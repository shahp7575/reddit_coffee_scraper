Feeling lost,"I started getting heart palpitations 5 years ago. It was a very stressful time in my life, I was going out a lot and drinking, vaping everyday etc, so I‚Äôm assuming that had something to do with how it started.

Flash forward to today. I do not vape, I am moderately stressed (pretty normal level), I have about 2-4 drinks a month if any, i drink very little coffee- I don‚Äôt even consume one cup a day, I eat healthy, take vitamins daily, and am an active person.

I am a 30 year old female. 

I have gone to a cardiologist a few times and have received a 7 day holter monitor as well as an echo. Echo came out normal, my holter monitor showed a good amount on PVC‚Äôs. I was told this was nothing to worry about. 

What I don‚Äôt understand is why I only have heart palpitations hours after exercise, while I‚Äôm laying in bed. I get the occasional palp when I‚Äôm excited or I drank coffee, which doesn‚Äôt bother me, but the post-workout laying in bed ones will NOT leave me alone. It is getting to the point where it is causing me to have depression and anxiety which is not a normal mental state for me.  Everything about my body feels so healthy but I just cannot kick these palpitations. 

Weird symptom that I get with my palpitations: muscle spasms!!! Typically on my legs but they are pretty spread out. These last days for me post-workout. Now I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm having an issue with electrolytes and that is what may be causing this? But if so, why am I having such a hard time keeping my electrolytes in line like a normal person can? My workouts include yoga, Pilates, and outdoor walking/hiking. Nothing I do is extremely strenuous to the point of dripping sweat or being exhausted. I take magnesium sulfate at bedtime. I do not take potassium or calcium unless it‚Äôs in an electrolyte water that I sometimes consume. 

Does anyone know where I can go from here? I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I can‚Äôt even enjoy my simple physical activities without having these awful thumps in my chest that take my breath away as I am trying to fall asleep. Is there a related disease/issue that I should look into about the electrolytes? I‚Äôm not sure why but I feel so strongly about them being related.

I have a cardiology follow up in a week and want to go in with a list of questions so that they don‚Äôt write me off like they normally do. Apologies for the long post I am just beginning to feel so hopeless. I miss being able to exercise free of stress. ",1,1737619483.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False

1i7yiew,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1i7yiew/how_i_wasnt_kidnapped/,How I wasn't kidnapped,"So I grew up sheltered. I had some friends from elementary and middle school but I wasn't allowed to go out much and neither did them, so my first ever real world experience came as soon as I started university.

One day one of my classes went together to a museum visit, afterwards we all could leave wherever we wanted as it was our last class for the day. Some of the people I chatted with made plans to go to a coffee shop, but I was peniless and tired so I said bye and started my walk to the bus stop. 

The path I had to take to the bus stop was on a not so good side of the city, most of the street was lined by abandoned houses, vacant stores, places that closed early. I was just walking down the street when I saw one of the houses had an outside light on; at the gate was this lady and a young man standing, very happy looking and nicely dressed. 

The lady made a hand gesture and came up to me, she told me she loved my earrings and how *punk* I looked. I was really shy and I just smiled and said thanks. That's when the man approached and asked me if I wanted to be a part of an *experiment* . 

I thought, ""I am alone and bored and got some time to kill, why not?"", and so I jumped and said ""yeah!"".

The man stayed outside the house, but the lady took me inside. The place was all white, no lights inside but still illuminated as it was midday and all the windows were open, no curtains in them, not even glass. The only furniture were these nice picnic tables with no mantles, each table had at least one or two people sitting in them eating something out of white boxes and filling some papers. 

She sat me at a vacant table, and gave me a plate of plain cookies and water. I didn't know what I had to do so I started eating one as soon as she left. When she came back, she was holding some white boxes and told me ""Oh no dear! The cookies are to clean your palate after you have these!"".
She put the boxes in front of me and some papers and a blue pen. She told me to open them and I found.... chips. Various chips. Different flavours as I could tell by the colors and smell.

She instructed me to eat the chips in order of how she put the boxes on the table and to answer the questions in the papers. It was somewhat like an exam, with questions asking if ""X chip tastes more or less like cheese than Y?"" and, ""Do you think Y and Z are more flavorful than X?"" 

I filled the questionnaire, ate chips and cleaned my palate by eating a plain cookie and drinking water. When I finished she took my paper and told me to wait. Soon she was back and told me I hadn't passed the exam, which left me a bit bummed, but she gave me many boxes of chips and then escorted me out.

Nobody believed me, not even after I arrived home with the boxes. Later I realized I could've been kidnapped. But I was fortunately not!

I had a shower this morning, I love them a lot. 

I had watermelon for breakfast and it‚Äôs one of the best things in the world. 

Work is buusssssyyyyyyyy. Yes I‚Äôve said that every day, what of it? 

I love drinks. I currently have on my desk in front of me a glass of water with ice, my glow drink, a cup of coffee and a diet coke. I just like having lots of lil drinks to choose from. I am admittedly terrible with finishing drinks though, the sheer number of half drunk cans of coke or sprite around the house is concerning and wasteful and my coffees always tend to get forgotten and cold. Mum and dad always comment on it, even when I start to take something to the kitchen they‚Äôll say DID YOU FINISH IT and I‚Äôll say LET ME LIVE. I mean exaggeration but I constantly get comments. Like the other day I had a hot chocolate as I was cold and reading on the sofa and I forgot about it half way through and dad comes over and says right I‚Äôm heating this up and you‚Äôre finishing it. I suppose I‚Äôm not good at finishing anything in life. 

He suggested that sort of subscription box idea to me again last night. He‚Äôs so clever? It‚Äôs such an interesting idea, beyond intimidating of an idea but a really intriguing idea nonetheless. I think it‚Äôs absolutely something to think about, at the very least. I wonder what I could do for it? I loved the perfume idea and the craft box ideas a lot, I could see the latter being something that could be successful if done right. I feel like parents want their kids off of screens but still entertained, no? Hm. And it would be so fun to curate?! I‚Äôm already day dreaming about what I‚Äôd pop in. And themes! Like Christmas in December and you could make ornaments and Christmas cards and gifts. In a spring or summer themed box you could do leaf and flower stamping or maybe a little gardening edition with little seeds and mini pots and they could paint and decorate their little pots before planting some seeds and taking care of growing them? And then there‚Äôs of course Easter, Halloween, Valentine‚Äôs Day etc. And then just the usual kinds of things too. How fun, no? I want one of those boxes. Anyway certainly something to think about. 

I had my GP appointment before. I‚Äôm staying on the same medication dose :) I don‚Äôt feel great but I never feel great and manageable is good so I‚Äôm continuing as is for another few weeks and then seeing her again. I also got some mega power antihistamines. Except she sent them to the chemist at my parents, so I need them to collect them for me. I have enough for quite awhile anyway. 

He called me :) I adore him so much. My sleepy baby. 

I worked a bit later, I finished around 6:30? Or a bit after? Idk around then. 

I have a four day weekend in a couple of weeks :) 

I have therapy tomorrow and I‚Äôm nervous as it‚Äôs been awhile. I hope it‚Äôs okay. I didn‚Äôt do all my summer bucket list things :( I did some though like reading, gardening, dog walks, spending time with Andy, going to the river, having a real fruit ice cream thingy, having watermelon and cherries etc. 

Okay I wanna read now. My honey is faaaast asleep, I hope he‚Äôs sleeping well. I had quite a good day today. I‚Äôm happy I did :) Night night ",1,1737618685.0,u_createdjustforthi-23,0,1.0,False

Since some new people are asking me about my pick selection process i decided to repost this since I can't reach out to everyone! 

Hey guys! First of all, I want to thank you all for the incredible support lately. The streak has been wild, and I sure hope it continues. I want to say that I did not expect my profile to explode like this, but I am happy it did (and for the good reasons).

Lately I received a lot of messages about how I make my picks. Its been difficult to answer each and every one, so I thought about making a post about how I do the selection and probably make things easier for everyone!

**1. How I bet?**

I mostly play Single bets. I have nothing against parlays, but if you expect to make consistent returns you either have to be insanely good, or insanely lucky. If I do parlay, I do not play more than 3 picks. Everyone has their own style and preference, but this is just how I do it and how I had the most success.

**2. What sports do I bet on?**

I mostly bet on basketball since it is the sport that I follow the most, and I know about it a bit more than the average person. I noticed that NBA gives me the most consistent returns, so lately it has been my main focus.

**3. How do I select my picks?**

I try to follow NBA (as much as I can since it is often hard to watch this season :D) and I pay attention to how players of interest perform against different defensive schemes and match-ups. I put a lot of attention to ANALYTICS. There are different websites for NBA analytics, but lately I've been using¬†[https://showstone.io](https://showstone.io/)¬†About which website you should chose, I leave it up to you, but I am having a good amount of success since I started using¬†[showstone.io](http://showstone.io/)¬†This website offers me a top picks page (¬†[https://showstone.io/TopPicks](https://showstone.io/TopPicks)¬†) that filters all the good opportunities for me to place my bets. After that, I go to the player dashboard (¬†[https://showstone.io/PlayerDashboard](https://showstone.io/PlayerDashboard)¬†) and there I begin my analysis.

**4. What to pay attention to when doing the analysis?**

I am sure that everyone does this in a different way, but my approach is - FIRST I look at the injury table. There I can see which players are missing or DTD and in the table i can see how them not playing impacts my selected player's minutes per game, and prop performance. The table quantifies the impact (for example +5 points) and tells you based on how many games that impact is calculated (EXAMPLE: With Doncic out, based on 10 games this season, Kyrie scores +5 points on average - numbers are random just for the sake of explaining it).

Then I look at the performance vs the Line and check how the player i selected performed vs the line. If I like what i see so far, I observe the Prop trends and check whether his trend is increasing or decreasing, how many minutes per game he is playing (last 15 vs last 5), and how much these L5 and L15 averages on the selected prop differ from the bookie line.

After that, I observe how the player performed vs the opponent. Showstone offers L5 against the opponent bar and I do think that this info is valuable, ESPECIALLY if they had a recent game. After that, I observe how the opposing team performs against that prop against the selected player's position (If i selected a guard, how many pts/reb/ast the opposing team allows vs guards). Showstone also provides this info (which is great) and ranks the opposing team on that metric (best/worst).

If the math adds up (so to speak), and my gut feeling agrees with it, I select the player and place my bet.

**5. How much should you bet on my Picks?**

I think this is a very individual thing and everyone needs to make their own conscious decision about it. I do not feel comfortable telling people how and what they should do with their money. We are all adults, and betting responsibly should be everyone's goal. I suggest that you make a betting budget (monthly/weekly) and accept that sometimes you will make and sometimes you will lose some money. This way, it is much easier to track your wins and loses, and (with some discipline) avoid heavy losses (I've been there before).

If you have any questions, I am always happy to answer (if time allows me to) and I hope that this post cleared up some things and can help you improve your performance. Also, I do not claim to be a betting expert, I do not claim that I will have 100% accuracy and make you a millionaire if you tail my bets. I like sports, I like analytics, and I like sports betting. I see it as an opportunity to cash in on my basketball knowledge and I basically look for opportunities where I disagree with the bookies' lines the most. Lately, I've been doing pretty good and I am happy and excited to see the amount of support I am getting. Only thing I can promise is that I will continue to post with great attention to detail and do my best to keep the streak going. Also, I will not post anything that I would not be comfortable putting my own money on.

Since my profile exploded in the last few days, I decided to open a buy me a coffee account to (possibly :D) increase my betting budget a bit. I am not forcing anyone to support but If you like what I do, feel free to show some love.

1i7y8aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i7y8aw/12_days_post_breakup_and_im_getting_more_and_more/,12 days post breakup and I'm getting more and more confused,"I just need to get this off my chest, sorry for the long post.

I've been in a relationship with a guy for a year who has avoidant attachment style (not sure though if it's DA or FA). I'm anxiously attached which I was aware of during our relationship. 
Even though I learned a lot about attachment styles in the last few years, I did not realize he was an avoidant until he broke up with me. 
I thought we had a great relationship, we spent a lot of time together, we went on dates, visited each other's family regulalry, knew each other's friends etc. He was very gentle, he often brought me flowers, made me coffee in the morning, we were cuddling a lot etc. He rarely gave me verbal affirmations but his actions showed me that he cares about me, so I was fine with this.
Then it turned out, out of nowhere, that he was planning to leave me for months. 
He never said a word to me about his doubts, every time I asked him if everything was okay or if he was happy with the amount of time we spend together, he always said he was fine and he was okay with the relationship, too. Then he says things to me like he never loved me and he is not attracted to me anymore and he was planning to break up for months?? Then after a few days, he said that he is afraid that he is making a mistake with breaking up with me? 
I think once he started to see my flaws, he decided that this relationship did not have a future, yet he did not say anything about these doubts.
My soul and my heart is completely crushed now, I understand nothing. He was always there for me, his actions showed me that he cares about this relationship and now it seems everything was a lie and he was never happy with me? I feel like he thought that this is how people should behave in a relationship and he forced himself to be a 'good boyfriend'? Maybe he was lying to himself, too? I wanted to make this work, so maybe the red flags were there, I just ignored them?
I'm not sure anymore, I feel so confused and betrayed now. I don't know how I can trust anyone again. ",2,1737617862.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

1i7y63s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i7y63s/to_date_or_not_to_date/,To date or not to date?,"On October, I went to a new university, testing my strength against another bachelor degree. I met a girl, like 7 years younger than me. 

It all started when I was helping my friend on an assignment right before class, then she approaches us and talks to that friend of mine. She knew my name from the very beginning which caught my eye. She was so full of life and energy I lacked my entire life, that I envied her tbh. 

So we start talking, right? About everyday stuff, work, hobbies, that kind of thing, and the conversation was so intense I felt electricity buzzing through my brain when talking to her. I never felt stuff like that. And in the meantime we started talking about group projects, which I was doing on my own, considering that I was older than the rest of the people and didn‚Äôt quite find my crew, so to speak. She replied, ‚Äúwell yeah you got it now‚Äù. She also jokingly wanted to go out with me help her find a Christmas gift for her family, and I told her I was like an expert in this stuff she wanted to buy. Buut I didn‚Äôt quite realized until later that it might not have been just a joke, but more of a suggestion. Nevermind. 

Before I dive in any further I want to let you guys know that after my past traumas in relationships I‚Äôm kind of in a new place which made me very defensive in catching feelings. I‚Äôve spent so much time trying to understand my behaviour and I‚Äôve come to realisation that I have quite the attachment issues towards potential love interests and get very clingy very early on.  I am also a very compassionate ambivert so seeing someone hurt so my instincts make me help someone in an instant.

So, let‚Äôs go back. Days go by, right? Our contact gets better. Very early on she started talking to me about her private life, like uncomfortably early. Her exes, family, her past, like I could write a biography after two days at university talking to her on breaks or boring classes. One day she texts me that she‚Äôs mad and being myself I asked what‚Äôs wrong. She sent me a voice message like 5 minutes long and in the end she bursts out crying. 

At this point after all that happened I knew that I would want to try something. Though I found myself in a corner. At the same time I knew that helping her would make me be more of a friend, rather than a potential partner. So I dodged the conversation by telling her that I can‚Äôt help her with that, as them issues are not ones for a messenger typing and stuff. Aaaand asked her out on a coffee so we could talk this out. She is an extreme kind of an overthinker. Outside she‚Äôs all happy and talking to everyone, but inside she‚Äôs one hell of an overthinking, vulnerable loner. So you guessed it, she was trying to find an excuse, I told her straight up - think about it, I can pick you up and drive you home if it‚Äôs too far from you. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it‚Äù. Yeah right, that was a bad call trying to ask her out on a coffee when she‚Äôs having a meltdown, I guess. 

Fast forward to now, she still seems to seek attention from me or I dunno, I inspire trust or something. She‚Äôs had a few meltdowns along the way but the previous days got to me yet again, but maybe it‚Äôs just me being weird. She started sending me TikTok‚Äôs with her and stuff, just out of the blue, I didn‚Äôt ask for them or nothing. She‚Äôs been asking me who looks younger from her friends and all. But what really got to me was when she had another meltdown and I upright asked her what‚Äôs wrong. I noticed that she has the same issues I had, which I have overcome by myself, ‚ÄúI feel you‚Äù I said. And she sent me a photo of her all puffed from crying. Knowing all her traumas this early I tried to help her after the first time, but it‚Äôs all the same with her, even though I gave her a very insightful point of view into her emotions and what she doesn‚Äôt see in herself or people. 

Let‚Äôs get to the point though. I still think I should try the second time to try to ask her out, maybe in better circumstances. Though I have my doubts. She‚Äôs clearly a damaged person and I tried fixing someone previously and it kicked me in the butt. I keep telling myself not to get attached and keep it cool but I can‚Äôt help it when someone texts you on a day to day basis. And I can‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôm falling into one hell of a trap. I am not fit to fix anyone anymore, at the same time, though, I don‚Äôt want to and want to help her, I see so much of myself in her, so much potential that it‚Äôs mind boggling. I don‚Äôt know if I should chase her or cut my losses so I won‚Äôt get hurt again. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should ask her out anytime soon, saying like, hey after exams I have a few days off work, wanna go out since you are so lonely? Or wait it off and wait for the new semester or I don‚Äôt know. (I dunno when, but not so long after exams she‚Äôs going on 2 weeks vacation so we‚Äôre gonna see each other in march). I‚Äôm just lost with myself, plain and simple.

I have watched the ownership change hands and I‚Äôve seen dozens of baristas come and go. We have nice small talk and I tip well. We go to this particular stand not just because of convenience but because, when done correctly, they have the best coffee in town for my taste. 

Once in a while the owner is in, and as a small business owner myself, we tend to chat and I‚Äôll generally let her know how her baristas are doing. There are a few that are just always spot on, but sometimes the noobs can be hit and miss on their coffee making skills. No, I don‚Äôt just go running and telling on them, just to be clear. I usually start by talking to the baristas myself. ‚ÄúYou made it too sweet‚Äù, ‚Äútoo much milk‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ and we try to work it out that way. Most tend to get the hang of it, but some just don‚Äôt. 

Coffee is my vice. It starts my day and dictates how much of an asshole I‚Äôm going to be. At something like $7.50 a cup, I feel like that shit should be right. We‚Äôre not here to discuss my financial choices, but when doing the math on it, we spend quite a bit at this little coffee stand in a year. 

So a couple months ago, the new hires started settling in and there was this one girl who just wasn‚Äôt getting it, and it was pretty obvious that none of the others at the coffee stand were very impressed with her or her personality. Me and the owner had a chat. She wasn‚Äôt very stoked about this girl from the sounds of it either, and within a few days of my review, she was let go. 

Since then one of the baristas, who started out hit and miss but worked it out and now serves a great cup of coffee, has been kind of passive aggressive toward me. She puts on her smile and we have our small talk, but before I leave she somewhat sarcastically fits it into the conversation that ‚Äúshe wouldn‚Äôt want to make it wrong or anything‚Äù. 

Well that happened this morning and I couldn‚Äôt  hold my tongue. ‚ÄòYes, I give your boss honest reviews of her employees. Did we not work it out? Then I don‚Äôt have to give her a shitty review of you. For what I pay for a soul warming cup of coffee, my happiness in life when everything else is already so expensive, the least that you can do is make it right. There are 5 other coffee stands in town but I choose this one, and shit coffee or not, I still tip well and you guys still passive aggressively complain about how long it takes you to make 3 coffees for one vehicle.‚Äô

Because there‚Äôs not much stuff going on between them (yet) but they‚Äôve dedicated two ending episode cliffhangers to their dynamic. One was Junseo telling Sian he liked her and the second was Sian picking Junseo for paradise.

I mean the editors clearly know the ending so I feel like they are doing this for a reason.

For the exact same reason I don‚Äôt think Sian and Theo are going anywhere because the editors barely show them interacting! And definitely don‚Äôt focus on it. So I feel like if they were endgame, we‚Äôd get way more of them. 

I don‚Äôt think Sian is as not into Junseo as people think though. She was curious about him so picked him for his coffee date but his actions/words during that date made her feel he wasn‚Äôt into her. So she friendzoned him. Then was shocked to find out he actually likes her. Then she had to rearrange her thoughts. It coincided with her initially strong feelings towards Jeongsu wavering coz of him being so wishy washy. Then she even did a feeling check in the last food date but I actually felt her body language towards Jeongsu was off. Like she was over it with him. 

So I think it‚Äôs down to between Junseo and Theo now! 

I feel like it could actually be cute if she and Junseo ended up together. Usually people have a type and don‚Äôt change because they‚Äôre attracted only to that type. Both she and Junseo are not each others type and didn‚Äôt choose each other initially and probably overlooked the other person. So it‚Äôs kinda cool to see them change their minds about each other and grow close. 

Anyway this is just my speculation only! I‚Äôm not a shipper of Sian with anybody. It‚Äôs just a 10 day reality show so let‚Äôs just live in the moment and have fun. ",7,1737616107.0,Singlesinferno2,11,0.89,False

When I was younger my dad and I would meet at a local coffee shop, and they sold these fantastic individually wrapped cookies.  There were several types, I think, but I really only remember my favorite, which I know contained Coconut, and may have contained Macademia.  These were not a local specific product, I don't believe: Factory sealed and wrapped, full nutrition info, etc.

They were somewhat pricy, and I believe they were gluten or wheat free.  The cookie itself was about six inches in diameter, and a very stark white (EDIT: Maybe closer to 4/5 inches, my hands are bigger now).  It was entirely covered in coconut flakes/shavings.  They almost tasted doughy, incredibly soft every time, as if they weren't even baked fully.  Very akin to a Coconute Snowball, I think. They may have been no-bake?  But I don't recall.

Ideally, Id love to find this brand if they're still around, but if not the name of the type of cookie would be great!  The closest I've found are Coconut Snowballs.  I am not including an image because it would be a white circle with little scribbles to show coconut shavings, and that's easy enough to imagine.",2,1737615235.0,TipOfMyFork,1,1.0,False

I decided to try it out on my 1ZPresso J-Ultra hand grinder to see if I would notice the difference.  Obviously, this isn't super-scientific, but I held the grinder at roughly a 60-75 degree angle until near the end of the grind each time to feed the beans more slowly.

The coffees tested:

* Glissade Chute Espresso blend (medium roast)
* Lavazza Espresso (not the Barista version, just Espresso, says medium but it's really dark roast)
* Noeo Colombian EA Decaf (medium roast)

Espresso machine: Cafelat Robot Barista

Firstly, the grind definitely needs to go down quite a bit.  I went down several clicks to get normal shot times.  For reference, tests on these three different coffees required finer grind by: 7, 15, and 15 clicks.  (I suspect the smaller number of clicks on Lavazza was from being older, darkly-roasted coffee.)  Shots were dosed with 20g for the caffeinated beans and 22g for the decaf and brewed to between 42-45g out.  I had Lavazza and Glissade shot times around 35-40 seconds, and the Noeo ended around 25 seconds.

Next up, shots seemed to have more crema than before.  Even the older Lavazza seemed to have more crema.  Mouthfeel overall was a little thicker.

And lastly, flavor.  Each of the three tested coffees showed more complexity and fruit flavors in the cup.  Even the Lavazza had something I couldn't quite place start to show up.  Maybe some dark grapes or raisins?  Previously, it was just a dark, roasty, smoky espresso.  Kinda bitter like dark cocoa.  Nothing special at all, and just an average shot of mass-produced coffee.  But that gave it some life that was quite pleasant.

But the most-surprising was my Colombian EA Decaf.  It went from being nutty with lots of graham cracker and a touch of raspberry to having some kind of full-on fruit that I couldn't quite place, particularly in the aroma.  But I'll call it tropical punch or something akin to Swedish fish fruitiness..?  Call it red or dark fruit.  I dunno, but it caught me way off-guard in a good way.  I'll likely go finer on the Noeo next time to see what happens.

If you haven't tried slow-feeding your beans, give it a try.  Your coffee might just surprise you!",3,1737615053.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

With the right Charleston SEO practices, businesses can increase their visibility, attract more foot traffic, and establish a strong online presence. This guide outlines proven strategies to help local businesses succeed in Charleston‚Äôs vibrant market.

**1. Optimize Your Google Business Profile**

Your Google Business Profile is the cornerstone of local SEO. It allows potential customers to find essential information about your business, such as your address, phone number, and operating hours. To optimize your profile:

* Ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date.
* Use high-quality images that showcase your products, services, or location.
* Respond promptly to customer reviews to build trust and engagement. An optimized profile helps your business stand out in local search results and on Google Maps.

**2. Focus on Local Keywords**

Keyword research is essential for any SEO strategy, but targeting local keywords ensures you‚Äôre connecting with your Charleston audience. Use tools to find location-specific terms that people search for, such as:

* ‚ÄúBest coffee shops in Charleston.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCharleston HVAC repair services.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúBoutiques near Charleston downtown.‚Äù Integrate these keywords naturally into your website content, blog posts, and metadata to improve your visibility in local search results.

**3. Create Locally Relevant Content**

Content marketing is a powerful way to engage your audience while improving your SEO rankings. For Charleston businesses, creating content tailored to local interests is key. Consider:

* Writing blogs about local events or attractions.
* Sharing stories about your involvement in Charleston‚Äôs community.
* Highlighting tips or guides specific to the area, such as ‚ÄúHow to Spend a Weekend in Charleston.‚Äù By producing valuable and locally focused content, you position your business as a trusted resource in the community.

**4. Optimize for Mobile Users**

A significant portion of local searches comes from mobile devices. Ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. To optimize for mobile users:

* Use responsive design so your site adjusts to all screen sizes.
* Keep navigation simple and intuitive.
* Ensure pages load quickly to reduce bounce rates. Mobile optimization not only enhances the user experience but also helps boost your rankings on search engines.

**5. Leverage Online Directories**

Listing your business in online directories improves your visibility and strengthens your local SEO efforts. Focus on reputable platforms such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and local Charleston directories. Make sure your NAP (name, address, and phone number) is consistent across all listings to avoid confusing search engines or potential customers.

**6. Encourage Customer Reviews**

Positive reviews play a significant role in local SEO rankings and customer trust. Encourage happy customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google and Yelp. To make this easier:

* Provide links to your review pages in follow-up emails or on receipts.
* Respond to reviews‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîprofessionally and promptly. A steady flow of reviews signals to search engines that your business is active and reputable.

**7. Build High-Quality Backlinks**

Backlinks from credible websites enhance your website‚Äôs authority and improve search engine rankings. For Charleston businesses, focus on acquiring links from local sources, such as:

* Charleston-based blogs or news outlets.
* Partnering with local organizations or events for mentions.
* Creating shareable content that naturally earns links. A robust backlink profile strengthens your website‚Äôs credibility and boosts its visibility.

**8. Utilize Social Media Platforms**

Social media and SEO go hand in hand. An active social media presence helps increase brand visibility and drives traffic to your website. Share engaging content tailored to your Charleston audience, such as:

* Updates about local events or promotions.
* Behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business.
* Customer success stories or testimonials. Consistent activity on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter helps you stay connected with your community.

**9. Track and Adjust Your Strategies**

SEO is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and adjustments. Use analytics tools to track your website‚Äôs performance, such as traffic, bounce rates, and conversion rates. Evaluate the effectiveness of your Charleston SEO strategies and tweak them to maximize results.

**Conclusion**

Charleston businesses can achieve incredible success by implementing these tailored SEO strategies. From optimizing Google Business Profiles and targeting local keywords to engaging with customers through content and social media, the possibilities are endless. By focusing on Charleston SEO, local businesses can build a stronger online presence, attract more customers, and thrive in today‚Äôs competitive market.",1,1737614734.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve never felt genuine love for someone like this and when I see his face when I hear his voice or his laugh, 

I fall even more in love with him. I can go on and on about him, and I might trust at this point the way his laugh is the way he talks about his favorite things he gets so excited over his games. 

His favorite movies is coffee. I just want to grab his face and kiss him. I can‚Äôt help but just fall deeper in love with him more and more. I genuinely see a future with him and I really want my future just to be with only him what I think about us. I find our love amazing I want to fight for our relationship and I know we‚Äôre OK we‚Äôre perfectly OK. 

His birthday is coming up soon in a few days actually and I want to be there for all his birthdays were five months into dating now is it weird to say I wanna marry him I‚Äôve never actually thought about marrying someone but I wanna marry him I don‚Äôt know what he thinks about this and some could say it‚Äôs still pretty early and that we haven‚Äôt reached the six month mark yet I love him so so much I‚Äôve never loved someone this hard and to me I feel a little bit scared because what if I scare him away the last thing I want to do is lose him because that‚Äôs unimaginable pain I cannot feel the thought of me losing him pains me and I already wanna cry just thinking about it. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose him and I know I won‚Äôt lose him.

I was a professional chef and worked many restaurants and knowing how a lot of them functioned definitely helped in times of need, but isnt always a guarantee. 

Pizza joints. Search up local pizza restaurants and try to catch them at the last 20 minutes before they close. Often times pizza spots have extra that they throw out at the end of the night. I'd look presentable and kindly ask managers if I could take home the pizza they throw out if any was left. 

Kitchens, especially ones that aren't corporate always need dishwashers. If you can clean up and walk in places between 2-4 pm, I've offered to wash dishes for a meal and that has worked a time or two. 

Dunkin Donuts and alot of donut shops throw boxes/bags of donuts away at the end of every shift too. You can check donut and coffee shop dumpsters and pick out clean, uncontaminated bags of pastries more often than not. 

Whole Foods (if you're lucky enough their dumpsters aren't pad locked) throws their expired canned goods away. They do this because it's required, just because a can of potted meat or whatever is expired doesn't mean it's going to kill you. 

You can file for emergency EBT if you have your documents, I never had mine because my Identification was stolen and this is why I mentioned to hangon to your documents for dear life. You just claim you're homeless and usually get the maximum amount of benefits priority. Create a PO box or use a shelter as a mailing address. 

Really hope this post helps out a little too for those who are new. Just keep your head up guys. It's traumatizing at first but once you figure out the ropes it does get better. And again you're never in a permanent situation. Stay locked in üôè",4,1737614322.0,homeless,1,1.0,False

So anyway my ‚Äòsex spreadsheet‚Äô from a previous sub on here, is now going to take even more of a battering. So, let‚Äôs recap (go grab a tea/coffee/whiskey). 

The Mrs started to become LL after kids, a long while back. Over the last few years it‚Äôs fair to say she‚Äôs lost interest in sex, though on occasions (once every 2-3 months) she‚Äôll partake in an unsatisfying 3 minutes (any longer she gets angry, I know that might be hard to believe but the sad fact is that it‚Äôs true). So our sex life is f**ked, excuse the irony.

She has been going through menopause over the last few months. Recently she offered a ‚Äòquicky‚Äô (side note, why is it always a f**king ‚Äòquicky‚Äô when we haven‚Äôt had sex in months? If we haven‚Äôt had sex in months why can‚Äôt it be a ‚Äòlongy‚Äô with multiple positions and a hot, passionate, make out? Anyway I digress‚Ä¶). Where was I? Oh yes that‚Äôs right - so the quicky offer, being a HL red blooded male, I had to swallow my pride (I.e. I‚Äôm fit, healthy, clean etc, my wife should want to have sex with me) and accept.

So (wrapping things up now cause I want to watch Squid Game), I entered her and she said it was too painful to continue.

So - she hates sex, and now probably hates it even more due to menopause issues. She will NOT be interested in HRT or any of the other things that some women do re menopause.

Just wondering on the way forward here? Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äòtalk to her‚Äô as I‚Äôve tried that for years and get nowhere. She views me as a bank and someone to help with the kids.",1,1737614107.0,DeadBedrooms,3,0.66,False

To put it briefly, my husband (45m) of 9 years (together for 15) texted me (35f) that he wanted a divorce and 6 days later moved out. He was very adamant about this, wouldn't agree to try to work on anything or go to marriage counseling or anything at all. It was out of the blue and i was devastated. I hit an emotional rock bottom and worked very hard to come to terms with it. He moved back in briefly, and I got hopeful we'd reconcile. He then moved out again after the holidays. I feel like I mentally and emotionally cut all ties to him in order to protect myself and start moving on after he moved out the second time. 

So I went on a date and slept with somebody. This was after confirming over and over and over that reconciliation was not an option. I even waited to tell my family until I was 100% certain. Well after I slept with somebody, suddenly my husband did a complete switch and now wants to get back together. He said he only said he wanted a divorce as a ""wake up call"" that things needed to change and he never thought I'd actually agree to it. He's texting 24/7 about how much he loves me and he can't see a future with anybody else and I'm the love of his life. 

He's not a bad guy. He's a great father (we have a 13 and 17 year old together). He's a great person, he'll do anything I ask of him. But he wasn't a great partner. He has never been one to take initiative in anything, I always had to tell him what to do and when to do it. My emotional and physical needs were never met. I wasn't unhappy, but I wasnt happy. I was surviving, not thriving.

Now that I've been on my own for a few months, I've become excited for my future and I've made plans and hung out with friends more and finally cleaned and organized my house and I started to do my hobbies again. I love the changes I've seen in myself, and I really feel this was a good move. But now he's flipped and he's being the husband I wish he would have been. He came over and cleaned my house when I was at work the other day. He brought me coffee and chocolate when I had a work emergency and needed him to bring me something from my house. He's fixing things I've been begging him to do for years. He wants to take me out in a date now. 

But why NOW? Why after I've started to move on, after I slept with somebody! If reconciliation was even a slight possibility, I would have never. And I feel so guilty for finally enjoying my life. He's trying so hard and he's begging for 1 more shot. But I don't want to give up this freedom I have, and that feels so selfish to me. I feel like getting back together would be sacrificing my happiness for his. He wants to have just one more chance where we each give 100% effort... But I don't feel anything towards him but sadness for him and the situation he's gotten himself into. He says this is the biggest mistake of his life, and it really was. I don't know if I CAN give 100%. ",3,1737613764.0,Separation,2,1.0,False

This guy has a girlfriend, but he seems to enjoy being friends with girls more than guys. Like he only hangs around with women and usually makes plans to hang out with women (with or without his girlfriend). However, I feel like whenever I hang out with him he actively does not hang out with his female friends and mostly brings out guy friends,

So I have a huge crush on one of his friends (female). Anyway, I told him that I liked this girl and immediately he tells me to drop the idea (because she only likes Korean guys). I was hoping he would try and gauge her interest in me.

So a while back I asked this girl out for a coffee but since our schedules didn't align I had to ask her out over text. Obviously big mistake and she was busy so she said no but maybe later. I took it in the chin and forgot about it thinking most likely she doesn't like me. (Don't worry I know I messed up asking her out over text, stupid idea, but it was a spur of the moment thing). The other day I overheard that she was asking about me and was wondering if I was trying to ask her out that time. I asked this guy again to gauge her interest in me. He was really dismissive and jokingy told me that she was really picky and to not go for it. There was no customary ""Hey bro, let me ask her discreetly to see if she has any interest"" or ""OH I have a plan, I'll see when she's busy and you can try...""

My question is, is he actively helping or cock blocking?

There was a situation before when I asked him for lunch, and he told me that he was busy. So I went alone to the cafeteria, and I saw him there with a bunch of girls (the girl I have a crush on was there). So I went up to him to say hello, and he was really weird, like dismissive and basically telling me (yeah,. we are gonna have lunch and you can have lunch with us if you want..)

In my head, if one of my guy friends told me that they were interested in my friend (female) I would actively try and help him/them get together or at least try and get him a date. No way would I tell him not to go for it. I would not try and dissuade him for any reason, even if there was a possibility that the girl would reject him, since I don't know anyone's preferences and it would be awesome if I could play matchmaker. Especially since this wouldn't affect my friend group since they hang around in separate circles.

My main question, is this guy trying to help me here to save me from being rejected or is he just being possessive of his female friends or he actually likes this girl and is hoping something will happen?

NOTE: I am not unpopular or weird (at least I don't think so). I am friends with a lot people that know here too. This guy and I are also very friendly and we make plans to hang out all the time, there is absolutely no reason to suspect that he doesn't like me in any way or that he doesn't want to be friends. Its just this one girl.

TLDR: Guy with a girlfriend, is not very helpful when I told him I liked his friend (girl); Is he trying to help me or cock block me?",2,1737613099.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
