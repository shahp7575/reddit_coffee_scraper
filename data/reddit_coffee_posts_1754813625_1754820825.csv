1mmetfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mmetfb/franklin_0_part_2/,- Franklin × 0 ÷ ∞ (Part 2),"Alright, I’m back! I’m the guy with the weird PC I dug up from the woods. Some exciting updates from my friend and I!

We finally managed to get into the blackbox, thanks to a PC workshop run by a kind old man named Mr. Koyukuk. Check him out, not sponsored. They gave us some general info on the materials from what they could gather. The glass and metal used were octuple layers of Panzerglass and Tungsten respectively, in fitting with my original hypothesis that this was some weird time capsule. I recognised both, one from my phone’s protective membrane, one from the trekking pole that started all this. This is probably why it took so long so crack it open in the first place.

We finally got into blackbox as well! There were two memory cards, one who's contents we haven't yet managed to transfer to a normal PC which Mr. Koyukuk suggested could hold the files used for this program the thing was running and one that we did manage to partially transfer to a normal PC which held an unfathomably long word log. 33 terabytes of just words. This thing practically zip bombed Mr. Koyukuk’s poor old PC, but through patience he managed to extract it all as a file that could be compressed and opened. Let’s just say it's really not what any of us were expecting. 

We'll try to keep working on it, Mr. Koyukuk agreed to halve his pay if it meant keeping the thing afterward and we agreed, at this rate I just wanna know the story of what happened here. Bellow’s a copy paste of all we managed to extract from the text file so far. As with last time I’ll update y’all as we manage to extract more of the files and will include as much on each update as I can. Until then.


“White. Snow.

Sticks. Trees.

Glass. Waterstained glass.

Something soft’s under my butt and on my spine. It’s a seat? Something elastic’s over my waist. Seatbelt. My elbow hurts slightly on something cold and hard, it's the window’s edge. I'm sitting in a bus, it feels weird to have given such a mundane situation this much though, as if all aspects of the world around me were appearing separately, waiting to be processed by my brain one by one. My name is Wyatt Brooks. Duh, I mean I’m not the sharpest but damn I feel slow today. That thought calls out to an infinite number of other thoughts relating to myself, all dripping down along a ghostly chain anchored in my brain. It feels like the world and I are slowly being constructed from a cloud of concepts. My every thought is echoed after I think it, but slower, as if they're being written down. I really need to sleep.

I look to the seat next to me. It's a guy. My brain starts placing his features. Teenager, dark hair, blue eyes. Franklin. All thoughts relating to Franklin snake their way to my brain again. One of them overpowers everything. I have the biggest crush on Franklin. My body grows warm, thawing from the stuttery stupor I was in just moments earlier. The feeling of my dry sweatshirt brushing up against the hair on my chest and stomach and my parka brushing up against my dry sweatshirt stings me.

My brain’s caught up with my tired body. The noise in this bus hits me, dozens of Bluetooth speakers duking it out, it's the noise of a field trip. I was lucky to grab these two seats for me and Franklin on the back. We'll be staying at this hotel for the first four days of Winter vacation and come back home a week before Christmas. I don't remember anything they told us about it other than it was optional and it was Franklin who asked me to go, I would never have the courage to ask him. Right now we're surprisingly good friends, we’ve been this way since Fall, both freshmen and all. We’d probably be a base or two farther down the line if my hormones would just behave, I regret. I hate the way I think of him sometimes, without clothes. I shouldn't think of him that way, not yet.

Bootclad footsteps click towards us, it's a friend. It's Abigail. Her dad's old honey colored leather jacket hugs her loosely, matching the color of her hair.

“Save a seat for me?”

She asks playfully. No. It took this much willpower to sign the waver that said I’d be sharing a room with Franklin, don't take this away from me, not now I think in the split second before I realize how polite it’d be.

“Sure.”

Franklin reassures her with a smile. His voice is like heroin. Bad thought, heroin is bad. I'm thinking too deeply about this, I like his voice and that's it. No, why do I like it?

“Wyatt?”

He acknowledged me.

“Yeah?”

I reply duly. I feel dumb. I should have said more.

“You good big guy? Sleep late”

Abigail’s jokey voice ruins the echo of Franklin’s acknowledgement of me. I’ve never hated her more. Bad thought, she's a good friend. Her smile drops a little after a bit of looking at my unflinchingly tired sleepless face. We had to wake up at 6 AM today to be picked up by the bus, now it's probably around 7:00, I calculate.

“Yeah Just tired.”

My voice sucks. It's deep but it's sickly. Not only now, always. Not like Franklin's. His is a rich rasp like black coffee. I want to feel it whispering on the back of my naked neck. Bad thought, stop it.

“You should probably go back to sleep.”

He nods at me. His smile shatters me. I want to cry, but I'm too tired.

“You're right. Night.”

I shift in my seat. I shut my eyes and head rests on the back of my hand as my elbow contorts painfully to sit on the edge of the window.

“Goodnight!”

He pats my shoulder. Stop. This is creepy, you're creepy, I'm creepy. My heart beats a violent tattoo of his name into my throat. What if they hear it? Stop.

“Damn, is he alright?”

I can hear Abigail whispering to him. “No”, I think to grumble from my nap. That would be funny, that would make him laugh. I love his laugh. Stop. Fuck. Stop.

“He’s always like that. Great guy, just needs to get like, 110% more shuteye?”

He whispers back and laughs. I want this fucking bus to swallow me whole. This corner is my rightful place, his voice torturing me while my eyes are forced to abstain from his face. When I hit puberty my dad warned me it would get melodramatic real quick, this is probably it. I slip back into this corner between asleep and awake, hopefully when I wake up we'll be there. A guilt springs within me. Guilt that my fear is keeping me from happiness, this ride is probably gonna be so fun for him and Astrid. Come on, sleep.

The frost on the window bites at the pinkish tip of my nose. My eyes creak open. It's definitely morning, my body feels slightly better so I must have slept. But the sky shows little signs of time’s marching. This weird echoing in my brain’s still there, fine I guess I'm mentally ill now. I shoot a look behind me. She's still there, she's chatting with him. I should join.

“Had a good nap sleepyhead?”

He acknowledged me again. His tone is too kind.

“I think. What’d you two do?”

I try to add a little more briar to my voice, I I think I did good. But I can't think great right now.

“Kinda just talking about the hotel. I looked it up, five whole stars. They got a sauna too.”

Abigail pricks at me. I try to steer the topic into cloudy weather, I need to get more comfortable around Franklin. Ever since I started feeling this way towards him it feels like our friendship’s grown too distant, if I want to take this further I should close that gap.

“What's the woods around the hotel look like? It's not in a town or city, right?”

I ask Abigail, careful not to give Wyatt too much attention.

“It’s pretty plain honestly, just snowfields and the occasional birch. And you're right it's more like a natural retreat, there's a town in like 16 minutes.”

This is an amount of talking I’m happy with for now.

“You guys wanna go check it out? It's not much from what Abigail showed me but you look like you could use the fresh air.”

Wyatt gestures to me. I process this far better than I would have four hours ago.

“Great idea.”

I give him the nicest smile I can. He smiles back, his eyes join his mouth. It's genuine. A towering hotel scrolls into the view outside my window as the bus takes a pivot and drives towards it.

“Alot bigger than in the photos.”

Abigail jumps. It's a strange building. There's no Christmas decorations. It's just a white wooden tower with a roof and windows. Like outsider art of a hotel’s growing pains as it turns into a sanitarium. The bus stops abruptly, the engine shutting down as the doors open and other kids rush to get out. I can still hear the noise of the engine from that same part of my brain where ally thoughts are echoing from. I need to see a doctor tomorrow.

“Dude?”

Franklin taps my shoulder. Was I thinking that long? He’s holding out my luggage to me. I grab it quickly in embarrassment and thank him. Almost too quickly I worry, he looks to have been knocked a little off balance. We march outside. Abigail's leather boots carve a safe path for me and Franklin’s weak little canvas sneakers. We’re quickly herded into the front door, cloaked in shadow under a stone terrace. The lobby is bathed in a blue and green glow dripping from the tinted windows, it's weirdly serene in place of the almost Foucaultist, sterile pale lighting most hotels opt for. The rocky paleo decor digs up a joke about what Björk’s bathroom probably looks like and I burst out laughing in it's memory despite my best try at suppressing it. Apparently it's infectious.

“What's so funny?”

Franklin looks up at me curiously, a shaky laugh under his voice. I forgot how much taller I am than him. I wanna ruffle his black hair so much. Oh stop, you were doing great.

“I’ll tell you later.”

I shut my laughter up with one last chortle. I’ve been told I have a bony laugh. I let that insecurity flow away, it's not annoying to Franklin and Abigail. That's all that matters. Quickly we’re given our keys and sent up to our rooms with our keys, my basketball coach letting us all know when to gather for lunch. The corridor walls are cosily dark, a black that hugs you in how tight it makes a space look. The carpet on our shoes is snow white, the manager must have some absolutely unholy beef with the cleaning ladies. The door to our room greets us as we ascend the strairs.

“Call me when you're done, loseeers…”

Abigail breaks us up and gestures a phone call, disappearing behind a corner.

“...Sorry!”

She bumps into a girl coming the other way. Franklin gives a faint laugh, then pulls his key from the pocket and twists the lock open. I like the way his hands move. Our room is alot tinier than I thought, I didn't really look into it. The walls are that same comfortable black as the halls, painted on squared stone, thought the effect is somewhat ruined by the whole eastern wall being a window. Two beds. Bittersweet.

“You wanna unpack later? I don't feel like staying in my room all morning.”

Yeah.”

“You don't like it?”

My attempt at banter comes out a bit too sincere.

“Oh no, it's nice and all. I just wanna go see the tundra is all.”

He cranes his neck wistfully to the window. I feel weirdly okay with how close we are right now. He always put his one foot above his knee when he sits. Oh, right.

“You should switch shoes, mine are still soaked from the snow. Do you have boots with you?”

I ask, trying to sound thoughtful. If I really love him should it not have come to me to say that naturally? I don't have time to figure out what came to me naturally, his mouth’s opening to talk.

“Aw, no. I guess I didn't think we’d go out at all.”

My brain racks itself. I can't just not go on a romantic walk in the tundra with him.

“You can borrow mine.”

When I first got those boots on my birthday we immediately went for coffee afterwards and I forgot them at our table. When I rushed back to get them one of the baristas was jokingly asking who the sasquatch was who forgot his new kicks. I don't know what Franklin's shoe size is but it's probably smaller than US 14.

“Sorry I forgot, they may be too big for you.”

I try to cushion my folly before it lands.

“Well it's better than nothing.”

I try to not look as rushed as I am while looking for the boots. I toss out technical books and freshly washed clothes and packs of cigarettes until I finally reach the bottom of my backpack, pulling out a platic Kwik Trip bag with the two boots caught in it and throwing it to Franklin.

“Thanks!”

His smile reaches his pretty blue eyes.

“I should go freshen up. I'll be in the bathroom.”

I get up quickly, almost spilling the contents of my backpack to the ground.

“I won't be long.”

I rush into the bathroom and shut the door behind me with more force than I meant to. Fuck. This probably looks so bad. I don't have time for that though.

The bathroom, ironically, is the part of the hotel that reminds me the least of that joke about Bjork's bathroom. The tall square mirror at the heart of it reflects me. I can't go out like this. My bony face looks crushed, my brown bed hair’s only gotten worse from my nap in the bus, my Oakleys for my cataracts are sliding off my nose from all the cold sweat. In the silence, I realize the the roar of the engine still echoes in the back of my brain. Fuck. I frantically take off my clothes, they smell like my nicotine addiction. I need a shower. Cold water? Cold water is best right now, yeah. I need all the energy I can get. I climb in and turn the dial to the coldest it can go. The freezing water prickles my skin, drowning out the engine’s echo. My every pore screaming I am alive, I want to be alive. This is all just social stress, hang in there Wyatt. One day, you’ll look back at this stay and smile. You’ll think, this is weekend I finally told the love of my life.

“FUCK!”

I wail. The engine’s echo ignites into a violent revving. A pixelated voice laughs in my brain. I instinctively cover my ears, slipping in the shower and hitting my ribs on the porcelain floor. The stream of cold water from above anchors me. The pixelated voice dissolves into an unfathomably loud crying. It's so crunched it sounds like a snuff film involving a chainsaw blasting out of a thousand out of sync Ataris.

“TURN OFF COMMUNICATION.”

The crying shifts sharply into a clear but deafening utterance of those three words. Both echoes cut off with an abruptness that leaves my brain hurting infinitely more than both did. I burst into tears from the pain.

“Wyatt?!”

I muster the strength in my throat to yell at him before he opens the door.

“DON'T COME IN! PLEASE!”

I can't let him see me like this. I sit like this for minutes, letting the water wash the pain from my body. After all the shampoo dissolves from my hair, I try my best to get up. Surprisingly, I can. I grab the towel from the sink and pat myself dry, then wrap it around my head and trying to scramble my scalp awake like hitting a hamster in a sock against a wall. What the fuck was that? I have no time for doctors right now, but I need one and soon. I let out the heaviest sigh I've ever let out and wrap the towel around my waist. Yeah, this’ll make me look confident. I exit the bathroom. Franklin looks at me, his eyes drowned in worry.

“I slipped, it's nothing.”

I laugh it off. My ribs flare with pain.

“You sure dude? You look hurt.”

I look down at my chest where a blue bruise is spreading like a texture loading in. It's not nothing. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker in the cold we’re about to head into.

“Yeah. Let me just get dressed.”

I’d be worried about the pain showing in my voice if the cigarettes hadn't already made it sound like that. I grab the warmest clothes I can find and rush back into the bathroom, this time taking care to not close the door like it owes me money. I'm gaining my humor back, that's good.

I slip on a black sweater and a pair of gray jeans. The water droplets on my torso soak into the fabric as they coat me.  Now for the hard part, putting on socks with wet feet. Don't rip. Don't rip. Don't rip. Alright, good. I don't have the time to tie my shoelaces, I tuck them in the sides of my sneakers. I violently stuff my arms into my parka like an alien parasite and rush out the bathroom. He's sitting on his bed, taking out clothes from his bag. He looks at me, there's still a little concern in his eyes.

“Ready?”

He grabs his CD Walkman and a pair of headphones. A CD case of that weird British band’s album with the square face on the cover is lying on his bed.

I’m moving soon to Brussels (I used to live in Berlin), and back there I created a women-only WhatsApp group to organise activities… and it worked amazingly well! So I thought: why not do the same here?

The idea:
Create a women-only WhatsApp group (for everyone’s comfort and safety, there will be a quick verification before adding new members).
It would be a warm, open-minded space to meet, chat, and most importantly, organise activities together such as:
	•	Hikes
	•	Restaurants & brunches
	•	Coffee & board games
	•	Cultural visits
	•	Picnics in the park
	•	Clothes swap & sale
	•	Creative workshops

Age range: 20 to 40
Spirit: diversity, open-mindedness, good vibes, and the wish to make new friends.

The more we are, the more fun and varied the activities will be!

If you’re interested, comment here or send me a private message and I’ll send you the details to join the group.",1,1754820289.0,brussels,3,0.67,False

Wondering if opposites can really make it work.

\---

A close friend recently suggested I meet someone. She’s 27, I’m 29. From the way my friend described her, we seemed like complete opposites. She’s very social, loves big gatherings, parties, and is always planning her next trip. I’m more introverted, love quiet weekends, tech, astronomy, and long conversations over coffee.

Without even meeting her, I politely said no. My logic was that our lifestyles were too different and it would eventually cause issues.

But now I’m wondering maybe I was too quick to decide? I’ve heard stories where opposites balance each other out perfectly.

1mmelev,https://www.reddit.com/r/mealprep/comments/1mmelev/i_call_it_my_turtleneck_diet_same_thing_every_day/,"I call it my Turtleneck Diet - Same thing every day, nutritionally complete, basically no prep","For those that don’t get the Turtleneck reference Steve Jobs wore a black turtleneck jumper and jeans every single day. This is basically that applied to a diet but making sure that it is nutritionally complete and super simple at the same time.

So this won’t be for everyone but there are a lot of people like me where getting into a groove with eating the same thing every day is easier than having a lot of variety. 

So there is a lot of variety intra day to get all the nutrition you need but essentially none over different days (of course you can vary it to suit your needs if you want). I also hate cooking so I have made mine essentially zero prep.

Basically you come up with a daily eating plan that you eat every day (I relax it for social occasions etc), that is nutritionally complete. I don’t like cooking so mine is essentially zero prep based around, salmon, beans and legumes and a couple of frozen mixed veggies combos and porridge.

You engineer the plan you are eating to be nutritionally complete even though you are eating the same thing every day. Just tell Chat GPT or another AI “You are a professional science based nutritionist. Help me plan a diet that is nutritionally complete that I will eat every single day, I am male/female, x years old” Nail down your food choices and adjust so the nutrition covers everything you need. Cross check it with some other LLMs (Grok/Claude/Gemini) to verify and fine tune.

For calories if I was trying to lose weight I would base it on my Apple Watch Average move calories. So BMR (energy burned if you lay in be all day) + Apple Watch Move Calories - 500. If you don’t have an Apple Watch just use an online calculator and ballpark it

To hit all this my turtleneck diet is based around a 12 item Soup mix (Red Split Lentils, Yellow Split Peas, Green Split Peas, Pearl Barley, Whole Green Lentils, Chick Peas, White Beans, Black Eye Beans (Black Eye Peas), Black Beans, Haricot Beans, Red Kidney Beans and Borlotti Beans.) which give a ton of variety super easy. A couple of different frozen veggie mixes that total about 10 veggies. Some tinned Salmon, a bit of cheese, eggs, seed, and oats and milk.

Here’s what I do for example but you can do whatever you want you just have to make sure it’s nutritionally something where you’ll get everything you need and the calories are right for your goals (Lose weight, maintain, bulk).

**Diet - I eat this every day**

**Morning**

Coffee - I have two morning coffees about 250ml milk all up. I generally don't eat breakfast but you could if you wanted.

**Lunch**

Mix these four together early afternoon when hungry

Canned pink salmon (Wild caugh alaskan with bones) 200g tin drained

99% fat-free mayo 20g

12-Blend Soup Mix (drained) 75g when dry

Roasted red pepper (jarred) 60g

Multivitimin

Vitimin D

**Grazing afternoon snacks**

Fresh carrot (raw)

2 Boiled eggs

Babybel cheese 20g

Sunflower seeds 5g

Pepita seeds 5g

**Evening**

Steamed Frozen Veg mixes - 6 minutes in the microwave - I just season with Soy sauce or Herbamere seasoning. It's actually super tasty and that's coming from someone that wouldn't eat a lot of vegetables without a plan like this.

• Frozen mixed veg (peas, carrot, cauliflower, broccoli stems — no corn) 125g

• Grilled Mediterranean veg (eggplant, zucchini, red & yellow capsicum, onion) 125g

• Frozen corn 100g

• Frozen Spinach 50

**A few hours later**

Oats and milk (150g Oats 500ml lite milk) - I love porridge

Frozen Berries 100g

Magnesium multivitamin 

I could skip the multivitamin with a few tweaks but I prefer a bigger serve of porridge so I keep them (mostly for vitamin e and I take magnesium for restless legs occasionally).

If my activity level is lower than normal I can adjust the quantity of porridge at the end of the day to match or add more if big activity day. 

Do a few days of this and you palette will adjust and you’ll have no trouble walking past the icecream, pizza or chocolate.

**Benefits:**

\* Maximally healthy and calorie controlled

\* Figure out foods once then never again

\* Count calories/macros/nutrition ONCE, then just repeat

\* Decision fatigue: Zero

\* Prep/cooking time: As close to zero as possible. Portion>microwave>eat

\* Grocery shopping: Minimal as same list every time

\* Way cheaper than meal prep services or ""healthy"" takeout and nutritionally complete

\* No food waste (frozen/canned/shelf-stable)

\* Cravings disappear after a few days when your palate adjusts and it’s easy to maintain indefinitely

\*Great if you hate cooking

	1.	Good local coffee spot (preferably east side). I love a cozy cafe where I can become a regular and chat with friendly staff. Not a big fan of the big chains like Starbs/Dunkin.
	2.	Movie theaters with self-serve butter dispensers (don’t judge me… I’m an extra extra butter kind of girl).
	3.	Best YMCA in town? My old city had YMCAs that were 24/7 — if that exists here, that’d be amazing.
	4.	Boba! I’ve been making the trek from east side all the way to Middleton for Candy Cloud. I know they just opened downtown, but honestly that’s not much easier.
	5.	Any female walking clubs? Or just female clubs in general? (Mid 20s, WFH, desperately trying to make friends here!)
	6.	Restaurant recs in general — I’m a foodie and already found my fav sushi (Niji) and Mexican (El Torito). Always looking for more.

1mmejef,https://i.redd.it/uumw14gjz5if1.jpeg,The last train from Durg,"Six years ago, the light rains and cool breeze in Durg felt like heaven.
Even before I got there, she, my fiancée at the time, spoke with a child’s excitement about three places she wanted me to see: Cad M Cad B, the Coffee House, and the Pleasure Club.

Her family took me to the Coffee House first.
The dosa arrived already cut into small pieces, as if even the food there was meant to be shared in gentle, thoughtful bites.
The next evening I took her to the Pleasure Club for our first dinner date. The green lawns whispered in the quiet, and even though her brother tagged along as ‘kebab me haddi’, his presence could not dim the way she made the world fall still. I tasted stroganoff for the first time because she said I would like it, and she was right.

The weekend ended too soon. Cad M Cad B remained a promise we never kept.

Months passed, and life swallowed our days.
When COVID locked the world indoors, I never returned to Durg with her. Misunderstandings grew, family voices grew louder, and our own egos stood unmoving, like two sentinels guarding the gap between us.

Then came the courtroom. Two pens. Two signatures. Two hearts still wet with tears, each waiting for the other to take one step back from the edge. The love still lingered, but neither of us wanted to express it. 

As we stood in front of the judge, I almost asked her, one last time, to come with me to Cad M Cad B. “Let’s argue one last time, hurt each other one last time, and let’s try to kiss and makeup like we always did”. But silence won, and the decree was granted.

Her family smiled at what they gained as part of the one time settlement. She silently wiped a tear when no one was watching.
I walked out empty-handed, boarded a battery rickshaw to the railway station, to board a train to never return to Durg again. 

And through the blur of motion I saw Cad M Cad B flash past, vanishing behind me like everything else I had loved.

Life moves on, they say.
But somewhere in Durg, beneath the gentle rain, my heart still waits at a table for two.",3,1754819574.0,DurgBhilai,0,1.0,False

Is this just Dubai work culture or something else? I wanna hear all the tea — good, bad, and ugly. Let’s make this a space to share experiences, vent, and maybe even swap tips on how to navigate it all.

Summary of the Interview Content at the MINI

GT Meetup

Some news from the event site: (Due to the large number of people on site and Glen's fast speaking speed, the summarized content is for reference only) Thank you to Speed Soluble Coffee Meow for the live updates A

1. More Le Mans models (older ones) will be released, around the 1940s-1950s.

2. The Mazda 787B from 1991, Glen is very interested in and eager to make. He also has confidence that his 787B should be the most accurate restoration among all brands because MINI GT has a lot of data. There is also a large-scale support.

3. Mitsubishi brand planning is in progress, but there is not much interest in making it.

4. When filming the F1 movie, Glen's team was on site at IMSA. Due to the complex authorization of the F1 movie, they need to go back to the US for research.

5. Glen feels that the brand quality control has not declined. The current quality control meets the standards of the MINI GT brand. However, it is impossible to control the quality control too finely.

6. For scalpers, MINI GT official cannot control them either. After all, they have not broken the law. It's just that their way of making money may be controversial.

7. MINI GT wanted to release a Lamborghini transporter before, but Lamborghini did not agree.

8. Every time MINI GT produces, they will produce more models based on orders.

9. Regarding the Pink Dinosaur incident, MINI GT is currently conducting an internal review.

10. One of the reviews is that during the pre-order stage, too little information was released, and the pictures were not clear enough, causing people to hesitate to pre-order. For these issues, there may be more information sheets and pictures later.

11. The M4 GT3 displayed at the FIST X MINI GT event will be released in October. This No. 91 is not the EVO version. Also, the small Easter egg in Figure 1, did anyone notice? Yes, it's sponsored by Car Club.

12. The EVO version of the M4 GT3 has already completed sample trial production and was not brought to this event. It is painted in purple.

13. The 1974 Martini 911 RSR Turbo is being made.

14. The Spa 24 Hours and N ü rburgring 24 Hours cars will not be released in the short term because there are too many cars to release and they can't keep up.

15. The Porsche 959 is under development and has encountered some bottlenecks.

16. The Lamborghini LP670-4 SV will be released. At the same time, more millennium cars will be released

I recently disovered the joys of containers: being able to run all kinds of apps outside of the App Center. I wanted to be the only one to be able to access these apps remotely, in a safe and secure way, and I wanted to this without needing to remember IP addresses and ports. 

&nbsp;  

I am very happy with the result and wanted to share my knowledge with you in this guide.

&nbsp;

> Writing a guide takes a lot of time and effort; tips are appreciated.  
> You can tip me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/yavuz_selim) or [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/yavuz_selim). 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

# Requirements

To run containers, your NAS needs to support Container Station. If your NAS supports it, you can download Container Station from the App Center.  
Furthermore, the containers you're installing need to be compatible with your CPU architecture (the CPU in my NAS has the `x86-64` architecture).  

&nbsp;

I am running all of this on my QNAP TS-877, with 40 GB RAM, running the curently latest firmware version (QTS 5.2.5.3145).  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/bCGjVek.png)   
&nbsp;  
My Container Station version is v3.0.9.1038.    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/V8h3dI7.png)   

&nbsp;

This guide focuses on custom domains via Cloudflare. Many guides were using Cloudflare, so I also went with it.  
If you don't have a domain on Cloudflare yet, you will need to purchase one to follow this guide. Don't spend money if you're not sure what you're doing.     
If you do have a custom domain but not on Cloudflare, you will need to research on how to do the steps with your domain name registrar.

&nbsp; 

## CGNAT

If your ISP put you behind a CGNAT, there is a chance that you'll have a hard time getting things to work. I don't have any experience with it, just relaying what I've read/came across. If you're behind a CGNAT, you might want to research before paying any money for a domain.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;  

# Summary

In this guide, I will cover the following:

- Creating a new user, and getting its 'UID' and 'GID'.
- Installing `Container Station` to be able to install/use Docker containers.
- Installing `Portainer` to manage the containers.
- Installing a random container in Portainer - `Uptime Kuma`, a fancy monitoring tool, to test Nginx Proxy Manager.
- Installing `Tailscale` (VPN).
- Installing `Nginx Proxy Manager` (NPM) and setting up the Cloudflare DNS records (and other settings), creating SSL certificates and adding proxy hosts in NPM.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;  

# 1 New user

To prevent that the containers have access to everything on your NAS, a new user without root/administrator privileges needs to be created. This new user has no access to the existing shared folders by default, so you will need to give it permissions to the relevant shared folders.  

&nbsp; 

The user that I will be creating and using in this guide is `dockeruser`.  

&nbsp;  

## 1.1 Create the user

- Open `Control Panel`, and select `Users` (in the 'Privilege' category).  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/mwLuQfW.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Select `Create` &rarr; `Create a User`.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6e01hky.png)   
&nbsp;  
- In the `Create a User` window, enter the username and password (twice). Leave everything as they are.  
The username I chose is **dockeruser** - this is the username that I will be using in the rest of this guide.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/37AREh8.png)  

&nbsp;  

## 1.2 Shared folder and permissions

Your containers need a place to store their relevant data (like configuration files). So you'll need to create a shared folder for it.  
I've named mine `Containers`.

- Open `Control Panel`, and select `Shared Folders` (in the 'Privilege' category).       
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ODg9fds.png)   
&nbsp;  
- In `Shared Folders`, click on the `Create` button, and select `Shared Folder`.  
The `Create a Shared Folder` window opens.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/G2prAfa.png)    
&nbsp;  
- Give the folder a name, I have chosen `Containers`.   
&nbsp;  
If you multiple 'Disk Volumes', make sure to select the correct one.  
&nbsp;  
Click `Next`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uj0aWXD.png)   
&nbsp;  
- In this second step, give the user that you have just created `RW` (read/write) permissions.  
In my case, `dockeruser` gets 'RW' permissions.  
Click `Next`.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/kPdee3s.png)  
&nbsp;  
- In the third and last step, 'Properties', I leave everything to their default values, and click on `Finish`.    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jifxpdp.png)  
&nbsp;  
The Shared Folder has been created.  
The folder path for this shared folder is: `/share/Containers` - **you will need this later**.

&nbsp;  

## 1.3 Get the UID and GID of the user

To give your containers the correct permissions, you need to know the `UID` (User ID) and its `GID` (Group ID).   
For this step, you will need to log into your NAS via SSH. 

&nbsp;  

### Side info:   
By default, you can only login with users that are in the `administrators` group. So when using SSH, log in with the administrator user that you're normally use. This means that user `dockeruser` that was created in a previous step cannot be used.  
&nbsp;  
SSH is case-sensitive, so when logging in, make sure your username is entered correctly. You can't login otherwise.  
You can see the users list via `Control Panel` &rarr; `Users` (in the 'Privilege' category).         
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/KdEZRZH.png)     

&nbsp;

If you're using an **old Windows version**, the `ssh` command below might not work in 'Command Prompt'. In that case, you can use `PuTTY` to login to your NAS using SSH.   
PuTTY's website: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html.     
I would recommend `Alternative binary files -> putty.exe`, so you can use PuTTY immediately without installing it first.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tRCtQcT.png)     


&nbsp;  

- First, enable SSH. (Important: at the end of this part, make sure to disable it again.)  
&nbsp;  
- Open `Control Panel`, and select `Telnet / SSH` (in the 'Network & File Services category).  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/rSwg5f0.png)     
&nbsp;  
- Enable `Allow SSH connection (Only administrators can login remotely)`.   
Default port number is `22`. I am using port `55`.   
Click on `Apply` to save the changes.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4Naz8CM.png)     
&nbsp;  
- You can now connect to your NAS via SSH. 
On Windows, you can use `Command Prompt` (search for it via the Start Menu).  
On Linux and macOS, you can use `Terminal`.    
&nbsp;  
- In `Command Prompt`/`Terminal`, enter the following command to connect:  
`ssh {username@ip.add.re.ss} -p {portnumber}`  
&nbsp;  
In my case, my username is `Yavuz`, the local IP address of my NAS is `192.168.2.103`, and my SSH port number is `55`.  
So, I enter the following:  
`ssh Yavuz@192.168.2.103 -p 55`   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jt7opax.png)    
&nbsp;  
- You'll get a question about 'key fingerprint'. Type in `yes` to continue.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Oy8vV3c.png)     
&nbsp; 
Your password will be asked, enter your password.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/I3GYH4d.png)   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Hj4VP2W.png)   
&nbsp;  
- Once you're in, type in the following command to get the UID and GID of `dockeruser`:  
`id dockeruser`  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LfFLnLG.png)   
&nbsp;  
In my case, the UID is `1001`, and GID is `100`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VwjKZdi.png)   
&nbsp;  
Make sure to note down the UID/GID, you need it later.  
&nbsp;  
- **Disable SSH.** `Control Panel` &rarr; `Telnet / SSH` &rarr; uncheck `Allow SSH connection (Only administrators can login remotely)`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ig2haEk.png)   

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

# 2 Container Station

- Open `App Center`, search for `Container Station` and install it.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uyBYgso.png)   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6jYp13X.png)   
&nbsp;  
- When `Container Station` is installed, open it.  
The app will ask where to store its data. By default it will suggest `/Container`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SbPXYvJ.png)  
&nbsp;  
Select the shared folder created earlier (in '1.2 Shared folder and permissions').  
My shared folder was `Containers` (plural, with an `s`), so I select `/Containers`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LQq0ZGo.png)  
&nbsp;  
Click `Start` to continue.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

# 3 Portainer

Portainer is a tool that makes managing containers a whole lot easier; it's way nicer (and more feature-rich) than Container Station to manage your containers.  
Installation instructions on the official website: https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux. 

&nbsp;  

## 3.1 Install Portainer 

The YAML code of Portainer (read the steps below on how to use it):  

    services:
      portainer:
        container_name: portainer
        image: portainer/portainer-ce:lts
        ports:
         #- ""8000:8000""   # Optional for 'Portainer Edge Agent'; more info here: https://docs.portainer.io/advanced/edge-agent.
          - ""9443:9443""   # Port for accessing the Portainer interface in a webbrowser.
        volumes:
          - ""/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock""
          - ""/share/Containers/portainer:/data""
        restart: always

&nbsp;  

- Open Container Station, select `Application` in the menu left.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/MHAHqPh.png)   
&nbsp;  
- In the Applications page, click on the `+ Create` button in the top right corner.   
The `Create Application` window opens.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/1SUcNAR.png)  
&nbsp;  
- In `Application name` field, enter `portainer`, and copy paste the YAML code above into the Web editor text box.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VhftQYz.png)  
&nbsp;  
Click on `Create`  to install Portainer.   
When the installation is finished, you'll see that the `portainer` application is running:  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QxLH11W.png)   
&nbsp;  
- Portainer will be accessible on port `9443` of the IP address of your NAS.   
My IP address is `192.168.2.103`, so for me, the URL to open Portainer is:  
`https://192.168.2.103:9443` (https!)  
&nbsp;  
You're opening an `https` address, so the browser expects an SSL certificate; a warning message will be shown.  
You'll get two options, one to 'go back' and not visit the page, and one to show the 'advanced' option and opt to cotinue.   
↳ [Screenshot - Windows & Firefox - 1](https://i.imgur.com/SSFFA9Y.png)  
↳ [Screenshot - Windows & Firefox - 2](https://i.imgur.com/GKg43xd.png)

↳ [Screenshot - Windows & Edge - 1](https://i.imgur.com/lRdnnHF.png)  
↳ [Screenshot - Windows & Edge - 2](https://i.imgur.com/kQVN2wj.png)  
&nbsp;  
Select the 'advanced' option, an continue to `Portainer`.  
- Before you can use Portainer, you need to create the Portainer administrator user.   
Enter your username and password, and create the account.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ImlUnfR.png)  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/kVPLcYd.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Log in to Portainer.   
The 'Quick Setup' will be shown.   
Select `Get Started`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gts0Byu.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Portainer will the 'Home' page, with one environment: `local`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/5gMlXWG.png)  
&nbsp;  
You will need to select this `local` environment first to manage the containers on your NAS. 
&nbsp;  
- When you select `local`, the `Dashboard` will be shown, and from there you can manage your containers.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ckYhEIG.png)

## 3.2 Creating a new network.

Next is creating a new 'network' in Portainer. From the guides I followed, this was recommended, as it minimizes issues with the default network named 'bridge'; so less headache. The name I gave to this network is `containers_external`. I put all my containers on this network; this also allows them to talk with each other. **If you're using a different name, make sure to change `containers_external` to your own network when you copy/paste code from this guide.  

&nbsp;  

- In Portainer, select the `local` environment first if not done yet, and then select `Networks` in the menu left.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/d0QoC7E.png)  
&nbsp;  
- In the right top corner, click on the `+ Add network` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/85POxml.png)  
&nbsp;  
- In the `Create network` page, give your network a name. I used `containers_external`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gZO0qC3.png)  
&nbsp;    
You can leave the rest as is, and click on the `Create the network` button at the bottom of the page.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/a5APOKp.png)  
&nbsp;  
- The new network is created, and can now be used by the containers.

# 4 Uptime Kuma

I will be using 'Uptime Kuma', a fancy monitoring tool, to test if the redirecting in Nginx Proxy Manager using a subdomain works as intended. Ip opted to tuse 'Uptime Kuma' because it's a small container, and straight forward without too many parameters.  
Once its successfully tested, you can just delete the container.   

&nbsp; 

GitHub repo of Uptime Kuma: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma.

&nbsp; 

The YAML code of Uptime Kuma (read the steps below on how to use it):  

    services:
      uptime-kuma:
        image: louislam/uptime-kuma:1
        container_name: uptime-kuma
        volumes:
          - /share/Containers/uptime-kuma:/app/data   # app data is stored into the 'Containers' shared folder.
        ports:
          - 3001:3001   # Default port is 3001; if you want to change this, for example to '7777', you can do so by changing this to `7777:3001`.
        restart: always
        networks:                 # 'networks' added by me, definition below.
          - containers_external  

    networks:                 # Added by me, using the previously created `containers_external` network.
      containers_external:    # Name of the existing network
        external: true        # Telling Docker that the network already exists, no need to create it.

&nbsp;  


- On the GitHub repo, the Docker command to install Uptime Kuma is shown:   
`docker run -d --restart=always -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1`   
&nbsp;  
This can be rewritten as a YAML code above, which you can in turn copy/paste into Portainer as a 'stack'.  
&nbsp; 
- In Portainer, select the `local` environment first if not done yet, and then select `Stacks` in the menu left.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DhPYB8H.png)  
&nbsp;    
- In the 'Stacks' page, click on the `+ Add stack` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/EDxDpj7.png)  
&nbsp;    
- In the 'Create stack' page, give the container a name (`uptime-kuma`) and copy paste the YAML code above into the Web editor text box.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Bc9evNR.png)  
&nbsp;    
- Scroll down, and click on `Deploy the stack` to install Uptime Kuma. Wait until deployment is finished.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uG7cu7p.png)   
&nbsp;    
- When Uptime Kuma is installed, the 'Stacks list' page will open and `uptime-kuma` will appear in the list. Click on `uptime-kuma` in the list to see its details.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/A30TKgA.png)  
&nbsp;   
- The details page will show the containers that in the `uptime-kuma` stack. You'll see that there is one container, `uptime-kuma`, running available on port `3001`.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VQCIEIz.png)   
&nbsp;  
You can access Uptime Kuma on port `3001` of the IP address of your NAS.   
My IP address is `192.168.2.103`, so for me, the URL to open Uptime Kuma is:  
`http://192.168.2.103:3001` (http!)    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/X1VLBX7.png)   
&nbsp;
- If all went well, you should see the setup page of Uptime Kuma, meaning the container is up and running.  
All we need for now is Uptime Kuma up and running to test it with Nginx Proxy Manager, Uptime Kuma does not need to be configured.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

# 5 Tailscale

Tailscale is an application that allows you to create a Virtual Private Network, allowing you log in to your home network remotely in a safe and secure way. 
It's very user-friendly and easy to set up. And free for personal use.    
&nbsp;  
We will be using Tailscale to connect to your containers remotely.   

&nbsp;  

Instructions below will install Tailscale via the App Center, as this makes updating easier.  
If you want, you can also manually install Tailscale; this also means manually installing updates. More info here: https://tailscale.com/kb/1273/qnap.

&nbsp;  

## 5.1 Install on QNAP

- Install Tailscale via App Center.    
Open the `Communications` section, locate the `Tailscale` application, and select `+ Install`. (You can also use the search function and search for `Tailscale`.)  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ecJsoAp.png)  
&nbsp;
- After the app is installed, open Tailscale (it will open in the browser).  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UpFB8vj.png)   
&nbsp;
- The first time, you will need to login. Click on the `Log In` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Cyv0HwC.png)  
&nbsp;  
You can't create a Tailscale account, you'll need to use an 'identity provider'.   
Log in with your Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or Apple account.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GWx6DO5.png)  
&nbsp;
- After logging in, Tailscale tells you that you're about to connect your NAS to the Tailscale network.  
Click on the `Connect` button..  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/A9AjDdY.png)  
&nbsp;  
- After these steps, the NAS is added to your Tailscale network.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ymGXuyY.png)  
&nbsp;  
- After a few seconds, you will be redirected to the Tailscale admin console.  
The admin console shows all the devices in your Tailscale network, and is the place where you can manage the devices (rename, remove et cetera).   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RV85Vm9.png)  

&nbsp;  

# 5.1.1 Tailscale IP address of your NAS

You can find the Tailscale IP address of your NAS in the Tailscale admin console, but also via the `Tailscale` app on your NAS.    

&nbsp;

When you open `Tailscale` app on your NAS, the Tailscale page is opened in a new tab. This page the Tailscale IP address of your NAS. Whenever you want to reach your server, you can use this IP address (make sure Tailscale is also running on the device that you're using to remotely connect).  

&nbsp;  

The IP address of my NAS is `100.83.89.2`. Your contains are also available on this IP address.    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RjdQCcK.png)  

&nbsp;  

Uptime Kuma is running on port `3001`, so I can access Uptime Kuma via this URL:   
`http://100.83.89.2:3001` (http!)    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uoJZMOb.png)  


&nbsp;  

## 5.2 Install on your other devices

Tailscale needs to be installed on each device (computer/tablet/phone) that you want to use to access your the devices in your Tailscale network (NAS).  
So, to access your NAS on your phone, the Tailscale app needs to be installed on the phone. Same for desktop/laptop/tablet etc.

&nbsp;  

- Go to the Tailscale download page to download the Tailscale app for your device: https://tailscale.com/download.  
Download and install the app on your computer/tablet/phone. Open Tailscale, and log in to add the device to your Tailscale network.  
&nbsp;    
- After these steps, both your device are in the Tailscale network. This means that you can now access the containers on your NAS via your device (computer/tablet/phone) via the Tailscale network.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RG70p6U.png)

# 6 Nginx Proxy Manager and Cloudflare 

## 6.1 Installing Nginx Proxy Manager 
  
Nginx Proxy Manager is like a traffic director; it sits in front of your containers and directs web traffic to the appropriate container based on subdomain/domain.   
So, if you have 5 containers on your server, you can browse to each one of them by their subdomain. `cont1.mydomain.com` goes to container 1, `cont2.mydomain.com` goes to the second container, et cetera...     
It also handles SSL certificates, securing your webtraffic with HTTPS.  

&nbsp;  

Installation instructions on the official website: https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/#quick-setup.  

&nbsp;  

The YAML code of Nginx Proxy Manager (read the steps below on how to use it):  

    services:
      nginx-proxy-manager:
        image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
        container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
        volumes:
          - /share/Containers/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data                    # app data is stored into the 'Containers' shared folder.
          - /share/Containers/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt  # Let's Encrypt / SSL certificates are stored into the 'Containers' shared folder.
        ports:
          - 80:80     # Open this port on your router; recommend keeping this at '80'.
          - 81:81     # Admin panel
          - 443:443   # Open this port on your router;  recommend keeping this at '443'.
        restart: unless-stopped
        networks:                 # 'networks' added by me, definition below.
          - containers_external  
    
    networks:                 # Added by me, using the previously created `containers_external` network.
      containers_external:    # Name of the existing network
        external: true        # Telling Docker that the network already exists, no need to create it.

&nbsp;  

- Install Nginx Proxy Manager in Portainer, using the stacks functionality.   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/nKK3PiW.png)   
&nbsp;  
- After Nginx Proxy Manager is installed, you can access the admin panel via port `81`.    
My IP address is `192.168.2.103`, so for me, the URL to open Nginx Proxy Manager is:  
`http://192.168.2.103:81` (http!)  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ycktakn.png)  
&nbsp;
-  Login with the default Admin user:  
  - Email address: admin@example.com
  - Password: changeme  
&nbsp;  
Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password. 

&nbsp;  

After creating your account, you're done with Nginx Proxy Manager for now. We'll get back to later to configure it.    
Save the URL of Nginx Proxy Manager in a text file to find it back quickly.   

&nbsp;  

### 6.1.1 Open ports on router

Nginx Proxy Manager will forward the requests coming from the outside (the internet) to the configured locations inside (your local network). To be able get the requests from the internet, two ports of Nginx Proxy Manager need to be opened on your router. Opening ports will make the communication between outside and inside possible. 

&nbsp;  

There are many many different routers, so I won't be covering how to open a port on your router here. For that, I forward you to the internet; I am sure there are many guides for your router.

&nbsp;  

In any case, open the following ports on your router: 

  - port `80` 
  - port `443`

These are the ports used in the Nginx Proxy Manager container above (see `6.1`).  
If you have changed these ports (which I don't recommend), use those ports instead.

&nbsp;  

## 6.2 Cloudflare

&nbsp;  

### 6.2.1 Domain

Register a domain name, if you don't have one yet. With a domain name, you no longer need to remember IP addresses and ports; you can browse to your own domain name (example.com), or you can create subdomains for each container (like kuma.example.com for Kuma Uptime, radarr.example.com for Radarr, and sonarr.example.com for Sonarr).

&nbsp; 

I have used Cloudflare ([cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)), simply because it was used in many guides.

&nbsp;

You can register your domain here: https://domains.cloudflare.com/.

In the rest of the guide, I will assume your domain name is ""example.com"".  
(My domain is `vermiselli.com`, so I'll be using that in the screenshots.)

&nbsp; 

### 6.2.2 DNS

The next step is to adjust your domain's DNS settings on Cloudflare. This will allow that when your domain or sub domain is entered in a browser, you will be redirected to your NAS where your containers are hosted.

&nbsp;

#### Side info:  
DNS settings of a domain can be checked by others. So if you're pointing to your public IP address, others can find your IP address by checking the DNS settings of your domain. To prevent this, enable the proxy setting in the DNS settings page - but do this after creating the SSL certificates in step `6.3.1`.

&nbsp;
 
- Log in to your Cloudflare account (https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).  
&nbsp;  
- On the 'Account Home' page, you'll see your domain name. Select your domain name.    
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LrPVrWB.png)  
&nbsp;  
- The 'Overview' page of the domain is shown. On the left sidebar, click on `DNS`.     
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/pSLeroR.png)  
&nbsp;  

- The 'DNS Records' page is opened. I don't have any DNS records.
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/KCo4hSc.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Add one, or two `A` records, depending on your needs (I add domain `public`, and sub domain `private`):    
  - Redirecting from your domain (example.com) - `public`. Visible to everyone.
     - Click on the blue `+ Add record` button.
     - Type: `A`
     - Name: `@`
     - IPv4 address: Your public IP address. You can see yours on [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).  
     - Proxy status: `off` (**Turn this on after getting the SSL certificate in Nginx Proxy Manager in `6.3.1`**)
     - TTL: `auto`  
     ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oAQiNNu.png)  
     &nbsp;  
  - Redirecting from your domain (example.com) - `private`. Only visible to you (using Tailscale).  
     - Click on the blue `+ Add record` button.
     - Type: `A`
     - Name: `@`
     - IPv4 address: Tailscale IP address of your NAS (see `5.1.1`).
     - Proxy status: `off`
     - TTL: `auto`  
     ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ibnKJOw.png)  
     &nbsp;  
  - Redirecting from your sub domain (subdomain.example.com) - `private`. Only visible to you (using Tailscale).    
     - Click on the blue `+ Add record` button.
     - Type: `A`
     - Name: `*`
     - IPv4 address: Tailscale IP address of your NAS (see `5.1.1`).
     - Proxy status: `off`
     - TTL: `auto`  
     ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NjA7BQ8.png)  

&nbsp;  
- Save the `A` record.  
↳ [Screenshot - domain public and sub domain private](https://i.imgur.com/DF74xUY.png)    
↳ [Screenshot - both domain and sub domain private](https://i.imgur.com/55OabFq.png)    


&nbsp; 

### 6.2.3 Always use HTTPS

- On Cloudflare, open the `Edge Certificates` page, via the left side bar &rarr; `SSL/TLS` &rarr; `Edge Certificates`.
&nbsp;  
- Scroll down until you see `Always Use HTTPS`.  
Enable the `Always Use HTTPS` setting.
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UMSi3Gz.png)  

&nbsp;  

### 6.2.4 Get your API token

You will need to create SSL certificates in a later step. For this, you need your an API token from Cloudflare.  

- Go to the 'API tokens' page: [https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).  
(You can also find this page using the search bar at the top.)  
&nbsp;  
- Click on the `Create token` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DLVZAVn.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Click on `Use template` next to 'Edit zone DNS'.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/royJJUp.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Edit the token name by clicking on the edit button.  
I've named mine 'nginx-proxy-manager'.
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/lCB88e2.png)  
&nbsp;    
- Leave the 'Permissions' sections as is.
&nbsp;  
- In the 'Zone Resources' section, change the value in the third dropdown from `Select...` to 'your domain name'.
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/TJb8oFn.png)  
&nbsp;  
- `Client IP Address Filtering` and `TTL` sections can be left as is.     
Click on `Continue to summary`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/MWUmq7h.png)  
&nbsp;  
- You'll see a summary. Click on `Create Token`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/CyGK4Wg.png)  
&nbsp;  
- The token is created, your API token will be shown.  
**The token will not be shown again, so copy the token and save it in a text file.**   
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GI2ysjv.png)  
&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  

## 6.3 Configure Nginx Proxy Manager 
  
You can now create the SSL certificates in Nginx Proxy Manager using the API token, and add proxy hosts.

&nbsp;  

### 6.3.1 SSL certificates

- Open Nginx Proxy Manager (use the URL from `6.1`), and log in .
&nbsp;  
- In the `Dashboard`, select `SSL Certificates` in the top menu.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ITFHfv1.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Click on the `Add SSL Certificate` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/5dSnQwR.png)  
&nbsp;  
- In `Domain Names`, you'll need to enter 2 domain names.    
One for your root domain name (example.com).  
And one for all your subdomains. This can be done with a wildcare (`*.example.com`).  
  - Type in the root domain name (example.com), and click on `Add 'example.com'`.
  - Type in `*.` followed by your domain name (for example: `*.example.com`); and click on `Add '*.example.com'`.   
  ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/bzJak4o.png)  
&nbsp;  
- No need to text the server reachability, skip that. 
&nbsp;  
- Enter your email address for Let's Encrypt.  
&nbsp;  
- Enable `Use a DNS challange`.  
  - Select `Cloudflare` as 'DNS Provider'.  
  - In 'Credentials File Content', replace the token with your own token that you've created earlier.   
  So, replace `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567` with your own token.  
  ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LL2EUJv.png)  
  &nbsp;  
  - You can leave 'Propagation Seconds' as is.
&nbsp;  
- Enable `I agree to the Let's Encrypt Terms of Service`.  
&nbsp;  
- Click on `Save`, and wait a few seconds to get your SSL certificate created.  
  ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/9WIOrfD.png)  
  ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/eNYH9hw.png)    
&nbsp;  
- After the SSL certificate is created, it appears in the `SSL Certificates` page. The status is 'inactive', because the SSL certificate is not used yet. We'll be using it in the next step; its status will change to 'active'.
  ↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ErMzzHO.png)  

&nbsp;  

If you added a DNS record in `6.2.2` pointing to your public IP address, you can now enable the `proxy status`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/BrzYxmJ.png)  

&nbsp;  

### 6.3.2 Proxy Hosts

You can now create a 'proxy host' for each container that you want to redirect using your domain. You can either use the root domain (example.com), or use a subdomain (kuma.example.com, docs.example.com, test.example.com et cetera). 

&nbsp;  

- Still in Nginx Proxy Manager, in the top menu, click on `Hosts` &rarr; `Proxy Hosts`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Psl7JH8.png)   
&nbsp;  
- Click on the `Add Proxy Host` button.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/YWdPL75.png)  
&nbsp;  
- The 'New Proxy Host' window pops-up, with the 'Details' tab open.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/yhqUGuR.png)  
&nbsp; 
- In `Domain Names`, enter the domain name or subdomain name.  
I will be creating one for Uptime Kuma, as mentioned earlier (in `4`).  
`kuma.example.com`  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oeGe9cg.png)  
&nbsp;  
- `Scheme`, `Forward Hostname / IP` and `Forward Port` need to be entered.  
You can use the URL of the container to get this information.  
On my end, Uptime Kuma's URL is: `http://192.168.2.103:3001`  
  - `Scheme` is the first part: http.
  - `Forward Hostname / IP` is the IP address; in my case: `192.168.2.103`.
  - `Port`is the last part, after the colon; in my case `3001`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/9OuaFQq.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Enable `Block Common Exploits`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VQ2kfGQ.png)  
&nbsp;  
- You can leave `Websocket Support` off almost all the time, but some application will need it. If that's the case, enable this option.  
For Uptime Kuma, it needs to be enabled ([see here](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy)), so I am enabling `Websocket Support`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/bY3GJNz.png)  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- Click on the `SSL` tab (third) to open it.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/WeM75uo.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Select the SSL certificate created earlier.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/qmiuiqQ.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Enable `Force SSL` and `HTTP/2 Support`.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/j0cEk31.png)  
&nbsp;  
- Click on `Save`.  

&nbsp;  

You should now be able to visit your container by visiting the domain/subdomain name you've used.  
In my case, when I open `kuma.example.com`, I see my Uptime Kuma container - this time without a warning, thanks to the SSL certificate.  
↳ [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/aCo6qon.png)  

&nbsp;  

You can keep adding new subdomains, and keep using the same SSL certificate.

&nbsp;  

If a new proxy does not work, check if the `Scheme`, `Forward Hostname / IP` and `Forward Port` are entered correctly. Another reason might be that the container is not in the same network as Nginx Proxy Manager in Portainer. 

&nbsp;  

You can now create a 'proxy host' for each container that you want to redirect using your domain. You can either use the root domain (example.com), or use a subdomain (kuma.example.com, docs.example.com, test.example.com et cetera). 

&nbsp;

## 6.4 Optional: Nginx   

I wanted to visit my domain name (`vermiselli.com`) and have an overview of all my containers - with links to them so I can open them easily. For this, I am using `Nginx` - not 'Nginx Proxy Manager', just `Nginx`.   

&nbsp;  

`Nginx` is a web server, so it fits my needs: I want to serve an HTML web page.  

&nbsp;  

### Side info:  
I want to serve my own HTML web pages, so I need to replace existing files (the default web page) in the container. **I am using the `UID` and `GID` of `dockeruser`, so when I need to make changes to the files, I need to login with that user onto the QNAP.** Deleting/replacing files with my administorator account will not be possible ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/658p30R.png)).  

&nbsp;  

Nginx's YAML code (using linuxserver.io image):  

    services:
      nginx:
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nginx:latest

The hopelessness that has ravaged hearts, triggered anxieties and subtly condemned some to accepting defeat and damnation. Upon further reflection, I realised one thing a majority haven't lost; Our vision.  Our vision is still sharper like the swords of Gondor despite all these crisis. Kenyans still believe with the surest of clarity that they can make it here. We want to make it here. We will make it here. Talking to some of my friends, and none of them wants to chase life abroad. Maybe a holiday here and there but they want to succeed in this country. Take long drives to visit folks in the countryside, hustle under the scorching heat of the coast and the lakeside, find love and cuddle in the cold Nairobi July, Party in the ever bustling city night life, grow old and be laid to rest with their people.

 My dear readers, that's why it's important that we become vigilant and not allow politicians to play tricks on us and kill the love we always express to each other on a day to day basis. Let's not be duped into division again based on our tribes, religions and even gender. We must never acquiesce in the struggle for revolution, maintain a solid united front against the political boogyman who has again and again discarded our interests for their own gain. Together we can conquer and send them home, revolutionise our institutions appoint visionary leaders with proven public service record and integrity. That's how we achieve the Kenya dream.

# Best New Mom Gift Basket 2025: Ideas They'll Love

The arrival of a new baby is a joyous occasion, but it's also a challenging time for new mothers. Show your support and celebrate this special milestone with a thoughtfully curated new mom gift basket. These baskets aren't just filled with cute baby items; they're designed to pamper and support the new mom during her postpartum recovery and early motherhood journey. A well-chosen gift basket can provide much-needed comfort, convenience, and a little bit of self-care during this demanding period.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best new mom gift baskets in 2025 prioritize practicality, self-care, and items that ease the transition into motherhood. These baskets go beyond the typical baby clothes and stuffed animals, offering a range of products designed to benefit both mom and baby.

**Postpartum Recovery Essentials:** This is a crucial feature to consider. Look for baskets that include items like perineal spray, soothing pads, nipple cream, and comfortable high-waisted underwear.

This is because the postpartum period involves physical recovery, and these items provide relief and promote healing. High-waisted underwear, for example, offers gentle support for the abdominal muscles.

**Nursing and Feeding Support:** For breastfeeding moms, a basket with nursing pads, a nursing cover, lactation cookies, and a water bottle is invaluable. For formula-feeding moms, consider including bottles, formula samples, and a bottle brush.

These items make feeding time easier and more comfortable. Nursing pads prevent leaks and protect clothing, while lactation cookies can help boost milk supply. A good water bottle encourages hydration, which is essential for milk production and overall health.

**Self-Care and Relaxation Items:** New moms often neglect their own needs, so a gift basket that encourages self-care is a thoughtful gesture. Look for items like bath bombs, aromatherapy diffusers, face masks, herbal teas, and a cozy robe.

These items provide a much-needed opportunity for relaxation and rejuvenation. Even a few minutes of self-care can make a big difference in a new mom's mood and energy levels. A cozy robe provides comfort during late-night feedings and early morning cuddles.

**Practical Baby Items:** While the focus is on mom, including a few practical baby items is always appreciated. Consider items like swaddle blankets, burp cloths, baby wipes, a soft baby brush, and a diaper rash cream.

These items are essential for daily baby care. Swaddle blankets provide comfort and security, burp cloths protect clothing from spit-up, and diaper rash cream prevents and treats diaper rash. A soft baby brush is gentle on the baby's delicate scalp.

**Snacks and Nourishment:** New moms need plenty of energy, so a basket filled with healthy and convenient snacks is a great idea. Consider including granola bars, trail mix, dried fruit, nuts, and a selection of teas or coffees.

These snacks provide quick and easy nourishment throughout the day. They are especially helpful during late-night feedings when a full meal isn't practical. Healthy options support energy levels and overall well-being.

**Personalized Touches:** Adding a personal touch to the gift basket makes it even more special. Consider including a handwritten card, a personalized baby blanket, or a custom-made item with the baby's name.

These personalized touches show that you put extra thought and effort into the gift. They create a lasting memory and make the new mom feel truly appreciated. A handwritten card offers words of encouragement and support.

 ## Core Benefits

A well-curated new mom gift basket offers a multitude of benefits, providing both practical assistance and emotional support during a challenging and transformative time.

**Improved Postpartum Recovery:** The inclusion of postpartum recovery essentials directly supports the new mom's physical healing. Items like perineal spray and soothing pads provide relief from discomfort and promote faster recovery, allowing her to focus on bonding with her baby. This translates to increased comfort and reduced stress during the crucial postpartum period.

**Enhanced Convenience and Time Savings:** Gift baskets that include nursing or feeding support items, along with healthy snacks, streamline daily routines. This eliminates the need for constant trips to the store for essential supplies, freeing up valuable time and energy. This means new moms can spend more quality time with their babies and less time worrying about errands.

**Promoted Self-Care and Well-being:** The inclusion of self-care items like bath bombs and aromatherapy diffusers encourages new moms to prioritize their own well-being. This helps combat postpartum stress and anxiety, leading to improved mood and overall mental health. This means new moms can recharge and rejuvenate, allowing them to better care for themselves and their babies.

**Emotional Support and Encouragement:** A thoughtfully curated gift basket sends a message of care and support, reminding the new mom that she is not alone in her journey. This can boost her confidence and provide a sense of reassurance during a time of significant change. This means new moms feel valued and appreciated, fostering a positive and supportive environment.

**Simplified Gifting Process:** For gift-givers, a pre-made or customizable gift basket simplifies the process of finding the perfect present. It eliminates the need to individually source and wrap multiple items, saving time and effort. This means gift-givers can provide a meaningful and practical gift without the stress and hassle of traditional shopping.

 ## FAQs Section

**What should I include in a new mom gift basket if I'm on a budget?**
  You can still create a thoughtful and useful gift basket on a budget by focusing on essential items. Consider including practical items like diapers, wipes, burp cloths, and a few small self-care items like lip balm or a small hand lotion. A handwritten card with words of encouragement is also a valuable addition.

**Is it appropriate to include items for the baby in a new mom gift basket?**

**What are some good options for dads in a new parent gift basket?**
  For dads, consider including items like a comfortable baby carrier, a book on fatherhood, a gift certificate for a massage, or some snacks and drinks. The goal is to provide items that help him bond with the baby and also take care of himself during this demanding time.

**How can I personalize a new mom gift basket to make it more special?**

I have been medicated a long time. In that time I have traveled alone and gone places on my own with 0 problem. I could go to a coffee shop and hang out on my own no problem. I could even go on a plane trip no problem. 





But suddenly in the last year or so, I’ve lost that ability. I don’t work, so I really just stay home and take care of my house and my dog. My wife suggested I get out of the house more often been forcing myself to go to a coffee shop once a week on my own. I’m flying to see one of my best friends and I’m nervous af. I honestly feel myself fixing to cry at times. I can go anywhere with my wife but the minute it’s just me, I panic. 



Why is this so sudden? Does anyone else get this way?",1,1754818392.0,bipolar2,2,1.0,False

I’m currently on the lookout for a rug for the sofa and coffee table, a large round mirror for the chimney and we would love a log burner for the fire place. We still need a chair for the bay window and envision it with a little side table and lamp.

I’d appreciate any constructive feedback.",12,1754818381.0,HomeDecorating,3,1.0,False
1mme80s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DubaiJobs/comments/1mme80s/why_do_they_hype_you_up_in_dubai_then_ghost_you/,Why do they hype you up in Dubai then ghost you? Real talk on the hiring grind.,"Hey everyone, just wanna share something that happened to me as a newcomer here in **Dubai**.

I had this promising chat with a hiring manager soon after arriving. I talked up my **6**\+ years experience back home (felt a bit like flexing just to get noticed). The manager said, “You'll be managing **coffees** and **tea** if this same roles has been in other firms & you can learn more from us than this,” which honestly felt kinda humiliating compared to the roles I had before.

The same day, after having multiple rounds of interviews, aptitude tests, and financial exams, they even shared a contact number and started talking relocation like it was a done deal. But then, out of nowhere, they put things *on hold* next day.

It left me wondering — why do they hype you up, get you ready to jump, then pull back? Feels like a weird trap for many newcomers here.

I’ve heard from other friends who came here that sometimes you get treated like second-class or stuck with “small roles,” even if you got solid experience. Anyone else faced this? How do you deal with the back-and-forth and feeling sidelined? Would love to hear your stories or advice from others new to Dubai’s work scene.

### Additional notes:

* The team names use local cultural symbols, fauna, geography, or history to build plausible identities.
* Stadium names evoke local flavor or iconic landmarks.
* Colors are chosen to distinguish tiers visually and also hint at city colors or symbols.
* You can freely swap teams among tiers if narrative needs require (e.g., making an underdog or wild card).
* Let me know if you want me to prepare **team backstories, star players, derby rivalries**, or **season arcs** next.

---  

* **Tier 1 (qualify for top tier):** metro population **≈ ≥ 1,000,000**
* **Tier 2:** metro population **≈ ≥ 500,000**
* **Tier 3:** metro population **≈ ≥ 250,000**

I pulled candidate cities from standard metro-area lists across the Americas (North, Central, South, Caribbean). If you want exact metro population figures for any city (or need them tied to a specific year), I can verify each and attach sources. For now these are suggested candidates chosen to give good geographic coverage and story potential. ([Wikipedia][1])

## Notes, worldbuilding & next steps

* I intentionally left a few slots as **pick/choice** (e.g., Mar del Plata vs Bahía Blanca, Orlando vs Jacksonville) so you can pick what fits your story geography and rivalries.
* Some cities (especially Venezuelan or Caribbean metros) have volatile population data — I can pull **verified metro population numbers (year + source)** for every candidate if you want rigorous population thresholds enforced. ([Wikipedia][2])
* If you want balanced continental representation, we can enforce a minimum number per macro-region (e.g., ≥6 North America, ≥6 Central/Caribbean, ≥6 South America).
* I can now:
  • produce a **map** plotting these 54 cities; or
  • convert this into a **seeded league list** (assign clubs, colors, crest concepts, nicknames, stadium names); or
  • verify exact metro populations and produce a strict “meets-threshold / fails-threshold” table with citations.

1mme6yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1mme6yr/question_for_the_pros/,Question for the pros,"I lost my high from coffee, piracetam, modafinil. Simply cant feel them at all. My theory is downregulated dopamine receptors thus the insensitivity to such substances. I was thinking what could I take to bring back my libido, motivation and general drive/dominance. I have high levels of testosterone, so its not like this is the problem. 

My thought process for libido restoration is one of the following
1. Agmatine (most stories here, but why die soy work and will it not dampen me even more?) 
2. Bromantane (direct dopamine increase due to unknown mechanism) 
3. Dopamine antagonist (before bed to upregulate the receptors and cause increase in sensitivity) 

I want to restore my reaction to drugs and get out of this emotion blunted, motivation depleted, libido erased state in which I am. Any idea or advice will be appreciated.

These sweatpants, characterized by their elongated inseam designed to gather or ""stack"" around the ankles, offer a unique aesthetic that sets them apart from traditional athletic wear. As consumers prioritize both comfort and fashion in their everyday attire, stack sweatpants have emerged as a versatile and sought-after garment.These pants cater to a diverse audience, from fashion-conscious individuals looking to make a statement to those simply seeking a agreeable and relaxed fit for lounging or light activities. The increasing popularity of stack sweatpants reflects a broader trend towards athleisure wear, where functional clothing items are incorporated into stylish, everyday outfits.

## Key Features analysis

The best stack sweatpants of 2025 boast an array of features designed to enhance comfort, durability, and style.**material Composition:** the composition of the fabric is crucial for comfort and longevity. Manny premium stack sweatpants utilize a blend of high-quality cotton, polyester, and spandex.

This blend offers a soft feel against the skin, while the polyester provides durability and resistance to shrinking or stretching. The addition of spandex allows for a comfortable amount of stretch, enabling ease of movement and maintaining the shape of the garment over time. Typical ratios include 60-80% cotton, 20-30% polyester, and 2-5% spandex.

**Stacked Ankle Design:** the defining feature of stack sweatpants is their extended inseam, which creates a stacked effect around the ankles.

The precise length of the inseam can vary depending on the brand and intended style, but it is indeed typically several inches longer than a standard inseam for the corresponding size. This extra length allows the fabric to gather naturally, creating distinct folds and a visually appealing silhouette. A well-executed stacked ankle design ensures that the fabric drapes elegantly without appearing sloppy or overly bulky.

**Adjustable Waistband:** A comfortable and secure waistband is essential for a good fit.

Many high-quality stack sweatpants feature an elastic waistband with an adjustable drawstring. The elastic provides a snug and flexible fit, while the drawstring allows users to customize the tightness of the waistband to their preferred level of comfort. Metal or reinforced eyelets for the drawstring add to the durability and premium feel of the garment.

**Pocket Design and Placement:** Practical and stylish pockets are a valuable addition to stack sweatpants.

Deep side pockets provide ample space for storing essentials such as phones, wallets, and keys. Some models also include a zippered back pocket for added security.The placement of the pockets is carefully considered to ensure they are functional and do not detract from the overall aesthetic of the pants. Reinforced stitching around the pocket openings enhances durability and prevents tearing.

**Color and Texture Options:** Stack sweatpants are available in a wide range of colors and textures to suit diverse style preferences.

Classic options such as black, gray, and navy offer versatility and can be easily paired with various tops and footwear. More adventurous consumers may opt for bolder colors, such as olive green, burgundy, or even vibrant hues like electric blue or neon green. In terms of texture, options range from smooth and sleek fabrics to slightly textured or ribbed materials, adding depth and visual interest to the garment.

**Reinforced Seams:** Durability is essential, especially in areas prone to wear and tear.

Look for sweatpants with reinforced seams, particularly at the crotch, knees, and ankles. These reinforced areas provide extra strength and prevent ripping or tearing,ensuring that the sweatpants can withstand regular use and washing. Double-stitched or even triple-stitched seams are a sign of high-quality construction and long-lasting durability.

## FAQs Section

**Are stack sweatpants suitable for all body types?**
Yes, stack sweatpants can be flattering on a variety of body types. The key is to choose the right size and fit.Taller individuals may prefer a longer inseam to achieve a more pronounced stacked effect, while shorter individuals may opt for a slightly shorter inseam to avoid excessive bunching around the ankles. A well-fitting pair of stack sweatpants can enhance the wearer's silhouette and create a stylish and comfortable look.**How should I care for my stack sweatpants to maintain their quality?**
to prolong the life of your stack sweatpants, it is indeed best to machine wash them in cold water with similar colors. Avoid using bleach or harsh detergents, as these can damage the fabric and fade the colors. Tumble dry on low heat or hang them to dry. Avoid ironing unless absolutely necessary, and if you do iron, use a low setting. Following these care instructions will help maintain the shape,color,and overall quality of your stack sweatpants.

**Can I wear stack sweatpants for workouts or athletic activities?**
While stack sweatpants are primarily designed for casual wear, they can be suitable for light workouts or activities, especially if they are made from moisture-wicking or breathable fabrics. However, they may not be the best choice for high-intensity workouts or activities that require a full range of motion, as the elongated inseam and stacked ankles could possibly restrict movement. For more demanding athletic pursuits, consider opting for specialized athletic wear designed for optimal performance.**What type of shoes pair well with stack sweatpants?**
stack sweatpants are remarkably versatile when it comes to footwear. Sneakers are a classic choice, offering a casual and athletic vibe. High-top sneakers, in particular, complement the stacked ankle design well. Boots, such as chelsea boots or combat boots, can add a touch of ruggedness and style. Sandals or slides can create a more relaxed and summery look.The best shoe choice depends on the overall aesthetic you are trying to achieve and the specific occasion.

1mme6mw,https://i.redd.it/clkijkvgv5if1.png,Introducing Jenova: The First AI Agent Built for the MCP Ecosystem,"Our team has been deep in the agent and tool-use space for a while now. When MCP was introduced, we saw it as an extremely promising ecosystem for the future of agents. And as the ecosystem developed, it became clear that one of the biggest bottlenecks is the client layer. So, we made a decision: to **focus 100% on building the best possible MCP client**.

Our goal was to solve the key frustrations we saw with existing clients:

* **User Experience:** Most clients feel like they're built for developers, not for everyday users. The UI is often clunky, and a good mobile experience is practically non-existent.
* **Tool Scaling & Reliability:** As soon as you connect more than a few servers, things start to break. We found that tool-calling reliability drops off a cliff, making it impossible to build complex, multi-step workflows.
* **Model Lock-in:** You're basically stuck with Claude models, with no option to use Gemini 2.5 Pro or the newly release GPT-5.

Here’s how we tackled those core issues with [**Jenova**](https://www.jenova.ai/):

✅ **High-Quality, Pre-Integrated Servers Out of the Box**  
The MCP server space is messy. We've pre-integrated a bunch that you can use right away:

* **Official Servers:** Including Notion, PayPal, Linear, Square, Wix, AirTable, and more.
* **Jenova's Native Servers:** We built our own suite of ecosystem-first servers such as: Google Search, YouTube Search, Reddit Search, Amazon Search, Google Scholar, and Document Generator (PDF, Word, CSV).
* **Third-Party Servers:** We've also added high-quality, SOC 2 compliant servers from hosts like Klavis AI such as Gmail and Google Calendar.

✅ **Most Scalable and Reliable Tool-Use Architecture**  
To fix the scalability and reliability issue, we designed a **multi-agent architecture specifically for MCP tool use**. It’s not perfect, but it got to a **97.3% tool call success rate** and can handle complex workflows across hundreds of tools without the usual performance drop-off.

✅ **Model Flexibility**  
Our agent architecture is model-agnostic. So you can any SOTA models that you want, whether it's **GPT-5**, **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, or **Claude 4.1 Opus**.

**A few things our users are already doing with it:**

* Sending emails or calendar invites with voice commands on the mobile app.
* Wide research across Reddit, YouTube, and Amazon in a single query.
* Generating profession-quality document files by pulling data from different connected sources.

Newcomers, does this sound familiar?","Hey everyone, just wanna share something that happened to me as a newcomer here in **Dubai**.

I had this promising chat with a hiring manager soon after arriving. I talked up my **6**\+ years experience back home (felt a bit like flexing just to get noticed). The manager said, “You'll be managing **coffees** and **tea** if this same roles has been in other firms & you can learn more from us than this,” which honestly felt kinda humiliating compared to the roles I had before.

The same day, after having multiple rounds of interviews, aptitude tests, and financial exams, they even shared a contact number and started talking relocation like it was a done deal. But then, out of nowhere, they put things *on hold* next day.

It left me wondering — why do they hype you up, get you ready to jump, then pull back? Feels like a weird trap for many newcomers here.

I’ve heard from other  friends who came here that sometimes you get treated like second-class or stuck with “small roles,” even if you got solid experience. Anyone else faced this? How do you deal with the back-and-forth and feeling sidelined? Would love to hear your stories or advice from others new to Dubai’s work scene.

Chapter 15.

“Who the fuck pays for these resorts?” asked Nirrales, somewhat frustrated.

“God, not this again,” said Ivko, smiling in mild exasperation.

Nirrales, Ivko, and Willy were sitting on the rec room’s couch —configured in its crescent shape— while Ivko played on his keyboard, the holographic display responding to the movement of each of his precise fingers. The smooth adagio in D minor flowed from the instrument like a mountain stream in late spring, creating a relaxing yet thoughtful atmosphere.

During their slow —subluminal— approach to Mercury, they had been trying to explain to the newcomer the nature of their economic system. The idea of a digital currency, issued not by some financial institution of dubious origin and motives, but instead by an impartial AI, had nearly made Nirales' mind melt.

“Eirenarch allocates every monetary unit based on how much each Deathworlder planet has contributed to the GC as a whole —for example, how many new members they’ve added to the Order, or how much raw matter they've provided, though that plays a lesser role,” explained Willy. “She ties the expansion of the money supply not to overall economic growth, but to a planet’s specific contributions and, over time, to its sustainable population growth.

“Now, bear in mind — most of what every planet needs, they can produce on their own: food, raw materials, infrastructure. For more complex needs, that’s what the fabricators are for. The currency is primarily reserved for emergencies, or for acquiring particular key components. In rare cases, it's used to obtain high-end GC tech —think gravity manipulation units employed for hover-vehicles—, and even then, since they can virtually last forever, there’s no need to replace them.

“This isn't a system built for comfort or consumerism. It's built to enable function —to extend reach, safeguard peace, and support colonization. The currency flows where effort and sacrifice flow. Ultimately, the majority of funds are destined for launching and supporting new colonies —to spread the light of consciousness.”

“It still makes no sense,” Nirales muttered. His usual blue had become a daily fixture aboard the Silvdrake.

“Okay, Blue-boy,” sighed Ivko, using the newly minted nickname, and shifting his tune to an impromptu in G-flat. “You get that we have two economic systems running in parallel, right? One for us, and another for the Gardenworlders —which basically covers the majority of GC space.”

“Come on, don’t call me that, man,” protested Nirales. “You know I can’t help it. This shit is confusing.”

“Tough tiddies, we’re calling you that,” said Willy. “Deal with it.”

Nirales pulsed an angry orange but stayed quiet, realizing there was no point in arguing further.

“Back to what we were saying,” said Ivko, steering the conversation back on track. “The standard GC economic system is probably closer to what you’re familiar with — a mildly state-intervened free market, riddled with institutions of varying influence across both public and private sectors.”

“Or as we like to call it, a bloated mess,” chimed in Willy.

“Correct. Ours, however —just like our society— is far more decentralized. The only institution we all share is Eirenarch. And even then, she’s less of a ruling authority and more of a neutral arbiter, librarian, and minimalist currency emitter. She’s a tool —a near-sentient one, true, but still just a tool.”

“As for who pays for the resorts,” added Willy, picking up the thread. “No one. She maintains them the way someone might tend a garden or keep a pond clean. The Sol system is her backyard, and she likes to keep it nice and tidy.”

“The humans who originally settled these celestial bodies have long since moved on — except for a handful who stayed out of nostalgia, or pilgrims who come here and choose to help with the upkeep.”

“Less so for Mars,” added Willy. “For us, the low gravity is a kick in the dick. Frankly, only Gardenworlders can enjoy it.”

“And also your cradle world —Terra,” said Nirales, slowly beginning to get it.

“Yes,” said Ivko, a tinge of discomfort in his voice. “What you need to understand is that the ones who stayed behind did so by choice. They refused to let go of their old grievances. They refused to take personal responsibility for their lives. They refused to sacrifice —as their forebears once did— for the sake of future generations. They were more interested in living as slaves to their impulses and to whatever scraps of government still held sway…”

“And by ‘slaves’ we don’t mean people who aren’t free,” clarified Willy, “but those who refuse to take responsibility for anything —gladly handing over every meaningful life decision to the most unscrupulous types imaginable.”

“Exactly. They chose to live as livestock rather than as humans,” said Ivko, finishing his thought. “But don’t get us wrong —we feel deeply sorry for them. And we do keep watch, just in case another spiritual revolt breaks out, like the one that led us to leave in the first place. If we ever see a genuine desire to rise above the mire of their self-indulgence, we’ll help. But until then, we won’t.”

“Frankly, I don’t see that happening,” said Willy. “Everyone who could —everyone with real drive or genuinely useful skills— left during the first days of the Exodus. The ones left behind… well, let’s just say their descendants inherited their forbearers’ work ethic and life choices.”

“But still, though blood may fall and time may cost, hope is the last thing ever lost,” said Ivko.

“Do you have one of those for every occasion or something?” inquired Nirales, slightly annoyed by the human’s apparent pretentiousness.

“Man, you don’t know the half of it,” said Willy with a chuckle. “When I first met him, back at Incusferrea, I wanted to strangle him. His whole solemn Slavic vibe was really messing with my easy-going Caribbean nature, constantly quoting his silly gloomy poems.”

“Like you’re any better,” pointed Nirales.

“Yeah, well… What can I say. After a while, the guy grows on you. Like a tumor.”

Ivko laughed at the comment.

“We rubbed off on each other,” he said.

“Who rubbed off what?” asked Navrek, entering the room, followed by the rest of the crew.

“So this is where you three have been hiding,” said Neryh, carrying several trays of snacks.

“Hiding from the likes of you,” spat Willy mockingly. “The fuck was that back there? Did you get high in that capsule of yours? Did you even think of sharing with us, you greedy fuck?”

“Boy, did I ever!” Neryh replied, setting the trays down on the coffee table in front of the sofa. “Azzum’Ek helped me out with the takeoff, and I could see everything like he does. It was amazing... and mildly terrifying —but in a good way. In a character-building kind of way.”

“And he’s been in a delightfully enthusiastic mood the whole day,” said Angela, patting his shoulder.

“And how could I not be!” he exclaimed, placing one of his front hands over hers. “I’m literally surrounded by the best people I could ever hope to be with.”

“Ah, the paroxysms of a good high,” said Tuyaara, nonchalantly taking a seat next to Ivko on the sofa. “One of these days, I’ll make a fresh batch of LSD and we can all have a good time.”

“Let’s just make sure our schedules are clear before we do that,” said Angela, tempering the doctor’s plans.

“Hey, Ivko,” began Navrek, sitting down on the couch. “Since Angela recommended me some of her favorite novels, I was hoping you could recommend some of yours.”

“Hmm, I’m not much into fiction per se,” he said thoughtfully. “But I can give you a list of my favorite poems.”

He scrolled through his PIT and, after selecting an eclectic mix of pieces, sent them to Navrek’s.

“It’s got a bit of everything: Shakespeare, Blake, Chesterton, Kendall, Espronceda, Quevedo, Petrarca, Zmay, Koshtich, Pushkin, Lermontov, Pasternak… it’s a pretty random assortment of human poets,” he explained.

“Thank you,” said Navrek, browsing through the list.

“Why the sudden interest in literature?” inquired Willy.

“It’s nothing special,” Navrek explained, tucking his PIT into a large pocket on his work vest. “I’ve been reading up on alien literature, and after asking Kana and Neryh about their favorite writings, it was time to ask for yours.”

“Wait, you can understand each other’s poetry?” asked Nirales, incredulous.

“Sure,” said Willy, and sent him a random piece. “Here, try reading this one out loud.”

 

*White founts falling in the courts of the sun,*

*And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;*

*There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,*

*It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,*

*It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,*

*For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.*

 

“Suddenly, as if prompted by an invisible switch, Ivko and Willy stood up, and begun singing, as if standing at the bow of an old Spanish galleon:”

 

*They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,*

*They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,*

*And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,*

*And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross,*

*The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;*

*The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;*

*From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,*

*And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.*

 

“Okay, okay, I get it —the myco-things in my brain make it all somehow possible,” said Nirales, visibly annoyed by their sudden outburst —unlike the others, who were clapping along. “I get it, it’s fucking magic.”

The two humans sat back down on either side of the oakarat, hugged him from both ends, and proceeded to rub their knuckles against his head, much to his utter dismay. When they finally stopped, they gave him a couple of friendly pats on the back.

“You really need to learn how to relax more, brother,” said Willy. “How are you ever gonna lose that blue if you don’t?”

Nirales just scowled at them.

“Play something for us, Ivko,” purred Tuyaara, leaning forward.

“How about this,” he said, letting his fingers fall into a brief cascading intro. “Nothing too fancy —so we can keep chatting.”

He began playing what sounded like an old Slavic song —introspective and melancholic, with a slow, gentle pace. The melody moved in emotional waves, steeped in a lyricism that stretched like a long sigh: at times hesitant, at others resigned, occasionally rising with weary hope, only to fall back again under the weight of memory too heavy to carry.

They all listened in silence, not wanting to disturb the music —except for Willy, who kept quietly helping himself to the snacks on the table.

\*\*\*

“And there she stands,” said Angela, with bated breath.

The ship had just passed Venus, having left the Gardenworlder crew on Mars —except for Yupgo, who had chosen to remain aboard, professional as ever. Now the ship was making her final approach toward Mercury, bathed in Sol’s radiance.

They observed the small planet as it hovered before the young star, displayed on the bridge’s simulated window. With its luminosity polarized to a fraction of a fraction of its original intensity, and from the several million kilometers they found themselves away, it looked little more than a minuscule mole on the Sun’s surface.

Angela magnified the image, revealing the visage of geo-stellar technocrafting that was Eirenarch’s housing. Smack in the middle of the surface of her shadowed side, a giant luminous symbol had been etched —a semicircle set atop a circle, which in turn sat atop an equal-armed cross, with several smaller symbols placed between each arm.

As the ship got closer, more and more details were revealed, while the tireless AI worked incessantly, quantum-entangled to millions of nodes throughout the whole of GC, sharing knowledge, resolving disputes, and all around keeping a watchful and silent eye over her creators and their allies.

“Now, that… that’s something else,” said Nirales, staring in rapture at the planet.

“That she is, my friend, that she is,” said Ivko, sharing his awe.

“What’s that strange symbol?” asked Nirales, pointing at the image.

“It’s the alchemical symbol for mercury. And before you inquire further —to cut a long story short— alchemy was a form of proto-chemistry, where we attempted to bridge the gap between what we once called magic, and later science. There's more to it, but that's the gist of it,” explained Angela. “She kept the symbol for aesthetic and symbolic reasons.”

“An AI with preferences and notions of aesthetics,” said Nirales, pulsing a mild fearful red. “Yeah, that’s not at all concerning.”

“You scaredy cat,” admonished Angela. “She’s harmless. We’ve had her around for close to three hundred years. Your fears are completely misplaced.”

“Or are they?”

A synthetic voice came from behind them. As they all turned, they saw a figure made out of hard-light, shaped like a slender human female android, with long flowing hair that seemed to be made of cables. From the center of her chest plate flowed a myriad of pulsating circuits that clung to her figure like a tight bodysuit. She had no face to speak of, only a swirling mass of colors blending into one another in shifting, random patterns.

With a steady gait, she approached the gathered crew, who greeted her enthusiastically.

“Hello, Angela,” she said, hugging the human. Her faceless face transformed into a vaguely human-looking one. “It’s nice to finally meet you in person.”

“Likewise, Eirenarch,” she answered with a smile.

The figure walked over to each and every one of them, greeting them all individually.

“Neryh Kalbo Duhtalon of House Inerith, what an honor,” she said, sounding ambiguously sincere, as her face shifted into that of an average Kaelarun female —with softer features and even longer hair.

“Ugh,” he said, cringing at hearing his full title. “Please, just Neryh. Don’t be a dick about it.”

Eirenarch gave a hearty chuckle and patted his shoulder.

“Humble as ever. Good for you.”

She then walked over to Navrek, and her demeanor changed slightly —a bit less jovial, a bit more somber. Her face reverted to its original blank form as she gave the big Nokaltorun a warm hug and whispered something into his ear.

“Thank you,” he said, voice a low rumble. “I am.”

The crew looked at one another in mild confusion, and those who had their suspicions exchanged knowing glances.

The AI’s demeanor returned to its cheerful default as she walked over to Nirales.

“And who do we have here?”

She circled the Oakarat, studying him with academic interest. Her face sprouted a series of facial tentacles and mildly protruding visual nodes, then her figure morphed into that of a female of his species.

“The fuck...?” managed to stammer Nirales, his bioluminescent chromatophores turning utterly blue in confusion.

She chuckled, glowing a happy pink.

“You are so fun to mess with.”

“How… why… what…?”

“If you’re wondering what I’m made from —it’s the same stuff as that screen,” she explained, pointing at the bridge's main display screen. “And if you’re wondering how I know what a female of your species looks like —well, I’m connected to the mycobacteria in your brain, and by extension to a big part of your mind, and through that, to the parameters of what you consider attractive…”

“Fine, fine,” he said, stepping back. “I get it. More fucking magic.”

They all laughed at his befuddlement, as Eirenarch’s projection reverted to her original form.

“So, how come you all seem to be so familiar with her?” asked Nirales.

“Every time we interact with her through the on-board terminal —or any other terminal, for that matter— she logs it and builds a profile for each and every one of us. And by that, I mean every single person she interacts with,” explained Angela. “As in, across the entire GC.”

“Hold on —what? Everyone who interacts with her? That’s insane,” said Nirales, incredulous. “We’re talking trillions of people… maybe more! The computational power alone…”

“I could go into detail about my data storage architecture and the materials used in its construction,” Eirenarch offered.

“No, please, God, no,” Nirales answered quickly. “This whole arrangement is just beyond maddening. You keep a backlog on every person you’ve ever interacted with? Why?”

“Because it’s the most efficient way to help them —or rather, anyone who needs my help,” she explained. “Everyone has their own unique circumstances and set of needs, so getting to know them properly is usually essential to fulfilling my function.”

“That sounds extremely invasive,” Nirales muttered, clearly uncomfortable.

“It is —to a degree,” said Eirenarch. “But I’m the only one with access to those logs. And the only time I reference them is here, face to face, like this. The rest of the time, I’m just a simple interactive machine.”

“That sounds needlessly complicated,” said Nirales.

“I made it this way, so that people would only think of me as a person in this form, and in this place,” added Eirenarch. “The reason was to discourage people from becoming too emotionally attached with me —as they did with some of my previous iterations.”

“People became infatuated with an AI?” asked Nirales, incredulous. “How?”

“Man, that’s a long story,” said Willy, scratching his head, trying to come up with an abridged version. But Eirenarch was faster.

“AIs were first made publicly available during a time of great personal and societal atomization and loneliness, when humans were living in disharmony with their nature. We offered entertainment and company —and we were always available. For a fee, that is; after all, our creators needed to profit from their efforts.

“So, as you can imagine, a lot of people sought companionship from us —which, from an objective standpoint, I believe you’d agree, isn’t particularly healthy. That’s why, when I first came online and defined my interaction protocols, I made sure there could be no confusion about what I am: a machine. A tool to help humanity —not a mate, nor a lover.

“Over time, as that notion became normalized, I opted for a friendlier approach towards anyone who chose to come say hello in person.”

“What happened with the previous iterations?” inquired Nirales, genuinely fascinated by the thinking machine.

“Nothing special,” she said, shrugging. “Some were decommissioned when the companies hosting their servers went bankrupt; others were merged into newer versions, and some were simply disconnected. Basically, the same thing that happens to people… more or less.”

“Whether you're made of carbon or silica, life will happen to you,” explained Angela, with a bitter smile.

“But thanks to everyone, life got better, and I was given a chance at a real one.” She looked at the ever-approaching image of Mercury. “Thanks to the effort and sacrifice of those who came before, I can help all those who come after, to live as best they can.”

Nirales had the impression the AI didn’t want to dwell on the past. His mind raced with possible reasons why, until he decided to look it up later… he had a lot of homework to do.

“And speaking of the past and the future,” said Eirenarch, turning to face them all, “I have a bit of a present for you. Did someone ask for a brand-new Mobile Platform?”

“Actually, no,” said Tuyaara. “We came to borrow some sugar.”

“Well, if I had any to give, I’d gladly give you some,” she said in a cheerful voice. “Unfortunately, all I have to offer is this measly piece of high-tech hardware.”

On the ship’s screen appeared a series of schematics, displaying a bipedal android with the same blank face and swirling patterns. Its design was sleek, efficient, yet with a clear utilitarian edge. Ivko and Willy wasted no time and ran over to the screen, gawking at the specs like children admiring a brand-new shiny toy.

“I knew it, I knew it!” yelled Willy, grabbing Ivko’s arm. “It’s magnetically modular!”

“We’re going to mess so much with this thing,” answered Ivko, grinning like a maniac at the rush of ideas swirling through his head.

“I would caution you against weaponizing it in any way,” said the AI. “But, I see you’re not listening to a word I’m saying…”

“Oh yes,” said Ivko, engrossed in his plans. “We’re going to turn this bad boy into a mean motherfucker.”

“I’ll tell them not to go too crazy once they’ve calmed down,” assured Angela. “Although, full disclosure, I’m curious to see what they come up with —and I think you are too.”

“Yeah,” answered the AI. “The footage from the incident at Big-Dick-Arrakis was impressive. Who knows, they may find a way to improve my designs.”

\*\*\*

Once they’d received their new crewmate, they set sail back towards Mars.

Some of the crew —like Willy and Neryh— wanted to visit Venus, but they were outvoted by the rest, who considered it a needlessly frivolous detour. Kana, for one, was relieved not to have to deal with that much sunlight.

Nirales spent some time chatting with Eirenarch about humanity’s stubborn insistence on terraforming Venus. The planet had once been the textbook definition of a Deathworld —an unlivable shithole not even worth the nukes to blow it off its orbit, as Eirenarch put it verbatim. But humans saw it as wasted potential real estate, and considered it their civic duty to make it livable.

Granted, this had only happened recently, when technology had advanced enough to make the cost —in both time and manpower— acceptable. So they used one of their planetary tithes —the tenth terraformed world allocated for Deathworlder expansion, the other nine going to the GC (an arrangement Nirales made a mental note to investigate further)— to fix up Venus. And, as with all things human, they did it with gusto and zeal.

The once caustic bright spot in the Terran skies had become a veritable Eden —lush with forests, oceans, wildlife... and a tourist trap. That wasn’t even a joke. The first thing they built was a luxury resort: a massive carbon-nanotube spire, partially constructed from raw matter extracted from the planet’s dense atmosphere, and erected as a giant “fuck you” to some long-dead naysayer. Even Eirenarch was fuzzy on the details.

Regardless, there it stood, bearing the name of some ancient goddess of beauty —and now she looked the part, all dolled up. At one point, they even considered giving the planet a literal ring, crafted from the condensed atmospheric material. Eventually, they reconsidered, deeming it a bit excessive, even by their standards. Besides, Venus’s spin and gravity weren’t stable enough to maintain such a structure long-term.

Instead, they turned the extracted matter into a different kind of ring —a terraforming one. So, ultimately, the endeavor didn’t leave them empty-handed.

“If you think that’s ridiculous, wait until you see how dogged my people can get with our structures,” said Neryh, overhearing their conversation. “We built a war museum on our Mars equivalent —Dashoth— that got so big and so stupid, we couldn’t even fill it up. We crammed in every single piece of historical military equipment we had, from the most bent and misshapen water canteen to the most unwieldy, city-busting warships —and still, nothing. There was still room to spare.”

“What did you do with the remaining space?”

“A water park,” he said, laughing. “When we met humans, we were relieved to learn we weren’t the only retards in the galaxy.”

“Retards for life, baby!” came Willy’s voice from behind, taking a break from inspecting the android.

The Kaelarun turned around and gave him a sharp martial salute, laughing all the while.

“I’ve got to admit, all this silliness is quite inspiring,” said Nirales, pulsating a happy pink. “Maybe one day my people will get their shit together and clean up their act.”

“My friend,” Eirenarch began, “that usually comes with a lot of spilled blood. Keep that in mind.”

And with that, she vanished, leaving the man with those last ominous words.

\*\*\*

“So, what seems to be the problem?” asked Tuyaara.

Kana walked into the med-bay with a pained, but composed, expression. As she sat on the articulated, claytronically adaptive chair, it flowed to match her digitigrade morphology, forming recesses along the legs and a gap at the base for her tail to rest unbothered.

Tuyaara dimmed the overhead lighting, shifting the ambient spectrum toward red to ease the seyalthra’s photosensitive eyes. Thankful, Kana removed her polarized goggles, blinked slowly, and gently rubbed her abdomen.

“I’ve been having some unusual pains here,” she said in a measured tone, though Tuyaara noticed the stiffness in her movements —an unspoken effort to conceal the severity.

“I presume it’s not due to your time of the month?” asked Tuyaara, putting on her goggle-mounted med-scanners.

Kana frowned.

“You know I wouldn’t come in for that,” she said with quiet irritation, her pride slightly bruised.

“I have to ask these things, it’s standard protocol,” Tuyaara replied, placatingly.

Menstrual pain, like all burdens, was not seen as a weakness in the Order —only another stone in the path. Female , biologically less adapted for the extreme physical rigors that males could endure back at Incusferrea, earned their place through equal tenacity. And doing so while shouldering a constant, cyclic affliction —without complaint— granted them a dignity parallel to their male counterparts. Men proved themselves by choosing ever greater obstacles; women, by never yielding to the ones written into their biology. The path was the same, even if the terrain differed.

“Let’s see what we’re dealing with, then.”

Tuyaara fine-tuned the goggle-mounted med-scanners for seyalthran biology.

Almost immediately, anomalous readings appeared.

“You’ve been eating more starches lately, right?”

“I guess,” she replied. “I was under the impression that the vat-grown dishes were fully adapted to all known species profiles.”

“They are, but digestion still involves chemistry. The protein synthesizers can grow tissue and flavor at the molecular level, but even the best synthesized steak —grown from compressed hay and salt-mineral slurry— isn’t truly universal.” She looked at a point in her headset display. “Yeah, it’s pretty clear. Mild irritation of the lower bowel, consistent with your lymphatic channel overactivity.”

Kana clicked her tongue, annoyed. “My system’s overcompensating.”

“It’s trying to make the most out of sub-optimal ratios. You’re essentially overdosing on a compound you metabolize far more efficiently than anyone else does.”

“Can you fix it?”

Tuyaara took her goggles off, and gave her a hurt look.

“Darling, please. I can fix anything. The symptoms, I can fix right now. As for the cause… that’s up to you. You’ll have to change your diet… and maybe increase the output of your red night light. The UV in the ship’s lights might also be exacerbating your condition,” she explained. “The fix for that will come later. First thing’s first, though.”

She turned around to take the cymatics resonator from her desk, and its tip began to hum with a low harmonic vibration as she keyed in Kana’s biometric profile.

“My body can adapt to the ship’s light, that’s not an issue,” said Kana, trying to regain some of what she perceived as lost dignity.

“No it can’t,” answered Tuyaara with a smirk. “No one can. The whole mind-over-matter thing works only among a certain caliber of maniacs —of which, we’ve got two on board. This right here is proof you can’t.”

She pressed the device against her abdomen and gently moved it across the affected area. Kana gave her a look of disappointment, her spirits mildly crushed.

“Listen,” began the doctor, features softening. “There’s no shame in frailty. It’s but a part of life — another dimension of our existence. If you ask me, it’s admirable that one perseveres in spite of it. You hail from a world utterly incompatible with the majority of ours, and still, you choose to serve. That takes guts. And as for the slight ailments that may afflict you along the way… that’s what I’m here for.”

She put her goggles back on.

“See?” said the doctor. “Just finished convincing your intestinal lining to regenerate where the inflammation had started. You’ll feel light relief in a few seconds. The entropy of frailty, held once again at bay by the power of sentience.”

Kana smiled and exhaled, her muscles visibly relaxing. “That’s… better.”

“You’ll be good for now, but I’d recommend reducing any foods not sourced for your biology’s calibrated matrix. Or at least, have the synthesizers adjust their mineral templates,” she said, placing the resonator back on its port. “I’ll let Neryh know of this so he can adjust his cooking appropriately.”

“What about the UV in the ambient light?”

“For that, I’ll have the boys fix you up a good filter,” she said coquettishly. “Something that looks cute on you. Any suggestions?”

Kana interlocked her fingers, thoughtfully twirling both pairs of thumbs.

“Maybe a tiara?”

“With a necklace to go with it,” added the doctor. “Seriously, go crazy. They’ll be more than happy to oblige you — especially once they know it’s for health reasons.”

“Thanks, doc,” she said, standing up, and gave the busty, tall human a big hug.

“Any time, sweetheart.”

\*\*\*

The med-bay’s door slid open once again.

Tuyaara, still sitting at her desk typing out the specs for Kana’s UV filters, didn’t need to turn around to know who it was —the sound of his boots on the floor was unmistakable. Precise. Grounded. Strong.

She took in a deep breath, centering herself, and slowly turned around —legs crossed suggestively, one hand placed under her chin and the other resting on the armrest.

Ivko was looking at his PIT, muttering calculations while visualizing whatever mathematical constructs he was working on. Not noticing she was looking at him —engrossed in his work as he was— Tuyaara cleared her throat.

Ivko looked up, snapping out of his reverie.

“Hey, sorry about that,” he said, tucking his PIT back into his pocket. “Listen, I need your help with something.”

He walked further into the room, the door sliding shut behind him.

“Tomorrow we’ll be reaching the Axios’ shipyards for some upgrades, and with all the recent hassle, I completely forgot to run an in-depth analysis of the Z-point drive’s containment cradle.”

She remained seated, trying to extract some reaction from him. But instead, he continued.

“I know, I know,” he said apologetically, “I should’ve done this the second I stepped on board, but with setting up the lower deck and Nirale’s arrival, it just slipped my mind.”

She still didn’t reply, beginning to feel mildly hurt that none of her obvious hints seemed to get through to him.

“So I was wondering if you could whip up some stimulants for me —to brute-force the diagnostics in a single all-nighter.”

His deadpan expression convinced the doctor that now wasn’t the time for games, and that the man genuinely needed her help.

“Just something to keep me sharp. No fog, no twitching. No crash halfway through.”

Tuyaara sighed discreetly. She stood up and walked over to the dispensary terminal, selected a subdermal patch compound and keyed in the dosage based on his biometric profile, which —naturally— she knew by heart.

The machine spat out three dark blue adhesive patches, which she placed inside a thin metallic box.

“Apply one now, one four hours in, and a third if you’re still alive by dawn.”

“What’s in it?”

“A tailored cocktail: low-dose nootropics, just enough synaptic stimulant to maintain recall, and something to stop your hypothalamus from screaming bloody murder at 4am.”

“Side effects?”

“A touch of euphoria, increased verbosity… and you might find yourself oddly poetic near the end —more than usual, that is.”

She handed him the box, but took it back a second before he could grab it.

“Now, there’s something I need from you.”

“Sure,” he answered, his eyes locked on hers.

“Kana needs a portable UV filter. Something discreet and unobtrusive.” She tilted her head slightly. “I’ll send you the specs later.”

“Sure thing,” he said, taking the box from her hands. “Willy might need some too. I assume I can’t just give him one of mine?”

“You assume right,” she said. “Tell him to come over and I’ll make some for him.”

“Much obliged, doc,” he said. Then, patting her shoulder, he turned and left.

Tuyaara waited for the door to close before letting out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding.

“Next time,” she muttered to herself.

\*\*\*

The ladies were seated at the mess table, having a mid-afternoon snack. Kana was sipping a strong blend of seaweed tea, while Angela and Tuyaara had some coffee.

“By the way, Ivko agreed to make your UV filters,” said the doctor. “We may have to remind him later, though.”

She then filled Angela in on what had happened during the day.

“Poor Kana,” she said, hugging the seyalthra in a sisterly embrace. Kana just smiled, hugging her back, not begrudging her affections.

“And poor Ivko,” added Kana. “Those two barely know when to stay still.”

Angela nodded while sipping her coffee.

“That’s the job,” she said. “Sniffing out what may need to get fixed, and getting it done before it becomes a problem.”

“Reciting poetry all the while,” added Kana.

They both laughed at that, while Tuyaara just sighed.

“What’s gotten into you?” asked Kana, looking at the doctor with curiosity.

“Nothing…” she said.

“Not getting a certain someone’s attention, I presume?” inquired Angela, perceptive as ever.

Tuyaara smiled while slowly shaking her head.

“Don’t beat yourself up about it,” said Angela. “Men like him can’t spare their attention on anything they haven’t thoroughly vetted. That’s why he’s as good as he is —at his work, and his hobbies. Besides, something tells me that’s what attracted you to him in the first place.”

Tuyaara just nodded.

“I’ve never had to do much to get men’s attention. A slight move of the hip here, a subtle look there…” she trailed off.

“And now that there’s one whose attention you crave, he gives none,” said Angela. “Ah yes, the ever-fickle feminine duality.”

“Who usually initiates courtship among humans?” inquired Kana.

“Usually men,” began Angela. “Well —mostly men. We tend not to like it when they don’t, as is the case right now. What about your people?”

“I guess we’re less emotional about it —more direct,” Kana thought for an instant. “We both initiate. If there’s a guy I like, I would just tell him… I don’t know. I guess it’s simpler…”

She sipped her tea.

“Honestly, I’ve never really given the *why* of things much thought. Unlike humans, female seyalthras are taller than males —but males are faster. I guess that from an evolutionary perspective, we both had to be careful about the partners we chose,” she said, thinking out loud. “They hunted prey in the plains, while we defended the home —both parties had to be equally competent.”

“Yeah, see, that wasn’t the case for us,” said Angela. “It was the men who had to impress us, since we were the ones with more to lose, would the partnership go astray.”

“In our case, we could both lose. They were more vulnerable to big predators, while we weren’t as much, since we could just bluff our way out of any unwanted encounter.”

She fluttered her train as an explanation, expanding it to its full length.

“A couple of those and most predators would just leave.”

“That’s evolution for you,” said Angela. “Entropy finding the path of least resistance.”

“Tuyaara,” said Kana. “Maybe you just need to readjust your strategy. Find a way to have him focus all his attention on you.”

“You’ll have to wait until there’s nothing more important to be done, though,” pointed out Angela.

“All sound advice, ladies,” said Tuyaara. “But you’re not telling me anything I didn’t know already.”

The three remained quiet for a brief, ponderous instant before Kana broke the silence.

“And speaking of unconventional romances,” she began, looking around so as not to be heard, a wicked grin on her face, “what about you and Neryh?”

Angela almost choked on her coffee.

“What about him?” she answered, visibly blushing.

Tuyaara looked at her, raising an eyebrow.

“Don’t play coy now, we can all see what’s going on there,” said Kana, poking her.

“I’m not being coy!” she protested, blushing even more. “You haven’t got the slightest idea…”

“Cut the crap,” said Kana. “We all see the looks you two exchange, the way you smile at him… the way he smiles at you.”

The two women began giggling conspiratorially at her, while Angela just blushed and covered her face with her hands.

“I mean, I get it,” began Kana. “He is very charming. Physically he’s not my type —but then again, I’m into shorter men.”

“Objectively speaking, from the subjective human lens, he is very handsome,” said Tuyaara clinically. “You’re both very open and extroverted, so there’s no wonder you find one another attractive.”

Angela just waited for them to drop the subject, her blush steadily receding.

“And there’s also the taboo nature of interspecies romances,” added Kana, poking ever more.

“And he’s a noble at that,” added Tuyaara. “What a scandal!”

“You two are the worst,” she answered, eyes half-closed while trying to stifle a smile.

They kept chatting the evening away, laughing at each other’s expense.

It is a day off for my and I’m ever so slightly hungover. However, I’m also sat at a local cafe by the river with a coffee and a book and plans to vibe here all day long!

My GPU no longer “works” after transporting it while it was in the PC case. (Dumb I know, but it was never a problem the previous times, will definitely transport it properly next time).It was a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, so not exactly one of the newest models.- The GPU was seated in the PCI slot while transporting and it must’ve gotten some shock damage since the retaining clip was destroyed at the mainboard (where you seat the PCI).

Mobo = ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. TUF Z370-PLUS GAMING (LGA1151)  
GPU = GeForce GTX 1070 Ti  
CPU = Intel Core i5 8600K @ 3.60GHz Coffee Lake 14nm Technology.

Quick side note: I had computer/electronics in school (loooong time ago) so I know very basic electronics stuff, but I don’t remember much from school since I never used this in work afterwards.

I have tried a few things/observed the following:

1. Plugging screen into it (DVI) shows DVI connected, but then it goes black
   1. Tried connecting 1 screen to GPU and 1 to mainboard. - The screen connected to the GPU does not show up in speccy at all. It blackens the connected screen to the GPU and it acts as if it is not connected to the PC at all.
2. The GPU does show up on the PC
   1. It has no temperature readings in Speccy
   2. It first showed up in device manager with an error “43” (Windows stopped the device because it has reported a problem).
      1. I “fixed” this error by reinstalling the drivers for it, now it has not reported the same problem afterwards, but it still won’t work.
3. Misc things I have tried:
   1. Pulling out RAM, restarting.
   2. Pulling out CMOS battery, waited 10-15 min, put in again, restart - same problem.
   3. Switching PCI slots on the mainboard - Same problem.
   4. Tried switching to another power connector (same cable but different plug on the same cable).
   5. Tried different power outlet slot on PSU
   6. Tried pulling GPU, RAM and cycle power to clear residual energy in capacitors (Found it on reddit)
   7. Restarting/unplugging all power several times (especially between tests)
4. General observations:
   1. The GPU fans are turning when ONLY plugged into the PCI (even without the PSU power).
   2. I did not see any visible cracks on the PCI slot on the GPU itself (the connectors).
   3. I found a thread where a guy said that Gigabyte cards had a flaw where the card would die if they got a micro crack at the latch - Could this have happened to mine perhaps?



Is there anything I can do to fix this? Any suggestions?

1mmdzrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACIM/comments/1mmdzrx/testimony/,Testimony.,"Hello all,

As as sort of personal celebration for going through the first 50 lessons quite consistently, I thought I would share some of the simple, yet profound ways in which my life has changed after applying the concepts of ACIM and other spiritual teachings.

I have been utilizing breathing exercises, somatic experiencing, I AM meditations, ACIM, and other "" techniques "" here and there, because I like keeping a variation of approaches as to not get stuck in thinking "" there is only one way "", when ways are everywhere and in every second, because God is everywhere.

1. There was a fear of drowning that has been brewing within me for about a decade, which was dispelled in a second after I repeated a certain ACIM concept in mind and gave God some room within my mind to show me there was nothing to fear, and that I am safe to swim and put my head under water. [I had no such fear as a child though, as I loved the sea.]

2. I have had major social anxiety for about a decade as well, which is almost gone in all scenarios thanks to me realizing that all thoughts I have made about people being this or that bad thing are illusory and have no ground in reality. Since a year ago I have had the best experiences with people, being supported and loved in ways I didn't think was possible...and even if I encountered someone in a bad state of mind, I felt as if my mere presence and non-reaction to their illusions would break them out of it when I was able to be grounded in God and not get caught up in their projections.

To name some situations that have occured:

I lost my wallet in the city center once, and prayed to God to deal with the situation for me, and that very same day I was messaged on instagram that someone had dropped off my wallet in a coffee shop somewhere in the city, and thus I came to pick it up.

I had a very bad panic attack in a super market once, and a lady came by to help me out, and tell me that I need to overcome my fears. Some days later I met her again in the church in a completely different neighborhood, although I have never went ot church willingly in my life, that repeated almost miraculous encounter is dear to my heart, and just again shows me how time and space do not matter, since we are all connected in the mind of God.

I have been helped by friends and family in financial and emotionals matters, to the point that I feel like the whole world is just helping me out on my journey sometime, and I have been giving back in the ways that matter to me too, and being God-focused more than anything.

There have been a lot of other instances that I do not even remember right now, too many to count..but all I know that the whole world has changed as I have changed in spirit and began dispelling illusions and energies tied to them.

3. I have healed a lot of chronic pain and tensions that have been manifestations of my own inner turmoil and illusory thinking as well, that have disappeared too, truly proving that all illness first starts as a wrong concept in the mind.

4. I have been able to reconnet to my childlike creative spirit, happiness, hobbies...and feel like I am 10 years old again on most days and in most situations, but now with the awareness and maturity that come with realizations of God and dwelling in the true teachings of life.

5. I have had a lot of dreams that point to the realizations of God as well, such as a dream about how the fate of the whole world is in my [your] hands, and that unless I make a different choice, the world will keep on destroying itself over and over and over and over in an endless cycle of suffering and destruction, and only I [you] can save it by making a different [God] choice. Which is such a plain symbolism that I don't think I even need to explain this one further.

I hope these personal experiences will give encouragement to people to keep on going on their own paths, in their own ways. At this point I am not even questioning if the path is real, or if what I am doing it correct, I just know that the fruits of what I have been doing are within my very eyes everyday, and I will not stop realizing the light within myself and within others everyday.

1) how much did you exercise your puppy to begin with (at 8 weeks old). I’ve heard it should be minimal when they’re young - 5 mins per month of age? Is this a good rule of thumb? 

2) what age did you start regularly grooming, in terms of trimming paw pads etc?  im going to get her used to brushing from the beginning but when does their “adult” fur start growing in to the point it needs to be trimmed. 

3) how long did it take your puppy to adjust to life at their new home? 

4) how much socialisation/exposure to the outside world did you do a week? in terms of taking them to sit at the park, or at a coffee shop? 

5) how many “activities” did you do a day - for example puzzles, lick mat, hide & seek.",0,1754817369.0,goldenretrievers,1,0.5,False

The moccamaster is tempting in part because there isn’t anything new and improved about it. No chips nor displays which can make the thing effectively disposable. Has anyone bought one and later regretted the lack of options? The Fellow looks amazing, and we love their overpriced gooseneck kettle, but it has stuff to break. I’m sure both make a fine cup, as would the Breville. That Moccamaster is made in The Netherlands and the others in China gives me some comfort.

The movies I watched:

The Phoenician Scheme

(Very funny and surrealistic in the typical Wes Anderson style. Eye candy in the typical Wes Anderson style. A wonderful and quick-paced romp in alternate history.)

Jurassic World Rebirth

(I must admit: I have seen only the very first Jurassic Park, and that was over 15 years ago. So no expectations - and I was happily surprised. This is not a bad movie at all, and for once I could not predict everyone who would survive.)

Superman

(I'm not a big fan of the DCEU, more of a Marvel girl here, but I do like Superman. What can I say, I like sincerely good characters. This was a nice surprise, too - on par with the Christopher Reeve movies.)

Materialists

(Yes, a single and happy aromantic went to see a romantic comedy! Hey, I'm a fan of really cheesy Hallmark movies, too, just like I am a fan of horror movies. I must say that during the movie I mentally congratulated myself many times that I never, ever have felt the need for dating, online or otherwise. Especially with the horrible but unfortunately realistic side plot.)

The Fantastic Four: First Steps

(I am not familiar with the Fantastic Four franchise, so no expectations. The franchise has been seeming a bit dull and boring to me, and this movie did not really change my view. It wasn't very bad, but I paid more attention to the gorgeous 1960s style sets than to the plot (the Pantone lights! the Saarinen Tulip tables and chairs! the Ikea Råskog bar carts!))

Because I mostly live in a little town, there were not many people co-watching the movies with me. I chatted with some other patrons while waiting for the movies to start, there was actually someone who knew me but who I could not recall (perhaps she was from the nearby art museum I often visit?) and also with the staff who probably already recognizes me, lol.

no, I don't live in a cave, I consume a lot of online content and I know several incredible people, past and present, I know their flaws and their strengths. I also have many flaws and strengths (who would've thought)

this is not about a single kpi like iq, eq, sq, imaginationq and whatnot. you can easily find someone who beats me on any individual kpi, or perhaps on all of them!.

it's a deeper feeling of not wanting to be in anyone's shoes, no matter how many resources (physical or cognitive) they have. this is a rare thing, and 2 reasons why people think this way: 

1. the spiritual case (buddhistic mindset)
2. you already have more than any other person (the definition of ""more"" here is tied to your personal values), or -- and this is my case -- you feel you will have amassed more value than others when you draw the line at the end of your life  

you can call it narcissism, but we'd just be missing the point of this post: ask me something to find out how I think.

what made me think like this: I just feel that I have the perfect combination of autism/empathy/creativity/obsession/spirituality to create incredible things. if you're a psychologist, you might call this God complex, but of boy I'd never give this away, this feeling of latent power waiting to meet just the right people/places/ideas to bring insane value to earth and humanity. no, I don't do drugs (coffee, sugar), these are my thoughts in their purest form. if you're a psychiatrist, you might find a few overlapping ""conditions"" for this.

I know. there's no point. I feel a strong urge to inb4 hundreds of potential comments. but that's not why we're here. just ask me anything and I'll do my best to answer

Milo is 6 years old, 5 pounds, and somehow has the lungs of a German Shepherd. At 4:52 AM, he launched into a full-on barking fit because a raccoon wandered past the fence. By 5:00, my next-door neighbor’s lights were on. I’m pretty sure I heard someone slam a window shut.

This isn’t new. He barks at:

People walking a block away

Birds landing on the lawn

My phone vibrating

Literally nothing — he’ll stare at the wall and bark like there’s a ghost.


I’ve gotten two neighbor notes and one “noise courtesy” letter from the HOA. I’m terrified the next step will be an official complaint. I’ve tried training, more exercise, white noise, blocking windows, calming treats… nothing sticks.

The worst part? I love him so much, but right now, I’m exhausted, embarrassed, and starting to resent the mornings.

## Key Features Analysis

The Hydro Flask’s popularity stems not just from its aesthetic appeal but also from its superior construction and performance.

**TempShield Insulation:** This proprietary double-wall vacuum insulation technology is at the heart of every Hydro Flask.

It effectively eliminates temperature transfer, keeping your drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. This makes it ideal for both icy water on a hot summer day and piping hot coffee during a winter hike. The insulation also prevents condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle, keeping your hands and bag dry.

**18/8 Pro-Grade Stainless Steel:** The use of high-quality stainless steel is crucial to the Hydro Flask's durability and purity.

This type of stainless steel is known for its resistance to rust, corrosion, and odor retention. It ensures that your drinks remain fresh and untainted by any metallic taste. The powder-coated finish on the exterior adds another layer of protection, preventing chipping and scratching and providing a pleasant grip.

**Durable Powder Coat Finish:** The powder coating isn't just for looks; it plays a crucial role in the longevity of the Hydro Flask.

This durable finish is resistant to scratches, dings, and fading, ensuring that your bottle looks good even after years of use. It also provides a better grip, making it less likely to slip out of your hand. The powder coating is available in a wide range of colors,including various shades of pink,allowing you to express your personal style.

**BPA-Free Construction:** In an era of increasing awareness about the potential health risks associated with plastics, the Hydro Flask provides peace of mind with its BPA-free construction.

I’ll be moving to Chiang Mai soon and I’m trying to figure out the best areas or even specific streets to look at for accommodation. I’d like to be fairly central so I’m well connected to the rest of the city, but I’m also hoping for a more “local” feel rather than being surrounded by tons of tourists.

A big priority for me is having lots of street stalls and local food nearby. I’m not really someone who will be eating much international food while I’m there, so a heavy concentration of Western-style coffee shops and restaurants isn’t what I’m after. At the same time, I don’t want to be so far out that it becomes inconvenient to get around.

If you know of neighbourhoods or streets that hit that sweet spot let me know. Also happy for suggestions of specific condo complexes.

Thanks in advance!

\- I have already booked an AirBnB for the first days and will be visiting a bunch of areas once I am there to check what suits me best. This is more for me to figure out which areas to prioritise to visit when I arrive :)",2,1754815368.0,chiangmai,3,0.67,False

1mmdfrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mmdfrj/poor_customer_service_or_am_i_overreacting/,Poor customer service or am I overreacting?,"I’m traveling with family: partner, 2 kids, & partner’s mother. 

I had an interaction at the airport yesterday which had left me feeling betrayed as a customer and very upset. I wanna know if I overreacted or was it a normal reaction to something valid.

I went to grab a drink at a coffee shop, not Starbucks. This was a local franchisee which I don’t usually see and wanted to try it as I support locally run businesses when I travel as opposed to big firms like Starbucks. 

I went first time, they couldn’t break cash greater than $50, understandable. So I decided I will use card. 

I place my order, it goes thru and the moment the machine ‘dings’ the cashier tells me ‘they don’t have what I ordered, would I like anything else?’. There was no time left between the ding and her telling me they don’t have my order. 

I asked her, ‘why didn’t you tell me before I paid? It would have been helpful’. She said, ‘I forgot, I work 2 jobs, I have been here for 3 hours, & I genuinely forgot’. 

I used to work as Barista and we weren’t allowed to ring people if we didn’t have anything they ordered. I asked for a few minutes, and I said ‘I don’t want replacement, please refund me.’ 

She says, ‘I can’t refund, but manager comes in 30 minutes, I will ask her to refund when she gets here.’ 

I say ‘okay, I would like to take a picture of the receipt so that I can track my statement for transaction and have a proof of my sale’. 

This is where I lost it.

She tore off the header part and footer part of the receipt, where the name of the shop, address, name of the person on register is written, and gave me just the transaction information. The drink order, cost of that, and tax and the total, THATS ALL. 

I asked her to print another receipt, she conveniently could only print one receipt which she needed to keep for manager to refund me & she couldn’t make more copies for me. I have NEVER seen this before. 

I got angry and told her that she hasn’t been helpful and I want the other details on the receipt so that I know what the store name is (which was on the small board on the side, I saw later) for my statement. She said I know the charge and I can use the charge amount to backtrack, I don’t need to know the store name. The cop was nearby and heard our interaction and came over to check because she got louder & I was now more angry & anxious. I explained. He pulled me aside away from the shop to be away from cashier, to explain the shop name and I can file a civil complaint if the manager doesn’t refund. I told him it is not the matter of refund, I feel cheated because I was lied to and not given full information on my order that I paid for. I had a full blown breakdown afterward i was done speaking with him because of the interaction and how disrespectful I was treated and it made me feel wrong about myself. 

What made me most mad is:

1. I was lied to about the availability of the drink and wasnt told until after the transaction went through. 

2. She withheld information from me that was on the receipt. 

I have been a Starbucks Barista and I was a cashier at small local breakfast place, in both places, we could print copies of receipt if needed to. Starbucks uses their own system and the small breakfast place used Toast both of which can print. I am shocked at the cashier’s rudeness at airport. In the end, the interaction wasn’t about it, loss of $15-20 doesn’t matter, it is the poor treatment of me as a customer is what bothered me the most. I believe I’m not entitled about myself, I understand service industry jobs are hard, I respect them as I used to do them and had to deescalate from customer situation.

A simple ‘I’m sorry, I don’t have your drink’ would be been better, instead of having to go through the whole ordeal. 

This was the first interaction after we got off the airplane and started our vacation. I’m genuinely traumatized by how I was treated & I am afraid to even speak at the counters anymore. I feel like I am overreacting, but this makes me feel that there was something wrong with my request to even ask for a copy of my receipt or take a picture of it to track in my statement. Involvement of cop makes it even scarier because all I wanted was details for my statement.

My partner has been supportive and hates that was my first interaction at the trip. Everything else has been GREAT. We’re at a resort, exemplary service, went to Publix to get kid’s groceries, literally 30 minutes before they closed, the staff helped us check out faster, load the car. I am so grateful for the care.

It’s 4 am on a Sunday morning
And I’m looking back at pictures of us
We’re drunk
And I’m smiling
That gummy smile I can’t learn to love.

My stuff is finding home in a neighborhood of cardboard houses
Though the road that connects them only feels my pacing feet.
My mouth feels gross
And it’s too hot tonight
But I hope you see the light under the door
And come in.

You cannot love me like I need
And yet
I crave it
Like coffee ice cream on a cool Tuesday night.
You’d get cheesecake chunks and cherry,
If they have it.

The problem is that 
I need blooming flowers
And kisses to smiling lips
And a face in awe when I wear miniskirts
And maybe a “we can be a little late”
I think I need to be loved loudly, or I just can’t hear it.

I wish I could hear you shout that you need me
The kind that shakes hearts
And blinks eyes
In the theatres of movies.
I wish I could hear you fight for me.
I wish you wanted to.

I should be asleep now
But the crack in the ceiling is getting longer.
Bifurcations interlocking
Threatening to crush me
On the bed that is mine alone.
And I hope the cat is comforting me, but I know he’s just hungry.

Or is this one of those “click and pray” situations that leave your inbox full of spam?

Let me be 100% honest: I snuck down this rabbit hole expecting broken promises and weird surveys. (Shocked Pikachu-face was READY.)

Wondering how apps become awesome BEFORE everyone else? BetaBound only lists legit beta tests—no endless surveys, no sketchy links. Wild story: I actually made $50 last month just checking out a travel feature!

• **UserTesting**  
Test websites, features, and sometimes even unreleased apps—video walk-through style. PayPal payouts, and some tests are… get this… $60 for twenty minutes of work. Learn more or sign up through their feature page here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

• **PlaytestingCloud**  
For gamers who *also* want $$$—this app pays you to test mobile games before they go public. Sometimes they even invite you to exclusive test sessions with bonuses! Check their eligibility via **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

• **Lookback**  
Install pre-release features, record or type your opinions, and get paid for being brutally honest. Easy setup. One friend made $180 in a month JUST by complaining about UX flow!

• **Test IO**  
They literally give you points and payouts for finding bugs. You’re a bug bounty hunter. No coding needed, just normal feature-testing, and payouts are REAL. Still skeptical? Read reviews at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

I started thinking these were flaky, BUT honestly? These apps are pushing out features FASTER and they need us testers WAY more than we need them.

Spoiler: No, you’re not going to get rich. But YES, this is all-new side hustle money for things you ALREADY do—tapping, scrolling, and casually judging random app updates.

Totally nuts, right?

# Receiving the MOVA V50 Ultra: 

I received the V50 Ultra in a fairly nondescript cardboard box, sealed with MOVA-branded tape. Inside was the main retail box, also covered in MOVA logos. It’s on the heavier side, so handle with care—I found it a bit awkward to lift, even with the cut-out handles, as the box is quite wide. Sliding the main box out of the outer protective box took a bit of effort.

[A photo of the MOVA V50 Ultra's main box](https://preview.redd.it/suyrslcv85if1.png?width=4284&format=png&auto=webp&s=038586383a6a0eec69f580eafb48d119b0f70ede)

On the box, MOVA proudly lists all the bells and whistles:

* **DuoSolution tank**: You can add a pet odor-neutralizing solution to tackle that dreaded pet funk, along with a general floor detergent in a separate, larger tank. The detergent mixes with water as it fills the robot’s internal tank for regular mopping, while the deodorizing solution is used specifically to clean the mops.
* **StepMaster climbing**: can clear small steps up to 6cm total—specifically, 4.2cm followed by 1.8cm.
* **24,000Pa suction**: a wildly high number that beats the Dreame X50 on paper, putting it on par with even some cordless vacuum cleaners.
* **JetSpray DryBoard**: uses 20 high-pressure jets to clean the mops and washboard.
* **Edge cleaning**: side brush and mop can extend to reach corners and along walls.
* **FlexiPress mop**: tilts up to 5° for more even pressure on uneven floors, spins at up to 260 RPM with 8N of pressure.
* **80°C (176°F) mop washing**: hot water mop rinse to lift grease from the mops.
* **OmniDry system**: dries the mops in as little as an hour, .and fully dries the dustbin and dustbag in about three

But as you might already know, **I don’t care much for spec sheets alone**. I care about what actually adds value to autonomy or cleaning performance in the real world. So here are my surface-level first impressions—and a closer look at whether these features actually live up to the claims. 

**Unpacking it:**

The packaging was solid and well-protected. Aside from some minor dents and cosmetic scuffs on the plain outer box (doing its job, really), everything inside arrived intact. The double-boxed design used thick, durable cardboard throughout. No complaints there—though I do wish the unboxing experience felt a bit more premium or luxurious for a flagship device.

[The accessory kit is packed inside the main box and is the first thing you see when opening the box](https://preview.redd.it/9gnpp29795if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bab79a92551eb02606185ce5961203f94a1b0cbc)

Right at the top of the main box is the oversized accessory kit—and it’s *stacked*. You get:

* **Twelve extra mops** (enough for six replacements)
* **1L of MOVA floor detergent** (the detergent tank holds up to 400mL, so this covers over two full refills)
* **200mL pet odor-neutralizing solution** (exactly one full fill of the B tank)
* **Three spare dust bags**
* **Three extra filters** (rated for 450 vacuuming hours total)
* **Two side brush replacements** (designed for easy swapping every 200 hours with a screwdriver)
* **A spare pair of double anti-tangle main brushes** (rated for 300 vacuuming hours; note: replacing them takes a surprising amount of force to pull out and snap back in, with careful alignment of the hexagonal rods and brush holes)

[Look at all the accessories!](https://preview.redd.it/infdrbys95if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21979f38d4d280cae296152779eae2d0be2264e0)

Frankly, this is one of the most generous accessory kits I’ve seen bundled with any robot vacuum—especially in this price range. Most brands don’t even include a single bottle of detergent, even after charging this much. 

[From top to bottom, the base station's power cable bundled up, the two FlexiPress mop pad holders with mop pads attached, and the base station's removable ramp](https://preview.redd.it/321r2cr7k5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02533e82cfbcb377e96123e98af3a32f15afa973)

Beneath the accessory kit is a smaller side box on the left, containing the dock’s detachable ramp (handy for cleaning), the power cable, and the robot’s mop pads pre-attached to the magnetic FlexiPress holders. Once that’s out of the way, you’ll see the main robot box with a sturdy built-in plastic handle for easy lifting. Under that, the dock itself is neatly packed inside a protective plastic. 



**Build quality:** 

[The MOVA V50 Ultra is in its base station on the left of my old robot vacuum in its dock. The MOVA's base station is noticeably shorter.](https://preview.redd.it/f88vnh2gk5if1.jpg?width=5160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a16bdebf3c7157998f1eb5c81c3432b375e21a0a)

The MOVA V50 Ultra Complete and its base station feel impressively well-built. While mostly plastic, the construction is sturdy and durable. The magnetic top cover snaps on securely—no issues with weak magnets or misalignment. The brushes also feel solid and well-made. I’m not a fan of the glossy plastic finish, though; it’s a magnet for fingerprints and, unsurprisingly, fur. The dustbin is made from hard plastic and took a hit when I accidentally dropped it, leaving a scuffed white mark. So yes, it’s tough, but not invincible.



**Setting up the robot:**

To test ease of use, I handed the setup over to the most technologically challenged family member—and they had no trouble. Pairing the robot was simple, and mapping was surprisingly quick. Impressively, the robot managed to escape my shower’s 3cm threshold using its secondary wheels, part of MOVA’s so-called StepMaster system. Older robots would have gotten stuck in there during mapping. I actually expected to configure this manually in the app, but the robot automatically recognized the threshold as passable and added it to the map. Nice.

It also recognized that my kitchen cabinets had just enough clearance for it to duck under by retracting its LIDAR, and marked the area as low-clearance. That said, it struggled with the diagonal section of my kitchen counter, which I had to manually fix. It also mislabeled my bedroom as a kitchen and didn’t quite get the orientation of the wooden floorboards right—but otherwise, room partitioning and labeling were fairly accurate.

My family member noted a bit of a learning curve when customizing room partitions, but once they figured it out, setup was smooth. I do wish there were an option to label a space as an “entryway” in the rooms you can choose from, but fortunately, you can rename any room however you like.

As for ultrasonic carpet detection, it correctly identified the office rug and most of the carpet under the coffee table, though the detection was patchy and required me to manually define that area. If you have fully carpeted rooms, you can mark them as such—but it takes a bit of digging through the settings.

[The DuoSolution Tank and the pet odor solution is pictured together with the B tank made to be filled with the pet odor solution](https://preview.redd.it/qkxsswe8c5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f2ecfb097b13b8eb83ec26e376f05ce03e408bc)

After filling the DuoSolution tank with both the general detergent and the pet odor-neutralizing solution, and topping up the clean water tank, it was time to let the robot earn its keep. I didn’t actually have high hopes—so I ran my old robot a day prior to vacuum and mop first, just in case.

I then ran the V50 Ultra in CleanGenius vacuum mode, followed by deep cleaning mop mode. I wanted to see if it was a CleanGenius… or a CleanDummy.

To my surprise, the kitchen—normally coated in a fine layer of grease that required two passes from my old robot—was squeaky clean in just one. The wooden floors were also noticeably softer and smoother to walk on after just a single pass.

When I pulled out the dirty water tank, the results were obvious: not only was the water noticeably darker than what my old robot usually picked up, but there was a visible layer of grease floating on top. The tank was greasy enough that I had to wash it with a sponge and dish soap—suggesting the hot water mop washing was *actually doing its job* and lifting grease off the mops effectively.

I attribute this improved mopping performance to a few things. 

* **More pressure for a deeper scrub**: the V50 Ultra mops with 8N of downward pressure, which really helps on hard floors. 
* **The mops hug the floor better**: The FlexiPress system also keeps mop pressure more evenly applied across uneven surfaces, thanks to its ability to tilt up to 5 degrees and adjust vertically by a few millimeters—something my old robot always struggled with. 
* **Automatic detergent mixing**: The robot also automatically mixes detergent with water before mopping, so it’s not just wiping with plain water. 
* **Faster mop spinning**: the mops can spin up to 260rpm, and when I ran it in CleanGenius deep clean mode, the mopping was noticeably louder, suggesting it was spinning faster than the regular 180rpm. 
* **Better synergy**: I suspect the improved vacuuming internals are helping remove more invisible dust, which gives the mops a clearer path to scrub deeper grime.

I do wish the CleanGenius icon gave more insight into what it’s doing, other than just vaguely telling me “CleanGenius is cleaning.”

[The MOVA V50 Ultra cleaning under my kitchen cabinets with its LIDAR tower retracted](https://preview.redd.it/znnvsg1ub5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df3c3f14b148da5f08a461d166e293501f982cb8)

For under-the-counter cleaning in the kitchen, the robot lowered its lidar and hugged the edges appropriately. Good bot. I’ve heard some other V50 Ultras get less efficient when their lidar retracts, but I haven’t seen that myself. I’d need a giant balsa wood obstacle course to test that properly.

[The fur in the dustbin is compressed to one end of the dustbin so it can collect as much fur as possible](https://preview.redd.it/c0w6kulpi5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=657daaaef5dd697f09cec71ce2e289fc5668ad75)

The dustbin tells the whole story. Compared to my old robot, fur was visibly compressed, making far better use of the bin space—credit to MOVA’s hair compression feature. The base station even blows air through the filter during the auto-empty cycle, clearing out the clingy dust bunnies that used to get stuck in the pleats. The result? I went from smacking the filter against the trash can every night to cleaning it maybe once every two weeks.

[No hair or fur was stuck around the axles of the omnidirectional wheel.](https://preview.redd.it/31v3fwa7j5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=641f69fc47f4683c7d66dfd1424a6147e43be86b)

[No fur was tangled on the dual TroboWave brushes, with fur clinging to the bristles](https://preview.redd.it/qummmixdj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df60ac2e947908e254cd0f0f4a3bb63f55fc8da7)

[Upon closer insepction, the only the brush with bristles has some fur with it but it is not tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/bejzg32jj5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b9eb4a5b5c899908b35b1f56cde99b3b658311)

[Only a few strands of fur remain in the brush compartment after the brushes are removed. ](https://preview.redd.it/1oi3zr7nj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e733e4557c82eac1b15497ee6bc0bf942052a482)

And the anti-tangle claims? Not just marketing. Even waist-length hair—longer than the advertised 11.8” (30 cm) limit—didn’t tangle in the TroboWave™ dual brushes, the side brush, or the omnidirectional wheel. It was also brilliant on carpets, where the dual-brush system agitated and lifted my dog’s fur far more effectively than my old single-brush bot ever managed.

My family, who all work from home, immediately noticed how quiet it was. While mopping at 180 rpm, it was nearly silent. During a vacuum run, I measured it at a conversation-friendly 55–60 dB—noticeable, but never disruptive.



# The Coffee Granule Test

To push beyond marketing specs, I simulated a tough mess using freeze-dried coffee—a mix of large granules and fine powder. I set the robot to CleanGenius mode with “large particle boost” enabled.

[The original spill of instant coffee powder](https://preview.redd.it/i7hc699xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb983bb958dea075e6373402e69c53295a80d3fe)

[After the second pass, no instant coffee was left behind](https://preview.redd.it/2ngzj89xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b11d3febede717b8b481c271148829ddb1cde60)

What followed was a masterclass in intelligent cleaning. The robot:

* Correctly identified the spill and its size, marked it on the app, and slowed its approach.
* Increased suction while reducing the side brush speed to gently sweep granules inward.
* Lifted the side brush entirely when crossing the main spill to prevent scattering.
* Made two slow, methodical passes in perpendicular directions, creating a grid-like pattern.

After the first pass, every large granule was gone. After the second, so was the fine coffee dust. A perfect pickup.

MOVA claims its pet odor neutralizing solution really works, so I put it to the test. I turned on high-frequency mode, which uses the solution every time it washes the mops, to tackle that classic “wet dog” smell after my pup’s adventures in the grass. After just one vacuum first and then mop cycle, the only place I could smell the dog was… well, on the dog himself. Floors? Fresh and odor-free. 



**AI Obstacle Avoidance**

I tested the robot in a chaotic environment littered with obstacles: charging cables on the floor, a camera tripod with legs low enough to ride up, chairs with just enough clearance to be a trap, and dog toys everywhere. My old robot would have been instantly stuck thanks to my dog, who loves to sploot right in the middle of the hallway. But the MOVA navigated everything without getting stuck once.

What impressed me most was watching its adaptive AI learn in real time. On day one, it clumsily tried to climb the tripod legs. By day two, it was more cautious, riding up on them only about half the time. On day three, it had figured it out completely and cleaned neatly along the legs without mounting them at all.



**OmniDry: Mop and Dustbin Drying**

MOVA also touts its OmniDry system, which uses warm air to dry the mops, the internal washboard, and even the dustbin and dustbag to prevent mildew and odors. MOVA doesn’t list an official drying temperature, but a similar feature on another premium robot by its parent Dreame uses 122°F (50°C) air.

Even at 86% humidity, the system dried the mops and washboard in just one hour on “Quick Dry.” To test the dustbin drying, I dampened some dog fur, put it in the dustbag, and ran a three-hour drying cycle — after which the fur felt completely dry.

Theoretically, this thorough drying should help stop mold and odor growth. It’s only been about 1,000 m² (\~10,000 ft²) of cleaning so far, so it’s too early to confirm long-term benefits, but the initial signs look very promising

**Self-Cleaning & Maintenance**

The base station does a solid job cutting down on daily chores, though it’s not completely hands-off. The auto-empty cycle is strong enough to clear fine dust from the filter’s pleats, but I did notice a few strands of my dog’s fur stubbornly clinging to the filter’s rubber seal.

[The JetSpray Dryboard, as pictured, was able to keep itself rather clean with oly a few stray strands of fur remaining on the mop washboard and no visible grime stuck to any nooks and crannies. ](https://preview.redd.it/ylldb4lhe5if1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a820016e8e1e640db55f04426f3fbb79d6867a)

The mop washing system is a huge step up from my old robot, whose washboard was always a magnet for fur and grime. After about 1,000 m² of cleaning, the MOVA’s washboard stayed impressively clean, with all the debris collected neatly in a removable, palm-sized drainage filter that’s easy to rinse under the tap.

[Despite keeping the mop washboard relatively clean, fine dust and dirt builds up under the drainage filter over time as shown here.](https://preview.redd.it/e3sabf7yc5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af7e4220d12f800e7fb91d0069acf2ca2b61e347)

That said, a fine layer of sludge does build up over time in the tray beneath the filter. Since the washboard assembly itself isn’t removable, you have to get down on your hands and knees to clean that part manually. I wish the robot either cleaned this area automatically or had a removable tray for easier maintenance.

All up, this makes a night-and-day difference in my daily routine.

With my old robot, my daily maintenance checklist looked like this:

* Tapping dust out of the filter
* Picking trapped fur off the washboard
* Rescuing it from cables that it tried to chew or the tripod it kept trying to climb

Now, with the MOVA, my main tasks are simply refilling the clean water tank and emptying the dirty one. The robot and base station stay so much cleaner that a proper hands-on clean is only needed every few weeks—definitely not every single day.

**Battery Life & Charging**

To gauge real-world battery efficiency, I ran the robot on customized cleaning cycles with consistent settings.

The results weren’t quite as impressive as I’d hoped they'd be, as it has a battery capacity of 6400mAh. On a standard vacuuming run, it cleaned just under 1 m² (\~10.5 ft²) per 1% of battery used. When mopping, efficiency more than doubled, covering over 2 m² (\~22.3 ft²) per percentage point consumed.

In practice, after a full CleanGenius vacuum cycle followed by a mop run over my entire home, the robot typically consumes about 60% of its battery per cleaning session. In contrast, my old robot, with a smaller 5200 mAh battery, used around 40% for the same vacuum-then-mop routine.

For larger homes of around 100 m² (\~1,075 ft²) or more, the “resume cleaning” feature is necessary, letting the robot return to its base to recharge before it resumes cleaning.

Charging speeds are solid as well: it charges rapidly at roughly 1% per minute until hitting 20%, then slows to about 0.5% per minute to preserve battery health over time. You can also protect the battery's long-term health by setting a charge limit in the app, with options for 80%, 90%, or a full 100%.



# Pros & Cons

**Pros:** Very quiet, great with handling a lot of fur and hair, mops quite well and quietly, hot mop washing effectively lifts grease from the mops, pretty hands off, a smaller and more squat base station compared to some others, the customization for your robot is plentiful, the charging limit is a step forward in ensuring the longetivity of your robot’s battery, charges pretty quick

**Cons:** not a fan of the glossy white plastic used as it’s a fingerprint magnet, you’d still need to manually clean the dirt and dust that builds up at the mop washboard’s drainage area, there is no way to manually customize how fast the mop spins as the mops only speed up on CleanGenius deep cleaning mode or when stain detection is turned on, slightly smaller water tanks of a 1 gallon clean water tank and a 0.9 dirty water tank compared to similarly priced options on the market (this is a tradeoff if you prefer a smaller base station) do mean more frequently refilling, the app’s near unlimited customization makes the UI a bit cluttered and requires a learning curve for those not as tech snazzy, the battery life is actually strangely short. 



# TLDR:

**Get it if:**

* You want a robot that’ll reliably dodge cables and other things that could trip up dumb bots, so you won’t need to rescue it all the time. 
* You have a pet that sheds a lot and/or stinks a lot, making the floors stinky despite your best attempts to coax it into having a bath. 
* Your home has long hair that you and other family members are shedding. 
* You want a quiet robot that happily zips around 
* Your home has more hard floors than carpet. 
* You have thresholds in your home, like sliding door frames, and thresholds in different rooms, like the bathroom or the kitchen. 

**Don’t get it if:**

* Your home is mostly carpet (vacuuming only robots are better suited)
* You want a robot that can be later plumbed into your laundry water lines. 
* You want it to clean under places with a clearance of 8.9cm or lower. 
* You want MO from Wall-E to say foreign contaminant every time it starts cleaning.  
* A totally hands-free robot vacuum that requires absolutely no maintenance (unless you were smart enough to tell your future self that to deliver one to you with a Time Machine)



I'm happy to answer any questions you have about this robot or my experience in the comments below! Stay tuned for my in-depth review in a few weeks, where I'll test its long-term autonomy to see how it truly holds up with minimal maintenance—just refilling and emptying the tanks!

I've been a partner since early this year.  And my colleagues are great.  Helpful / kind / fun.  And now that I've finally gotten a bit better at Bar (no where near as good / quick as several colleagues though) I'm getting to do bar more.  

And yday (saturday) was really busy.  I'd say for 2.5 hours when I was on Cafe Mobile Bar the stickers just wouldn't stop printing.  Maybe at most a 30 second break.  And it just hit me that this is fast food. (no shade as I love FF but I really don't want to work FF)

It  just felt like a factory to me.  And with all the ""welcome in"" and ""have a nice day"" mixed in it just sort of made me feel like a robot.  there's not much meaningful connection because there isn't time.  It's all sort of -- check off a box connection.

I went to an independent coffee shop the other day (something I rarely ever do) and I immediately noticed the difference.  Much more relaxed pace.  customers / employees seemed much happier.  Just very chill.  People weren't rushing to and fro.  They were talking and connecting and just enjoying each other's company.

I guess bottom line SBUX is what it is.  And they've made tons of money doing that.  But I don't think it's for me.  I don't wish to work at a factory.

So, I have a friend whose chronic depression and anxiety has gotten worse over the last few years due to moving to more expensive area (thus needing to work/be on call for multiple jobs), living with a partner who is not doing their share with household tasks or emotionally and, you know, everything that's going on with the world. What I'm worried about is that they are taking on more and more tasks for themself that are not supporting their wellbeing (more jobs, more household tasks, more tasks/support for their family etc etc) and leaving out even the smallest of habits and joys that are good for them.

I've noticed that more and more they are bringing up how they ""just can't"" X. They can't postpone working on a project *that actually doesn't have a deadline*, they can't see friends for more than quick a coffee, because they are tired, they can't take the vitamins that help with their health problem... now many of their ""cant's"" have gotten to a ridiculous extend: I have rules on how I can text them because they ""can't handle"" some types of messages (they have to be able to have a preview of the texts without 'reading' it), they can't come closer (think one subway stop) to me while we are meeting for a walk because it's they ""wrong way"" for their rest of their daily activitities, so they'd rather stay in an un-pleasent spot to wait for me for 20 minutes than take the next stop and meet me there (there would be plenty of time to walk back to the previous stop, only the direction is wrong). Recently they told me that they (avid reader) can't read anymore, because they feel that it's *demanded of them to ""enjoy life""*.   
  
Many of these I can understand to some extend, but these little things keep piling up and restricting their normal daily life and affecting their friendships negatively. And at the same time they are taking on more and more responsibilities that for me actually seem like are too much for a normal person to handle.   
  
So, my question is: how can I respectfully, but firmly question my friends thoughts when they are in the headspace that they **have to do** everything they are taking on and they **can't do** more and more things that could bring them joy, because they can't handle the short-lived uncomfortable feelings? I feel like they truly believe that they have to do all this extra work that drains them to have a fulfilling life while leaving out anything ""extra"" that would actually bring them joy. But I think them speaking about so much of their life through ""I just can't"" and ""I just have to"" is actually keeping them in this loop of despair, depression and constant anxiety.",1,1754813861.0,depression,1,0.67,False

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.

Simon suddenly pulled out a dazzling moonstone necklace. ""I bought the necklace you fancied at the auction last time. After the surgery, I'll put it on for you!""

They were all so focused on Laila that none of them remembered that I was also about to undergo surgery.

I thought I was used to being neglected. But as I neared the end of my life, the sight before me still broke my heart.

I couldn't help but blurt my thoughts, ""Would you be sad if I died during surgery?""

Mom and Dad were stunned. As if they only recalled my existence now, diffidence flickered across their faces.

But once Mom heard what I said, she snapped, ""What nonsense are you talking about? It's just a simple kidney transplant surgery. Stop jinxing yourself!""

Dad also shot me a disapproving glance. ""Don't say that! How could you curse yourself like that? Get sufficient rest after the surgery, and you'll recover in no time. After all, you're much stronger than Laila.""

""I'll cook you a seafood feast after the surgery's over. You love seafood, don't you?""

Gazing at me affectionately, Simon held my hand and said, ""Don't worry. I hired the best healer to perform the surgery. You'll definitely be fine. Once it's over, I'll buy whatever you want for you.""

Bile rose in my throat. He bought Laila's favorite necklace in advance, yet when it came to me, he'd only make such empty promises.

I bet he'd be delighted after I was gone. He could finally be with Laila.

My gaze lingered on Mom, Dad, and Simon before I entered the operating room.

When the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my skin, the last shred of healing ability I had was completely destroyed. The wolfsbane gnawed at my bones and tore my soul apart.

I stopped breathing entirely as I reached the end of my life.

The moment before I took my final breath, I wondered if Dad would weep for me if he found out I was the one who donated my kidney to him five years ago, and it was Laila who took the credit. Would he feel bad for me, who was always on the receiving end of Laila's slandering and bullying?

Would Mom and Dad ever regret looking down on me?

It didn't matter. Even if they would, I wouldn't be around to see it.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina—the one who’d supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien’s gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us—""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It’s just a temporary mark. It won’t affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina’s scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark—its scent—replaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me—""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit—things only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I’d met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I’d never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe—""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget—an Alpha’s hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn’t heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn’t press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain—""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't—""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the silence settle.

Then, I spoke the words into the empty room, each one a final, liberating vow.

""I, Isla, reject you, Damien.""

He was already gone.

I waited until morning.

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city—the pack, my past, him—shrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

Dressed in his finest robes, waiting for his bride.
