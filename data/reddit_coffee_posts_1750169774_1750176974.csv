1ldrabs,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1ldrabs/what_promo_got_you_into_betting/,What promo got you into betting?,"For me it was that classic ‚Äúbet five bucks, win a hundred and fifty if any team scores a touchdown‚Äù thing. I saw it during NFL kickoff weekend a few years back and figured why not. Tossed the bet on a random game, didn‚Äôt even care who won. First quarter TD hit and boom, just like that, I was hooked. Not because of the money, really. It was the rush. Felt like I cracked some code.  
  
From there it spiraled quick. Started building parlays I had no business building, sweating out NBA games I didn‚Äôt even watch, and checking lines way more than I checked emails. I chased a few more promos after that, some hit, most didn‚Äôt. But that first one? It was like betting with cheat codes.  
  
Eventually I stopped chasing the promo carousel and started betting the way I actually enjoy. Been tossing bets lately and it just feels right. Nothing extra, just betting how I like to bet.  
  
Kinda wild how something that started with a promo turned into part of the weekly routine. Sundays now are coffee, RedZone, and a couple bets that actually make sense. Curious what pulled everyone else into the game.",2,1750176774.0,sportsbook,0,1.0,False

""Natalie, let's get a divorce,"" Craig Lambert said in a flat voice.

Natalie Hudson, who had planned to surprise him with her pregnancy, was stunned.

""It's been four years; it's time for us to end this,"" he continued, his face blank and voice devoid of emotion.

Natalie decided to keep her pregnancy a secret.

She knew this day would come.

Craig had never loved her. And they got married just to please his grandmother.

""This is the divorce agreement. Sign it. You'll get 16 million dollars.""

Craig handed her a stack of documents as he spoke, deadpan.

For Craig, their marriage had always been a business deal.

Hand resting gently on her belly, Natalie‚Äôs voice trembled. ""Suppose we were expecting a baby.‚Äù she asked, ‚Äú would you still want a divorce?""

Craig's eyes shifted to her belly, and he frowned. ""You mean last month? Didn't I tell you to take the morning-after pill?""

He‚Äôd come to her room late one night last month--their only intimacy in four years of marriage.

Natalie's hand shot away from her belly as if she'd touched a hot pan.

Craig grabbed her wrist, snapping, ""Are you pregnant?""

Her breath quickened. ""I said suppose. Would you want it?""

""No."" His refusal was curt yet firm. He believed that bringing a child into a loveless relationship was meaningless.

He‚Äôd learned that from his parents' marriage.

As his hand left hers, her heart sank.

She watched him walk away, tilting her head back to hold back her tears. His words stung her.

Only then did she realize that she could never thaw a heart so cold.

Her hand back on her belly, she felt the tiny life within and swallowed her bitterness. ""Baby, Daddy doesn't want you, but I'll protect you.""

Natalie had been an orphan since childhood. After her adoptive parents had twins, she was sent to live with her cousin. Fortunately, she treated Natalie well.

Divorce loomed, but Natalie wouldn't be alone, for she had the baby.

Without checking the divorce agreement, she signed her name to the final page.

\*\*\*

In the morning, a call from Dora Huffman, Craig's mother, informed Natalie. Her tone was as haughty as ever.

""Natalie, have the maid prepare the second-floor guest room. We'll have a guest staying for a few days."" She hung up before Natalie could inquire further.

Natalie was used to such treatment.

When Natalie went downstairs, Craig had already left for work.

In the afternoon, a young woman in designer clothes swept into the hallway.

""Are you the housekeeper?"" the woman asked, removing her sunglasses. She looked pretty.

Natalie, startled, wondered if this was Dora‚Äôs guest.

Before the divorce, this would have upset her. But now, ten women wouldn't faze her.

Natalie moved closer and began, ""What can I do for‚Äî""

But the woman ignored her and began walking around the hall.

Then she called out to the butler, ""Geez, these curtains are hideous. Get rid of them, along with these decorations. The sofa is terrible, and all the beds must go. I want them replaced with the brand I like.""

Natalie frowned. ""Who are you? The villa stays the way it is.""

The woman replied, chin lifted. ""Let me introduce myself. I'm Tiffany Werner. I'll soon be the mistress of this house, so the d√©cor is up to me.""

Natalie wasn't surprised to hear the name.

She just lowered her head, thinking, ""No wonder Craig wanted a divorce. Tiffany is back.""

Craig‚Äôs first love returned, leaving Natalie, the substitute, to depart.

A taunting smirk came to Tiffany's lips. ""I see. You've heard of me. Sign the divorce papers and get out of my house.""

Natalie frowned. ""Your house? If you wanted the title, you should've married Craig when he was in a coma after the car accident.""

Back then, his grandmother Ruth Lambert had sought a wife for him, but no woman would marry a man in a vegetative state.

Tiffany stiffened for a moment. ""My family forbade it. Seven brothers were all against it. Listen, my brothers are all powerful. If you steal Craig from me, your family will pay the price.""

Natalie's expression hardened. ""Lay a hand on them, and you're toast.""

""Sign the divorce papers to keep family safe,"" Tiffany smiled when she saw the agreement on the coffee table.

She‚Äôd waited three years for this day.

Natalie calmly replied, ""It‚Äôs already done.""

Tiffany took out a check from her designer handbag. ""Here's 160 thousand dollars, a small gift from me.

""Take it and leave us alone. Poor girl, you are not from our world.""

Natalie closed her eyes, taking a deep breath to steady herself. She then retreated to the master bedroom. She had decided to leave before Tiffany came.

The divorce made her staying pointless.

Just then, Tiffany stormed in and threw a pregnancy test on the floor.

""Is this yours?"" Tiffany huffed.",1,1750176716.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm thinking of gifting her a set of **three attars**‚Äîperhaps one warm and cozy (like *Soft*), one gourmand (like *Choco Musk* or something coffee-based), and one elegant or unique (maybe *Dalal* or *Spiced Vanilla*).

1ldr6zr,https://i.redd.it/2zldrvxghi7f1.png,Blur Perfumes reviews,"Got 5 of them in blind buys and guys, another indian brand that's taken my money for no good purpose.


Packaging; Printed cardboard that is nice to look at, if it didn't come squished and torn in transit. Very pinterest and armaf inspired but the quality is missing. The bottles look cute online but IRL the glass is not super clear so looks
messy and the caps are nice but have no weight and were scratched up when they arrived. Good attempt but at this price point the consumers deserve much better. The rings came seperate and they can be put around the neck of bottle and will likely come off in bags. Quality of those is decent they look like they're from diy charm kits.


Delivery; took 10 days to deliver.

Perfumes; got 5:

Cherry tart - dupe of Alhambra cherry - which is a dupe of TF cherry smoke.This is a linear cherry with no other nuance, just plain cherry cough syrup scent. It's not sour or tart just basic cough syrup like.

Vanilla Melts - Idk. This smells like nothing to me. Like plastic bread wrapping. No vanilla or sweet or gourmand or such notes. Just very basic perfumy slightly vanilla like vanilla. lykwim.


Peach Sorbet - Bitter peach / Bright peach dupe. It's a peachy fruity scent, but it's nothing different or fresh. The peach is overly ripe and smells chemically and just a bit too strong / alcoholic.


Coffee Cake and Cookie Crumble - clubbing these cuz while CC1 smells like bitter coffee chicorie with no other notes no lactonic or sweetness or gourmand vibe, the crumble crumbled just as badly. It is like wet bread that's got no cookie, vanilla essence or sweet notes, it's like stale bread.


Performance - Icing on the cake. I sprayed twice on my wrists and after about 15 mins couldn't smell any of them. Just smelled something that should have been perfume. No projection, no trail so total dud.


Overall, packaging is 3/5, scents are 1/5 and performance is 0/5. Seems like vogue and all were paid to create this, and it's perfect gift for frenemy - give something also that she has to like and appreciate , but make it ineffective.",1,1750176558.0,desifemfrag,1,1.0,False

My Queen

 If you‚Äôre in bed and you look to your right and the man you love is no longer there, just a window this letter is for you my Queen!


There are moments in life when words feel too small for the depth of what‚Äôs in our hearts. Today I‚Äôll try, because you deserve to hear it, feel it, and know it with every part of you:

My god I‚Äôm so in love with you.
Not just in passing, not just in habit, not just in word, but in a way that fills every corner of my soul. If love is a language, then you are every word I‚Äôve ever wanted to learn, every phrase I‚Äôve ever needed to speak fluently.  There were times when I spoke your language effortlessly, your back arched on suspense!

Two years ago, something rare and sacred happened: we found each other. And I truly believe we were always meant to, just not before we were ready. ‚ÄúWe are not the same people we were then,‚Äù as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote. ‚ÄúWe are stronger, better, and more able to choose love, again.‚Äù

You once told me that my words and my actions didn‚Äôt align and you were right. I see that now, and I am deeply sorry for the ways I let my own wounds, assumptions, and silence speak louder than the truth of my heart. I should have lifted you up, cherished you like the queen you are. I should have gotten up early just to make you coffee, washed your car without asking, loved you not just aloud, but actively. Beautiful love lives in the little things, and I failed to see how powerful those small acts really were to my Queen!

You are so fiercely independent, yet you desperately yearn to be held and touched softly!  You are so brilliantly resilient, yet you‚Äôre as fragile as glass forged from fire! None of those things should have stopped me from doing what I could to lighten your load without being asked. You shouldn‚Äôt have had to ask nor tell me. I should have just known. I thought saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù all the time was enough, because I never wanted to leave this world without you knowing. But now I realize that words, when not backed by presence, can become echoes instead of anchors.

You filled my life with colors I thought only existed in movies and I used to not believe in real life love stories, until you walked into ours.
‚ÄúYou and I, it‚Äôs as though we have been taught to kiss in heaven and sent down to Earth together,‚Äù Rumi said. ‚ÄúTo see if we know what we were taught.‚Äù
I may have forgot the lessons for a minute. But I promise you, I‚Äôm remembering now.

We both carry scars from our pasts, and no child escapes life unscathed. I wish we had shown more grace to each other‚Äôs wounds, more patience to each other‚Äôs silence, more understanding to each other‚Äôs fears. I‚Äôve come to see that healing isn‚Äôt a solo act‚Äîit‚Äôs something love makes possible, together.

I now understand what true love and partnership means:
	‚Ä¢	Listening without trying to fix.
	‚Ä¢	Asking instead of assuming.
	‚Ä¢	Protecting each other‚Äôs peace.
	‚Ä¢	Creating a soft place to land.
	‚Ä¢	Validating feelings without defense.
	‚Ä¢	Respecting triggers, not dismissing them.
	‚Ä¢	Encouraging growth, not fearing it.

We came into this love from long journeys, both of us having known a version of love before, But this!  What we have, is something else entirely. It‚Äôs love not just built on a foundation, chemistry or comfort, but on conscious choice.

If I had handled things differently, maybe we‚Äôd already be engaged, but what I know now is that we still have a chance to write the rest of this story, better, stronger, and more beautifully than before.

We both know I don‚Äôt deserve to ask, this one question and your answer will be taken with the full weight as you give it!  Either way!  Afford me this one last chance, my love, my Queen?
To show you that the man I am today, the one who has sat in silence and frustration with his therapist, wrestled with his ego and his demons!  Has finally stopped trying to fix, what he didn‚Äôt understand.  Is the man who can finally see the one true you. The man who has grown into the one you always deserved.

Let‚Äôs learn from the past, but live only in the present. Let‚Äôs create a future that is so beautiful, it makes the pain we have endured worthwhile. I believe in us, in you, in the love we share, the pull we have, the destiny that awaits us and in what is supposed to be will always be!

‚ÄúI have waited for this opportunity for more than half my life,‚Äù said Maya Angelou, ‚Äúto be able to tell you how much I love you.‚Äù
I love you more deeply than words can carry and I promise you this, I will spend every day for the rest of my life!  Proving to you that the love I have for you will never fade or flatten in the face of time!

This lifetime, and whatever comes next, I choose you my Queen!

Two years ago, something rare and sacred happened: we found each other. And I truly believe we were always meant to, just not before we were ready. ‚ÄúWe are not the same people we were then,‚Äù as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote. ‚ÄúWe are stronger, better, and more able to choose love, again.‚Äù

You once told me that my words and my actions didn‚Äôt align and you were right. I see that now, and I am deeply sorry for the ways I let my own wounds, assumptions, and silence speak louder than the truth of my heart. I should have lifted you up, cherished you like the queen you are. I should have gotten up early just to make you coffee, washed your car without asking, loved you not just aloud, but actively. Beautiful love lives in the little things, and I failed to see how powerful those small acts really were to my Queen!

You are so fiercely independent, yet you desperately yearn to be held and touched softly!  You are so brilliantly resilient, yet you‚Äôre as fragile as glass forged from fire! None of those things should have stopped me from doing what I could to lighten your load without being asked. You shouldn‚Äôt have had to ask nor tell me. I should have just known. I thought saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù all the time was enough, because I never wanted to leave this world without you knowing. But now I realize that words, when not backed by presence, can become echoes instead of anchors.

You filled my life with colors I thought only existed in movies and I used to not believe in real life love stories, until you walked into ours.
‚ÄúYou and I, it‚Äôs as though we have been taught to kiss in heaven and sent down to Earth together,‚Äù Rumi said. ‚ÄúTo see if we know what we were taught.‚Äù
I may have forgot the lessons for a minute. But I promise you, I‚Äôm remembering now.

We both carry scars from our pasts, and no child escapes life unscathed. I wish we had shown more grace to each other‚Äôs wounds, more patience to each other‚Äôs silence, more understanding to each other‚Äôs fears. I‚Äôve come to see that healing isn‚Äôt a solo act‚Äîit‚Äôs something love makes possible, together.

I now understand what true love and partnership means:
	‚Ä¢	Listening without trying to fix.
	‚Ä¢	Asking instead of assuming.
	‚Ä¢	Protecting each other‚Äôs peace.
	‚Ä¢	Creating a soft place to land.
	‚Ä¢	Validating feelings without defense.
	‚Ä¢	Respecting triggers, not dismissing them.
	‚Ä¢	Encouraging growth, not fearing it.

We came into this love from long journeys, both of us having known a version of love before, But this!  What we have, is something else entirely. It‚Äôs love not just built on a foundation, chemistry or comfort, but on conscious choice.

If I had handled things differently, maybe we‚Äôd already be engaged, but what I know now is that we still have a chance to write the rest of this story, better, stronger, and more beautifully than before.

We both know I don‚Äôt deserve to ask, this one question and your answer will be taken with the full weight as you give it!  Either way!  Afford me this one last chance, my love, my Queen?
To show you that the man I am today, the one who has sat in silence and frustration with his therapist, wrestled with his ego and his demons!  Has finally stopped trying to fix, what he didn‚Äôt understand.  Is the man who can finally see the one true you. The man who has grown into the one you always deserved.

Let‚Äôs learn from the past, but live only in the present. Let‚Äôs create a future that is so beautiful, it makes the pain we have endured worthwhile. I believe in us, in you, in the love we share, the pull we have, the destiny that awaits us and in what is supposed to be will always be!

‚ÄúI have waited for this opportunity for more than half my life,‚Äù said Maya Angelou, ‚Äúto be able to tell you how much I love you.‚Äù
I love you more deeply than words can carry and I promise you this, I will spend every day for the rest of my life!  Proving to you that the love I have for you will never fade or flatten in the face of time!

This lifetime, and whatever comes next, I choose you my Queen!

1ldr0ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ldr0ec/in_praise_of_cardinal_scents/,In Praise of Cardinal Scents,"I ordered the EDP Sample Trio from Cardinal Scents, requesting **Doll Face**, **Sugar Haze** and **a surprise scent. Doll Face** was not available in an EDP at the time so I was sent the oil. The surprise/EDP replacements I was sent were **Witch Hat** and **Girl Crush**. I was also sent **Rose Baby** and **Pop Astrology** as extras which was incredibly generous!!!



**NOTE: I have only done skin tests of Sugar Haze and Witch Hat*****.***¬†



**Doll Face**

**sparkling bergamot, gummy peach rings, red raspberries, sugar cookies**

I requested this in my EDP trio, but it‚Äôs not available as an EDP yet so I was sent the oil version. Gummy peach rings are one of my favorite candies so I very excited to try this. It‚Äôs definitely a sparkly scent thanks to the bergamot and peach rings notes, but the sugar cookie note helps to ground it and create a creaminess to the overall fragrance. The raspberry note is definitely the most subtle but is a really lovely ‚Äúend‚Äù to the initial sniff. 4.5/5



**Sugar Haze**

**spun sugar, pink himalayan salt, sea amber, white musk**

The reason I made an order with Cardinal Scents. The idea of a salty spun sugar scent really fascinated me as I‚Äôm trying to find the perfect cotton candy/spun sugar fragrance. Started off as a really lovely skin scent. The salt is definitely the most prominent note but the hint of sugar helps to avoid it smelling like the ocean or beach. Overtime it turned musky and almost sweaty smelling? I really wanted to like this :( 1/5



**Witch Hat**

**black plum, wormwood, caramel, patchouli**

This was a ‚Äúsurprise me‚Äù/extra scent and oh my god. This is the most amazing jammy juicy plum scent. The urge to gnaw on my wrist after spraying it is so strong. It‚Äôs deep and sexy but still fresh and juicy enough to wear in all weathers. Edible but not gourmand. Imagine the sexiest person eating a ripe plum and seeing the juice run down their chin. If I could kiss Haley Dee for including this in my package I would. 100/5¬†



**Girl Crush**

**hazelnut cappuccino, raspberry body spray, pear shampoo, warm skin musk**

I wouldn‚Äôt have picked this one for myself because while I love the smell of coffee, it‚Äôs not necessarily something I want to smell like. To me it‚Äôs a very coffee and musk forward scent. The raspberry body spray and pear shampoo are definitely present, but more secondary notes. The ‚Äúclean‚Äù smell definitely helps to make the cappuccino note more wearable for my taste. Another edible note without being gourmand. Unsure if this is something I‚Äôd actively wear but I‚Äôm planning on doing a wear test and seeing how I like it over time! 4/5



**Rose Baby**

**candied rose petals, raspberry jam, marshmallow cream, sandalwood**

Another scent I wouldn‚Äôt have picked for myself as I‚Äôm not a fan of rose notes. HOWEVER, if I were to wear a rose scent, it would be this. It smells more like a clean rose than a floral rose, I‚Äôm assuming this is from the raspberry. The marshmallow cream and sandalwood are delicious and take the forefront after the initial bit of rose petal. I‚Äôm interested to see how this performs on the skin and if the rose gives me a headache. 4/5



**Pop Astrology**

**nag champa incense, strawberry bubblegum, cream soda, white musk**

Again a scent I wouldn‚Äôt have picked for myself since nag champa tends to be a bit cloying for me and I‚Äôm usually 50/50 on musks. This is delicious though. The bubblegum and cream soda help to tone down the nag champa and it‚Äôs a really well blended fragrance. The musk isn‚Äôt musty at all and takes on more of a skin scent than anything else. 4/5



Cardinal Scents might be one of my favorite brands now. I already have a small list of new samples I want to buy when I order a full size of Witch Hat. If you haven‚Äôt sampled anything from Cardinal Scents I BEG you to try them!!!!",3,1750176141.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,0.8,False

Has this happened to anyone else?","It was a normal day, nothing special. I was exhausted, my mind was full of things, and my heart was half-dead. A colleague said, ""Let's go get coffee,"" and I was about to make up an excuse to go home. I didn't feel like talking or socializing. But for some reason‚Äîmaybe out of habit, maybe because I couldn't say no‚ÄîI said yes.

That decision, truly, changed everything.

In that coffee shop, without planning it, I ended up talking to someone at the next table. A casual conversation, with no expectations. But that person, over time, became someone who helped me see things I didn't want to see. She listened without judgment when I couldn't stand it anymore. She held me in silence when I didn't even understand what I was feeling.

It wasn't a love story, but it was a human connection that saved me from a version of myself that could no longer be sustained.

Fast forward to a few years ago when I got pregnant for the first time and the heartburn and chest pain returned with a vengeance. I was expecting it to stop after I delivered but it did not and I ended up with gastritis and it was recommended that I go on Prilosec for at least a year. During that year I got pregnant again and decided I wanted to get off Prilosec after I delivered my 2nd child to see if my symptoms went away as I did not want to be on that medication long term. They did not. It didn't matter what I ate or did not eat. Then, as I was looking into using probiotics for constipation, I came across scientific journal articles discussing probiotics for GERD. I've been taking them for a few weeks now and as long as I remember to take them, I have absolutely no heartburn or chest pain. I am so shocked that no provider has ever mentioned probiotics to me in all these years and there is research to back up that it works. They just kept telling me to take Prilosec. What the f***?

I still had coffee and tomatoes during that time. Thank you to the person that posted something similar about probiotics on this sudreddit a few years ago.

Fast forward to today and I forgot to get more coffee since I used more than expected yesterday. So I ran the beans I still had through the Mr Coffee and then 30 seconds through my blender. Then 13g with a pressurized basket and minimal tamping and it's amazing. YMMV but yay for not having to shell out a couple hundred for a fine grinder (yet)

I‚Äôm in love with this coffee. I was a humble express person on Mokapot and espresso but this one has knocked them all of out of the park. 

It smells sweet, with foamed milk, I lose my mind hahaha. 
Never bought half KG of anything but this I want to drink uninterrupted every day morning for at least 20 days. 
Recipe: 
17.5 grams in, 35 out, 28 seconds. (It just happens on my gaggia. Never had such an ideal shot everytime)

I got no wdt or fancy puck prep, just old school tapping and tamping. 

Imp note: I left the coffee away for 20 odd days. Tried it at 14 days from roast date it was acidic and puck was all over the place, suggest doing that.

I came up a question about littering law in Texas.

If a person pours out drinks like water, ice, or coffee on ground in the open area (on campus, sidewalk of street, small park, or parking lot,...,etc.), does it be included in the littering law in Texas and becomes illegal? It notes that the containers are not dumped.

I read the state law and I am not sure if water or liquids belong to ""litter"" in code. The definition of litter includes decayable waste, but I wonder if it includes those liquids. I also noticed some news say water and ice are fine when ""dropping from car"", but I am not sure about other acts.

Here is the news:

Chapter 1  
  
The day I got my marriage license with Reed Hawthorne, he told me:  
  
""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.  
  
""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want‚Äîexcept me.""  
  
I was obedient. I played the perfect Mrs. Hawthorne for three whole years.  
  
Three years later, his first love, Vivian Cross, suddenly appeared and handed me ten million dollars and told me to leave Reed.  
  
""Reed says you two are just victims of the previous generation's mess. Your marriage has always been in name only.  
  
""He wants to have a real family now, with a child born from someone he actually loves.  
  
""You've already held him back for three years. I hope you can let him go.""  
  
So he had someone he liked now!  
  
It really wasn't right for me to keep occupying the position of Mrs. Hawthorne anymore.  
  
That night, I went to find Reed in his study.  
  
""Back then you said I could have whatever I wanted. Does that still count?""  
  
Reed put down the documents in his hands, his slender fingers removing the glasses from his nose.  
  
His eyes flickered, a smile playing at his lips.  
  
""Of course.  
  
""What do you want?""  
  
My hand holding the documents tightened slightly as I placed the divorce papers in front of him.  
  
""I want you to sign this.""  
  
\---  
  
Everyone said I hit the jackpot when I married Reed Hawthorne‚Äîlike I'd won the damn lottery becoming Mrs. Hawthorne.  
  
But they had no clue. This marriage? Neither of us wanted it.  
  
It all started when Grandpa got really sick and had to be hospitalized.  
  
Reed's grandfather happened to be in the same place, and by pure chance, Mr. Hawthorne recognized Grandpa as an old war buddy.  
  
The kind who'd saved his life, no less.  
  
The two old guys spent hours reminiscing about the past, catching up on everything.  
  
When they got to talking about me, Grandpa's voice cracked.  
  
He was terrified that after he was gone, my stepmother and her kids would make my life hell.  
  
Mr. Hawthorne couldn't stand seeing his old friend so torn up. Right then and there, he said I should marry his grandson.  
  
So that's how Reed and I met‚Äîon day one.  
  
Day two, we found out about this arranged marriage that came out of nowhere.  
  
Day three, we were husband and wife.  
  
Right after we got our marriage license, Reed laid it out for me.  
  
""We'll only have the title of husband and wife, nothing real between us.  
  
""As long as you behave and play the good Mrs. Hawthorne, I can give you anything you want‚Äîexcept me.""  
  
Honestly? I was relieved when he said that.  
  
I mean, some guy I'd known for three days suddenly becoming my husband?  
  
Truth is, I couldn't wrap my head around it either.  
  
So we settled into this weird roommate situation with wedding rings.  
  
At first, I felt pretty awkward about the whole thing.  
  
But Reed? He was actually amazing.  
  
On the daily, I got nannies and housekeepers handling everything.  
  
Money-wise, he used to drop five million into my account every month, and he'd even given me his extra card.  
  
Relationship-wise, he actually acted like the married man he was supposed to be.  
  
I never saw a single tabloid story about him with other women.  
  
Even though hardly anyone knew he was married, and absolutely nobody knew I existed.  
  
As time went on, I started really loving what we had.  
  
I thought we'd go on like this forever.  
  
But I forgot‚Äîhe never loved me.  
  
So of course he wasn't going to let me be Mrs. Hawthorne forever.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Last night Reed didn't come home.  
  
I mean, sometimes he'd be gone on business trips and stuff.  
  
But this time felt different.  
  
There it was on the news‚ÄîReed gently helping Vivian along, and her looking all shy and smitten as she gazed up at him.  
  
In three years of marriage, this was the first time I'd ever seen any news about him with another woman.  
  
\[Hawthorne Group CEO and Emmy-Winning Actress Vivian Cross Spotted on Late-Night Malibu Beach Walk.\]  
  
The comments section was going crazy.  
  
Most people were saying how perfect they looked together, what a power couple they'd make.  
  
My fingers unconsciously traced over Reed's face in the photo‚Äîhow relaxed he looked, how genuinely happy.  
  
My chest tightened.  
  
Yeah, they really did look perfect together.  
  
The next morning, I saw Reed.  
  
I had no idea when he'd gotten back.  
  
Not that he needed to tell me anyway.  
  
""Have you been keeping up with the news lately?""  
  
Reed's smooth voice cut through the quiet, and I stopped mid-spoon, looking up at him.  
  
""What news?""  
  
Something flickered in his eyes. He studied me for a long moment before saying casually, ""Nothing important.  
  
""Just some trashy gossip.""  
  
I kept my voice even. ""Okay.""  
  
Then went back to my cereal.  
  
After a beat, he spoke again.  
  
""Probably better that you didn't see it anyway."" His voice was low, and I couldn't tell if he sounded relieved or disappointed.  
  
My heart clenched.  
  
I figured he was probably hoping for a different answer from me.  
  
That way he could've kept the conversation going.  
  
And then dumped me.  
  
I thought if I just kept dodging the truth, maybe I could stay by Reed's side a little longer.  
  
But here's the thing about stuff that was never yours to begin  
  
‚Äîno matter how badly you want to hold onto it.  
  
Eventually, you're just fooling yourself.  
  
""Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today.""  
  
Sitting across from me was Hollywood's hottest leading lady, Vivian Cross.  
  
When the housekeeper told me Vivian wanted to see me, my first instinct was to say hell no.  
  
But if it wasn't today, it'd be tomorrow.  
  
I could dodge her once, maybe twice, but how long could that last?  
  
""What did you want to talk about?"" I asked, even though we both knew why she was here.  
  
Vivian picked up her coffee and took a delicate sip, every movement graceful, her smile picture-perfect.  
  
There was no contest between us.  
  
""Reed and I went to college together,"" she said with a soft smile. ""He never told you that, did he?""  
  
My stomach dropped, but I nodded.  
  
""No, he didn't mention it.""  
  
""But Reed's told me all about you."" Her tone shifted slightly. ""You're the wife his grandfather forced him to marry three years ago, right?""  
  
Forced.  
  
So, that's how Reed had explained me to her.  
  
I mean, he wasn't wrong, but it still felt like a punch to the gut.  
  
""Yeah, that's right."" My voice came out flat, emotionless, as I gripped my coffee cup tighter, willing my hands not to shake.  
  
She smiled that calm, confident smile and pulled a check from her purse, sliding it across the table.  
  
""That's ten million. I want you to leave Reed.""  
  
Her smile was so sure, so composed‚Äîand it made me want to throw up.  
  
""Did he ask you to come here?"" The words came out like gravel.  
  
Vivian shook her head, her voice flowing like silk.  
  
""Reed told me you two are just casualties of some old family debt, that your marriage has never been real.  
  
""He wants to have a real family now. With someone he actually loves, and kids of his own.  
  
""You've already taken three years from him. I think it's time you let him go.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I didn't take Vivian's money.  
  
I'd already been sitting in someone else's rightful place as Mrs. Hawthorne for all these years‚Äîtaking her money on top of that?  
  
That just felt wrong on every level.  
  
My grandfather passed away a year ago.  
  
Back then, I thought Reed would divorce me right away.  
  
But he didn't.  
  
He was the one who handled all the funeral arrangements after Grandpa died.  
  
My dad and stepmom's family? They were nowhere to be found from start to finish.  
  
Ever since they found out Grandpa needed surgery and it was going to cost a fortune, they just vanished into thin air.  
  
The only reason I agreed to marry Reed in the first place was because his grandfather promised he'd cover my grandpa's medical bills.  
  
During that time, Reed stayed with me for two whole weeks.  
  
When I'd break down crying under the covers in the middle of the night, he'd hold me tight and just wait in silence until I cried myself to sleep before he'd leave.  
  
When I had no appetite for anything, he'd personally go out and buy me those chocolate chip cookies from Levain Bakery that Grandpa used to get for me.  
  
And when I felt completely alone in the world, he brought me a dog so I'd have company again.  
  
I'd already fallen in love with him.  
  
But the person he loved wasn't me.  
  
Someone that wonderful‚Äîhow could I be selfish enough to stand in the way of his happiness?  
  
That evening, I went to find Reed in his study.  
  
Sitting behind his desk, Reed looked even more untouchable than usual.  
  
I slowly walked over to face him, and after steeling myself, I spoke up.  
  
""Remember when you said I could have anything I wanted? Does that still stand?""  
  
Reed set down the papers he was holding, those long fingers of his removing the glasses from his nose.  
  
His eyes flickered with something, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.  
  
""Of course.  
  
""What is it you want?""  
  
That look in his eyes‚Äîlike he'd been waiting for this moment forever.  
  
So he'd been wanting to divorce me all along!  
  
My grip tightened on the papers in my hand, then I placed the divorce agreement in front of him.  
  
""I want you to sign this.""  
  
As the document hit the desk, it felt like someone had grabbed my heart in a vice grip‚Äîthe pain was so sharp I could barely breathe.  
  
My eyes burned hot, and before the tears could completely betray me, I rushed to finish what I had to say.  
  
""I already signed it.

It‚Äôs Tuesday morning. You grab your coffee, open your laptop, and the first thing you see is a wall of GitHub notifications. There are a dozen pull requests waiting for review, a handful of new issues reporting minor bugs, and a few comments asking for documentation updates. Your plan for the day was to tackle that one challenging feature, the one that requires deep focus. But now, you‚Äôre faced with an hour, maybe two, of context-switching, running tests, and typing out repetitive feedback. It‚Äôs the kind of work that drains your creative energy before you‚Äôve even written a single line of your own code.

This isn‚Äôt a unique problem. It‚Äôs the daily reality for countless developers and teams. The small, necessary tasks of repository maintenance accumulate, creating friction and slowing down the work that truly drives a project forward. You might feel like you‚Äôre spending more time managing the work than actually doing it. This is precisely the operational bottleneck that AI-assisted development aims to solve. It‚Äôs not about replacing developers; it‚Äôs about giving them an intelligent assistant that can handle the routine churn, freeing up human minds for the complex, architectural challenges that they are uniquely qualified to solve.

Enter Claude 4, a model from Anthropic that is particularly well-suited for this kind of work. It‚Äôs built to understand long, complex sets of instructions and maintain context over extended, multi-step operations. Think of it less as a simple chatbot and more as a junior developer that you can direct with plain English. It excels at code generation, logical reasoning, and following through on a sequence of tasks, which makes it a fantastic candidate for integrating directly into your development workflow.

This article is your step-by-step guide to doing just that. We are going to walk through the entire process of integrating the Claude App into your GitHub repository. We‚Äôll start with the initial setup on your local machine, move on to configuring the app within GitHub, and then run a real-world demonstration where we resolve a GitHub issue with a single comment. By the end, you‚Äôll have a clear picture of how this tool works and how you can use it to reclaim your time and focus on what you do best: building great software.

# Foundational Setup: Preparing Your Environment for Claude Code

Before we can have Claude writing code in our repositories, we need to establish a connection between our local machine, the Anthropic services, and GitHub. This involves a few preparatory steps to get all the necessary tools installed and authenticated. Think of this as laying the digital plumbing that will allow instructions to flow smoothly.

# The Role of Claude Code CLI

The primary tool we'll use to bridge our local environment with Anthropic's models is the Claude Code Command Line Interface (CLI). This is a small package you install on your computer that gives you a terminal-based command center for interacting with Claude. It‚Äôs the conduit through which you‚Äôll issue commands, authenticate your account, and kick off the GitHub app installation process. It acts as the secure handshake between you and the AI.

# System Prerequisites

To get the CLI running, your system needs a couple of things. Let‚Äôs make sure you have them in place.

# Node.js and npm

The Claude Code CLI is built on Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime. It‚Äôs distributed through npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with every Node.js installation. There‚Äôs a good chance you already have these tools on your machine if you‚Äôve done any web development. You can check by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing the following commands, one at a time:

* `node -v`
* `npm -v`

If you see version numbers appear for both (like `v20.11.0` and `10.2.4`), you‚Äôre all set. If you get an error message like ""command not found,"" you‚Äôll need to install them. The best way to do this is to visit the official Node.js website and download the installer recommended for most users. The installation is straightforward and will automatically add both `node` and `npm` to your system‚Äôs path, so they can be run from any directory.

# Global Installation of Claude Code

With Node.js and npm ready, you can now install the Claude Code package itself. In your terminal, run this command:

`npm install -g` u/anthropic-ai`/claude-code`

Let‚Äôs quickly break down what this command does. `npm install` is the standard command for installing a package. The u/anthropic-ai`/claude-code` part is the official name of the package we want. The `-g` flag is the key part here; it stands for ""global."" This installs the package in a central location on your system, not just within your current project directory. The benefit is that the `claude` command becomes available to you in the terminal no matter which folder you‚Äôre in. It makes the tool a system-wide utility.

# Anthropic Console Configuration

The Claude Code CLI needs to connect to an authenticated Anthropic account to function. This is how it gains access to the AI models and how usage is tracked.

# Account Creation

Your first stop is the Anthropic Console website. If you don't have an account, you'll need to go through the sign-up process. It‚Äôs a standard procedure requiring an email and password. Once you're in, you‚Äôll have access to a dashboard where you can manage your API keys, view usage, and handle billing.

# Account Funding

Anthropic‚Äôs API operates on a pre-paid credit model. You add funds to your account, and as you use the models, the cost is deducted from your balance. To start experimenting, you‚Äôll need to add some credits. A common starting point is around $10. This is typically more than enough to run through the examples in this guide and conduct your own tests. You can add these funds using a credit or debit card through the billing section of the console.

You might feel a bit of hesitation about adding money upfront. This is understandable. The goal here is to start small. The credit system gives you full control over your spending. You can't accidentally rack up a huge bill, because the system will simply stop working if your balance runs out. This approach allows for predictable and manageable experimentation.

# Authenticating the Claude Code CLI

Now it's time to connect the CLI tool you installed with the account you just funded.

# Initiating the Connection

Open your terminal and, from any directory, simply run the main command:

`claude`

The first time you run this, the CLI will detect that it hasn't been authenticated yet. It will then begin the authentication sequence.

# The Authentication Sequence

The process is designed to be secure and user-friendly. Here‚Äôs what will happen:

1. The CLI will display a message in your terminal telling you it needs to authenticate.
2. A new window or tab will automatically open in your default web browser, taking you to the Anthropic login page.
3. After you log in to your Anthropic account, the website will generate a unique, temporary authentication code.
4. You need to copy this code from the browser.
5. Go back to your terminal window and paste the code into the prompt.

This flow confirms that the person running the command in the terminal also has access to the Anthropic account in the browser, completing the secure link.

# Verifying Success

Once you paste the code and press Enter, the CLI will confirm the connection. You should see a welcome message or a prompt indicating that Claude Code is now active and ready to use. Your terminal is now a direct line to the Claude models, authenticated and ready for your instructions.

# The Core Integration: Connecting Claude to Your GitHub Repository

With the foundational setup complete, we can now move to the most exciting part: bringing Claude directly into a GitHub repository. This is where the automation truly comes to life. We will install a dedicated GitHub App that listens for our commands and uses Claude to perform tasks on our behalf.

# The Claude GitHub App: An Overview

The Claude GitHub App is an automation agent that you install into your repository. It isn't a person or a separate user account. Instead, it works through GitHub Actions, a powerful feature built into GitHub that lets you automate workflows. The app provides a pre-configured workflow that listens for specific triggers, such as someone mentioning ""@claude"" in an issue or pull request comment. When it detects that trigger, it springs into action, using the Claude model to understand the request and execute the necessary steps, like writing code, creating a new branch, and opening a pull request.

# Initiating the GitHub App Installation from the CLI

The setup process for the GitHub App cleverly begins from the Claude Code CLI you've already authenticated.

# The Command

Inside your active Claude Code terminal session (the one you started by running `claude`), type the following command:

`/install-github-app`

Notice the forward slash at the beginning. This indicates that you're issuing a special command to the CLI itself, rather than sending a prompt to the AI model.

# Behind the Scenes

When you run this command, the CLI communicates with Anthropic's backend services. It prepares your account to be linked with the GitHub App and then provides you with the next steps needed to complete the installation on the GitHub side. It essentially pre-authorizes the connection, making the subsequent steps on the GitHub website much smoother.

# Preparing the Target GitHub Repository

Before you finalize the installation, it's a good practice to prepare the repository where you plan to use Claude.

# Best Practices for a Clean Start

It is highly recommended to start with a test repository or a new, clean project. Why? It gives you a safe, isolated environment to experiment without any risk to your production code. You can learn how Claude responds to your prompts, understand its workflow, and get comfortable with the process before introducing it to a critical project. This also helps you verify that the integration is working correctly without the noise of a complex, existing codebase.

# Initializing the Repository State

A useful step to ensure your repository is ""live"" and its GitHub Actions are working is to create and merge a simple, initial pull request. This could be as minor as adding a single line to a [`README.md`](http://README.md) file.

1. Create a new branch.
2. Make a small change, like adding a sentence to the README.
3. Commit the change and push the branch.
4. Open a pull request on GitHub.
5. Merge that pull request into your main branch.

This sequence of actions confirms that your repository is active and that the GitHub Actions runners, which the Claude App will depend on, are operational for your account.

# Configuring the GitHub Actions Workflow File

The installation process will automatically add a new workflow file to your repository. This file is the ""brain"" of the operation, telling GitHub exactly what to do when Claude is mentioned.

# Locating and Understanding claude.yml

The setup will create a file named `claude.yml` inside the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. This is the standard location for all GitHub Actions workflow files. You can navigate to this file directly on GitHub or pull the changes to your local machine to view it in your code editor.

# Deconstructing the Workflow File

If you open the `claude.yml` file, you‚Äôll see code written in YAML, a human-readable data format. Even if you've never seen a GitHub Action file before, its structure is fairly logical. You'll typically see these main sections:

* `name`: A simple name for the workflow, like ""Claude.""
* `on`: This defines the trigger. It specifies which events should cause this workflow to run. For the Claude App, this is usually configured to listen for comments on issues and pull requests that contain the u/claude mention.
* `jobs`: This section defines the work to be done. A workflow can have one or more jobs.
* `steps`: Inside a job, you'll find a series of steps. Each step is a single action, like checking out the code from your repository, setting up the right tools, and finally, running the Claude action itself.

# Specifying the Model

Within the steps of your `claude.yml` file, you will find a line that specifies which Claude model to use. It will look something like this:

`model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229'`

This line is very significant. It lets you choose the right model for your needs, balancing capability, speed, and cost. Anthropic offers a family of models:

* **Claude 3 Opus:** The most powerful and intelligent model. Use this for highly complex tasks that require deep reasoning, like refactoring an entire class or debugging an obscure issue. It is the most expensive model.
* **Claude 3 Sonnet:** A great balance between intelligence and speed. This is an excellent default choice for most day-to-day tasks like writing new functions, reviewing pull requests, or generating documentation.
* **Claude 3 Haiku:** The fastest and most compact model. Use this for tasks that need a near-instant response, like simple issue labeling or quick syntax checks. It is the least expensive.

You can edit this line in your `claude.yml` file at any time to switch between models based on the needs of your project. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll stick with Sonnet as a capable and cost-effective option.

# Finalizing the Installation and Granting Permissions

The last step is to formally install the app from the GitHub Marketplace and give it permission to access your chosen repository.

# Navigating to the App Page

The CLI or documentation will provide a direct URL to the Claude App page on the GitHub Marketplace. It is typically `https://github.com/apps/claude`.

# The Authorization Flow

When you click ""Install,"" GitHub will guide you through a standard authorization flow. You'll be asked to select which of your GitHub accounts or organizations you want to install the app on.

# A Note on Security and Scoped Access

Next, you'll see a critical screen where you grant the app permissions. You will have two choices:

1. Grant access to **All repositories**.
2. Grant access to **Only select repositories**.

You might feel uneasy about giving an application access to all of your code, and that's a perfectly valid security concern. It is strongly recommended that you choose the second option: **Only select repositories**. From there, you can pick just the one test repository you prepared earlier. This is a core principle of security known as ""least privilege."" You only grant the absolute minimum level of access required for a tool to do its job. You can always come back to this page later and grant access to more repositories as you become more comfortable with the tool.

With the permissions granted, the installation is complete. Your repository is now equipped with a powerful AI assistant, waiting for your command.

# A Practical Demonstration: Resolving a GitHub Issue with a Single Comment

Theory is one thing, but seeing this automation in action is where the real ""aha"" moment happens. Let‚Äôs walk through a concrete example based on a real-world use case: generating a Docker Compose file to satisfy a GitHub issue. This demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, from a developer's request to a finished pull request.

# Setting the Stage: The Target Issue

For our demonstration, we'll use a scenario similar to Issue #9 from the `kingabzpro/bbc-news-class-mlops` repository. The issue is titled ""add the docker compose file,"" and its description might elaborate on the services needed, like a web server and a database.

The success of any AI-driven task hinges on the quality of the input. A well-defined issue is critical. A vague request like ""fix bug"" is unlikely to yield good results. A specific request like ""add a docker-compose.yml file that sets up a Python Flask service on port 5000 and a PostgreSQL database"" provides clear, actionable instructions for Claude to follow. This is a great example of how developers' roles shift: the skill becomes less about typing boilerplate code and more about clearly articulating requirements.

# Invoking Claude: The Magic Mention

With a clear issue defined, a developer can now delegate the task to Claude without leaving the GitHub interface.

# Crafting the Comment

The developer navigates to the issue page. In the comment box, they type a simple, direct command:

u/claude `add the docker compose file based on the issue description`

This comment does two things. First, it mentions u/claude, which is the specific trigger that our `claude.yml` workflow is listening for. Second, it gives a clear, natural language instruction. The phrase ""based on the issue description"" is important, as it tells Claude to use the context from the issue title and body as its source of truth.

# The Trigger Mechanism

The moment this comment is posted, GitHub's automation engine springs to life. It sees the u/claude mention, checks the `on` condition in our `claude.yml` file, sees a match, and initiates a new run of the workflow. You can even see this happening in real-time by going to the ""Actions"" tab of your repository.

# Observing the Automated Workflow

Now, we can sit back and watch the process unfold right within the issue thread.

# Claude's Response

Within a minute or two, a new comment will appear in the issue, posted by the Claude App. This comment typically acknowledges the request, something like, ""On it! I'm working on adding the docker compose file."" This feedback is valuable because it confirms that the trigger was successful and the task is underway.

# Code Generation in Progress

In the background, the GitHub Actions runner is executing the steps defined in our workflow file. It checks out a copy of the repository's code, and the Claude action processes the request. The model reads the issue description, understands the requirements for the Docker Compose file, and generates the necessary `docker-compose.yml` code. It doesn't just generate the code; it also creates a new branch in your repository (often with a descriptive name like `claude-issue-9-fix`) and commits the new file to that branch.

# The Pull Request Link

Once the code has been generated and committed, the Claude App posts a final comment to the issue. This is the payoff. The comment will contain a summary of the work done and, most importantly, a direct link to a brand-new pull request. The pull request is already filled out, comparing the new branch with your main branch and showing the newly created file.

# Review and Merge: The Human in the Loop

This final step is perhaps the most important one, and it addresses a common fear about AI development: what if the AI makes a mistake? The workflow is explicitly designed to keep a human in the loop for quality control.

# The Critical Review Step

The AI has done the tedious work, but the developer is still the ultimate authority. Your job now is to click the link to the pull request that Claude created. You will be taken to the standard GitHub pull request screen. Here, you must perform a code review, just as you would for any human colleague.

* Examine the ""Files Changed"" tab.
* Read through the `docker-compose.yml` file that Claude generated.
* Does it meet all the requirements from the original issue?
* Is the syntax correct?
* Does it follow your project's conventions?

In most cases, for a well-defined task, the generated code will be very accurate. But you are the final checkpoint. You might find a small tweak is needed, or you might approve it as is.

# Completing the Task

Once you are satisfied with the code, you perform the final action: you click the ""Merge pull request"" button. This merges the new `docker-compose.yml` file into your main branch. Merging the PR will also automatically close the original issue, completing the entire loop from problem report to deployed solution, with minimal manual coding.

# Expanding the Application: A Repertoire of Automated Tasks

Generating a file from an issue description is just the beginning. The combination of Claude's reasoning ability and the GitHub Actions framework opens up a wide range of possibilities for automating common developer tasks. Let's explore a few more scenarios to get you thinking about how you could apply this to your own projects.

# Automated Code Review

**Scenario:** A junior developer on your team has just submitted a pull request for a new feature in a Python project. Before a senior developer spends time on a detailed review, you want a preliminary check for common issues.

**Sample Prompt:**  
In a comment on the pull request, you could write:  
u/claude `Review this PR. Check for adherence to the PEP 8 style guide and identify any potential null pointer exceptions in the new functions.`

**Expected Outcome:**  
The Claude App would process this request and, instead of creating a new PR, it would add comments directly to the existing one. You would see line-level comments appearing on the ""Files Changed"" tab. For example, it might highlight a line with a variable name that doesn't follow PEP 8 conventions or flag a piece of code where an object could be `None` before one of its attributes is accessed, suggesting a defensive check. This provides instant, actionable feedback to the developer and saves the senior reviewer's time for more complex logical and architectural considerations.

# Intelligent Issue Triage

**Scenario:** Your open-source project is popular, and you receive a steady stream of new issues from users. Manually labeling each one (`bug`, `feature-request`, `documentation`) and assigning it to the right person can become a full-time job.

**Sample Prompt:**  
This can be set up to run automatically on every new issue. The prompt within the workflow file would be something like:  
`Analyze this new issue. Add the appropriate labels from ('bug', 'feature-request', 'documentation'). Based on the file paths mentioned, assign it to the developer with the most recent commits to those files.`

**Expected Outcome:**  
When a user files a new bug report mentioning a ""crash in `payment_processing.py`,"" the workflow triggers. Claude reads the issue, determines it's a bug, and adds the ""bug"" label. It then queries the repository's git history, finds that ""Developer A"" has been working extensively on that file, and automatically assigns the issue to them. Your project's backlog stays organized without any manual intervention.

# Autonomous Debugging and Fix Generation

**Scenario:** Your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline just failed. The automated tests on a pull request have thrown an error on a specific unit test, blocking the merge.

**Sample Prompt:**  
In a comment on the failing pull request, you could write:  
u/claude `The 'test_user_authentication' unit test is failing on this branch. The error is 'AssertionError: Expected status code 200 but got 403'. Please analyze the test and the related 'auth.py' file, propose a fix, and create a PR.`

**Expected Outcome:**  
Claude would analyze the error message, the code for the failing test, and the source code of the [`auth.py`](http://auth.py) file. It might deduce that a permissions check was added that the test didn't account for. It would then generate a proposed fix‚Äîperhaps by modifying the test to create a user with the correct permissions‚Äîand commit that fix to a new branch. Finally, it would comment on the original PR with a link to a *new* pull request containing the proposed fix, ready for your review.

# Proactive Documentation Updates

**Scenario:** A developer merges a pull request that adds a new, important function to your API, but they forgot to update the documentation.

**Sample Prompt:**  
You can create a workflow that allows you to trigger this manually after the fact. In a comment on the merged PR, you might write:  
u/claude `A new function 'get_user_profile' was added in commit 123abcd. Please generate a Python docstring for it that explains its parameters and return value. Also, update the project's` [`README.md`](http://README.md) `with a new section on how to use this function.`

**Expected Outcome:**  
Claude would find the specified function in the codebase and generate a well-formatted docstring according to standard conventions. It would then locate the [`README.md`](http://README.md) file and add a new ""Usage"" section with a clear example. All of this would be delivered in a new pull request, making it incredibly simple to keep your documentation in sync with your code.

# Code Refactoring on Demand

**Scenario:** You have a file in your codebase with a large, old function that has grown over time. It‚Äôs become difficult to read, modify, and test. It‚Äôs a classic piece of technical debt that no one has had the time to address.

**Sample Prompt:**  
You could create a new issue titled ""Refactor the process\_data\_blob function"" and then comment:  
u/claude `Refactor the 'process_data_blob' function in 'utils.py'. Do not change its functionality. Break it down into several smaller, single-responsibility functions. Improve the variable names for clarity and add comments where the logic is complex.`

**Expected Outcome:**  
This is a more advanced task where a model like Claude Opus would shine. It would analyze the monolithic function, identify distinct logical blocks (e.g., data validation, transformation, loading), and extract each one into its own private helper function. It would rename cryptic variables like `d` and `tmp` to `customer_data` and `temporary_path`. The final result would be a pull request that replaces the one large function with a clean, readable, and more maintainable set of smaller functions, ready for your team to review and merge.

# Final Thoughts and the Future of Software Engineering

What we‚Äôve explored here is more than just a clever trick or a niche tool. It represents a fundamental shift in the *how* of software development. The workflow moves from one where a developer is responsible for manually writing every line of code to one where they act as an architect and director, guiding a highly capable AI agent to handle the implementation details. The developer‚Äôs role is elevated, focusing more on high-level logic, clear communication of requirements, and rigorous quality control.

Tools like the Claude Code CLI and the GitHub App are part of a broader vision for an automated software development lifecycle. Imagine a future where you can describe a feature in a design document, and an AI agent builds it, writes the tests, debugs the failures, updates the documentation, and deploys it, all while keeping you in the loop for key decisions. We are taking the first concrete steps into that future right now.

Now it's your turn to build. Take the steps outlined here and apply them to one of your own projects. Start with a test repository. See what it feels like to close an issue with a single comment. Experiment with different prompts and models. You may discover novel and creative ways to automate the unique challenges of your repository management. The power lies not just in following the examples, but in adapting them to your own needs.

We can chat on Reddit chat first, then after a bit of time move to Discord since it's nicer and more stable. I speak only Polish and English so far, but if you know any languages I'm interested in I'll be sure to let you know!

I'm a professional programmer (not a gamedev though, that's just a hobby) but if you aren't one I won't bore you or tell you anything (unless you want to hear, lol).

I am interested in a few foreign languages (inquire within) but neglected them lately... I am always on the look out for some anime partners. I don't own a powerful PC, just a decent laptop, so I am into older or indie games mainly. 

As for anime watching: I'd do it with screenshare on Discord, and use VC or text chat to talk as we watch. In general I like to be very outspoken and active when watching with someone, not just sit there in silence (that I can do myself, lol). We can watch something you or I or both of us saw before, or something new to both of us, all variations are fun (when we both saw it or didn't, or if one of us saw it and for other it's new).

I'm not too into live action series or movies, but I do have some favorites. My favorite Polish movie is a heist one, so it'd require subs or me live translating (there isn't that much spoken dialogue really and most of it is in short lines), if you wanted to see it.

As an extra fun fact I can say I tried to not drink coffee last few days except before noon, to try enhance my sleep quality.",1,1750175306.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
""Riley, are you seriously going to leave Aiden and move to Germany?""  
  
In the quiet corner of the coffee shop, Riley Lowell set down her spoon and looked across at her stunned friend, her voice calm and detached.  
  
""We're getting divorced.""  
  
""What?!"" Completely blindsided by this bombshell, Phoebe nearly choked on her latte.  
  
A second later, she was fired up on Riley's behalf.  
  
""And Aiden's actually okay with this? You've been nothing but amazing to him for three years straight. I mean, come on‚Äîeven a stone would've warmed up by now! Does he seriously feel nothing for you?""  
  
Riley let out a hollow laugh, something flickering behind her eyes.  
  
Honestly? She had no clue if he was okay with it or not.  
  
Two weeks ago, when she'd handed him the divorce papers, he'd scribbled his signature while juggling a phone call, then bolted without even listening to what she had to say.  
  
He hadn't brought it up since.  
  
In another two weeks, she'd have her divorce decree. She'd finally be free.  
  
Just as she opened her mouth to respond, a familiar deep voice cut through the caf√© chatter behind them.  
  
""You two finished here?""  
  
Both women turned around to find Aiden Roosevelt in his signature black trench coat, those long legs carrying him straight toward their table.  
  
Phoebe was still seething and ready to give him a piece of her mind. ""Aiden, Riley just told me you guys are getting divor‚Äî""  
  
""What brings you here?""  
  
Riley quickly squeezed Phoebe's hand and gave her a warning look, smoothly cutting her off at just the right moment.  
  
""Looked like it might rain. Figured I'd swing by and give you a ride.""  
  
Only then did Riley manage a small smile. After hugging Phoebe goodbye, she gathered her purse and left with him.  
  
The drive home was brutal‚Äîrain drumming against the windows while thick silence filled the car.  
  
Faced with this woman he'd married through a twist of fate, Aiden's jaw worked like he wanted to say something. Several times he seemed ready to break the ice, probably searching for conversation topics, but then he remembered he hadn't been home in two weeks.  
  
After what felt like forever, he finally spoke up.  
  
""Riley, that document you had me sign a couple weeks back‚Äîwhat was that about?""  
  
After all this time, he was just now thinking to ask?  
  
Figures. He'd been too busy chasing after Brianna Caldwell to care about the small stuff.  
  
Riley's mouth twisted into a bitter smile. Just as she was about to answer, his phone lit up.  
  
""Aiden, I'm totally wasted and my head's pounding. Can you come get me? Please?""  
  
Hearing that pouty, baby-talk voice on the other end, Aiden's knuckles went white as he gripped the steering wheel, his whole face darkening.  
  
""Brianna, we've been over this a million times. I'm married.""  
  
Dead silence on the other end.  
  
Then: ""So what? I was supposed to be your wife at that wedding, remember?""  
  
That casual, dismissive tone sent Aiden completely over the edge.  
  
In three years of marriage, Riley had only ever seen his cool, composed demeanor. This was the first time she'd watched him lose control.  
  
He slammed the brakes so hard the car shrieked against the asphalt.  
  
""Yeah, well, where the hell were you?!""  
  
The line went quiet.  
  
A moment later, Brianna's voice came back all shaky and tearful. ""God, I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore, I swear.""  
  
The call ended, but Aiden looked even worse than before. His fingers drummed against the steering wheel for the longest time before he finally caved completely, typing out a message with resigned defeat.  
  
""Send me the address.""  
  
When her location popped up, he turned to Riley with an apologetic expression.  
  
Riley knew exactly what was coming and beat him to it. ""Just go handle it. I'll catch an Uber home.""  
  
Watching her climb out into the rain with her umbrella, Aiden felt genuinely guilty and said softly, ""I'll be back soon, okay? We can spend some time together.""  
  
Riley nodded.  
  
She stood there in the downpour, watching his taillights disappear, complex emotions swirling in her chest.  
  
Seven years. She'd been crazy about Aiden Roosevelt for seven damn years.  
  
She could still picture that first moment on the basketball court when her world completely shifted.  
  
There he was in his jersey, sinking shot after shot, single-handedly destroying the other team's defense while the entire gym went absolutely wild.  
  
The girls around her were practically hyperventilating, filling in the newcomers on his whole story.  
  
Aiden Roosevelt from Computer Science, MIT's golden boy, heir to the Roosevelt family dynasty of New York.  
  
Too bad this campus heartthrob only had eyes for Brianna Caldwell, his childhood sweetheart he'd been with for years.  
  
He'd blow ridiculous money on her‚Äîrenting out entire amusement parks just to celebrate her birthday.  
  
He'd swallow his pride and get on his knees in front of the whole school begging for reconciliation whenever some girl confessed to him and Brianna threw one of her famous tantrums.  
  
He'd stand outside in blizzards until his hands went numb, even when she'd blown him off to get manicures with her sorority sisters, and he'd harbor no resentment...  
  
Four years of college, four years of hearing countless stories about Aiden and Brianna's epic romance.  
  
Riley always figured she'd be like background noise in their fairy tale ending.  
  
Until two years ago, when Aiden graduated and couldn't wait to put a ring on Brianna's finger.  
  
Riley hadn't gotten an invitation, but she showed up anyway to that wedding of the century, claiming to be just another classmate.  
  
Except even after the ceremony had begun, Brianna was nowhere to be found. Aiden went absolutely ballistic, made ninety-nine phone calls straight, only to get a text from Brianna saying she wasn't ready for marriage and had already caught a flight to Europe.  
  
That's when Aiden's patience finally ran out.  
  
No more games, no more indulging her drama. He just grabbed the microphone.  
  
""Alright, change of plans. I, Aiden Roosevelt, need a new bride. Any single ladies interested?""  
  
Riley‚Äîquiet, invisible Riley‚Äîfelt her heart about to explode out of her chest. She knew half the room had crushes on him, so the instant those words left his mouth, she shot to her feet.  
  
That day, she squeezed into that ill-fitting wedding dress and married a guy who couldn't even remember her name.  
  
Three years of polite respect, separate lives, and peaceful coexistence.  
  
Until last month, when Brianna decided to come home.  
  
Watching Aiden try to resist while being drawn to her like a magnet, Riley knew her beautiful dream was finally over.  
  
Time to give the Mrs. Roosevelt title back to its rightful owner.  
  
Let him have his devoted heart's desire.  
  
And finally set herself free.  
  
Standing in the pouring rain, Riley fired off a text message.  
  
""That document you asked about? It's in your glove compartment. Open it if you actually want to know what it is.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It wasn't until half an hour later‚Äîby the time she'd already made it home‚Äîthat Aiden finally bothered to text back.  
  
""Don't worry about it. If you asked me to sign it, it can't be anything that would hurt me.""  
  
So he wasn't even going to look at it.  
  
Of course not. He was probably too busy playing knight in shining armor to drunk Brianna to waste time on paperwork sitting right within arm's reach.  
  
The rain didn't let up all day, finally stopping around dinnertime the next evening.  
  
Riley spent the whole time holed up at home, systematically deleting every single post about their marriage from all her social media accounts.  
  
After wiping her Instagram clean, she scrolled through her feed and immediately spotted Brianna's latest post‚Äîa perfect nine-photo grid.  
  
Yacht photos, each one artfully shot to show off a man's elegant hands in the background.  
  
Riley knew those hands belonged to Aiden. She also knew Brianna was doing this on purpose.  
  
But honestly? She couldn't care less about this petty drama anymore.  
  
She tossed her phone aside, headed to the kitchen, and started making herself a salad from scratch.  
  
She'd just finished preparing dinner when Aiden suddenly walked through the door.  
  
Seeing the bakery box in his hands made her freeze for a moment.  
  
""Since when do you buy cake? I thought you hated dessert.""  
  
Aiden walked over, took one look at her simple dinner, and frowned.  
  
""It's your birthday today. Did you forget? Why are you eating something so plain?""  
  
Riley went completely still.  
  
Her parents had divorced when she was barely five, dumping her on her grandmother. When her grandmother died during her teens, there was nobody left who cared, and she'd stopped celebrating birthdays altogether.  
  
But these past three years with Aiden? He'd remembered every single year. No matter how swamped he was, he'd always rush home to celebrate with her.  
  
When she'd travel and come back, worried about her safety, he'd make special trips to pick her up from the airport.  
  
During thunderstorms, knowing she was scared, he'd pull her gently into his arms...  
  
Riley had convinced herself that these little moments of care and thoughtfulness meant he liked her.  
  
Until their one-month wedding anniversary, when Aiden used work as an excuse to cancel their candlelit dinner reservation.  
  
Feeling crushed, she'd gone to meet Phoebe at a bar to drop off a jacket, only to accidentally run straight into Brianna.  
  
She was completely wasted, clinging to the guy who was supposed to be working late at the office, refusing to let go.  
  
Aiden's face was dark with anger as he tried to pry her off.  
  
""Brianna! Cut this shit out and let go! What do you think I am‚Äîsome toy you can throw away and pick up whenever you feel like it?""  
  
Brianna wasn't listening to a word he said. Every time he pushed her away, she'd just wrap her arms around his waist again.  
  
Over and over, like some twisted game.  
  
Finally, Aiden just gave up completely.  
  
He stood there frozen, looking down at her with eyes full of helpless love and complete surrender in his voice.  
  
""Brianna, what the hell am I supposed to do with you?""  
  
In that moment, the bag in Riley's hands hit the floor.  
  
Her mind flooded with memories.  
  
Hands intertwined tightly through crowded streets. An umbrella tilted to keep her dry in the pouring rain. A figure in graduation robes, down on one knee proposing...  
  
Every single scene was proof that Aiden had only ever loved Brianna.  
  
Riley had witnessed those moments with her own eyes, so she couldn't deny the truth.  
  
Three years of marriage, being his wife, having a tiny piece of his attention‚Äînone of it changed anything.  
  
To be completely honest, whatever kindness Aiden had shown her was just stolen from Brianna during her temporary absence.  
  
Riley had clung to those few sweet crumbs, fooling herself into thinking she had everything.  
  
But the reality was, she'd never had him. Not for a single second.  
  
So staring at the number ""24"" on the birthday cake, Riley felt absolutely nothing.  
  
She just gave him a polite nod. ""Thanks.""  
  
Aiden lit the candles with a soft smile. ""Hey, we're married. You don't have to thank me like we're strangers. Make a wish.""  
  
She nodded and was about to lean forward when his phone started buzzing.  
  
Seeing that barely contained tremor in his eyes, Riley knew exactly who was calling and sat back down.  
  
Sure enough, a minute later he hung up and headed for the door.  
  
Listening to the sound of his car driving away, Riley's lips curved into a bitter smile.  
  
The room was dark except for the flickering candlelight casting her lonely shadow on the wall.  
  
She pressed her palms together and made her twenty-fourth birthday wish.  
  
""Starting now, Riley Lowell is done being in love with Aiden Roosevelt.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Three days later, there was a Computer Science department reunion.  
  
Riley only found out Aiden was coming after she'd already shown up.  
  
He was holding court in the center of the room, but the second he spotted her, he ditched everyone and came to sit next to her.  
  
Seeing the two of them together, the vibe in the private room got super awkward.  
  
Riley knew she was the problem.  
  
To these college friends, she'd only married Aiden to gold-dig her way up the social ladder, so they all treated her like trash.  
  
But she couldn't care less about their petty judgment. She sat quietly, keeping her poker face on.  
  
Their class president Marcus showed up late, lugging a huge cardboard box, and waved at everyone.  
  
""Hey guys, thanks for coming! Two reasons for tonight‚Äîcatching up, obviously, and remember that 'letter to your future self' thing we did freshman year? It's been five years, so figured we'd crack these babies open together.""  
  
Everyone immediately mobbed the box, talking over each other.  
  
""Ooh, let's make this interesting‚Äîeveryone picks a random letter to read out loud!""  
  
""Hell yeah! Dibs on going first!""  
  
Tyler, the guy who'd never met a spotlight he didn't like, elbowed his way to the front and snagged an envelope.  
  
With everyone cheering him on, he ripped it open, cleared his throat dramatically, and started reading.  
  
""Dear Riley, five years from now‚Äîhow are you? I am writing this letter to you in the sunshine, and though I do not know what circumstances or emotions you will experience when reading these words, I wish to convey my feelings in this moment to you.""  
  
After that opening, the room went dead silent. Every pair of eyes shifted to Riley.  
  
Even Aiden, who'd been mindlessly scrolling his phone, looked up in shock.  
  
Riley's face‚Äîusually a mask of indifference‚Äîwent white as her stomach dropped, knowing exactly what was coming.  
  
Tyler shot her a shit-eating grin and kept going.  
  
""Today, you are nineteen years old, a sophomore, and you have fallen deeply for Aiden Roosevelt. He remains unaware of this fact, but even if he knew, it would change nothing, for he already has someone he loves. Your hidden affection is destined to remain fruitless.""  
  
""You may wonder why I refuse to abandon these feelings when they are doomed to fail. What I admire is his fearless spirit when thousands cheer his name, his unconscious kindness when he shielded me from a stray basketball in the evening breeze, and his sincere politeness even when declining others' confessions.""  
  
""I am the one whose neck grows sore from stealing glances during weekly meetings, who braved a thunderstorm to secretly place medicine in his desk when I heard he was injured, who filled an entire diary with his name through sleepless nights. Perhaps he will never remember my existence, but that is acceptable‚Äîfor unrequited love has always been one person's beautiful chaos.""  
  
When Tyler finished, you could've heard a pin drop.  
  
Aiden went completely rigid.  
  
Suddenly, he was back at that nightmare wedding‚Äîseeing her rise from the crowd of shocked faces and walk straight to him without hesitation.  
  
Only now did he finally understand why Riley had actually married him.  
  
It wasn't about money or status like everyone whispered.  
  
She'd simply been in love with him for years.  
  
Something in his chest‚Äîsomething that had been dormant for so long‚Äîsuddenly started racing for reasons he couldn't explain.  
  
He wanted to grab her, demand answers to all the questions eating at him, but Brianna's ringtone cut through everything.  
  
""Aiden, I'm stuck outside the club. These guys won't leave me alone...""  
  
Before she could finish, Aiden's expression completely changed.  
  
He shot up and bolted downstairs. The second he saw those lowlifes, he was throwing punches.  
  
Pure rage made him vicious‚Äîwithin seconds, he had one guy spitting blood on the pavement.  
  
The group that had followed him down quickly formed a protective circle around Brianna as she sobbed about some tattooed creep who had grabbed her hand.  
  
When Aiden heard that, he grabbed a crowbar and brought it down hard on the guy's hand.  
  
The scream that followed could've woken the dead.  
  
Riley rushed downstairs just in time to see the aftermath.  
  
Looking at that mangled, bloody mess of a hand, she froze completely.  
  
She looked up at Aiden, only to watch him gently guide Brianna away from the scene.  
  
The same man who'd just brutally assaulted someone was now all soft touches and whispered comfort.  
  
This was the kind of fierce, protective love Riley had never received from him.  
  
She dropped her gaze, hiding what she was feeling, and let out a bitter laugh.  
  
Then she turned around and walked home alone.  
  
Aiden didn't come back until after midnight.  
  
Finding her sitting silently on the couch, he finally remembered he should probably explain.  
  
""Riley, about tonight... look, we're all classmates. I couldn't just stand there and watch Brianna get harassed.""  
  
Riley had no interest in calling out his bullshit. She just made a noncommittal sound and headed for the bathroom with her pajamas.  
  
Thirty minutes later, she came out toweling her hair dry, only to find Aiden holding her phone with this strange expression on his face.

You've been nothing but amazing to him for three years straight. I mean, come on‚Äîeven a stone would've warmed up by now! Does he seriously feel nothing for you? Riley let out a hollow laugh, something flickering behind her eyes. Honestly? She had no clue if he was okay with it or not. Two weeks ago, when she'd handed him the divorce papers, he'd scribbled his signature while juggling a phone call, then bolted without even listening to what she had to say. He hadn't brought it up since. In another two weeks, she'd have her divorce decree. She'd finally be free. Just as she opened her mouth to respond, a familiar deep voice cut through the caf√© chatter behind them.  
You two finished here? Both women turned around to find Aiden Roosevelt in his signature black trench coat, those long legs carrying him straight toward their table. Phoebe was still seething and ready to give him a piece of her mind. ""Aiden, Riley just told me you guys are getting divor‚Äî""  
What brings you here? Riley quickly squeezed Phoebe's hand and gave her a warning look, smoothly cutting her off at just the right moment. Looked like it might rain. Figured I'd swing by and give you a ride. Only then did Riley manage a small smile. After hugging Phoebe goodbye, she gathered her purse and left with him.  
The drive home was brutal‚Äîrain drumming against the windows while thick silence filled the car.  
  
Faced with this woman he'd married through a twist of fate, Aiden's jaw worked like he wanted to say something. Several times he seemed ready to break the ice, probably searching for conversation topics, but then he remembered he hadn't been home in two weeks.  
  
After what felt like forever, he finally spoke up.  
  
""Riley, that document you had me sign a couple weeks back‚Äîwhat was that about?""  
  
After all this time, he was just now thinking to ask?  
  
Figures. He'd been too busy chasing after Brianna Caldwell to care about the small stuff.  
  
Riley's mouth twisted into a bitter smile. Just as she was about to answer, his phone lit up.  
  
""Aiden, I'm totally wasted and my head's pounding. Can you come get me? Please?""  
  
Hearing that pouty, baby-talk voice on the other end, Aiden's knuckles went white as he gripped the steering wheel, his whole face darkening.  
  
""Brianna, we've been over this a million times. I'm married.""  
  
Dead silence on the other end.  
  
Then: ""So what? I was supposed to be your wife at that wedding, remember?""  
  
That casual, dismissive tone sent Aiden completely over the edge.  
  
In three years of marriage, Riley had only ever seen his cool, composed demeanor. This was the first time she'd watched him lose control.  
  
He slammed the brakes so hard the car shrieked against the asphalt.  
  
""Yeah, well, where the hell were you?!""  
  
The line went quiet.  
  
A moment later, Brianna's voice came back all shaky and tearful. ""God, I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore, I swear.""  
  
The call ended, but Aiden looked even worse than before. His fingers drummed against the steering wheel for the longest time before he finally caved completely, typing out a message with resigned defeat.  
  
""Send me the address.""  
  
When her location popped up, he turned to Riley with an apologetic expression.  
  
Riley knew exactly what was coming and beat him to it. ""Just go handle it. I'll catch an Uber home.""  
  
Watching her climb out into the rain with her umbrella, Aiden felt genuinely guilty and said softly, ""I'll be back soon, okay? We can spend some time together.""  
  
Riley nodded.  
  
She stood there in the downpour, watching his taillights disappear, complex emotions swirling in her chest.  
  
Seven years. She'd been crazy about Aiden Roosevelt for seven damn years.  
  
She could still picture that first moment on the basketball court when her world completely shifted.  
  
There he was in his jersey, sinking shot after shot, single-handedly destroying the other team's defense while the entire gym went absolutely wild.  
  
The girls around her were practically hyperventilating, filling in the newcomers on his whole story.  
  
Aiden Roosevelt from Computer Science, MIT's golden boy, heir to the Roosevelt family dynasty of New York.  
  
Too bad this campus heartthrob only had eyes for Brianna Caldwell, his childhood sweetheart he'd been with for years.  
  
He'd blow ridiculous money on her‚Äîrenting out entire amusement parks just to celebrate her birthday.  
  
He'd swallow his pride and get on his knees in front of the whole school begging for reconciliation whenever some girl confessed to him and Brianna threw one of her famous tantrums.  
  
He'd stand outside in blizzards until his hands went numb, even when she'd blown him off to get manicures with her sorority sisters, and he'd harbor no resentment...  
  
Four years of college, four years of hearing countless stories about Aiden and Brianna's epic romance.  
  
Riley always figured she'd be like background noise in their fairy tale ending.  
  
Until two years ago, when Aiden graduated and couldn't wait to put a ring on Brianna's finger.  
  
Riley hadn't gotten an invitation, but she showed up anyway to that wedding of the century, claiming to be just another classmate.  
  
Except even after the ceremony had begun, Brianna was nowhere to be found. Aiden went absolutely ballistic, made ninety-nine phone calls straight, only to get a text from Brianna saying she wasn't ready for marriage and had already caught a flight to Europe.  
  
That's when Aiden's patience finally ran out.  
  
No more games, no more indulging her drama. He just grabbed the microphone.  
  
""Alright, change of plans. I, Aiden Roosevelt, need a new bride. Any single ladies interested?""  
  
Riley‚Äîquiet, invisible Riley‚Äîfelt her heart about to explode out of her chest. She knew half the room had crushes on him, so the instant those words left his mouth, she shot to her feet.  
  
That day, she squeezed into that ill-fitting wedding dress and married a guy who couldn't even remember her name.  
  
Three years of polite respect, separate lives, and peaceful coexistence.  
  
Until last month, when Brianna decided to come home.  
  
Watching Aiden try to resist while being drawn to her like a magnet, Riley knew her beautiful dream was finally over.  
  
Time to give the Mrs. Roosevelt title back to its rightful owner.  
  
Let him have his devoted heart's desire.  
  
And finally set herself free.  
  
Standing in the pouring rain, Riley fired off a text message.  
  
""That document you asked about? It's in your glove compartment. Open it if you actually want to know what it is.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It wasn't until half an hour later‚Äîby the time she'd already made it home‚Äîthat Aiden finally bothered to text back.  
  
""Don't worry about it. If you asked me to sign it, it can't be anything that would hurt me.""  
  
So he wasn't even going to look at it.  
  
Of course not. He was probably too busy playing knight in shining armor to drunk Brianna to waste time on paperwork sitting right within arm's reach.  
  
The rain didn't let up all day, finally stopping around dinnertime the next evening.  
  
Riley spent the whole time holed up at home, systematically deleting every single post about their marriage from all her social media accounts.  
  
After wiping her Instagram clean, she scrolled through her feed and immediately spotted Brianna's latest post‚Äîa perfect nine-photo grid.  
  
Yacht photos, each one artfully shot to show off a man's elegant hands in the background.  
  
Riley knew those hands belonged to Aiden. She also knew Brianna was doing this on purpose.  
  
But honestly? She couldn't care less about this petty drama anymore.  
  
She tossed her phone aside, headed to the kitchen, and started making herself a salad from scratch.  
  
She'd just finished preparing dinner when Aiden suddenly walked through the door.  
  
Seeing the bakery box in his hands made her freeze for a moment.  
  
""Since when do you buy cake? I thought you hated dessert.""  
  
Aiden walked over, took one look at her simple dinner, and frowned.  
  
""It's your birthday today. Did you forget? Why are you eating something so plain?""  
  
Riley went completely still.  
  
Her parents had divorced when she was barely five, dumping her on her grandmother. When her grandmother died during her teens, there was nobody left who cared, and she'd stopped celebrating birthdays altogether.  
  
But these past three years with Aiden? He'd remembered every single year. No matter how swamped he was, he'd always rush home to celebrate with her.  
  
When she'd travel and come back, worried about her safety, he'd make special trips to pick her up from the airport.  
  
During thunderstorms, knowing she was scared, he'd pull her gently into his arms...  
  
Riley had convinced herself that these little moments of care and thoughtfulness meant he liked her.  
  
Until their one-month wedding anniversary, when Aiden used work as an excuse to cancel their candlelit dinner reservation.  
  
Feeling crushed, she'd gone to meet Phoebe at a bar to drop off a jacket, only to accidentally run straight into Brianna.  
  
She was completely wasted, clinging to the guy who was supposed to be working late at the office, refusing to let go.  
  
Aiden's face was dark with anger as he tried to pry her off.  
  
""Brianna! Cut this shit out and let go! What do you think I am‚Äîsome toy you can throw away and pick up whenever you feel like it?""  
  
Brianna wasn't listening to a word he said. Every time he pushed her away, she'd just wrap her arms around his waist again.  
  
Over and over, like some twisted game.  
  
Finally, Aiden just gave up completely.  
  
He stood there frozen, looking down at her with eyes full of helpless love and complete surrender in his voice.  
  
""Brianna, what the hell am I supposed to do with you?""  
  
In that moment, the bag in Riley's hands hit the floor.  
  
Her mind flooded with memories.  
  
Hands intertwined tightly through crowded streets. An umbrella tilted to keep her dry in the pouring rain. A figure in graduation robes, down on one knee proposing...  
  
Every single scene was proof that Aiden had only ever loved Brianna.  
  
Riley had witnessed those moments with her own eyes, so she couldn't deny the truth.  
  
Three years of marriage, being his wife, having a tiny piece of his attention‚Äînone of it changed anything.  
  
To be completely honest, whatever kindness Aiden had shown her was just stolen from Brianna during her temporary absence.  
  
Riley had clung to those few sweet crumbs, fooling herself into thinking she had everything.  
  
But the reality was, she'd never had him. Not for a single second.  
  
So staring at the number ""24"" on the birthday cake, Riley felt absolutely nothing.  
  
She just gave him a polite nod. ""Thanks.""  
  
Aiden lit the candles with a soft smile. ""Hey, we're married. You don't have to thank me like we're strangers. Make a wish.""  
  
She nodded and was about to lean forward when his phone started buzzing.  
  
Seeing that barely contained tremor in his eyes, Riley knew exactly who was calling and sat back down.  
  
Sure enough, a minute later he hung up and headed for the door.  
  
Listening to the sound of his car driving away, Riley's lips curved into a bitter smile.  
  
The room was dark except for the flickering candlelight casting her lonely shadow on the wall.  
  
She pressed her palms together and made her twenty-fourth birthday wish.  
  
""Starting now, Riley Lowell is done being in love with Aiden Roosevelt.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Three days later, there was a Computer Science department reunion.  
  
Riley only found out Aiden was coming after she'd already shown up.  
  
He was holding court in the center of the room, but the second he spotted her, he ditched everyone and came to sit next to her.  
  
Seeing the two of them together, the vibe in the private room got super awkward.  
  
Riley knew she was the problem.  
  
To these college friends, she'd only married Aiden to gold-dig her way up the social ladder, so they all treated her like trash.  
  
But she couldn't care less about their petty judgment. She sat quietly, keeping her poker face on.  
  
Their class president Marcus showed up late, lugging a huge cardboard box, and waved at everyone.  
  
""Hey guys, thanks for coming! Two reasons for tonight‚Äîcatching up, obviously, and remember that 'letter to your future self' thing we did freshman year? It's been five years, so figured we'd crack these babies open together.""  
  
Everyone immediately mobbed the box, talking over each other.  
  
""Ooh, let's make this interesting‚Äîeveryone picks a random letter to read out loud!""  
  
""Hell yeah! Dibs on going first!""  
  
Tyler, the guy who'd never met a spotlight he didn't like, elbowed his way to the front and snagged an envelope.  
  
With everyone cheering him on, he ripped it open, cleared his throat dramatically, and started reading.  
  
""Dear Riley, five years from now‚Äîhow are you? I am writing this letter to you in the sunshine, and though I do not know what circumstances or emotions you will experience when reading these words, I wish to convey my feelings in this moment to you.""  
  
After that opening, the room went dead silent. Every pair of eyes shifted to Riley.  
  
Even Aiden, who'd been mindlessly scrolling his phone, looked up in shock.  
  
Riley's face‚Äîusually a mask of indifference‚Äîwent white as her stomach dropped, knowing exactly what was coming.  
  
Tyler shot her a shit-eating grin and kept going.  
  
""Today, you are nineteen years old, a sophomore, and you have fallen deeply for Aiden Roosevelt. He remains unaware of this fact, but even if he knew, it would change nothing, for he already has someone he loves. Your hidden affection is destined to remain fruitless.""  
  
""You may wonder why I refuse to abandon these feelings when they are doomed to fail. What I admire is his fearless spirit when thousands cheer his name, his unconscious kindness when he shielded me from a stray basketball in the evening breeze, and his sincere politeness even when declining others' confessions.""  
  
""I am the one whose neck grows sore from stealing glances during weekly meetings, who braved a thunderstorm to secretly place medicine in his desk when I heard he was injured, who filled an entire diary with his name through sleepless nights. Perhaps he will never remember my existence, but that is acceptable‚Äîfor unrequited love has always been one person's beautiful chaos.""  
  
When Tyler finished, you could've heard a pin drop.  
  
Aiden went completely rigid.  
  
Suddenly, he was back at that nightmare wedding‚Äîseeing her rise from the crowd of shocked faces and walk straight to him without hesitation.  
  
Only now did he finally understand why Riley had actually married him.  
  
It wasn't about money or status like everyone whispered.  
  
She'd simply been in love with him for years.  
  
Something in his chest‚Äîsomething that had been dormant for so long‚Äîsuddenly started racing for reasons he couldn't explain.  
  
He wanted to grab her, demand answers to all the questions eating at him, but Brianna's ringtone cut through everything.  
  
""Aiden, I'm stuck outside the club. These guys won't leave me alone...""  
  
Before she could finish, Aiden's expression completely changed.  
  
He shot up and bolted downstairs. The second he saw those lowlifes, he was throwing punches.  
  
Pure rage made him vicious‚Äîwithin seconds, he had one guy spitting blood on the pavement.  
  
The group that had followed him down quickly formed a protective circle around Brianna as she sobbed about some tattooed creep who had grabbed her hand.  
  
When Aiden heard that, he grabbed a crowbar and brought it down hard on the guy's hand.  
  
The scream that followed could've woken the dead.  
  
Riley rushed downstairs just in time to see the aftermath.  
  
Looking at that mangled, bloody mess of a hand, she froze completely.  
  
She looked up at Aiden, only to watch him gently guide Brianna away from the scene.  
  
The same man who'd just brutally assaulted someone was now all soft touches and whispered comfort.  
  
This was the kind of fierce, protective love Riley had never received from him.  
  
She dropped her gaze, hiding what she was feeling, and let out a bitter laugh.  
  
Then she turned around and walked home alone.  
  
Aiden didn't come back until after midnight.  
  
Finding her sitting silently on the couch, he finally remembered he should probably explain.  
  
""Riley, about tonight... look, we're all classmates. I couldn't just stand there and watch Brianna get harassed.""  
  
Riley had no interest in calling out his bullshit. She just made a noncommittal sound and headed for the bathroom with her pajamas.  
  
Thirty minutes later, she came out toweling her hair dry, only to find Aiden holding her phone with this strange expression on his face.  
  
""Riley, why did you buy a plane ticket?""

Chapter 1  
  
My boyfriend's childhood friend pushed me down the stairs, causing my miscarriage. Then he vanished for a week.  
  
Seven days later, my boyfriend returned, kneeling before me with his childhood friend in tow‚Äîmy father's illegitimate daughter.  
  
""Your sister may have accidentally caused your miscarriage, but she's consumed with guilt. She threatened to take her own life unless I marry you,"" he declared.  
  
""That's why I've brought her along for this proposal.""  
  
As the true heir to the Kingsley Group, my boyfriend was certain I would accept his proposal.  
  
The condition? I had to welcome both my sister and the child growing inside her womb.  
  
I rejected him outright.  
  
My illegitimate half-sister, in her vindictive rage, hadn't just caused my miscarriage‚Äîshe had scattered my baby's ashes.  
  
I turned away and called the recently disowned ""fake heir"" of the Kingsley family: ""Does your previous offer to marry me still stand?""  
  
What nobody realized was that this ""fake young master"" was actually the President's son.  
  
The curtain was about to rise on a devastating business takedown of the Kingsley family...  
  
Jess's Childhood Friend Pushed Me Down the Stairs and Caused My Miscarriage  
  
When Jess's childhood friend‚Äîmy father's illegitimate daughter‚Äîpushed me down the stairs causing my miscarriage, he disappeared for a week.  
  
Seven days later, Jess returned, holding hands with his childhood friend, and knelt down to propose to me.  
  
""Your sister Lilith didn't mean to cause your miscarriage, but she felt so guilty she threatened to kill herself unless I married you,"" he said.  
  
""Today I've brought her to witness my proposal to you.""  
  
Jess, this newly-recognized heir of a wealthy family, was certain I would accept his proposal.  
  
Instead, I flat-out refused.  
  
I turned around and called the ""fake heir"" who had just been expelled from the Kingsley family: ""Does your offer to marry me still stand?""  
  
No one knew that this ""fake heir"" was actually the President's son.  
  
Seeing my hesitation to take the engagement ring, Jess's face filled with impatience.  
  
""Take it already!"" he snapped.  
  
But I directly refused: ""I don't want to!""  
  
Jess stood up, frowning as he looked at me.  
  
At that moment, Lilith grabbed my hand with a smug smile. ""Ophelia, please accept the proposal. I'm sorry for accidentally bumping into you and causing you to lose your baby. I threatened to kill myself, and Jess agreed to propose to you because he cares about me.""  
  
""I personally selected the ring. Do you like it?""  
  
Seeing Lilith's hand, I immediately recalled how she had pushed me down the stairs a week ago with that satisfied look on her face.  
  
""Die with your child!"" she had said.  
  
I frowned and violently shook off her hand. ""Let go! You're the murderer who killed my baby!""  
  
My baby had been six months along. She would have been born soon.  
  
This woman killed her!  
  
After I shoved her away, Lilith immediately fell into Jess's arms with tears in her eyes. ""Jess... I was sincerely apologizing!""  
  
Jess immediately held Lilith tight. ""It's okay, don't be afraid!""  
  
His face darkened terribly as he threw the ring at my face.  
  
""Ophelia! How many times do I have to tell you Lilith accidentally bumped into you!""  
  
""She did nothing wrong, yet she cried and begged me to propose to you! She willingly gave up her position as my wife, and you're being so ungrateful!""  
  
The massive diamond ring cut my cheek before falling to the ground, gleaming brilliantly.  
  
This ring I had dreamed of for ten years was now right before my eyes, but seeing it only tore my heart to pieces.  
  
""Ungrateful?"" My voice was hoarse as my entire body trembled.  
  
""She killed my baby! Am I supposed to thank her for that? Jess, have you lost your mind?""  
  
""I don't want your charity. I'll say it again‚ÄîI refuse!""  
  
Jess let out a cold laugh as he picked up the ring from the floor and offered it to me again.  
  
""Who else would marry you now besides me?""  
  
""Who would want a woman who can't have children anymore, a woman I've used for ten years?""  
  
""I'll say it one more time‚Äîtake the ring.""  
  
I didn't take the ring. Just then, the private investigator I had hired finally sent me the security footage.  
  
Hope ignited in my heart.  
  
Surely Jess wouldn't act this way after knowing the truth!  
  
After all, the baby in my womb had been his too. After all, we had loved each other so deeply once.  
  
I handed him my phone.  
  
""Watch this first, then we'll talk.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The surveillance footage was enough to prove Lilith had pushed me deliberately.  
  
But just as I handed my phone to Jess, Lilith immediately stepped between us.  
  
She then grabbed Jess's hand and tried to pull him away. ""Jess, I'm hungry. I want strawberry cake. Will you buy me some?""  
  
Jess immediately smiled. ""Of course!""  
  
He looked at me and said, ""We'll talk about this later!""  
  
I grew desperate. ""Watch it now!""  
  
I tried to push Lilith aside, but before I could apply any force, she dramatically fell to the ground.  
  
""Ah!"" Lilith screamed.  
  
""My stomach, my baby...""  
  
Seeing Lilith like this, Jess instantly panicked. His face showed unprecedented alarm.  
  
He immediately turned pale as he looked at Lilith.  
  
""Don't worry! I'll take you to the hospital right now. Our baby will be fine!""  
  
I stood there stunned. Lilith was pregnant!  
  
Jess and Lilith were having a baby together!  
  
Jess cradled Lilith like a precious treasure, and then casually slapped me across the face.  
  
""Ophelia! Did you know Lilith was pregnant and try to hurt her? She was worried about telling you after you just lost your baby to avoid upsetting you! You're truly vicious!""  
  
I was knocked to the floor by the slap, the wound in my abdomen hitting the coffee table with excruciating pain.  
  
Yet I only questioned Jess: ""Jess, as my boyfriend, aren't you going to explain why you got another woman pregnant?""  
  
Jess's eyes flashed with guilt at my question.  
  
But he said, ""What happened between Lilith and me that night was an accident.""  
  
""You just lost your baby, and Lilith and I were afraid of upsetting you, so we planned to tell you later.""  
  
""Now that you know, there's no point hiding it. After we get married, you'll need to take good care of her, understand?""  
  
With that, Jess carried Lilith and rushed out the door.  
  
I watched Jess's retreating figure with tears streaming down my face.  
  
I picked up my phone and called someone.  
  
""Does your previous offer still stand? You should know my current situation.""  
  
The person on the other end couldn't hide their excitement.  
  
""If you don't mind me being a disinherited heir, why would I mind anything about you?""  
  
""My word is always good.""  
  
After hanging up, I gave a bitter smile.  
  
Jess and I had fallen in love at first sight in college. When he confessed his feelings, I happily accepted.  
  
Back then, his family was poor, and his parents abused him. Throughout college, I worked part-time jobs to cover all our expenses.  
  
I never looked down on Jess for being poor.  
  
Jess would tell me passionately, ""Thank you for loving me like this. I'll make lots of money for you someday!""  
  
After graduation, Jess proposed to me.  
  
I gladly accepted, but then Jess's biological parents showed up‚Äîhe was actually the heir to the Kingsley family!  
  
Jess had looked at me with excitement: ""Ophelia, I'm rich now! You won't have to suffer with me anymore.""  
  
After Jess returned to the Kingsley family, their adopted son was thrown out.  
  
Jess became the only son of the Kingsley family.  
  
He didn't break up with me as his mother‚ÄîEleanor Vance‚Äîhad arranged, but he also didn't marry me.  
  
Later, when Lilith returned to the country, I discovered he had been having an affair with my half-sister all along.  
  
Jess hired her as his secretary, bought her a house and a car.  
  
When I questioned their relationship, he answered:  
  
""We're just neighbors. I'm just helping her out.""  
  
I believed he loved me and kept convincing myself his words were true.  
  
Even when I accidentally got pregnant, I hoped we could finally get married.  
  
But he refused: ""We've been together for ten years‚Äîdon't you trust that I'll take responsibility? We'll get married after the baby is born.""  
  
But now that he finally wanted to marry me, I no longer wanted to marry him.  
  
I gripped my phone tightly.  
  
Once Jess knew the truth, everything would be over.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I had just finished writing my resignation letter when Jess sent me a message.  
  
\[The doctor checked Lilith and she's fine. Sorry about hitting you earlier‚ÄîI didn't mean to. Remember to wear the ring.\]  
  
Then he transferred me $1,000.  
  
I declined his transfer and threw away the ring.  
  
The next moment, I checked Instagram and saw Lilith's latest post.  
  
Lilith had posted a picture of a check.  
  
\[Just lightly bumped into someone and he's so worried he immediately gave me a $30 million check. I'll forgive you for the money's sake.\]  
  
I looked at this post and smiled coldly.  
  
Jess was so generous with me...  
  
At 8 PM, Jess finally returned with Lilith, bringing more than a dozen delivery men behind him.  
  
I stared at what the delivery men were carrying.  
  
Seeing my gaze, Lilith gave me a smug smile: ""Ophelia, what do you think of all these baby items I bought? It's a bit early to set up a nursery since the baby won't be born for a while, but Jess was so eager we had to buy everything now!""  
  
Looking at these baby items, my heart ached again.  
  
When I first got pregnant, I had also eagerly wanted to buy many things to prepare a nursery. I asked Jess to accompany me, but when he found out, he coldly refused.  
  
""The baby won't be born for so long, why are you in such a hurry? Besides, I'm too busy to go with you.""  
  
Later, I prepared the room myself with my swollen belly. Jess never once offered to help me.  
  
I clenched my fists as my eyes welled up with tears again.  
  
Jess didn't notice my expression. He was happily directing the delivery men where to put everything.  
  
Then he looked at me.  
  
""Ophelia, we'll use the room you previously chose for that child as the nursery‚Äîthat room gets good sunlight.""  
  
""Go move your things out now.""  
  
I stared at Jess's face in silence for a long time.  
  
I knew that even if I refused, the outcome would be the same.  
  
""Fine,"" I agreed, choking back tears.  
  
I turned and painfully moved all the nursery items out, piece by piece.  
  
After I finished, I could hear Lilith and Jess playing around in the bathroom.  
  
They stayed in there for three whole hours before coming out.  
  
When they emerged, Lilith's neck was covered in red marks, her face flushed. Seeing me sitting outside the door, she looked triumphant: ""Sister, don't misunderstand. Jess was just helping me take a bath. Nothing happened between us.""  
  
Jess's expression stiffened slightly when he saw me. His eyes flashed with embarrassment: ""It was just helping her take a bath. She won't misunderstand.""  
  
I ignored Jess's response and simply stared at him. ""I need to talk to you.""  
  
Jess paused, then nodded.  
  
His unusual directness gave me hope.  
  
Lilith's eyes flashed with panic. Jess kissed her forehead and said, ""Wait for me in the bedroom. I'll be right there.""  
  
After Lilith left, I handed my phone to Jess.  
  
But Jess set the phone aside: ""You make good strawberry cake, and Lilith would like some. After you finish making the cake, I'll look at it.""  
  
My heart ached again, needle-like pain spreading through it.  
  
I took a deep breath and went to make the cake.  
  
An hour later, the cake was finally done. Jess looked at it and smiled at me: ""Good job. Lilith loves your strawberry cake the most. Remember to make it for her twice a week from now on.""  
  
I didn't answer him and handed him my phone again.  
  
""Now can you watch this video?""  
  
Jess smiled and took the phone. I continued, ""I'll say it again‚ÄîI was pushed down by Lilith. It wasn't an 'accidental bump' like she claims!""  
  
I thought Jess would surely be angry after seeing the video.  
  
But to my surprise, Jess looked at me with calm, unruffled eyes.  
  
He even deliberately smashed my phone.  
  
He had known all along!

First shot was last Friday. I do IF on most days. I do full fasting day from Sunday evening until Tuesday afternoon, so about 48 hours of just coffee and water. It's usually difficult, but this time was a breeze. Slightly hungry, but I am trying to adjust my calories and macros. So far so good. Zero side-effects. Also, got Protein powder since there is no way I can get to 160+ grams daily. Did a 7.5 mile very difficult hike on Sunday and then we always go to get Mexican food and margaritas. I typically inhale a giant burrito, chips and guac, and have at least one drink. This time I had Albondigas soup, 8 wings, and a Diet Coke. Barely finished it all. Felt great. I do cheat meals Sunday evening as I don't eat until Tuesday. Not like anything super unhealthy, but may be like a large poke bowl, half a chicken, or gyros. It really worked out. I (47m) started at 257 on Friday. Weighed in today at 251. Obviously, it's not all fat, but still, feels good. Exercise, healthy eating, and Zep, and I'll be 180 by New Years

1ldq9zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NordLayer_official/comments/1ldq9zd/small_business_vpn_why_your_consumer_vpn_might/,Small business VPN: Why your consumer VPN might not be enough anymore,"Consumer VPNs are fine for personal stuff: Netflix, gaming, or anonymous browsing. But once your business grows beyond a handful of employees, things get messy quickly.

## Signs your business has outgrown its consumer VPN:

* **Remote work!** Everyone‚Äôs working from home or cafes, and your team needs secure access without constant headaches
* Managing access for multiple users individually feels like herding cats
* Compliance just got serious (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.)
* Scaling: your consumer VPN can‚Äôt keep up when your team expands

## Real-life ways a small business VPN helps

### 1. Secure remote access

Remote work is awesome until an employee leaks business data to someone in Starbucks. A business VPN:

* Encrypts all connections to your internal systems
* Keeps sensitive data safe even on sketchy Wi-Fi
* Protects your team's credentials from being intercepted on the network

### 2. Safer cloud services

AWS, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365 have security, but adding a VPN:

* Lets you limit access by IP address
* Adds another security barrier beyond just logins
* Makes cloud access less risky (and your CTO happier)

### 3. Centralised management and logging (finally)

Keeping track of VPN access and user activity is tough without central control. A business VPN helps by:

* Quickly onboarding and offboarding users from a single interface
* Easily pushing security policies and updates to everyone
* Enforcing MFA without chasing down every employee individually
* Collecting detailed activity logs for audits and troubleshooting
* Spotting suspicious patterns early (like logins from unexpected places)

### 4. Departmental sanity

Not everyone needs access to everything. With a business VPN:

* HR sees HR files, no more, no less
* Devs access code repositories¬†
* Finance sticks strictly to billing and numbers

### 5. Linking your scattered offices with a site-to-site VPN

If your offices are spread out, your VPN should connect them like they‚Äôre right next door:

* Easy sharing of files, printers, and coffee orders
* Consistent access to resources wherever your team sits

### 6. Compliance becomes less terrifying

Industries like healthcare or finance have strict rules. A business VPN helps by:

* Encrypting connections helps meet frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2
* Making audits way less stressful

### 7. Contractor access without chaos

Contractors don't need access to everything. A VPN helps by:

* Giving temporary credentials that won‚Äôt haunt you later
* Keeping clear logs on what contractors do (or don‚Äôt do)

### 8. Ditching geo-restrictions

Operating globally means dealing with geo-blocks. VPNs:

* Bypass annoying restrictions
* Help global teams pretend they're all in the same place (at least digitally)

Still unsure if your business needs a better VPN? Ask away; we've been there, done that, and we're happy to help.",2,1750174449.0,NordLayer_official,0,1.0,False

He's a big guy(6'2, 280, more flab than muscle), not horribly obese but could lose some weight, like many of us. I'm around 6'2, 230. Goal is 200-210 range, i too need to lose weight. I'm crawling towards my goal through lots of lots of small victories with food as other than cardio while living, I'm not doing any heavy exercise.

My coworker on the other hand is constantly lecturing about bad food purchases people make, the terrible items in the office fridge, how the drive-thrus are always so full, and on and on. Nobody ever initiates this and yet we all hear it every day from him. 

Today I'm leaving for work, I don't have many breakfast options, so in my head I'm thinking today is double chocolate donuts day on my ride in, nice! But like most times, I come to a level head and by the time I'm there I know I'm getting a low cal wake up wrap and black coffee. I know I'm allowed the 350 cal donuts but if I start my day with 2 or 3 of them, today is basically lost for calorie tracking as you burn up such a large percentage at breakfast time.

I pull in the Dunkin DriveThru and in front of me is my coworker's truck, in the process of pulling away from the speaker. And there is Dunkin's shiny new LCD screen asking ""Is everything on the screen correct?""

1 Orange juice.
1 Caramel iced coffee.

I followed him the last couple miles to our office as it's a long single lane road, and watched him eat his breakfast, clear as day, being the car directly behind him.

About an hour ago, I'm in the break room and he sees somebody has wings from a local chain place and without being prompted looks at me and says ""Can you believe people eat this processed sh*t covered in sugary sauces?""

I laughed and told him I'm done listening to him judge what other people are eating all the time. I'm not here to talk dieting either. He responds, why, what's your problem?""

""I was behind you at Dunkin and watched you crush a 2000 calorie breakfast just so you can come in here and dump on people using creamy ""fattening"" dressings on their salads? I'm good man.""

With him speechless, I left the break room area.

Texting my wife, she mentioned I came across pretty harsh and some people who act like this are just projecting. They're actually judging themselves, while they're being critical of others' food.

Awful side effects on Day 5,"Background: I had previously taken Wellbutrin a few years ago. That time, my doctor started me at 150mg and after a couple months they bumped me up to 300mg, which worked well for me. I don't recall having side effects during this time. I eventually tapered off under doctor supervision and stopped taking it.

Last week, I started taking this medication again after talking to my doctor. They prescribed 300mg as a starting dose, which I thought was odd, but didn't question it at the time.

I'm on Day 5 now and have been gradually feeling worse and worse physically. Headache, dizziness, nausea,heart palpitations, etc. Part of this may be due to low sleep and reduced appetite, although I'm trying to force myself to eat more. 

I reached out to my doctor's office, and am waiting to hear back.

Anyone else have a doctor start them at a higher dose like this? Is it too late to reduce it back down to 150mg for a while before increasing it to 300mg again?

They said it didn't match the sub's style of horror ‚Äî and I kind of agree. This one is more thriller-puzzle-like and psychological than horror. It is loosely based on the [tragic death of Tamla Horsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Tamla_Horsford), which you may already know about. But the question is: can you tell what really happened that night?*.

**1**

I‚Äôm starting this story by saying one thing: I didn‚Äôt do it. And I don‚Äôt lie, ever. I hate lying.

I know it‚Äôs weird to open with that, but I need you to believe me before the media sinks its claws in.

Because the second you see my face splashed across TikTok or in some true crime podcast, you‚Äôll stop thinking clearly. You‚Äôll stop trusting that I didn‚Äôt kill Denise.

For Christ‚Äôs sake, she was a guest in my house.

Yes, she died there. And yes, I barely knew or even liked her that much. But come on‚Ä¶ why would I murder someone *in my own home*? That‚Äôs insane.

Denise was new in town, and I only invited her to my Wine Wednesday party because my husband insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good look if you invite all the other moms and leave her out"".

So, reluctantly, I asked her at the school gate. Her face lit up when I did, and I actually felt sorry for the girl.¬†

Ever since she moved in with her son, people whispered. You know how small towns are. No place for a single mom, especially not one as pretty as Denise.

The other moms hated how she looked. Her curves, her hair, her eyes‚Ä¶ they couldn‚Äôt stand it. Not me, though. I didn‚Äôt care.¬†

But Tanya told me her husband had been chatting with Denise, smiling too wide, offering to help her with her car or whatever. I would never allow Thomas to do something like that.¬†

Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track. Let me tell you what happened that night.

**2**¬†

She showed up around six with a nice bottle of Italian wine. The other women welcomed her just fine, and it looked like her shot of being accepted.¬†

That night was girls-only. ‚ÄúNo men allowed‚Äù was our only rule, and it was supposed to be when we moms could drink, chat, and dance freely.

Thomas usually hated it. He‚Äôd normally just leave to meet friends at the bar, but that time he just locked himself in the bedroom.¬†

Denise was lively and charming there. Quick with the jokes, generous with the wine. For a moment, I thought she might actually click with the group.

And honestly, it really hit me how beautiful she was at the party, especially when I remember what her *body* looked like laid in the garden the next morning.

It was so...

Never mind. Let‚Äôs keep going.

So, yeah. Some of the girls got a little too excited during the party, including Denise. Drinking too much, dancing like teenagers.

The mood shifted after the alcohol kicked in, and it became a different party. But what really set me off was when I came back from the bathroom and saw Thomas downstairs, helping the girls with their drinks.

The way he handled Denise‚Äôs glass made my stomach turn. So delicate and careful. Like it was some kind of ritual.

I hated it.

He saw me staring and went straight back upstairs. ‚ÄúI was just thirsty,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt come down again.‚Äù

And he didn‚Äôt. But the party was already ruined for me.

I slumped on the couch next to Tanya and watched Denise and the others dancing to whatever 90s pop song was on.

That‚Äôs when I noticed Denise starting to fade.¬†

It happened fast. Too fast. Her eyes started fluttering mid-song, like she was struggling to focus. Then she stumbled onto the floor, dizzy.

We brought her water and tried to keep her upright. She looked wasted, even though I swear I hadn‚Äôt seen her drink nearly enough to justify that.

When Thomas heard the commotion he came back down. ‚ÄúWe should let her rest in the guest room,‚Äù he advised.

I didn‚Äôt love the idea, but what choice did I have? Better that she rest and go home later in one piece.

So we took her to the room, laid her on the bed, turned off the lights, closed the door, and got back to cleaning up the mess from the party.

That was the last time I saw Denise alive.

**3**

I definitely didn‚Äôt hear what the neighbors claim they did that night.

No struggle. No scream. Nothing. But again, I do take two pills before I get to bed.

I woke up early, went to the kitchen to make some coffee‚Äîand saw her lying there in our yard, near the garden. Thomas was already downstairs, visibly shaken. His eyes were wide, red, panicked. He told me he‚Äôd seen Denise kill herself.

He called the cops immediately, and they said she had a deep slash on her wrist and a blade in one hand.

""That's how she did it, with the blade,"" Thomas repeated in the station. ""I saw it all.""

But no one in town really believed him. They kept talking about signs of a fight between Denise and someone else. It didn't help that the police report was... inconclusive.

So the town decided to spin their own crazy theories.

The first one? That I‚Äôd done it. Tanya‚Äîthat two-faced bitch‚Äîstarted gossiping that I‚Äôd been glaring at Denise the whole night. That I killed her out of jealousy, out of the way Thomas looked at her.

You can still find Reddit threads out there defending that lunatic version.

The second theory? That‚Äôs the one the media ran with: that Thomas had done it.

That he drugged her drink‚Äîthat careful glass he handed‚Äîand tried something that night.. She resisted and he panicked. So he killed her, and his old high school buddy, the town‚Äôs police chief, helped him cover it up.

I don‚Äôt talk about that one much because it still hurts. Especially after what happened to Thomas the week after.

I found him dead in the garage. The neighbors, vultures that they are, say guilt drove him to the gun.

**4**

So yeah, it‚Äôs hard for me to keep talking about this. It tore my family apart.

But I need to say it again, just so we‚Äôre clear: I didn‚Äôt kill Denise. I swear on it, and I never lie. 

That‚Äôs exactly what I told the cops, over and over.

Can you believe those pigs came back after Thomas died and asked if I did the same to him? If I killed my own husband?

I didn‚Äôt reply a word to them this time, you know. Just kept quiet, outraged by that question being given to a mourning widow.

So they soon gave up and never asked me again. 

Thank God...

Im Male, 39, non smoker  and non drinker- other thann coffee which I suppose is relevant here.

I've had PVCs on and off throughout my life, at extremely unpredictable levels.

For example  10 years ago I had a terrible bout where I was hiving them every few seconds for hours, ended up in ER where they stopped  and then started again later.

I have had repeated ECGs and an echo cardiogram too all of which detected no abnormalities so it was put down to stress and  suffering from panic disorder.

Oddly enough I have had very few PVCs in the last couple of years despite going through an absolute horrendously stressful period and by far the most  difficult period of my life.

However  today without warning I had a  single PVC that felt much more stronger, like the compensatory  gap was longer than usual so it panicked me for a second that my heart had stopped and then the stronger beat was very powerful- it produced  a strong adrenaline reaction that  people with PVCS may know about.

The only thing I did differently today was have an extra coffee and a stronger one than usual.

Is this the probable cause and has anyone else ever had a particularly strong PVC beat so that it almost felt like your heart had stopped?

1ldq0ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1ldq0ae/atelier_playa_mujeres/,Atelier Playa Mujeres,"Just got back from 5 nights at Atelier and wanted to post a review, since I found them so helpful when I was choosing a place! It was my first time at an AI, and in Mexico, so my experiences are probably colored by that. We booked an Inspira swim-out suite through Costco Travel. Apologies if this is too long - I love to read a detailed review so I wanted to write one as well! 

**Overall** 

This was the best vacation I've ever had. Everything about the hotel screamed luxury. The staff were super friendly and accommodating, our room was great, we had a blast. The hotel could be a little confusing to navigate at times, it's pretty big and the different buildings only connect at certain points. There's a site for guests with activities, restaurants, and a map, but it wasn't always very intuitive to use. We got the swim out room, and I 100% think it was worth it, as was dinner at Maria Dolores. 

I celebrated a birthday while there, and the staff decorated our room for it, brought out a special birthday dessert everywhere we ate that day, and left a handwritten card and a bottle of bubbly in the room - it was so fun and unexpected, and really made my day. 

**Room**

We had a king swim out suite and found it super comfortable. We had a little noise from the room above us, but not too bad. I was worried about bathroom privacy given the sliding doors around the tub, but didn't end up feeling too exposed having a bath! Loved the shower. My only complaint is that the lighting in much of the room was kind of dim, otherwise, everything felt super comfortable. We spent a ton of time out on the patio/pool area. We only saw other people in the swim out area a couple times - we mostly stayed to the area of the pool directly in front of our own room and didn't use it (or see anyone else use it) to get from the room to anywhere else. There was a row of trees between the swim lane and the path around the resort, so even though it wasn't private, it still felt pretty secluded.

**Inspira perks**

We went with an Inspira room purely for the attached pool, and that was very worth it to me! We checked out the Inspira only pools around the hotel - the rooftop and the ocean front one - but didn't use them much. The rooftop pool was pretty small and usually very crowded, but the bar/lounge area next to it was lovely, it was great getting a breeze. 

I had some mixed feelings about the butler service. We had two staff taking care of us during the day - one in the morning, one in the evening. They were both so lovely, but I did feel some awkwardness! They set up a whatsapp chat to keep us informed on activities etc, and asked to meet up with us in person most days to check in, which was honestly a little inconvenient as we were bouncing around between places and activities. We didn't make any dinner reservations in advance of our trip, and they were able to get us tables at restaurants that the site showed were full, which was very appreciated. We did have an off-putting interaction our first day, where the regular butler was out and the person they had filling in was pretty rude in response to some questions, but the two butlers who worked with us the rest of our stay were super kind and helpful. The caveat is that we had to follow up on most things - if we only talked about it in person, it didn't happen, we only really got stuff that we then followed up on in our whatsapp chat. 

The Inspira section at the beach was great. We were able to get a cabana most days we went, and that alone was a huge blessing. The service there was a little hit and miss - sometimes it was well staffed, other times less so, but it didn't really impact my experience. 

**Food/drinks**

This is the one I've seen talked about most for Atelier, so I'm going to get detailed! Overall, we thought the food was great, though we did have some stress about getting reservations for dinner every night. 

The drinks were pretty good, but a lot of the cocktails I got that had sugar or simple syrup tasted like artificial sweetener. The house wines are pretty mid, but I thought the white was nigh undrinkable. Pretty much every restaurant will try to sell you bottles of wine that aren't included, but if you're a big wine drinker that might be the way to go. 

We did breakfasts at El Suspiro, Cafecito, and the buffet at Mercado 19. Some of the buffet options (eggs, smoothies) at Mercado 19 were still made to order, but they had a ton of options, and table service for drinks. Suspiro felt like the nicer option for breakfast, I'd recommend the croque madame and s'mores waffles. We tried Cafecito as a grab and go option when we wanted to hit the beach early, but didn't love their pastries or yogurt, and the black coffee was also not as good as in the restaurants. 

The beach side food service was our favorite lunch- we loved everything we had, but especially the mushroom arancini. We also visited the Italian spot, Cilento, for lunch a couple times - loved the prosciutto and arugula pizza, but most of the other things we tried were pretty underwhelming. 

Cala di Luna was our favorite dinner spot, the strawberries jubilee for dessert was really fun! Los Abrazos was also pretty good, the salad bar had some fun options. I've heard Takeshi mentioned as the best dinner: the sushi was pretty good, as was the Mongolian beef, but the beef was served with rice that seemed intended as a side for Indian dishes (it had cardamom, allspice, and cloves in it, and really carried that taste). We tried Mercado 19 for dinner one night and got a huge spread of tacos, but unfortunately they all felt pretty bland.

Maria Dolores was the highlight for food on the trip. The cocktails were amazing, the waiter made some great recommendations for food. Everything tasted fantastic, and there were so many fun and unexpected flavors and pairings. We got half off for being Inspira guests but I would have happily paid full price - do not miss it. 

**Hydrotherapy** 

We had a free session as Inspira members, and it was relaxing, but I'm not sure I'd do it again. We were walked through a circuit of steam room, sauna, cold plunge, hot tub, some fun scented showers, and then shown to the ""Sensations"" pool. Everything except the sensations pool was divided by gender, and there were set times for each section of the experience, with no doubling back to revisit the sauna or steam room once we left them. The sensations pool had some massage jets in it but I didn't get much out of them. The sauna was the best part. I'd skip this one! 

**Beach** 

The beach was beautiful! The sand and waves were both warm, soft, and just overall lovely. We did have a seaweed advisory, and there were yellow flags on the beach every day for caution. That said, I didn't find the seaweed to be a huge problem. There were staff cleaning up the seaweed from the beach pretty regularly, and it didn't really get in our way in the water. 

**Pools**

We mainly stuck to the party pool - the swim up bars were really fun! The pool never felt too busy or crowded, and things didn't get too rowdy, even with activities like water cycling happening in other parts of the pool. The Inspira ocean front pool was pretty much always empty, and the ""relaxing"" pool was just a little further from our room, so we didn't spend much time at those. Overall, the number of people at each pool was the main difference in them. They're all kept at a very comfortable temperature, and they're all pretty shallow - I don't think the water is ever more than 4ft at any of them. 

**Activites**

We only did a handful of activities - a Spanish class, bead art, a back of house tour, and then some stuff at the night club and rooftop bar. The Spanish class was just us, so our instructor customized it to what we wanted to learn, and was just about the nicest person we met. The bead art class was pretty busy, but the instructor was still able to come help everyone if needed, and I really enjoyed it (plus we got some cute souveniers out of it!). The back of house tour was kind of dull, but one of the guys on the tour was very interested in the water filtration system, so that was probably a driving factor in it being a little boring - but it was cool getting to see in kitchen and food/booze storage! The live music at the rooftop bar and at the nightclub were both really fun. I didn't love the nightclub aside from the performances, but I'm also not much for nightlife so ymmv.

  
I hope this helps someone else with vacation planning!

I was leaving work around 5:45 PM, just like I always do. Same walk through the parking garage, same elevator, same car. I even remember fumbling for my keys like always, dropping them once like I always do. Nothing felt different‚Äîuntil I got home.

I walked into my apartment and immediately noticed the light was on in the kitchen. I never leave lights on. I‚Äôm obsessive about it, almost to the point of compulsion. I live alone. I double-checked the door. Locked, no sign of forced entry. I thought maybe I was just being forgetful.

But then I looked at the fridge. There was a magnet on it that I didn‚Äôt recognize. A small red one shaped like a chili pepper. I don‚Äôt own that. I never have. Underneath it was a shopping list I didn‚Äôt write‚Äî‚Äúmilk, paprika, batteries, twine.‚Äù The handwriting wasn‚Äôt mine.

I felt sick.

I checked my phone to call a friend, maybe just to hear another voice, and that‚Äôs when it got worse. My call log was full of numbers I didn‚Äôt recognize, mostly recent‚Äîdozens of calls from someone named ‚ÄúLia.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know any Lia. I never have. I went to my texts. Conversations were there, long ones, full of inside jokes and references that meant nothing to me‚Äîbut apparently I‚Äôd replied. My name was in them. My voice, somehow, in attached voice messages.

Panicked, I went to my room. My bed was unmade. I always make it before work. The window was slightly open. I never open that window because the latch is broken. It takes a screwdriver to open and close it properly, and I don‚Äôt even own one.

I backed out of the room, heart pounding. That‚Äôs when I heard the shower running.

No one should be in my apartment.

I didn‚Äôt run. I stood there, frozen, for what felt like minutes. The shower stopped. I heard the curtain slide back. Then footsteps.

Someone walked down the hallway‚Ä¶ toward me.

But no one came around the corner.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I grabbed my keys, bolted out the door, and drove to my sister‚Äôs place without thinking. When I got there, I told her everything. She didn‚Äôt say anything for a long time. Then she asked, carefully, ‚ÄúAre you sure today is Wednesday?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù I said.

She turned her phone to me. The lock screen read: Sunday, 4:08 PM.

I laughed, thinking it was a glitch.

Then she pulled up a photo she took that morning of us at brunch. I was in it. Laughing, drinking coffee. Wearing a blue sweater I‚Äôve never seen before.

She said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been staying with me since Thursday. You said someone broke into your apartment and nothing felt right.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt gone back since.

A week before our engagement, Robert Lockman dropped a bombshell‚Äîour ceremony wouldn't happen as planned. Instead, it was being pushed back another month.  
  
""Diana's first solo concert falls on the same day,"" he explained, as if that justified everything. ""It's a huge milestone for her, and I can't miss it. What's the difference if we get engaged a little later? We're still getting married, aren't we?""  
  
This wasn't the first time. It was the third.  
  
The first time, Diana had fallen ill overseas, panicked, and begged him to come. The second, she'd impulsively booked a trip, and Robert had raced after her like a knight chasing a damsel in distress.  
  
And now, this.  
  
I set my phone down and turned to Anthony Norton‚Äîmy childhood friend and the crown prince of Royal City. ""Need a fianc√©e?"" I asked.  
  
On the day we were supposed to exchange rings, Robert was too busy wrapping Diana in a celebratory embrace at her concert banquet to notice‚Äîuntil footage of Anthony and me announcing our engagement flashed across every screen in the city. His face darkened, his knuckles whitening around his glass.  
  
Anthony studied me, his gaze steady. ""Are you sure about this? Can you really let him go?""  
  
I shrugged. ""Three strikes, Anthony. Three times he's chosen her over me. Maybe the universe is screaming what I refused to hear‚Äîwe were never meant to be. You can't thaw a heart that's already frozen solid.""  
  
A slow smile curved his lips. ""Then let's make it official. The Nortons don't do quiet engagements. I want the whole world to know who you are.""  
  
For the first time in years, I felt a flicker of certainty. ""Alright,"" I said.  
  
Back at the apartment, I was packing when Robert stormed in. His eyes landed on my suitcase, and he scoffed. ""Running away again, Trudy? Four years of this drama‚Äîdon't you ever get tired?""  
  
""It's just a postponement,"" he snapped, frustration sharpening his tone. ""Not a breakup. Stop overreacting.""  
  
""I'm not running,"" I said evenly, folding another sweater. ""Just organizing."" But inside, I knew‚Äîthis time, I wouldn't come back.  
  
He yanked at his tie, already moving on. ""Good. While you're at it, prep the guest room. Diana's staying here‚Äîit's closer to her venue.""  
  
""Fine,"" I said without looking up. ""Julie can handle it tomorrow.""  
  
My calmness threw him. His voice softened. ""Look, I know you're upset. Go pick out jewelry tomorrow‚Äîmy treat. I've just been swamped with Diana's return. Her place is a wreck, so I've been helping her settle in.""  
  
""Don't bother,"" I said, the weight in my chest crushing. ""I'll keep myself busy.""  
  
Relief flashed in his eyes. ""Oh, and Diana mentioned she wants the sunroom for piano practice. You're finally clearing your stuff out?""  
  
I inhaled deeply. ""Starting tomorrow, it's hers.""  
  
So are you.  
  
The next morning, before I could even grab coffee, my phone exploded. Diana was back‚Äîand the internet was on fire with photos of her and Robert locked in a tight embrace at the airport.

1ldpvlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appleton/comments/1ldpvlk/no_longer_supporting_tempest_coffee/,No longer supporting Tempest Coffee,"As a former employee of Tempest Coffee Collective, I think it is important that the public knows the background of the business and how they treat their employees. I recently quit along with several others after recent comments about LGBTQ+ folks and learning the owners‚Äô criminal history.¬†Some people are already aware of this information, but I know not everyone is. 

\*Warning for child abuse\*

The owners, Lucy and Larry Lonadier, were involved in their son‚Äôs death in 1982. Rather, they were directly responsible for his death, acting upon the orders of another ‚Äúreligious leader‚Äù and beating their child to death. The details are shocking- their three year old son was tied and gagged, beaten for hours on end until he could no longer sit, and was taught to cry out to Jesus for help while his parents abused him. On the day of his death, the child was unconscious for hours before he was taken to the hospital. Family members were quoted at the funeral noting how cold and detached both Lucy and Larry were.

This book chapter has the most details on the case; it can be borrowed for free and the relevant pages are 166-170 ([https://archive.org/details/notorious9200ston/page/n519/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/notorious9200ston/page/n519/mode/2up))¬†

Around the same time I found out about all this, I also heard about a conversation the owners had with another employee. It was mostly about Pride Month, and their comments were really disheartening. They said most of the employees they've had issues with have been LGBTQ+, claimed Christians are the most persecuted group today, and said that they can't wait for Pride Month to be over. Afterward, one of the owners went to a different employee to vent that the first one had ""stabbed her in the back"" just for having that conversation. The employee the owner originally talked to seemed totally caught off guard by it all and quit the next day.

With all that in mind, I think people deserve the full picture when deciding where to spend their money. Tempest is already pretty overpriced, with small portions and less than high quality ingredients. But learning about the owners‚Äô past and the kind of environment they foster really made it an easy decision for me not to support them anymore. Everyone‚Äôs free to make their own choices, but I think this is something the community should be aware of.",75,1750173519.0,Appleton,15,0.94,False

1ldpv06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ldpv06/confused_am_i_pregnant/,Confused - Am I pregnant?,"We have been trying to conceive for about 2 years now with no luck. At this point, I just expect not to be pregnant each month. Well this cycle has been weird, and I am confused! Any insight or shared experiences (no matter the outcome) would be appreciated. 

I should start by saying that I do not test for ovulation, so all my numbers are based off what my Premom app predicts. 

9/10/11 DPO - I had sore nipples and heavy boobs. Along with that, I was just feeling blah. No appetite, but felt sick if I didn't eat. As soon as I ate, I would get super gassy (stomach gurgling). 

12 DPO - experienced light pink spotting after having sex. Thought it was my period starting, but was just the one instance. No appetite, still gassy if I ate. 

13 DPO - CM was more yellow with a tiny bit of stringy brown. Barely noticeable, only saw it when checking cm. No appetite, still gassy if I ate. 

Saturday - Day AF Due - Started lightly spotting (no clots), but flow never picked up. Typically spot for a hour or two and then turns into a heavy flow (soaking super tampon in 3 hours). I went the whole day and a panty liner would have sufficed. My period is normally very consistent when it comes to days of bleeding and flow level. Still no appetite. 

Sunday - woke up and still only spotting. Ran to store and then took blue dye pregnancy test, had a faint positive. Still no appetite. 

Monday - spotting stopped. No appetite, tried to eat but instantly nauseous. Nausea continued on and off all day. 

Tuesday (today) - took another blue dye test when I woke up at 6am - kinda see a very very faint line - but pretty sure its negative. I did wake up at 3am to pee, but didn't think to test then. I ran to the store and bought some First Response Pink Dye and took when I got home - clearly negative. I still feel like crap, don't want to eat, kind of nauseous trying to have my coffee. I'm also having backaches, and my pelvic region feels like its stretching if that makes sense. It's not a normal cramping feeling.  We will see how the rest of the day goes. 

While I don't test for ovulation, I do track my ""symptoms"" each cycle and have never experienced this. Was my faint positive a false positive? Am I having a chemical pregnancy and spotting was just a weird period? Did I possibly ovulate later than predicted and I am testing too early and pee is too diluted? I plan to see how today goes and maybe test again tomorrow or in a few days. If I am out this cycle, that is totally fine - I just hate this unknown. Something is not right with my body and if I am not pregnant - I feel like I should go to urgent care to figure out what else could be wrong. ",1,1750173478.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

1ldpusq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ldpusq/lending_a_jacket_to_female_friend/,Lending a jacket to female friend,"This is a bit of a strange post, but it's because I was having a discussion with my friend about not offering her my jacket when she was cold, so this is the current situation.

She is a female friend the same age as me. We were doing a coffee catch up and she was helping me with French at a cafe. When I arrived at the cafe, her partner was there. We shook hands briefly and just said hello. He went to work which was across the road. Again, we are just friends so there's absolutely nothing wrong here. However, her partner's boss was also at the cafe and he was sitting at the table next to us.

My friend was sitting on the other side of the table from me and said that she was cold. My first instinct was to not lend her my jacket because I didn't really know her partner that well and also her partner's boss was right there. So anything I do could be relayed back to the partner, and I didn't want it to appear that I was trying to flirt with her or trying to be accommodating in a ""man to woman"" way, as I see her as just a friend so it should really just be a friend-to-friend encounter.

She asked for the jacket anyway and strongly requested that I give it to her, so I said ""sure, here you go"" and gave it to her.

After discussing it later, she asked why didn't I give her the jacket initially? I said well, because your partner's boss was there and I didn't see it as appropriate for you to be wearing my clothes.

Nothing promiscuous going on here - it's all very innocent. It's just a miscommunication. However, I would be curious to get a second opinion if anyone has any thoughts on this.

**Edit:** Someone pointed out that my heart was in the right place wanting to be respectful of boundaries, but this particular act of kindness probably falls well within normal friend behavior. What do you all think?",1,1750173465.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm planning to study at the Defence Public Library, which opens at 10 AM. But I need to start studying by 8 AM, and I‚Äôll already be in Defence around that time, preferably somewhere in Sector Z.

Can anyone recommend a cafe or coffee place that opens at 8 AM, where I can sit and study for a couple of hours? I‚Äôd of course be buying something like a coffee in exchange, just need a spot that‚Äôs quiet-ish and okay with someone sitting with a book for a while.

Navy blue, 
Reading articles, 
A signature home scent, 
Drinking red wine, 
Casually throwing on a trench coat, 
Walking in heels with ease, 
Fancy soap in your bathroom,  
Good handwriting/good signature,  
Ordering coffee after dinner,  
People who go places alone, 
Wearing a quarter zip, zipped up, 
Thin drinking glasses, 
Going to the grocery store just for dinner that night, 
Having ‚Äúa guy‚Äù (a lawn guy, cheese guy), 
The smell of sunscreen,

**Original post is at the bottom**

So, I was pissed and I plotted to give them all a taste of their own medicine!

It took me close to two fucking weeks to get everything back to where it was and I froze and combined the abomination they served me on Mother's Day for Father's Day.

I told my adult children that they would be responsible for dealing with Fathers Day and I volunteered at the community center before I realized that it was father's day üòâüòÅ

My kids and husband are inherently cheap EXCEPT when treating themselves --- so, I knew this was going to be fun 


Father's Day is typically a huge brunch with an assortment of pastries, omelette's, home style crispy potatoes, bacon and sausage, homemade bagels, along with their favorite coffee and freshly squeezed juice and for dinner BBQ with all his favorites plus sides. It's a lot of work and I would do it all myself from beginning to end 


I tend to batch cook and typically have a freezer full of premade meals ready to go. I made sure that there was NOTHING available EXCEPT the stuff they served me on Mother's day. I used up all my premade meals during the month and made my life easy.

I purposely didn't buy any groceries the week before and used up pretty much everything --- i think there were two eggs left and maybe a quarter gallon of milk. No bagels, toast, really nothing but some frozen veggies, condiments, frozen fish and the frozen ""delicious casserole"" of the crap they made for mother's Day ü§¢. So their only options were to either warm that up or actually make an effort to shop and plan.

I've been pretending that the washer is broken and ""they're waiting on a part"" , oops wrong part gotta reorder, now it's something else and have been sending the three stooges to the laundry mat to do their individual laundry along with the towels and sheets. They THINK I've been hand washing my clothes when in reality I've just been using the machine -- I just toggled the fuse so it won't just turn on üòÅ. I love it when they complain/whine about how expensive it is (because I'm not paying for it) and how hot and humid the laundry mat is. They fucked around and now they're finding out.

The lawn and all the equipment was very generously mowed and fixed by my son's friend and his grandpa. Son's friend embarrassed the hell out of him and when he told his grandpa that he wanted to mow the lawn for me they both volunteered to make it right. Husband was incredibly embarrassed and PISSED because he didn't want people talking shit about him so husband and kids have been doing the lawn since but whatever --- I'm still incredibly annoyed.

***The day before Father's Day***

I baked a little over 6 dozen cupcakes. Six dozen for the community center and the leftovers for the house.

Had they actually thought about it, they could have saved the cupcakes for breakfast but they demolished them on Saturday --- so nothing was left ü•≤üòÇ I'm just sitting back and smiling at what I know is going to happen. 

I also reminded them that I'm going to be gone for a ""bit"" on Sunday.

***Father's Day morning***

I get up bright and early. Load up the car and take off.

I stop to put gas and text my husband -- HAPPY FATHER'S DAY! LOVE YOU! Kids are going to take care of you and spoil you today üíñ See you later, don't hold the meal up for me --- I don't know when I'll be done. He would see it when he would get up.

I go to the community center that is hosting a Father's Day event. I drop off the cupcakes, help set-up, chitchat with everyone, take pictures as ""proof"", and just did whatever was needed.

11:23 am --- first text comes in from my oldest.
Where r u? (I ignored it) 

11:55 am --- first call comes in from my youngest 
(I ignored that as well)

12:15 pm --- I called back the oldest and told them that I was busy at the center and I reminded them that they were supposed to handle father's day. They were PISSED and said FINE! and hung up 

12:23 pm --- youngest calls back and says there's nothing to eat. I ask them what they bought? They say Nothing! I asked them to just make something from the fridge --- they say there's nothing üòÅüòà I told them to just make coffee and have the cupcakes (which I know they've already eaten) Those are gone -- I tell them to check the freezer there ""might be"" a breakfast casserole in there üòÅ. Cool, they found it üòÑ 
They want to know how long to bake it? 350 for 40 minutes and check it.

We hang up and I'm laughing at what is about to happen 

1 pm --- I call my husband to wish him a happy father's day AND to find out how it's going? üòà

He doesn't pick up 

I'm pretty much done with the event but I'm sure as hell not going home 


I decide to go to my favorite bakery and get a cup of coffee and some pie

Before I leave the bakery, I text my kids and ask them how it was going? No response 


I then went to buy his Father's Day gift (last minute like they always do and what mothers Day hasn't included a lengthy trip to home Depot while I'm left to deal with whatever they've left behind) --- a organizational drawer thing for the garage (that I knew was online only) but I actually needed to return some stuff. So sad that the close to our house home Depot didn't have it, so obviously I have to drive to the one an hour away that's next to the movie theater --- I might have parked at home Depot but I didn't go to home Depot until AFTER the movie. I walked in and walked out -- so I could truthfully say that I went there but couldn't find it (because I honestly didn't care to look). 

Meanwhile, I've received calls and texts from all three of them.

I text back the kids and ask them what they're planning for dinner --- they're thinking about ordering pizza but Dad is mad because the food didn't taste good, there was no coffee left (there was in the pantry), and they ""forgot"" it was Father's Day (no you didn't because where they both work had huge happy father's day promotions that they HAD to help set-up)

Cool, go ahead and eat without me.

I stopped by and ate at my favorite fast food place (also happens to be my husbands favorite) because I had to take my medicine 

While I was waiting for my food, my husband calls me back and I could tell he was PISSED. I listened to him vent about their lack of thought and consideration and then he got pissy that I wasn't there (yeah, there to cook and cater)

I explained to him that I told them that they would have to handle it and I volunteered before I knew it was father's day -- I even ""came through"" with the breakfast casserole.

He said it was disgusting and he thought they didn't cook it right --- I told him that it was the leftovers from mother's day and I didn't want to waste food so I froze some üòÅüòàü§£

Told him I'll call him back after I ate and hung up üòâüòÅüòà

Enjoyed my meal and called him when I was halfway home (so they wouldn't ask me to pick up food for them) and stopped to top off the gas. 

He said that they hadn't done ""anything"" and they were waiting for me to get home.

I called them and told them that I already ate, I've had a long day, and I'm just going to take a shower and go to sleep 

When I got home, you could tell there was tension and they still hadn't ordered anything or picked up anything.

Monday, I slept in and I know there was nothing for them to eat or take with for lunch. 

I know how to cook and bake -- so there was plenty of food if you are willing to make an effort 

I called my husband and asked him to pick up dinner on his way home 

Monday night, they're all still pissy and asking when I'm going grocery shopping? Thursday maybe Friday-- because why not?

Then I told the oldest to pick up dinner for all of us on Tuesday and the youngest would be picking up dinner on Wednesday and if they don't, then I'll order whatever I feel like eating and charge it to their credit card. (They both work full time and make plenty of money AND they don't pay for anything in terms of rent, utilities and the like --- so them buying dinner is not going to set them back in the least)


I'm still not done but I have never seen my husband so... (a combination of pissed, aggravated, disappointed)

I'm going to wait until he's in a better place and start pointing out how everything he's upset about are the EXACT same things I've been asking them to change for years.

I will continue my little life lessons through birthdays and Christmas and anniversaries and HOPEFULLY between now my birthday or next mother's Day they get their shit together

It's also helpful that my kids have friends that are quick to point out their bullshit

**Original post ‚¨áÔ∏è**


***""I got up and made her a gourmet breakfast and she didn't appreciate it""***

Translation: I got up, used every fucking dish, bowl, and piece of cookware making a HUGE mess (left for me to deal with) that could have easily been avoided. Ruined over a hundred dollars worth of groceries only to ""create"" something that looked like it had already been chewed and spit out. Mmmmmmm so delicious and they can't understand why I'm not more excited 

***I helped do the laundry***

Translation: I over packed the washer to the point that it was unbalanced and it moved itself into the middle of the laundry room filled with water and essentially two and a half loads of wet heavy laundry. Let's not even discuss the fact that nothing was separated or pockets checked 

***I'm going to do the lawn, trimming, and leaf/grass blowing***


Translation: I'm going to break the lawnmower by mowing over landscape rocks. I'm going to break the trimmer by getting landscape fabric wrapped around the motor and string head. I'm going to break the leaf blower because I'm going to use the wrong fuel.

***My husband and adult children then have the fucking nerve to call ME ungrateful and hard to please***

I'm exhausted by their stupidity and lack of basic awareness 

Edit: I have absolutely taught and shown all of them how to properly cook, clean, and do the yardwork --- they're just assholes who think they know better

My wife and I grew up in central Florida. Currently live in Raleigh, NC but feeling pulled back closer home. Neither of us love the idea of living in Orlando, but the proximity to family would be very nice. 

On a visit home last week we popped up to your lovely city for a concert. We didn‚Äôt spend much time, but just drove around Riverside/Avondale a bit. I have to admit I sort of fell in love, I love historic and walkable neighborhoods. We noticed that almost every single person we interacted with was so incredibly nice. Like wildly nice, from the busboy to the concert security, bathroom janitor, random people on the street. I‚Äôve lived all around the south but this still stuck out. We also grabbed a quick breakfast at Community Loaves, total gem. Liked it so much we stopped again on our way driving through town heading back to NC. 

I‚Äôve had this nagging thought since last week that we should consider Jacksonville. But since I have so little familiarity, I thought your perspectives might help. We have a toddler. We are solid ‚Äúmid-sized city‚Äù people. Things that we like include parks, riding bikes (both for commuting and recreation), music (indie, folk, etc.), coffee, food, history, art. My wife is a pediatric nurse and I understand that Jacksonville is quite the medical city but curious for specific perspectives. I work in transportation engineering, specifically bicyclist and pedestrian safety, and while I could bring my job with me I‚Äôd like to know what the active transportation scene is like. We‚Äôd love to be able to eventually buy a 3/2 house in a historic neighborhood for $500k or less (from perusing zillow that seems possible?).

All that to say, if nothing else we thoroughly enjoyed our whirlwind time in Jacksonville. Thanks for any thoughts you might have to help us as we consider our future!

Edit: any specific thoughts on Springfield as compared to Riverside/Avondale? I drove through Springfield briefly a couple years ago. I loved the old homes and access to downtown, though it did feel rough around the edges. However we aren‚Äôt afraid of a little of that, as long as things are generally safe.

1ldpjv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ldpjv2/the_girl_with_serpent_dreams/,The Girl with Serpent Dreams,"Alexandria Sutton woke up screaming again.

The sheets clung to her sweat-soaked body like wet cement, and for a moment‚Äîjust a moment‚Äîshe couldn't tell where the nightmare ended and her cramped studio apartment began. She'd bitten her tongue. The metal taste mixed with the phantom flavor from the dream‚Äîsomething ancient and wrong, like licking the inside of a tomb.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. 3:47 AM. A text from Maya: *heard you through the wall again. you okay?*

Alex lived in a converted warehouse in Pilsen, the kind of place that advertised ""artist lofts"" but delivered paper-thin walls and pipes that groaned like dying animals. Maya had the unit next door, which meant she got a front-row seat to Alex's nightly horror shows.

*yeah. sorry. bad one.*

Three dots appeared immediately. *coming over*

Before Alex could protest, she heard Maya's key in the lock. They'd exchanged spares months ago, after Alex had locked herself out during a particularly bad episode of what she called her ""artistic fugues""‚Äîthose times when she'd paint for hours and emerge with no memory of what she'd created.

Maya appeared in the doorway wearing an oversized Bulls jersey and flannel pajama pants, her dark hair twisted up in a messy bun. She carried two mugs and the kind of determined expression that had gotten her through law school and into a job at the public defender's office.

""Chamomile,"" she said, pressing one mug into Alex's trembling hands. ""And don't give me any shit about it being for old ladies. You need to sleep.""

""I did sleep. That's the fucking problem.""

Maya settled onto the bed, careful not to disturb the scattered sketchbooks and half-finished canvases that covered every surface of Alex's apartment. ""Same dream?""

""Variations on a theme."" Alex sipped the tea, grateful for something real to focus on. ""She had six arms this time. Maybe eight. They kept... shifting.""

""The woman?""

""If you can call her that."" Alex pulled her knees up to her chest. The dream was already fading at the edges, the way dreams do, but the core of it remained vivid. ""She's in this empty place. Just nothing. And she's reaching for me with all these arms, and her mouth is moving but no sound comes out. There's blood‚Äîno, not blood. Red tears. They're streaming down her face like she's crying, but her expression never changes. And I know that if she touches me, I'll become her. Or she'll become me. Or we'll become something else entirely.""

Maya was quiet for a moment. In the distance, a siren wailed‚ÄîChicago's nightly lullaby. ""How long has it been now?""

""Three months. Maybe four."" Alex laughed, bitter. ""Hard to keep track when you're losing your mind.""

""You're not losing your mind.""

""No? Because dreaming about a woman with blood tears who want to wear your skin is totally normal.""

""You've been through a lot. Your mom‚Äî""

""Don't."" The word came out sharper than Alex intended. She softened her voice. ""I know you're trying to help, but this isn't about her.""

Her mother had died six months ago. Cancer, the slow kind that gave you just enough time to say everything you needed to say and realize it would never be enough. But the dreams had started before that, back when her mom was still pretending the chemo was working and Alex was pretending to believe her.

Maya changed tactics. ""Show me what you're working on.""

Alex gestured vaguely at the canvases propped against the walls. Her latest series was all abstracts‚Äîswirling blacks and deep reds, shapes that suggested violence without quite depicting it. They sold well enough at the galleries, the kind of art that let rich people feel edgy without actual danger.

But there were other paintings too, ones she kept turned to the wall. The ones she made during her fugues.

""Liam stopped by yesterday,"" Maya said, too casual. ""Wanted to know if you were okay.""

""I'm sure he did.""

""He cares about you.""

Alex shrugged. ""Maybe. I just wish he'd stop trying so hard.""

""That's not fair. He's been a good friend‚Äî""

""I know. You're right."" Alex set down her mug. ""I'm being a bitch. He's sweet. It's just... sometimes I feel like he's trying to fix me, you know?""

Maya didn't argue, which meant she'd noticed it too. That concerned look Liam got sometimes, like he was worried about her. Which was nice, but also exhausting.

Alex's skin prickled suddenly, a sensation like insects crawling just beneath the surface. She scratched at her forearm absently.

""You okay?""

""Yeah, just‚Äî"" Alex stopped. Where she'd been scratching, faint lines had appeared on her skin. Not quite a rash, not quite a pattern. They writhed slightly in the dim light, serpentine curves that seemed to shift when she looked at them directly.

""What the hell?"" Maya leaned closer.

Alex blinked hard, and the lines were gone. Just her normal skin, slightly red from scratching.

""Did you see‚Äî""

""See what?"" Maya touched her forehead. ""No fever. When's the last time you ate actual food?""

""I'm not hallucinating from low blood sugar.""

""Humor me.""

Alex tried to remember. Yesterday was a blur of canvas and paint, broken only by Liam's visit. He'd brought Thai food, she remembered now. Pad see ew from the place on 18th Street. They'd eaten it sitting on her fire escape, watching the sun set over the city's jagged skyline.

""Yesterday. Liam brought dinner.""

Maya's expression softened. ""See? He's not so bad.""

""One decent act doesn't make him‚Äî"" Alex's phone rang, cutting her off. Unknown number, but something made her answer anyway.

""Ms. Sutton?"" A woman's voice, professional and cold. ""This is Dr. Elizabeth Grant from University of Chicago Medical Center. I'm sorry to call so early, but we have some concerns about your recent blood work.""

""What blood work?"" Alex hadn't been to a doctor since her mother's funeral.

A pause. ""You were seen in our emergency department two weeks ago? October 3rd?""

""No, I‚Äî"" But even as she denied it, a memory surfaced. Hazy, dreamlike. White walls. The smell of antiseptic. A needle sliding into her arm.

""Ms. Sutton?""

""Sorry, I... yes. I remember now."" She didn't, not really, but something in the doctor's tone made her lie. ""What kind of concerns?""

""We found some unusual markers in your blood. Nothing immediately dangerous, but we'd like you to come in for follow-up testing. How's this morning? Say, nine o'clock?""

""I have a deadline‚Äî""

""Ms. Sutton, I really must insist. The sooner we run these tests, the better.""

After she hung up, Alex found Maya staring at her. ""You went to the ER and didn't tell me?""

""I don't remember going."" The words sounded insane even to her. ""I mean, I must have, right? But it's all... fuzzy.""

""Fuzzy like your painting fugues?""

""Yeah. Exactly like that.""

They sat in silence while the city woke up around them. Delivery trucks rumbling past. The El train screeching in the distance. Normal sounds of a normal world that felt increasingly foreign to Alex.

""I'll go with you,"" Maya said finally. ""To the hospital.""

""You have court.""

""Screw court. This is more important.""

Alex wanted to argue, but the truth was she was scared. The dreams were bad enough. The fugue states were worse. But losing pieces of time, whole chunks of memory? That was new.

""Okay,"" she said. ""Okay, yeah. Thanks.""

Maya squeezed her hand. ""We'll figure this out. Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out.""

After Maya left to get dressed, Alex stood in her tiny bathroom, studying her reflection. Same face she'd always had‚Äîangular features that photographed well but looked severe in person, dark hair that never did what she wanted, eyes the color of old pennies. Nothing special. Nothing that would make anyone look twice.

So why did she feel like something was looking out through those eyes? Something that wasn't quite her?

Her phone buzzed. Liam.

*hey, you up? thought i heard voices*

Christ, did everyone in this building have paper walls?

*yeah. maya came over. bad dreams again*

*want me to come by? i make a mean breakfast burrito*

She almost said no. Almost. But the thought of being alone until nine, of sitting with her own thoughts and the phantom taste of tombs...

*sure. door's open*

She jumped in the shower, letting the hot water wash away the last remnants of the dream. As she lathered shampoo, her fingers found a tender spot at the base of her skull. When she probed it, pain shot down her spine like lightning.

Another memory surfaced: lying on a table, bright lights overhead, someone's fingers in her hair, parting it, exposing her scalp. A needle, maybe. Or something else. Something that burrowed.

She jerked her hand away. The shampoo bottle fell, exploding foam across the shower floor. 

""Damn it!""

""You okay in there?"" Liam's voice, concerned.

When had he arrived? How long had she been standing here, water running cold, lost in another half-memory?

""Fine! Just dropped something!""

She finished quickly, threw on jeans and an old paint-stained sweater. Liam was in her kitchen area, which was really just a hot plate and mini-fridge tucked into one corner. He'd already started coffee, the smell mixing with whatever he was cooking on her ancient skillet.

""Eggs, cheese, leftover chorizo from that place you like,"" he said without turning around. ""And before you ask, yes, I did a little breaking and entering into your fridge. Sue me.""

He was wearing his usual uniform‚Äîdark jeans, fitted t-shirt that showed off the gym work he pretended was casual, that leather jacket that probably cost more than her rent. His dark hair was artfully mussed, like he'd just rolled out of bed looking perfect.

Which he probably had.

""Smells good,"" she admitted.

""I am a man of many talents."" He plated the burrito with a flourish. ""Eat. You look like you haven't been taking care of yourself.""

""Charming.""

""I mean it. When's the last time you slept? Really slept, not just that half-conscious thing you do.""

She took a bite instead of answering. The food was good, better than anything she'd made for herself in weeks. Liam watched her eat with genuine concern, like a friend who'd seen too many of her bad days.

""The dreams again?"" he asked.

She nodded. No point lying; the walls were too thin for secrets.

""Maybe you should see someone. A therapist or‚Äî""

""I'm seeing a doctor this morning, actually."" She watched his face carefully. ""Apparently I went to the ER two weeks ago. Don't remember it.""

His eyes widened. ""You don't remember going to the ER?""

""That's concerning,"" he said, setting down his fork. ""Really concerning, Alex.""

""That's one word for it.""

He reached across the small table, covered her hand with his. His palm was warm, callused in places that didn't match his soft-boy aesthetic. ""Whatever's going on, you know I'm here, right? Whatever you need.""

She should have pulled away. Should have established boundaries like Maya was always telling her to do. But his touch was grounding, and she was so fucking tired of feeling like she was floating away from her own life.

""I know,"" she said.

That's when it happened again. The crawling sensation under her skin, stronger this time. She looked down and saw them clearly‚Äîlines like scales, like snake skin, rippling across her forearm in delicate patterns. They glowed faintly, a sick green that made her stomach turn.

Liam's grip tightened. ""Alex, your arm‚Äî""

""Do you see it?"" Her voice came out strangled. ""Please tell me you see it.""

""I‚Äî"" He leaned closer, then shook his head. ""I see you scratching. You're going to hurt yourself.""

""No, there were‚Äî"" But when she looked again, her arm was normal. Just skin, slightly red from where she'd been digging her nails in.

She yanked her hand away. ""I could have sworn...""

""Hey."" His voice was gentle. ""When's that doctor's appointment? Maybe we should get you there early.""

Had she imagined his reaction? The reverence, the recognition? Her head felt stuffed with cotton, thoughts sliding away like wet soap.

""Yeah,"" she said. ""Yeah, maybe.""

He insisted on walking her down to the street, waiting while she ordered an Uber. As the car pulled up, he hugged her, and she let herself sink into it for a moment. He smelled like expensive cologne and something else, something that reminded her of Sunday mornings‚Äîcoffee and fresh laundry and safety.

""Text me when you're done,"" he said. ""Let me know you're okay.""

She nodded, slid into the car. As they pulled away, she glanced back to see him still standing there, worry written across his face.

The ride to University of Chicago Medical Center took her through neighborhoods in various stages of gentrification. Corner stores next to artisanal coffee shops. Vacant lots beside luxury condos. The city eating itself, remaking itself, never quite finishing the job.

Her phone buzzed. Maya: *on your way? i can meet you there in 20*

*already in the car. don't skip court. i'll be fine*

*you sure?*

Alex wasn't sure of anything anymore. But Maya had already done enough, lost enough sleep over Alex's problems.

*positive. i'll text you after*

The hospital loomed ahead, all glass and steel and the promise of answers she wasn't sure she wanted. As the Uber pulled up to the entrance, that crawling sensation returned, stronger than ever. She looked down at her arms, half-expecting to see the serpentine patterns again.

Nothing. Just her own skin, pale in the morning light.

But as she walked through the automatic doors, she could have sworn she heard something. A whisper, maybe. Or the sound of scales sliding across stone. The sound from her dreams, following her into the waking world.

The receptionist smiled at her with too many teeth. ""Can I help you?""

""I have an appointment,"" Alex heard herself say. ""With Dr. Grant.""

""Of course."" The woman typed something, fingers clicking across keys in a rhythm that sounded almost like a chant. ""Take the elevator to the third floor. Someone will meet you.""

Alex moved through the hospital like a sleepwalker. Everything felt both too real and not real enough‚Äîthe lights that hummed at a frequency that made her teeth ache, the hospital smell that couldn't quite mask something earthier underneath, the way everyone seemed to look at her just a beat too long.

The elevator was empty. As the doors closed, she caught her reflection in the polished steel. For just a moment‚Äîa heartbeat, a blink‚Äîshe saw something else looking back. A woman with too many arms and eyes like dark pits and a smile that promised such terrible things.

Then the doors opened, and Dr. Grant was waiting.

She was younger than her voice had suggested, with prematurely gray hair pulled back in a severe bun and eyes the color of old ice. Her coat was pristine white, but something dark stained the cuffs. 

""Ms. Sutton. Thank you for coming."" She didn't offer her hand. ""Please, follow me.""

They walked down a corridor that seemed to stretch longer than the building should allow. The lights flickered in a pattern that almost made sense, like morse code or a heartbeat or the rhythm of something breathing in the walls.

""I should mention,"" Alex said, her voice echoing strangely, ""I don't actually remember coming here before.""

""Memory issues are not uncommon with your condition."" Dr. Grant didn't look back.

""What condition?""

""That's what we're here to determine.""

They entered an examination room that was too cold and too bright. Alex sat on the paper-covered table, the crinkle of it loud in the silence.

""I'll need to draw some blood,"" Dr. Grant said, preparing a needle that seemed longer than necessary. ""And ask you some questions. Have you experienced any unusual dreams lately?""

Alex almost laughed. ""You could say that.""

""Describe them, please.""

So she did, the words pouring out like water through a broken dam. The woman with too many arms. The place that wasn't a place. The feeling of becoming something else. Dr. Grant took notes in handwriting that looked more like symbols than letters.

""Interesting,"" the doctor murmured. ""And have you noticed any physical manifestations? Changes to your skin, perhaps?""

Alex's hand went unconsciously to her forearm. ""This morning. Lines like... like scales. But they disappeared.""

""Show me where.""

Dr. Grant's fingers were ice cold as she examined Alex's arm. She pressed gently at first, then harder, and the pain was electric, shooting up to Alex's shoulder and down to her fingertips.

""Ah,"" the doctor said. ""There you are.""

And the lines appeared again, but different this time. Deeper. More complex. They spiraled up Alex's arm like living tattoos, and she could feel them moving, burrowing, making space for themselves beneath her skin.

""What is this‚Äî""

""Don't struggle."" Dr. Grant's voice was calm, detached. ""It will only make the awakening more painful.""

""What awakening? What is this?""

But even as she asked, part of her knew. Had always known, maybe. The dreams weren't dreams. The woman with too many arms wasn't a nightmare.

She was a promise.

The room spun. Dr. Grant's face blurred, shifted, revealed something underneath that had too many angles and teeth in the wrong places. The walls breathed. The floor tilted.

And somewhere, a phone was ringing.

No, not ringing. Buzzing. Her phone, in her pocket. Maya's ringtone.

The sound cut through whatever was happening like a blade. The room snapped back to normal. Dr. Grant was just a doctor again, looking concerned.

""Ms. Sutton? Are you alright?""

""I..."" Alex blinked hard. The lines on her arm were gone. Her phone stopped buzzing. ""I need to go.""

""But we haven't completed the examination‚Äî""

""I said I need to go."" Alex slid off the table, legs shaky but holding. ""Thank you for your time.""

She fled before the doctor could protest, half-running through corridors that now seemed perfectly normal-sized. The elevator came immediately. The lobby was just a lobby. The receptionist had a normal number of teeth.

Outside, she gulped Chicago air like she'd been drowning. Her phone buzzed again. Three missed calls from Maya, two from Liam, and a text from an unknown number:

*The serpent stirs. You cannot run from what you are becoming.*

She deleted it without reading it twice, her hands shaking so badly she almost dropped the phone.

Another text, this one from Liam: *are you okay? something felt wrong*

How did he know? How could he possibly know?

She started walking, no destination in mind, just away. Away from the hospital and its wrong angles. Away from doctors who weren't quite doctors and receptionists with too many teeth.

But she couldn't walk away from the feeling under her skin, the sense that something had been set in motion. Something that had been waiting her whole life to begin.

In her pocket, her phone rang. Liam again. She almost didn't answer, but the thought of being alone with whatever was happening was worse than talking to him.

""Alex, thank god. Where are you?""

""Walking. I left the hospital.""

""What happened?""

She laughed, high and hysterical. ""I don't know. I really don't know. The doctor was... wrong. Everything was wrong.""

""I'm coming to get you. Where are you exactly?""

She looked around, tried to focus on street signs through the tears she hadn't realized were falling. Gave him the intersection.

""Stay there. Don't move. I'll be there in ten minutes.""

""Liam‚Äî""

""It's going to be okay."" His voice was soothing, worried. ""I promise, Alex. We'll figure this out together.""

The line went dead. She stared at the phone, his words echoing.

We'll figure this out together.

She waited on the corner, watching the city move around her. Normal people living normal lives, unaware that something fundamental had shifted. That somewhere, in a place that touched this world but wasn't quite of it, a woman with too many arms was crying tears of blood.

When Liam's car pulled up, she got in without hesitation. Whatever was coming, she didn't want to face it alone.

He looked at her with those concerned eyes, reached over to squeeze her shoulder. ""You're safe now. I'm taking you home.""

But as they drove away, Alex caught a glimpse of her reflection in the side mirror. For just a moment, her eyes seemed different. Darker. Like looking into deep water.

She closed them tight and leaned against the window, exhausted. Beside her, Liam drove in worried silence, one hand on the wheel, the other reaching over occasionally to pat her arm, making sure she was still there.

1ldpj2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ldpj2l/routine_is_key_and_im_locked_in_a_prison/,"Routine is key, and I'm locked in a prison.","Is anyone else facing a unique experience of implementing a routine so well that not only do their dogs do everything automatically, but they also remind you of the routine? üòÇ

_Some examples:_

In my house, we have 4 dogs of big size and massive personality, so routine is everything in this home.

**The cool part:**
- Without a word, after eating they go potty. 
- If I put my coffee down in the morning, nothing happens. But if I put my finished coffee (empty mug, down), they automatically run to the designated eating area.

**The interesting part:**
If I drink coffee and put down an empty mug at any other time of the day, they don't even bat an eye. Nobody moves. 

 **The funny _problem_**
They eat at the exact same time in the evening every day.
 
So when the clock strikes the relevant eating o'clock:
- Dog 1: Sits in front of me. Stares into my soul whining and trembling
- Dog 2: Runs to designated food area (from wherever he is) 
- Dog 3 & 4: Stand up and circle me like sharks while whacking me with helicopter tails

This happens **EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY.** There's no alarm or anything. They just have some sort of internal body clock that tells them it's time to eat. üòÇ

**The interesting part for this one:**
If I stand up one hour before food time. No one even flinches. Half an hour before? Everyone is still watching TV or basking in the sun. Five minutes before? Everyone rises (from REM) running to the designated eating place. 

**The funny _problem_ (2nd edition)**
Sometimes I go out and come back late (after normal food time). Instead of greeting me at the door, they wait to make sure it's me. Once confirmed, everyone runs to their designated eating area, sitting in silence, waiting for me to bring the food. They will sit there until the food comes, whether it takes 5 minutes or 30 minutes. Because guess what, that's what I always do when I get home late.

**Tl:dr**
I'm in a hostage situation with my dogs; we made a routine, and they stick to it like velcro. They alert me when I'm late. We don't have an alarm or clock in the house, but they somehow always know the time.

*Draconis System*

Itrop leaned back in his private cabin, pleased at the events of the past weeks. Shameless flattery, bribery, and a few deaths had been necessary, but the Freelord Svitre's portion of the Throne's Fortune had finally come to heel.

The first real trouble had been convincing the commodores that smuggling was preferable to outright piracy. While smuggling was certainly less glamorous, it had a far lower chance of winding up Svitre'd. But there was still a group who demanded vigorous action. That was something he was going to have to deal with today.

""Look at the images. The stills. There was even a stream from the passenger. They are wealthy beyond imagining, and they will be in Hurdop space in one week, which gives us time to prepare. To intercept. To attack, to board, and take whatever riches are aboard that ship and then the ship itself. Freelord Svitre would demand no less of us.""

Itrop leaned forward as he regarded at the two commodores. ""Dolin. Smeitr. I respect your resolve in Svitre's name. The both of you are fine commanders. However in this moment remember what the Terran Foreign Legion is capable of. The Third Vilantian Warfleet. They were able to command others and defeat the Fourth and Seventh Warfleets. Even our mighty fleet suffered catastrophe at his hands. I would counsel that you remember who you're dealing with."" He looked between the two. ""What we must do to right the wrongs to all of us in this moment is be patient. Remember. If we attack them, their clan will remain vigilant. We must let them grow relaxed, comfortable. Allow them forget the clanwar they started. Then, and only then do we strike. This is a fine opportunity, but the time is not right for action.""

Smeitr growled softly. ""Spoken like one who has risked nothing to lose nothing.""

""Commodore, the losses of Freeclan Svitre were not small. But when compared to the loss suffered by Vilantia at his hands, it is a fraction. A small fraction. If the two of you do this I wish you well, and I will pray for your success. But I cannot condone this action.""

""What actions do you condone, then?""

""The actions as I have laid them out. We must gain allies, strength. Show Hurdop and Vilantia that the Legion weakens us as a people. If you pursue this, leave your holds empty of all that can be spared."" Itrop leaned back in his chair. ""If you are defeated, we will need the supplies and precious cargo that you carry. If you win - the space will be needed for the bounty of their ship. Good fortune to you, no matter what you decide.""

The two left, their scent filled with confidence in themselves. Itrop glanced over at Bob, who had been silently listening to the conversation from his normal spot.

""You have thoughts?""

""They plan to take six ships. It will not be a fair fight. Currently I calculate the chance of any of the ships returning at three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one.""

Itrop grimaced. ""Thank you for keeping that calculation to yourself."" He glanced at his tablets, pausing. ""Hopefully their replacements will be wiser. Send a few other ships in their shadow with the necessary communications; we'll take advantage of their actions by sending others who are calmer and wish to live to see victory's dance.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

The ship was getting used to the new cadence brought about by the additional personnel. As he walked out to the bridge to begin his new day, the comm chair with Yomios sitting in it was a touch jarring.

""Major; as we are currently in R-space, we have no communications traffic. There are currently fifty-three communications from our...employers pending delivery once we exit R-space. Of those messages, I believe forty of them are worthy of review - certain parts of the display may reveal ship functions or capabilities that we wouldn't want people to know about.""

""Understood Corporal. We'll review those after breakfast with the XO. Any specifics?""

Yomios' ears fluttered slightly - a sign that she was a touch uncertain how to proceed. ""Well sir, several of them are marked as age-restricted, and for good reason - ""

Rosie interrupted smoothly. ""She's wanting to send four full frontal shots of Gabe coming out of the shower - you could grind meat on his abs and he's packing a chunk of driftwood in his pants - which is gonna be hell for him when skinny-jeans come back in style again. Then she got a few more from the rear. I think she's trying to use the socials to have her fans convince Reilly to marry the poor schmuck.""

Gryzzk closed his upper and middle eyes. ""Tell me there's more than just Terran nudes involved?""

Yomios nodded. ""Well, yes. There are several images of the ship's interior that might give any attackers a layout of the ship.""

There was a shrug. ""Rosie, what are the odds someone's picked up the layout of our ship already?""

The reply was a soft chuff. ""*Jane's Fighting Ships* published an update after the war. They've got a perfect exterior and decent guesstimates of the interior based on the fact that this was a cargo-hauler before it got a refit.""

""I'd rather they not know more than is absolutely necessary.""

""Certainly Freelord Major. On the up side, there are several posed shots with Lieutenant Gro'zel, including her reading her favorite bedtime story to Gabe."" Rosie paused. ""Respectfully, she may have weaponized her cuteness.""

""That we'll let go. I believe it would be good publicity."" Gryzzk gave a lopsided smile. ""Anything else I should be aware of?""

""Yes, Chief Tucker and I will be taking breakfast in the Engineering space for the duration of this job. He's not fond of the Reillys and has elected to relocate his quarters to the engineering space temporarily.""

""Advise the engineering squads that rank has privilege, and that they may not take after Chief Tucker. Also advise Chief Tucker that he is still expected to maintain standards of hygiene.""

Rosie purred - as much as a holographically generated AI could. ""I will make quite certain he showers, Freelord Major.""

There was a raised finger from O'Brien's station. ""Aht-aht-aht. First. Warning. There will be no horny on the bridge.""

Rosie looked innocent...ish. ""I'll be certain to advise Hoban and Miroka.""

O'Brien grumbled under her breath. ""Don't remind me.""

Gryzzk couldn't help himself. ""Sergeant Major, if your husband would like to join us as a consultant to the armory, the arrangements could be made.""

There was a snort. ""No way in hell that happens. Colm gets sick in R-space, the poor bastard. Go eat and make sure those three don't make a mess of our lovely ship.""

There was a smile on Gryzzk's face as he headed for the mess hall. This morning was calmer, after a fashion. As he settled with his normal tray there was a bit of an oddity. Charles showed up by himself with what Gryzzk had learned was a ""full English"" breakfast, though some things seemed to have a Vilantian equivalent. He paused before seating himself and began taking tiny bites, sitting up perfectly straight - but his scent was filled with turmoil.

It took a few minutes before Charles spoke. ""Your daughter is lovely."" His voice was smooth, gently toned - it was as if his vocal cords were an instrument unto themselves.

""Thank you."" Gryzzk knew enough to be patient in times like these. Some of his old skills seemed to translate.

""You...are fortunate. When Chastity - er, I guess you know her as Jenassa - when she was that age."" He paused as if the memory was painful. ""We'd found out that the genetic mix wasn't what we'd asked for. It was...difficult. Six years of tutoring, lessons, and Jenassa wasn't going to be what we'd hoped.""

Gryzzk took in this information with a sip of tea. ""I know what you did, but I must ask why?""

Charles stared down at his breakfast for a long time before speaking. ""Our band was called Chardelia. It was Neofolk. Delia played the electro-gurdy and sang lead while I played bass, was backup on the vocals and was basically the public relations guru - there was a piper and a percussionist as well. We were popular - amazingly so. Blisteringly famous for fifteen minutes; and then the musical fashion changed - we became a trivia question eight months after our height. We'd done well enough that we could easily afford the Centauri lifestyle, and then we found new jobs in Anchiano as scouts. We had an eye and an ear, but no audience for our songs. We'd gotten married, ostensibly for the press but...she was different then."" Charles' gaze changed, no longer seeing the breakfast table but something entirely different but pleasant.

There was a sip of acrid coffee before he continued. ""That was when we looked at our accounts and realized we could afford to have three genetically boosted children. Julliard Ren√© and Prospero Alan turned out almost exactly the way we wanted, but Jenassa."" He paused, arranging his thoughts. ""It hurt when we fell from the public eye. So much so that we stopped playing, even the nostalgia shows. It doesn't make up for what happened, but it explains it. I hope.""

Gryzzk blinked in confusion. ""I'm afraid it doesn't.""

""We...we wanted our children to be safe. To not feel the pain that we felt - the band breakup was acrimonious because it was our dream gone to hell and none of us understood why. Delia and I didn't get divorced, but our relationship changed, and...usually I let her do the talking in a group setting. I mucked it up with the band publicity somehow. We were barely more than kids ourselves, but then we started looking at children and we."" He paused, swallowing. ""We wanted them to be flexible enough to survive the whims of the public. To do what we couldn't. Julliard's adapted to three revolutions in architecture, and Prospero's paintings are almost a harbinger of a new style - he stumbles sometimes, but never dramatically."" Charles looked up to meet Gryzzk's eyes. ""Have you ever looked at your children and wondered what they were going to be when they grow up?""

Gryzzk stopped for a moment. ""To be frank...no. I suppose I should, though. On Vilantia, a position is generally hereditary. The eldest takes the position from their father or mother, and the younger siblings are given similar training and then they are traded to other clans as needed."" He considered. ""I had expected that the children would...follow in my footsteps as ship captains, now that lives of service are not exactly an option. That may have to change.""

""So your father...""

""For thirty-three generations - about thirteen centuries, all told. The histories are incomplete, but I am told that the First Gryzzk might have been a noble of some sort."" There was a shrug. ""But that was then and it worked, after a fashion. But you have given me something to consider.""

Charles looked up at the ceiling for a moment. ""Delia isn't a bad person. She's very strong and caring. In her own way, she's trying to convince Jenassa to come home to safety.""

""If I may be frank, Charles."" Gryzzk paused for a moment. ""Lord A'ogers, one of our scholars of child-rearing wrote in the Fourteenth Generation that the magic of children is that they become adults, and one of the worst things we can do as parents is prevent that magic from becoming real. I feel like Delia may have attempted to raise an adult - and when that did not become as expected, she has attempted to keep Jenassa a child until she becomes what was expected. Was that how your sons were raised?""

Charles blinked. Blinked again. Then a weak smile crept across his face. ""Where were you fifteen years ago when we needed to hear this?""

""Learning how to properly serve and manage what was to become my Lord's household."" There was a gesture. ""Certainly nothing so grand or glamorous as this but I suppose this is a form of service.""

Charles stood. ""I think...perhaps I need to shock her into realizing that our daughter is an adult. Though I'm not sure I've been able to talk to her for years."" He paused. ""Would it be possible for me to visit the bridge after Cha-Jenassa is on duty? I believe I have something she might like. Or throw at me.""

""I'll have to ask during the changeover tonight. Until then.""

The rest of the day was more or less routine, shockingly. Between Yomios, Rosie, and Gryzzk about half of the social posts were rejected outright, others were blurred appropriately, and over Gryzzk's objection the risque shots of Gabe were allowed. Gro'zel presented herself for uniform inspection at precisely midday, and then took off for her duties of making sure everyone was cared for. The reports from the ship were few; it seemed as though the elder Reillys had spent the day in their cabin and had chosen to not mingle with or agitate the crew. Reilly was perplexed as she came in with the evening squad.

""Major. Sir. Freelord. Why the hell is Charles quoting Vilantian Lords now?"" Reilly reached up to tap the controls to move the station to her configuration.

""We spoke this morning over breakfast.""

""Annnnd now Delia's acting like it's my fault."" She hmph'ed. ""Like I have some mystic powers when I'm sleeping.""

There was a soft smile from Gryzzk. ""I will ask Lomeia on our return if you have any mystic sleeping powers.""

O'Brien turned sharply to the command chair. ""No incitement to horny on the bridge, either. Fuzzy jumped-up mad bastard..."" the Sergeant Major left the bridge trailing a stream of muttered oaths.

The changeover was overall smooth, and about five minutes had passed before the bridge door opened and Gro'zel led Charles onto the bridge. Charles was carrying a case of some sort and smelled like...anger and passion. It was highly unexpected, and made Gryzzk more than a little curious.

Reilly promptly glared at Gryzzk. ""The hell."" There was a pause. ""Sir.""

""It was requested, Sergeant. It may be beneficial for you to be patient.""

Reilly glanced between Gro'zel and Gryzzk, her hands laced tightly in her lap. ""One minute.""

Charles swallowed before placing the case next to Reilly's station. ""This. Before you were born, we did other things. Your mother played this, but stopped after certain things happened. We never taught you about music because we were afraid you would find out about our history. Things we couldn't easily explain beyond 'We were young and stupid'. But maybe...maybe you should know. There's a tab that you might want to watch."" He paused for a moment, his voice becoming hesitant. ""Delia may never admit it, but. We made mistakes. We...wanted you to be safe and happy. That was the idea.""

Reilly was cautious as she touched the case gingerly, like it was going to cause her physical pain if she touched it for too long. ""This doesn't make up for anything.""

""It doesn't. But...maybe it'll explain some things.""

""Maybe. Minute's up. I'll be at breakfast tomorrow.""

Charles left the bridge, and Gro'zel clambered up to Reilly's lap, not saying anything.

Finally Reilly looked at Gro'zel. ""I still think your papa has a better family than mine.""

Gro'zel glanced around for a moment before speaking as if she were revealing a secret. ""Your mama likes Mama's jelly cookies.""

""She does not. I have never seen Delia eat any candy. Ever."" Reilly looked surprised and a little suspicious.

There was a serious nod. ""She says they're art in food form.""

Reilly seemed to deflate slightly, before glancing around. ""Okay. Maybe I don't know as much about 'em as I thought. Doesn't mean I suddenly like 'em.""

Gro'zel turned to give Reilly a hug. ""You smell like Big Feelings. I'll come back in an hour or two."" The she walked off the bridge to her next destination.""

Reilly looked at the case, and then the data tab before glancing at the rest of the bridge. ""Anyone object to tonight's movie being 'What The Fuck Were Two Of Reilly's Genetic Donors Doing Before They Decided To Bang And Then Have Three Canned Kids?' No? Good.""

Gryzzk kept a hand on the command chair for a moment before going to his quarters, glancing at Rosie. His XO was overly calm as she glided over and whispered to him.

""I will advise if you are needed."" There was a pause. ""I know you plan to sleep in your uniform.""

Gryzzk shook his head a little, re-focusing to read more about plants and determine what sort of light and conditions would be needed. Eventually he did go to sleep, dreams of growth in his head.

When he woke the next morning, there was a small data tab compliments of Rosie. It was marked ""You get to watch this once."" He slid the data-tab into his tablet and pressed play.

It was Reilly, sitting in Gro'zel's quarters with the electro-gurdy - she seemed to be familiar with the instrument basics, but her voice was soft and gentle as she played and sang a lullaby to Gryzzk's sleeping daughter.

The strangest thing was that Reilly was singing in Vilantian. Horribly accented, and some of the tones were off, but she was understandable. It was a little odd to hear, and as soon as it finished Rosie's voice came in.

""I know it was nice, but Reilly specifically asked that it be a one and done. We'll be in the Vilantian system this time tomorrow; and I believe that Reilly's mother has concerns about your child-rearing.""

Gryzzk exhaled softly. ""Pull the threat assessment for Vilantia. Do we know of anything else that's going on?""

""Beyond a joint commission of the Vilantia and Hurdop Ministries of Science making waves? The Ministry of Culture is trying very hard to slow-walk your statue.""

""In this, I concur with the Ministry.""

""I'm sure you do. But they've already informally renamed the place 'Freelord Park' because of your visit there with Nhoot. In any case, there's far fewer social posts to monitor, but Delia has placed a highly urgent request with me to speak with you.""

The exhalation became a groan. ""Do I want to know?""

""She has suggestions regarding education.""",24,1750172558.0,HFY,6,0.96,False

Today i had a dream that kept me thinking since I woke up because it felt more real than my whole life. I apologize if it's too long, has some mistakes and details that doesn't matter that much.

I was in the kitchen of my house, it had the changes my mom and I have in mind to do in the future, we were drinking coffee and talking about something I can't remember. Further in the dream I see my dad and one of my cousins being treated like she was my sister, I'm an only child and my dad doesn't live with me. Everything else to this moment is normal; the rooms, the porch, the backyard, our dog, the only difference is the people in my house. In my dreams something weird or out of a fantasy story always happens, but this was just a normal day like any other. At one point my mom, dad and cousin are dressed up in work and school clothes, I was the only one who was still in pajamas, I get told by my mom that they'll be leaving, I ask her if my cousin knows how to use the bus because the school where I live is pretty far away, my mom tells me she knows and goes to the garage, I follow behind her and see the car of my dad behind a black van or something like that, before my mom gets in the van I ask her what time it is and she says 7 o'clock, I'm a bit controlling with the time and anything related to it so I keep it in mind to have enough minutes to prepare myself for school. I go inside and put away some groceries that were on the couch of the living room, while I'm doing that I get the feeling that I am not in my real home, that the place I was in wasn't the place I had been living in for six years now, then I remember that for a while I was interested in the ""shifting"" and had some notes and information of a different reality I wanted to go to. I was thinking and remembering everything and the word I had for when I needed to come back to reality, but it all left my head when I remembered that in those notes I wrote that I had a cat instead of a dog and stopped thinking that I was in a different reality as I continued putting away the groceries, I still got an urge to search of my smartwatch and check the time, when I found it the time said 6:59 and I woke up.

I think I didn't move for a minute as I tried to comprehend what I had just dreamt of before checking the time in my phone, 6 o'clock, almost an hour before the times that appeared in my dream. I'm surprised and at the same time terrified of the capabilities the human brain has regarding dreams because it felt so real that I'm still thinking that if I didn't had an obsession with time I wouldn't be awake right now.",1,1750172425.0,u_Ok-Student-3339,0,1.0,False

Transparent labs whey looked promising.

So I bought nearly every flavor.

And drank them daily.

Here‚Äôs what actually stood out...

the good, the weird, and the ones I couldn't finish.

# The best everyday flavors

These are the ones I reached for again and again.

**Milk chocolate** is safe, familiar, and smooth.

No weird aftertaste, no sweetness overload.

Just reliable chocolate that works with water or milk.

**French vanilla** is mellow and perfect for mixing.

Alone it‚Äôs mild, but it doesn‚Äôt fight with fruits, oats, or peanut butter.

**Chocolate peanut butter** surprised me.

It leans more peanut butter than chocolate but avoids the fake candy flavor some brands have.

It‚Äôs richer in milk but totally drinkable with water.

# Niche but worth trying

These were solid just more specific in taste.

**Dark chocolate** is deeper and less sweet.

More cocoa than candy, great if you‚Äôre over sweetened shakes.

**Mocha** has a chill coffee vibe.

Not bitter, not overly caffeinated‚Äîjust good for mornings.

**Cinnamon french toast** hits hard with the maple-cinnamon combo.

Definitely a treat flavor. Not for daily use, but fun now and then.

**Strawberry milkshake** tastes like powdered strawberry Nesquik.

If that‚Äôs your jam, you‚Äôll love it.

**Oatmeal chocolate chip cookie** has a mild, comforting taste.

Not too sweet. Feels like it belongs in a post-workout shake with banana.

# Flavors I wouldn‚Äôt buy again

These weren‚Äôt bad. Just not for me.

**Vanilla peanut butter** felt confused.

Couldn‚Äôt tell which flavor was leading. Probably better in blended shakes than on its own.

**Chocolate chip banana bread** is very banana-forward.

If you love banana bread, go for it. Otherwise...eh.

**S‚Äômores** was way too sweet.

A marshmallow bomb. Fun for one scoop, tiring after three.

**Mint chocolate chip** tastes like thin mint protein.

Some will love that. I didn‚Äôt.

**Blueberry pancakes** had a fake maple aftertaste.

Reminded me of diet syrup. Not my thing.

**Chocolate coconut** was decent but forgettable.

Too light on the coconut to stand out.

**Unflavored** is what it says.

Useful for recipes or coffee. Not meant for sipping alone.

# Pros and cons I noticed over time

After 6 weeks of mixing, sipping, and blending, a few things stood out.

**What I liked:**

* Mixes great in water or milk  
* Clean ingredients, no sucralose  
* No bloating or gas for me  
* Didn‚Äôt coat my throat with fake sweetness  

**What got annoying:**

* Some flavors fade fast (taste fatigue)  
* Pricey if you‚Äôre experimenting with multiple tubs  
* Subtle flavors can feel underwhelming if you're used to sweetened brands  

# Final thoughts (and what to actually buy)

If you're trying this protein for the first time, go for milk chocolate, french vanilla, or chocolate peanut butter.

They're the most consistent, most liked, and easiest to finish a whole tub of.

If you want to experiment, mocha and cinnamon french toast are worth sampling in smaller sizes first.

Skip blueberry pancakes unless you‚Äôre oddly passionate about fake maple.

Try a couple before committing.

That‚Äôs how I found Michael. Tuesdays, 7:30 PM, the little Thai place with the flickering neon elephant. He ordered pad see ew, always with extra broccoli, like he needed to prove something to himself. He read crime novels while he ate ‚Äî paperback only, no screens. People like that are cracked open already. They just don‚Äôt know it.

He looked like someone who‚Äôd been left too many times.

That‚Äôs where I come in.

I never insert myself. That‚Äôs what amateurs do. You show up too fast, people panic. Pull back. No, you have to become the air around them. Make them feel like you‚Äôve always been there.

I started with eye contact. Brief. Familiar. Like he should know me, but doesn‚Äôt.

Then I ""accidentally"" ran into him at the bookstore two weeks later. He was in True Crime. I was already there, waiting. I held up the same book he was reaching for.

‚ÄúWe have the same taste. That‚Äôs rare.‚Äù

I said it like a compliment, not a coincidence.

He laughed.

Hook set.

People call what I do manipulation, like it‚Äôs cruel. But manipulation is just care in disguise. I pay attention to the things others overlook ‚Äî how he scratches his neck when he's lying, how his voice drops when he‚Äôs scared, how he keeps his keys in his left jacket pocket, not the right.

Most people don‚Äôt even know what they need. But I do.

When he told me about his last relationship ‚Äî the one with the girl who left suddenly, no note ‚Äî I saw the way his eyes glazed over. Not grief. Abandonment trauma. Classic.

‚ÄúPeople always leave,‚Äù he said.

I smiled.

‚ÄúNot all people.‚Äù

It started small. I made sure his favorite cereal was always in my cabinet. I rearranged my schedule to mirror his. I never told him when I followed him, of course ‚Äî not until much later. When it would feel like a relief to know I‚Äôd been watching out for him.
He left his window unlocked twice. I never went in.
The third time, I did.

Only for ten minutes. Just enough to tidy up his laundry pile. Move his toothbrush a quarter-inch left so he‚Äôd feel the touch without knowing why. Subtle is everything.

By the time he noticed things were ‚Äústrange,‚Äù he‚Äôd already started calling me when he felt anxious. When he woke up from nightmares.

‚ÄúI just feel like I‚Äôm being watched.‚Äù

I‚Äôd hum through the phone.

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs watching you. You‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

I was watching him.

That‚Äôs why he was safe.

His friends didn‚Äôt understand him. They said he changed around me.

Of course he did.

He was finally becoming whole.

They said I was too quiet. Too reserved. They saw my stillness and mistook it for emptiness. But still waters drown people too.

I didn‚Äôt make them disappear. I just showed them out.

Sent a few honest messages. Leaked a few private thoughts of his ‚Äî things he told me in fear. Said he didn‚Äôt want them around. They left on their own.
I just helped him shed the noise.

Now it‚Äôs just us.

He wakes up every morning, and I‚Äôm already there ‚Äî making coffee the way he likes, humming that song from the restaurant on our ‚Äúfirst‚Äù night.

Sometimes he stares at me like he‚Äôs trying to remember a version of himself that existed before me.

But that version was hollow.

I filled him up.

I still do.

He asked once:
‚ÄúWould you ever leave me?‚Äù

I tilted my head. Brushed his hair back. Pressed my lips to his ear and whispered:

‚ÄúSweetheart, if I ever leave‚Ä¶ who will protect you from me?‚Äù

She stood before her bathroom mirror, her dark brown hair so dark it verged on black. Her hands trembled, a tremor that shook her entire frame. Her brown eyes, fragile as glass, welled with tears. She gripped the sink, shaking so violently it seemed she might collapse. A scream clawed at her throat, desperate to escape. Just then, her phone rang. With immense effort, she fought back the urge to shatter. She wiped her tears, splashed water on her face, and rushed to her room to answer the call.
""Hey, Carla!"" said a cheerful voice.
""Hi,"" she replied, ensuring that the shake in her voice was not audible.
""Long time no see, girl!""
""Yeah, it's been busy, you know, summer vac and all the homework and other stuff,"" Carla explained.
""Yeah, I hear you. By the way, I called you to ask if we could meet. It's kind of urgent.""
""What, like right now? It's 11:30-ish, girl!"" Carla exclaimed.
""No, obviously not now! Maybe tomorrow evening, huh?""
""Okay, why not?"" Carla agreed.
""Yayyyy! I'll text you the location by noon. Bye!""
Just as Carla was about to say ""bye,"" the call disconnected.
She went straight to her bed, curled up, and clutched the pillow as hard as she possibly could, trying to pour her heart out, and within minutes she was fast asleep.
The alarm rang. She looked at her phone.
""Oh, shoot, it's 12 already!"" The lights were still on as she had forgotten to turn them off. She unlocked her phone to check if Bella had texted her the location for the meetup. ""Something urgent, hmmm... What could it possibly be?"" she wondered.Three messages from Bella popped up as soon as she opened her WhatsApp.
""üìç
Meet me at 3
Don't be late""
""Got it,"" she replied.
She saw her reflection in the mirror across from her bed, jumped out of bed, brushed her teeth, and ran downstairs for breakfast.
""Stephanie, is Dad home?"" While opening the kitchen cabinet, she asked her stepmom.
A cruel voice replied from the living room, ""No, he's left for work. A client was waiting for him. Not everyone's like you...""
""God damn it! I wake up early each and every day! Will you ever let a chance go? And it's my vacations, anyway!"" Pouring milk in the cereal bowl, she replied.
Just as Stephanie was about to say something, she stormed off upstairs into her room with her bowl of cereal. While eating her cereal, scenes from last night's dinner flashed across her mind. She tried to shake it off, but it was still present in some part of her mind.
A few moments later, she found herself standing in front of her wardrobe, deciding whether to wear her white top with black denims or blue jeans.
""Black denims it is!""
She went flying to her vanity, took out some earrings and her favorite necklace that meant the world to her because it was her mom's.
She was putting on some makeup to hide the dark circles and to make herself look fresh even though she was tired. Just then a text popped up, ""Hi, how's been your week so far? Everything's good?""
She decided to ignore the text as she was already late. She grabbed the purse lying on her bed, ran downstairs, put on her sneakers, and left, yelling in the empty corridor that she'd be home by 5. Her phone rang.
It was Bella.
""Girl, where are you? It's 3:15, you haven't arrived yet! I told you not to be late!""
""I'm on my way, the map's showing that I'll be there in 2 minutes.""
""Okay, I'm waiting, be fast.""
She ran down the street, bumped into a guy, and excused herself.
When she reached the cafe, all out of breath, she started looking for Bella. There she was, sitting by the mulberry tree.
""Hey, Carla,"" said Bella.
""Hi, girl,"" Bella replied, passing her a cup of coffee. ""I already ordered your favorite caramel frappe, and you came just in time.""
""Thanks, girl,"" said Carla.
""No need, man.""
""So... what's this 'something important' you wanted to talk about?""
""Nothing really, I just wanted to meet you, and you would have never come, so that's why I said it's urgent.""
""Oh, okay.""
""Hmm... so how's life? How's everyone at home?""
""Everyone's good, life's great. I was wondering if we can go to the mall later this evening?""
""Yes, why not?"" Bella replied.
The two of them spent the rest of the evening together, chatting about their lives, childhood memories, and God knows what not.
Just as they were about to leave the mall, Stephanie called her. ""God forbid what have you been up to! It's 6:30 already, and you haven't reached home yet! You said you'd be home by 5, you little rascal!""
A muscle twitched in Carla's face as she hung up. Bella noticed her expression and asked if everything was alright. Carla told her it was a wrong number, nothing to worry about.
Bella offered her a ride home, which she gladly accepted. On the way home, Carla replied back to the earlier text, asking if they could meet tomorrow.
""Music?"" asked Bella.
""Yes, please.""
Listening to their favorite song, they were enjoying their ride home when it started to drizzle. Carla rolled down her windows a bit so she could smell the rainy earth.
When they reached Carla's home, Bella hugged her tight and said goodbye. Before going, Carla stood in front of the porch to wave her off. Once Bella left, Carla hesitated a bit, thinking of what was to come next...

**Story so Far:**  
The Whales enter the kitchen of an abandoned house and divest it of everything interesting.  
\_\_\_

**Yesterday, Rhamus Road, Teth-Odin:**

Rhamus Road was once known as Riverflow until two hundred years ago. It was once where homes of the well-to-do citizens stood, but when a disastrous Monster Flood caused the Storm Gate Fortress (among a few others) to overflow, it saw an exodus of residents from that particular area of Teth-Odin and turned what was once a neighborhood of bright and lively households into a squalid group of dilapidated structures where criminals lurked and shady businesses were conducted. One such resident however, stubbornly refused to move.

That man's name was Magnor Rhamus. Part of the reason he refused to move was due to its ease of access to the main roads of Teth-Odin, and another part had something to do with any satyr's built-in genetic instinct to stand one's ground in the face of trouble. As the exodus from Riverflow Street worsened, Magnor offered to buy a few houses from those he was well-acquainted with, converting them into shops where intrepid merchants could set themselves up at a reasonable price.

Years passed by and Magnor's vision of a peaceful and lively Riverflow Street was starting to take shape. A few years later, the Lord Mayor had the name changed to ""Rhamus Road"" in his honor, as thanks for reviving that section of the city so accessible to the main streets. The posh houses were replaced with bustling shops, the furtive pitter-patter of thieves' feet became the clip-clop of hooves and a staccato of wood and leather heels coming over to buy, sell, trade, if not sit down for a spell at a cafe, bar, or restaurant. The frivolous gossip of servants and house-ladies was replaced with stentorian calls of merchants promising affordable prices for quality goods and the jubilant singing of drunken adventurers, thanking the Gods for all of them gathered at one table for another day.

Tragically, Magnor died in his sleep many years later, only a few days before petitions sent by residents of Rhamus Road were approved by the lord mayor of Teth-Odin, which saw the construction of a triangular median serving as a buffer between Rhamus and the main road, a little place where a pedestal was erected, where a statue of Magnor was built in his honor. The same statue that stood at the entrance of Rhamus Road. The same statue that greeted The Whales as they rounded around the corner as they first entered this city following Kvaris' directions of ""an old family friend"" that might provide them a place to set up Autumnhollow.

Kinu, Kvaris, and Ingrid laid a flower and lit a candle at the foot of the pedestal, offering a short prayer. The cold morning air nearly put out the little candle, almost, but it continued to burn while they prayed. A minute later the three rose.

""So? Race back home?"" Ingrid said, pulling her hood back on. The three of them looked like they were the The Whales Volleyball team on an early morning jog thanks to Philia obtaining some matching exercise wear from Earth. A thought that the other reincarnators shared.

""Mhmm!"" Kinu and Kvaris wagged their tails and nodded, Ingrid couldn't help it and ruffled the two girls' hair, who leaned into her touch, ears wiggling as they did so.

""If we ever visit Earth you two are going to be really popular‚Ä¶"" Ingrid purred, smiling as the two sisters glomped him.

""Mmm‚Ä¶Why?"" Kinu asked, glomping Ingrid.

""Because on Earth, a lot of people find those who look like garms and ciltrans very cute."" Ingrid said, leaning down and Kinu turned up her face for a smooch.

""I thought Earth didn't have any other people but humans."" Kvaris queried, making soft dog-whining noises before Ingrid also gave her a loving smooch.

""Mwaaah\~ didn't stop humans from imagining it."" Ingrid said.

Passersby giggled and snickered as they saw the sight. It looked like two garm girls walking their human.

""Let's go then!"" she said after they pulled away. The sisters, rather than race her, contented themselves to just follow her a few steps behind, tails wagging.  
\_\_\_

Five minutes later, two servals (cat-folk) rounded into the entrance to Rhamus Road, stopping by Magnor's statue and dropping a customary flower at the base of the pedestal. Aside from being a token of respect, it was also known as a prayer for good luck, a custom that made the corner stores selling flowers and herbs thrive well. The two glanced up at the statue of Magnor, his gentle features smiling at the endless procession of travelers, adventurers and citizens alike along the main road. At his hand was a watering can, perpetually sprinkling water into a basin at his feet. This in turn flowed through pipes to water the planters that housed colorful flowers and ornamental plants. It was a satyr custom that any statue made in one's honor involve flowing water. Satyr statues traditionally were built within sight of rivers, waterfalls, or the sea. Here within the walls of Teth-Odin, the fountain-like watering can perfectly captured Magnor's legacy of revitalizing a once dilapidated district into a bustling hub of commerce.

Making a short and quiet prayer, the two cats proceeded down Rhamus Road at an unhurried pace. One had gray and white fur with black bands while the other was almost entirely black, save for the white patch at the tip of his ears. They were purring as they looked around, it was a nice and busy street full of shops and the occasional house or two, a pleasant and beautiful neighborhood to walk around in no matter what hour of the day.

""We should head to Magnor's Arcade."" The gray cat reminded his companion as they walked along, a group of laughing and screaming kids ran by them as they played, the gray one deftly leaning to the side and catching a young elf boy by the arm as his foot caught on the cobblestones and tripped.

""Careful."" The gray cat smiled as he and his companion moved along.

""Isn't Magnor's Arcade the site of the old man's home?"" the black cat asked.

The gray one nodded in reply, ""A distant relative of his bought the property and continued his dream to develop Rhamus Road. Don't let the name fool you, to this day the arcade was never built and remains a shop front accommodating seven three-storey establishments. A place like that with a storied history would no doubt have stores that would fit the everyday life of our quarry, hence my recommendation we stop by there.""

The black cat's ears wiggled curiously ""They've never developed the property further?""

""I can only guess at this point."" The gray cat meowed as he and his companion backed into an alley, there was no hurry for them to be anywhere now they were in the right street. A sleepy maiyeah (rabbit-folk) sat down on his bench, finished setting up his little shop of rolled tobacco and other little comforts someone might need before beginning a day's work.

The two cats came over and made their purchases from the sleepy rabbit, slipping a bundle of rolled tobacco into one pocket, but not before taking one out to enjoy now. They leaned on the opposite wall, watching the morning crowd begin their day.

The two cats purred in pleasure as they lit their cigars. It was spiced with a delicious fragrance, and the leaf it was made of was masterfully aged and seasoned in a way that filled their mouths with a delightful taste that could only be described as heavenly. Tobacco was one of Teth-Odin's exports after all, and one of the advantages of smoking tobacco right in the city that made them was that it was ripened perfectly. Those that were marked for export were completely at the mercy of fate; the travel time as the wagons plied the roads, the ripening at some off-site storehouse with probably less-than-optimal conditions, the inevitable wait between customs throwing off the timing, and inspection meant the buyers from distant cities had to make do with imperfect leaves.

One had good money to pay for perfected blends brought in from afar. Most had to supplement their otherwise fine cigars or pipe-leaf with good coffee or wine to make up for the loss of flavor.

It was one of the reasons the two cats enjoyed their job. They get to travel places and enjoy their products the way it was meant to be, and all at a fair price.

Teth-Odin leaf as far as New Gorpisal already ballooned to a quarter of its original price to say nothing about the imperfect blend and aging. Rumor has it however, that the Guildmaster of the Fenrir's were perfect. Just as good as grown from the Teth Valley itself and it was said his sources were as secretive as the adventurers these two cats were here to spy on.

""Ah, good stuff."" The black cat said with a content sigh. The gray cat purred in assent.

""So what's interesting with the arcade?"" The black cat pressed as they continued their people-watching.

""My research from city hall records show that Magnor's Arcade was one of the first few properties developed after the exodus from Riverflow."" The gray cat said quietly, ""...word was, Magnor thought that the storefront was profitable enough, and thus saw no reason to improve on it yet. To this day what was supposed to be an arcade remains a shopfront. Behind it should be an empty lot.""

""Makes sense,"" The black cart murmured, ""So he focused on lining Riverflow street with commercial facades to draw in people... businesses started booming and one little ignored lot quickly got forgotten in the grand scheme of things. Something like that?""

The gray cat nodded in agreement, taking a long drag from the rolled tobacco, ""Right. Or, it could be a satyr custom. Usually, when a venerable home of an honored man has to be taken down, a private family shrine will dedicated to the site out of honor of providing the world a great service. Not all Rhamus clansmen are like that mind you. Last I checked, they were more of the Stymisian denomination which finds such practices a little frivolous. It could be empty.""

The two cats leaned back, smoking their tobacco in deep thought as they adjusted their coats to keep warm against the chilly morning air. The gray cat looked down the pleasant little alley that led further towards minor out-of-the-way shops, and further that were houses. All of them were a reflection and testament to Rhamus Road's prosperity. It was in no way close to some aristocrat's row, but it was also miles away from some impoverished slum.

Not that Teth-Odin had that kind of stark contrast, but for them, it would've helped their mission if it did. Adventurers that were competent enough would flare their auras as they walked about, making any thief with ill-intentions think twice before making them a target and clandestine observers like the two cats know they weren't ordinary people.

""But why stake out the arcade specifically?"" The black cat asked, scratching his whiskers.

""There's a chance the Whales have taken lodging in Magnor's arcade. Maybe in that abandoned lot behind the storefront."" The gray cat replied, flicking the ashes of his cigar, ""There's no information about it, nobody asks about that place. That would make it the perfect place for them to stay there. My contact at the Jormungand guild told me that they lived somewhere in this street. I know Siria Bluethorne is in the party as the leader and I'm sure she would insist on a location like that since she's very particular about not being easy to find.""

""Well, you should know I too have done my own digging..."" The black cat said, taking a drag from his little cigar. His gray companion looked at him expectantly as he trilled in pleasure at the cigar's exquisite taste.

""What did you find?""

The black cat handed him a small slip of paper, which his gray companion quickly pocketed.

""Memorize the contents of that later,"" the black cat said as he handed it over. ""I have there the roster of their companions taken from Teth-Odin. Siria is among them, but not their leader.""

""Huh‚Ä¶ interesting."" The gray cat said before taking another drag off of his cigar, purring in pleasure.

""Among this adventurer team The Whales are Kinu and Kvaris Enthana-""

The gray cat quietly meowed in surprise, leaning back incredulously.

""Amaduscia's pups?""

The black cat nodded, purring,

""That's quite a team Siria's assembled...""

""The current owner of Magnor's Arcade is Zarael-""

""The cheesemaker?"" the gray cat asked, he was a fan of Zarael's wheels of premium cheese. They weren't sold in the city of Teth-Odin, but directly from his family's estate in the valley. He had already indulged in a few slices of them and they were just absolutely heavenly. There was supposedly a stall selling them within the Storm Gate Fortress as well, but as the cats were working a clandestine job, they couldn't enter to confirm this.

""Yes, the cheesemaker. As you know, he took over Magnor' properties after his death and if I remember correctly, Zarael claims to be a distant relative of the Rhamuses... in no small part due to the great satyr diaspora a thousand years ago.""

""And Zarael is a good friend of Amaduscia Enthana,"" The black cat continued quietly, ""It makes sense now. The sisters must have insisted on taking them to Magnor Road and appealing to the friendship her father and Zarael had to secure lodging for her team. That way, it also satisfies Siria's need to keep her team on a low profile. Also, I'm sure that would also come with a discount to any and all businesses that ply their trade on any properties Zarael owns. It's the perfect place for them.""

The gray cat nodded, taking another drag from his cigar, ""Anyone else of note?""

**Autumnhollow, Behind Magnor's Arcade:**

The cool morning air was broken with the sounds of gunfire as the mice began their marksmanship training. The Whales habitually got up early, they only slept in when they were taking a couple of days off. Now that they were going to sortie tomorrow however, they had returned to their routine.

There was also much to do for everyone, there were last-minute orders that needed to be picked up among other things the team needed to retrieve from shops around Teth-Odin.

The larkirk pigeons cooing atop the Hesco barriers that enclosed the firing range didn't flinch as the mice conducted their marksmanship training. Like the mice, these intelligent birds had taken to the power of firearms, cooing with interest as they watched the mice take down distant targets with their M1 Garands using real full-sized, full-power 7.62x51mm bullets.

The mice's daily training was something that Ingrid and Philia didn't even mention to them. Once they had witnessed the power their guns and various tools afforded to them, they had began on their own initiative on training their bodies and honing their skill.

They were first to finish breakfast at the table every morning and always hurried to the training grounds while the rest of the Whales were still having their first meal of the day. As soon as they were done washing their paws and snouts, the mice would hurriedly scurry upstairs to don their armor. The wooden floor above would reverberate with the staccato sounds of the mice's little feet followed by the rhythmic clinking of their lamellar armor that would make Genghis Khan's elites envious as they quickly marched to the forecourt of the Autumnhollow House, lining up like little soldiers for inspection.

Arthur, Charles, Gerald, Riker, Aiden, and Rykard inspected their subordinates, making sure their armor was put on properly and helmets were securely fastened. The leaders also made a quick inspection of each one's guns before giving it back and the mouse snapping on the magazine and pulling the charging handle, chambering the round.

Satisfied, Arthur squeaked loudly and the mice quickly marched in step, pausing briefly to salute Ingrid. The Starchaser returned the salute before she, Kinu, and Kvaris went jogging outside.

The villagers in Ram Ranch were treated to the now-regular sight of the mice marching to the training grounds for their usual marksmanship and fencing practice. The mice snapped a salute to the villagers as they waved. They've already been accustomed to the distant sound of gunfire, and were content to not pry on what sort of magical devices the mice were given. The villagers of Ram Ranch after all, were sensible folk. The concept of magic alone was already a bewildering topic, and these ""guns"" were no different. To them, it was just another form of arcane craft best left to those who knew how to handle it.

The pigeons cooed, as if impressed at the newcomer mice's marksmanship catching up to their seniors' proficiency. To save bullets, the mice trained in fives, while the rest practiced their fencing with long sticks to simulate their glaives. The four shadow mice who were given swords used sticks of approximately the same length. Without any prompting from Ingrid, they had organized their own fencing practice routine; each sword-wielding shadow mouse would protect his golden mouse partner from multiple attackers, simulating a worst-case scenario.

Meanwhile, the other mice clambered up and down a makeshift obstacle course. While this sort of agility was natural to them in the wild, it was different when wearing full battle gear, and the mice after feeling the weight knew the importance of conditioning their bodies.

Ingrid arrived in twenty minutes, holding to her chest a new gun. The mice halted in their training as Arthur let out a loud squeak, which was apparently the mousy equivalent of a ""Ten-hut!"" and the mice snapped into a salute. Ingrid returned the gesture.

""Gather around, everyone!"" Ingrid said as she held out one of their newest toys. Philia stuck to her guns about not standardizing their main weapons, citing that it provided the mice with enrichment and kept them from becoming too reliant on any one type of gun... which was the case for Philia's stores.

""Gentlemen,"" Ingrid began as she presented the assault rifle ""this is the Bushmaster ACR or Adaptive Combat Rifle... I will teach you how to use this gun, not just in firing it but also how to clear any jams as well as how to take it apart and clean it if there are any problems...""

**An alley at Rhamus Road, Teth-Odin:**

The two cats left the alley and stepped back into the main avenue that was Rhamus Road, stopping only by a nearby stall to buy some after-smoke candies. They purred happily as they opened the leaf-wrapped candies and plopped them into their mouths with gusto, their tails wagging like metronomes as they savored the minty flavor that cleansed their palates. The avenue was bustling and full of life even this early morning, and it made both cats happy. They've seen too many miserable little villages, too many ransacked towns with reduced to smouldering ruin, too many cities quickly abandoned. Seeing Teth-Odin warmed their hearts, it was a bastion of happiness ironically nestled atop a dungeon where dangerous monsters lurked.

Most of the avenue was populated with commercial establishments, and only the occassional house of some wealthy man. The two cats stood in front of one gate, tails slowly curling curiously as they eyed the house before them. It looked too small to accommodate a team such as the Whales.

The gray cat quietly enumerated the names on the list.

""So we're looking at more than ten people in this party, give or take."" he said, his voice trilling with excitement was the smell of delicious food wafted into his nose ""Not this house, something bigger, an inn maybe..."" he turned his head and looked down the avenue but most establishments didn't look like they accommodated any form of lodging. At least not on first glance.

""You still think they might live in that empty lot. Vorque?"" The black cat asked, walking along as a leisurely pace. There was no need for them to be in hurry; it was early in the morning and based on his study of the city map, the nearest entrance to the dungeon was the Storm Gate Fortress and the fastest route was heading to the main street that they came from.

""Possibly not, Nive."" Vorque replied, ""But it is Zarael's property and I'm sure an establishment like that which has stood for so long means it would have something that would be relevant to an adventurer's daily lives...""

The two cats observed the shopfront that was supposed to be Magnor's Arcade. The shops at the center looked to be a more recent construction compared to the rest, after all, an arcade was a roofed courtyard where various shops ringed around it. It seemed that Zarael or whoever took over Magnor's dream after his death quickly filled the entrance arch and just turned it into a series of fronts.

The shopfronts were three stories tall and were of reasonable depth to have enough space for the proprietor and their families to live above the ground floor commercial establishment, the two cats walked around the building, ducking into an generously wide alley as they tried to survey the property. Tall privacy fences of wolf-oak surrounded the perimeter, making it difficult to peer into the lot without being obvious as the alley they were in was also populated with stalls and other commercial establishments. On the arcade's side of the curb, prickly bushes deterred any would be loiterers from settling down to spy and tall trees prevented anyone from a high vantage point to look into the area. Again, the cats settled down to a stall run by a young jodove selling freshly baked meat pies. Purring, the pair kept an ear towards the property, but any sounds they tried to pick up were drowned by ecstatic bird-songs, the calls of merchants, and the cries of children playing.

Hearing nothing, the two cats resumed walking around the curb until they emerged on the opposite side of the arcade. A pair of stout oaken gates gave access to the empty lot at the back and it looked reasonably well maintained.

""Someone lives in here all right,"" Nive muttered, pulling his coat closer to himself as a gust of wind blew through, sending a shiver through his body.

""Maybe it's a little shrine dedicated to Magnor after all..."" Vorque guessed. The two of them climbed up the three steps up the elevated veranda and walked down in front of the shops. Four of them were occupied, two were boarded up and one was closed with a sign indicating that the owner was away on a trip. They both headed towards the restaurant at the side opposite them, it was beside a bakery and both establishments were already starting to fill with hungry customers.

The restaurant they went to specialized in regional dishes from the Teth Valley, as they approached, they saw many diners heartily eating a good breakfast of Teth-style goat stew served with pickled mushrooms. A second outdoor kitchen was on this veranda, a good way to show off to the people that their signature dish was being made fresh. A jolly orc matron bearing the Valiant God's visage stirred a big pot constantly, which bubbled and let out a delicious aroma of freshly chopped herbs and finely seasoned meat while her assistant behind her turned a big roasting goat on a spit. The two quickly hurried over, hunger tugging at their feline bellies.

""Mother!"" Vorque called, a common appellation in orcish cultures towards older women, ""Two stews please!""

""At once, boys!"" the orc replied, ladling a generous portion into two wooden bowls. Small talk ensued between Vorque and the matron while Nive hurried over to claim a vacant table.

The two of them were purring happily as they ate their stew with gusto, it came with complementary buttered bread fresh from the adjacent bakery which turned out to be also owned by the matron herself. Technically though, the matron had told Vorque, the bakery was run by her eldest son who had found himself a good baker recently.

""Eddy?"" Nive said as he dipped his buttered rolls into his stew, ""I doubt that name will be useful to us.""

""Probably not."" Vorque remarked. Both of them were keeping an eye on the street, in particular, the two gates that led further inside the property. Nobody came in or out, but the freshly painted wood was an indicator that at the very least, the place was being maintained.

""We're not asking if anyone lives behind this arcade."" Nive muttered quietly.

""Agreed, too obvious.""

There was a pause as the two of them quietly ate, pretending to make small talk with each other so that anyone observing the two would merely think they were just two regular customers enjoying a morning meal.

""That said..."" Vorque said after the conversation died a bit ""...is your information correct?""

The Nive nodded, ""My contact within the Fenrir Guild confirmed to me that this team, The Whales was founded by the human Ingrid Lily herself. He was present when Ingrid appeared at the Guild Hall and went straight to Siria Bluethorne's desk. There was quite a commotion after all, seeing a Nemesis-Stalker wearing a drow's Solenrala, but Siria gave her endorsement nonetheless and during the testing day the human conducted herself with due honor and etiquette-""

""Etiquette how?"" Vorque asked quietly as he laid pickled mushrooms atop his buttered bread, before ladling a generous amount of stew atop it.

""During the duelling exam, Ingrid was paired off against Zardos-""

""You're talking about Zardos the Steel Horn, right?""

The black cat nodded.

""...my contact was a silver-rank and by his expert opinion, he couldn't follow Ingrid's movements. Zardos was completely on the backfoot. Ingrid was deliberately holding back during the fight. What's more, she didn't end the fight by defeating Zardos but by pretending to have a lapse of concentration, allowing him to maintain his dignity as proctor. She passed the test by showing she was capable of defending herself and holding her ground without needing to overcome him.""

Vorque gulped down his morsel, wiping his whiskers. ""That's quite unexpected. Many would-be adventurers of exceptional talent usually try to defeat a proctor to show off-""

""A war-mutilated man could count how many actually can and still have digits to spare‚Ä¶"" Nive chuckled, Vorque joined him in his mirth.

""Indeed‚Ä¶ yet here we have a human who understood the nature of this test and regarded her proctor with respect. Truly, she's earned that Solenrala.""

The two of them took their time to eat. Keeping an eye out for anyone who might resemble the description of any member of The Whales. Bowls of stew and a plate of pickled mushrooms was replaced with a post-entree meal of ""Valley Shepherd's Repast."" It consisted of unleavened flat bread, a bowl of clotted cream that was mixed with spices and herbs, thick slices of cold ham, and a heavy savory ""dip"" consisting of meat, cheese, and potatoes.

**Chapelle's Arms Emporium:**

""Ermmm‚Ä¶"" Cuddly murmured, cutely eating his carrot as Kinu cuddled him in her lap.

The two sisters sat at Chapelle's office, smiling as they saw him walk in carrying their ancestral kriegsmesser swords and one other object.

""For the moment I only have one Duregar War Dart."" The crocodile said, he held up a dart the size of a pencil. After putting a negligible amount of his mana through it, it had transformed into a sword-like javelin with a long narrow blade and a rather short but heavy handle.

""We need about ten of these."" Kvaris said. ""We'll pay in full.""

The crocodile chuckled, a deep crocodilian bellow in his throat. ""Nice try, but I won't be a great merchant if I charge Amaduscia Enthana's daughters the listed price. What are you planning anyway?""

""Thrown weapons for our mice familiars,"" Kinu replied, patting Cuddly's head, the fae hair ermm'd cutely and flattened his ears. ""While I'm tempted to ask for that dart now, it'll make re-registering the remaining darts very difficult, so we'll wait. They're doing fine on their own for the moment.""

""I assume you two are planning to sortie soon?"" Chapelle inquired.

Kvaris' eyes didn't show she was joking ""Tomorrow to be exact. Kinu and I have been hearing rumors that a Rogue Rift had manifested in the dungeons below. We'll find out tomorrow if this is the case.""

""We predict it's going to be a lengthy siege so I imagine we'll be busy for the next few days, and probably another few more to sort off our loot. So this order won't be that urgent.""

There was a flicker of worry in his eyes, he didn't want to be known as the man who sold Amaduscia Enthana's daughters the last weapon before their doom, but he reminded himself of the company the girls kept. Their leader was a talking, intelligent Nemesis-Stalker who thought beyond the usual ""feral"" human needs such as food, shelter, and fighting. He was reminded of the fierce Red Banner of the Nightmane Tribe; Sammy Foster, how she and the Enthana sisters had held their ground and won in the Red Moon back in New Gorpisal. The sisters didn't look like they were lying either when they said that the legendary Siria Bluethorne on their side as well.

The crocodile sighed, ""You better come back alive or Amaduscia will have my scales for this. Fifteen. I'll give you fifteen and enhance their weight.""

Kvaris smiled ""Thank you!""

The crocodile scowled ""You should have come to ask me sooner!""

""The idea for these war-darts only came along yesterday."" Kvaris said, ruffling Cuddly's head.

""Ermm‚Ä¶"" Cuddly rubbed his head against her hand.

Chapelle tilted his head quizzically ""Why fifteen? I seem to recall you have more mice than that.""

""We do,"" Kinu told him ""But most of them already fight at range. Few of our mice however, the shadow mice in particular, may need them in some situations.""

Chapelle let out a soft guttural bellow ""Alright, if you insist. Now, for your orders: I just finished these last night. I just finished attaching the final gemstones an hour ago‚Ä¶""

He held up the Enthana sister's kriegsmesser swords, the scabbards now bearing what looked like a big gem on a bigger decorative bezel near the area where the sheath met the sword's crossguard.

""Attached your \[Recall Pommels\] I have."" The crocodile announced proudly, ""It works both ways too, unlike most other recall pommels, you can now bring this weapon to either hand and return it to it's sheath so long as it's in a position where there's space for the sword.""

The two sisters gratefully took their ancestral swords and slowly drew them. They thrummed with arcane energy.

Recall Pommels were not uncommon magical items. Many professional militaries and guards of important people had them. Kinu and Kvaris however, being trained by their legendary father saw little use for such ""frivolties"". Furthermore the sisters had a shield which allowed them a way to protect themselves even without a weapon on hand. Their shields themselves also had a dagger strapped to it.

With a nod of his head, Chapelle opened the door to his backyard where the training dummies were. The sisters began strapping their kriegsmessers to their waists just as before. The training dummies were about thirty feet away, but there was no need to get any closer.

Kvaris tested her sword first. She raised an arm and channeled \[Mana\] into her fist as she closed her fingers, her kriegsmesser materialized just as her digits reached the optimal position. Swinging her sword while pouring in more energy, it generated a crescent-shaped pressure wave of razor-sharp wind about thirty feet wide, hitting multiple dummies and cutting deep gouges across them.

""Whoa‚Ä¶"" Kvaris breathed ""I wasn't even putting in much \[Mana\] into that swing. This is masterful work, Chappelle!""

The crocodile let out a quiet throat bellow as he chuckled. ""It's an honor to hear praise from you. Studying your \[Tempest Lance\] helped me get a good idea on how the wind enchantment works, as well as your artifact.""

He handed back Cuddly's Ether Ring to him, affectionately patting the fae hare who returned the gesture.

""Ermmm‚Ä¶"" Cuddly murmured as he put his ring back on.

""While sheathed the swords will steadily use the surrounding \[Ether\] to regain its energy, as a result, you will not need to use much of your own \[Mana\] in regards to summoning or recalling the weapon, or to use its power to generate cutting gusts of wind.""

Kinu was next, swinging her sword to create smaller, controlled cutting gusts.

""This is amazing, excellent work, Chapelle!""

The crocodile nodded lightly, smiling. The quartet then returned to his office to pay the balance in gold coins.

I get it, it‚Äôs basic diner food. It‚Äôs not elevated dining. I couldn‚Äôt care less about the wacky retro decor or the rubber ducks. I just want a halfway decent meal. Apparently that‚Äôs too tall an order for this place. I‚Äôve gone a handful of times in the last ten or so years. Literally every meal has been sad and disappointing. Yet it‚Äôs constantly busy and if you try to go on the weekend it‚Äôs a 45 minute wait.

I decided to give it another shot today. Breakfast platter with 4 over medium eggs, hash browns, toast and sausage links. Added a short stack of pancakes.

Coffee so weak it can‚Äôt defend itself. Then the food begins to arrive. They bring me seven eggs on three separate plates. each wgg crispier than the last. Yolks completely cooked through. Definitely not over medium. Waitresses completely baffled about the number of eggs.

I take a bite of the egg and potatoes. There is no flavor whatsoever. I salt the shit out of them in hopes of bringing some life to them. To no avail. 

Tired of the bland, overcooked pile I move on to the sausage. Lukewarm and almost no taste. What little flavor it had didn‚Äôt resemble sausage.

Somehow, the toast was burnt on the crust but completely untoasted everywhere else. Fuck it. Surely the pancakes will be better.

Alas, no. After drizzling the meager portion of syrup I was allotted over them, it takes some effort to cut a bite off due to the extremely rubbery consistency. Their claim of ‚Äúthin, wispy pancakes‚Äù does not describe the fact that two of these paper thin asscakes don‚Äôt even equal one regular flapjack.

The shoes and coffee cups were each marked as ""medium"" items. The body spray was a ""small"". 

TELL ME WHY Vinted thinks it's reasonable to only send me a shipping label for one medium sized item for this bundle?? Because obviously 2 medium items + one small item are no longer going to fit inside one single medium sized package.

I've contacted support, and I'm hoping they'll provide a new shipping label for a large package so I don't have to cancel the order and risk that the buyer changes their mind if they have to pay more for shipping. But based on what other people have posted here, it doesn't seem likely that they will choose to resolve it in this way. I just really hope the buyer is willing to cancel and order again after I set one of the items to ""large"". 

But anyways, this seems like a huge and really ridiculous oversight in the Vinted system. If a buyer orders 10 pairs of shoes as a bundle, is the seller also expected to just ""make it work"" with 1 medium shipping label for one shoebox-sized box?

I have a Gaggia Classic Pro which I bought 2 years ago. I usually brew 1 coffee per day, and I‚Äôve never done a descaling until recently ‚Äî although I do backflush with Cafiza every month.

Recently, I bought a Bosch descaler and followed the step-by-step descaling instructions from the Whole Latte Love video.

I followed the instructions exactly as shown, except the manual recommended doing 4 tanks. That was the only difference.

After descaling, I tried brewing ‚Äî but the water was only dripping from the brew head, not the usual steady flow. I panicked and filled the tank twice with fresh water, then flushed both full tanks through the steam wand.

After doing that, things seemed fine for about a week. The flow returned to normal. But now it‚Äôs dripping again and seems like it‚Äôs clogged. I tried backflushing with Cafiza, but I think that made it worse.

1ldp2d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1ldp2d3/a_consise_definition_of_truth/,A consise definition of Truth.,"I'm writing this laying in bed this morning before coffee. In a note app no less which is such a departure from the normal routine.

Although to be honest this is a rehash of an older routine, back when I thought I knew something based on what others said.

Alright anyway, the other day somebody said something here about the truth. The general idea was that you'll die one day so be nice. YOLO for spiritual enthusiasts. There isn't anything wrong with this. It's a message worth spreading and repeating over and over‚Äîto dream better.

It's worth noting though that it isn't what Awakening is. And by golly I get it.

""Who are you to say what Awakening is? That's up to everybody to come to terms with on their own, got dammit!"" And you're right. But everybody who has Awakening dawn through them comes to the same Realization.

What wakes up was never born. So it can't die. This is the Truth, or one way to point towards it.

Here are some other, older, better written words to illustrate this sign:

> The sage neither rejects the world nor desires Self. He is free of joy and sorrow. He does not live and cannot die.

These words come from the Ashtavakra Gita. It's considered in some ways to be pretty advanced jargon, because it hammers away, over and over at the sense of attachment to whatever is happening.

The premise used in the text is that I am Awareness. That's all.

But this isn't a concrete ""I am this"" object called 'awareness,' in the same way one might say ""I am this body."" Why? Because Awareness isn't something I can reach out and grab.

The intention to reach out and grab anything is seen immediately and without effort by the same Awareness I attempt to reach. Awareness always stands before any activity, momentum or thought, down to the most subtle. And at the same time, it's insperable from whatever the thing seen happens to be. I reach, the reaching is seen, and it's seen from some ""thing"" which isn't separate from the reaching. 

These words are pointing at and ""attempting to capture"" a paradox. Both is and isn't. This is what the Ashtavakra Gita hammers at over and over, because the Paradox (which is Truth, and what you are) is naturally detached. It isn't holding anywhere, but nowhere is apart from it. So hilarious. Let's look at the pinch from the quotes earlier:

> The sage neither rejects the world nor desires Self. He is free of joy and sorrow. He does not live and cannot die.

So here you have it said three times. There isn't a rejection of the world, nor is there a desire for some absolute unity of the world either. This polarizes opposites to reveal the pinch of a paradox.

Again: free of joy, which is the opposite of sorrow‚Äîwhich the paradox is also free of.

One more time: does not live, cannot die. A pinch of a paradox. Where is it? The comma between ""does not live"" and ""cannot die.""

For myself, the breakthrough insight happened casually many years ago. The thought of being born came up while meditating and snapped out of view and it was a shock. Being born was only a thought. 

This body was born. And it's changed so much over the years, together with a personality, structured and restructured by experience. Somebody said, in an answer to ""What is truth,"" that change is the only constant. And it's true. 

But what knows this?

I mean in your own experience. You know you've changed in some way, personally, over the years. The body isn't the same one that was born, and it won't be the same one that dies. Nisargadatta says it well. You may be familiar with the situation the questioner is in.

**Questioner:** On the verbal level it sounds all right...But what am I to do to realise it as a fact, to go beyond into the changeless, wordless Reality?

**Nisargadatta:** You can do nothing. What time has brought about, time will take away.

Time consistently brings and takes away all the change. Time, in fact, is a measurement of change. 10 years old, 15, 25, 40, 65...

But something remains unchanged and even unbothered throughout all of this. That is what Awakening is about. It wakes up to itself beyond the idea of itself as any particular thing.

Not a particular feeling, nor the absense of feeling. Not a particular thought, **nor the absence of thought.** Not any thing, but also, not the absense of things either.

A paradox. 

And you can't do anything about it because the doer of any thing is what time brings and takes away. Here's this, again from the Ashtavakra Gita:

> When one realizes he is neither the actor nor the one who watches, the mind-storm is stilled.

This is so concise it's ridiculous. Time is the actor, for the sake of illustrating this point. Time brings change. All action is change. 

Now, when it comes to watching change happen, are you not aware of being aware? This is an incredibly subtle point. Obvious, but relegated to being unimportant because it's so natural, and effortless.

That which is aware of being aware is IT.

This, which is nameless and totally beyond the realm of ordinary experience, is insperable from and immediately aware of all experience. A paradox.

Is there a conclusion to this? Probably not. I can go on and on honestly, but I'll end it here to stretch, maybe brush my teeth and have coffee. Not necessarily in that order.",1,1750171647.0,awakened,5,1.0,False

My brother Sam died three years ago. Car accident. Driver fell asleep and swerved into oncoming traffic. Sam never saw it coming. One moment he was driving home from college, the next‚Äîgone.

We buried him on a Thursday. Closed casket. The impact had‚Ä¶ ruined his face. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for days after the funeral. I‚Äôd stare at my phone, scrolling through our old messages, rereading his stupid jokes and memes.

Two weeks after his funeral, I got a text from his number.

> ‚ÄúCold in here lol‚Äù

I dropped my phone.

I told myself someone had recycled his number. It happens, right? I didn‚Äôt reply. But the texts kept coming. Every couple of days. Random. Disjointed.

> ‚ÄúYo I left my charger at your place?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúDo you still play that zombie game?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúI hate Thursdays‚Äù

They were too specific. Too *him*. I even checked with the carrier. They said the number was deactivated the day after his death. I showed them the texts. The rep went pale and asked if I was pranking them. I wasn‚Äôt.

Eventually, I switched phones. New number. New carrier. It stopped.

Until last week.

It started again.

Same number. Same texts. Except now, they weren‚Äôt random. They were‚Ä¶ aware.

> ‚ÄúNice haircut.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúThat girl from the coffee shop smiled at you. Make a move already.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to work tomorrow.‚Äù

That last one hit differently. It arrived at 2:13 a.m. I stared at it until sunrise. I told myself it was nonsense. Went to work anyway.

At 8:46 a.m., a ceiling tile came loose in the warehouse. It missed me by two feet. Would‚Äôve crushed my skull.

I started replying.

**Me**: ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù
> **Me**: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Sam.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúCheck the attic.‚Äù

Our parents‚Äô house has a crawlspace attic, barely big enough to stand in. I hadn‚Äôt been up there since we were kids. Sam used to hide his comic books there.

That night, I went over. Told Mom I was helping her check for mold. I climbed the rickety ladder, flashlight in hand.

It was dusty and cramped. Cobwebs everywhere. I waved the light around until it landed on something in the corner. A shoe box.

Inside: photos. Of me. Sleeping. At work. In my car. Some from angles that meant whoever took them was *right there*. Watching me.

And one more thing: Sam‚Äôs old flip phone. The screen was cracked but still intact. Battery dead. I brought it down with me.

I didn‚Äôt tell my mom.

Charged it at home. It powered on.

There were no recent texts on it. Just old ones‚Äîfrom before he died.

But there was one draft. Unsent.

> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming back. Don‚Äôt trust‚Äî‚Äù

It cut off.

That night, I got another text.

> ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to find that.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt sleep.

Last night, I was watching TV when I got another ping.

> ‚ÄúCome outside.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move.

Then another text.

> ‚ÄúOr I‚Äôll come in.‚Äù

I grabbed the bat from beside the door. Quietly opened it. The street was empty.

Ping.

> ‚ÄúLook up.‚Äù

I looked at the roof. No one.

Then another text came in. A photo.

It was me. Standing at the doorway. From above.

From the *roof*.

I slammed the door shut and called the cops. Told them someone was stalking me. They searched. Found nothing.

Today, I smashed the old phone. Threw it in the river. Changed my number again.

But just now, I got a message.

No number. No contact name.

Just this:

> ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt ghost your own blood.‚Äù

As someone who developed this addiction during the pandemic and carried it for years, affecting my relationships, studies, and work, I want to share how I handled it.

First turn off social media notifications, one by one, day by day, or every other day. Start with the one you use the least, so that its absence bothers you a little, but not so much that you give up. Turn off notifications from each social network on your phone until you reach the most addictive one, which in my case was Instagram. Over time, you will get used to the absence of each one and it will be easier not to feel uncomfortable.

Now you must delete the social media applications, one by one, starting with the one you use the least and then the most addictive. This period can be difficult because you won't be able to go in to review anything. By the time you've deleted all your apps (I suggest a maximum of 2 weeks), you'll probably start to notice improvements in your productivity and focus.

Even if you no longer have distractions on your phone, you will still have them on your laptop. Whenever you're working on something on your computer and feel the need to check a social media feed, get up immediately and leave the room. Go get water, coffee, or just the bathroom. The idea is that you override that impulse by physically leaving the environment.

After you get over the awkwardness of checking social media on your laptop, turn off each one, starting with the least distracting one. In the end, you might notice how rewarding it is to not depend on them so much.

This strategy helped me a lot. After a month without social media, I felt an improvement in my concentration and a reduction in distractions. I don't know if it will work for everyone, but sharing it seemed important to me. I hope it helps someone else too.",2,1750171501.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

No fluff, no gimmicks, just affordable, effective steps to fix crepey, sagging skin and feel strong again.

If you‚Äôre tired of wasting money on miracle lotions that don‚Äôt deliver, this is for you. Pair this blog with my YouTube video where I show you exactly how I do each step.

**Step 1: Caroline Girvan Arm Workouts ‚Äì 10 to 15 Minutes a Day**

Strength training changed everything for my arms. I started following Caroline Girvan‚Äôs free arm workouts on YouTube. Just 10 to 15 minutes a day made a huge difference.

Exfoliation is key. I make a simple DIY scrub using used coffee grounds and olive oil. Massage it onto your arms in the shower 2‚Äì3 times a week.

This one might surprise you: I use a microcurrent device on my arms 2‚Äì3 times a week. It stimulates the muscles under the skin, boosting tone and firmness. It‚Äôs not just for your face! Consistent use really helped lift and tighten my upper arms without spending a fortune on spa treatments.

# Step 4: Boosting Daily Protein ‚Äì Skin and Muscle Repair

You can‚Äôt firm up crepey arms without feeding your body properly. I increased my daily protein intake with simple swaps‚Äîlike adding a scoop of protein to my smoothies or snacking on Greek yogurt. Protein supports skin repair and muscle growth, both crucial for reducing that thin, saggy look.

# Step 5: 1 lb Wrist Weights ‚Äì Wear Around the House

This one‚Äôs my secret weapon. I wear 1 lb wrist weights around the house for 1‚Äì2 hours a day while doing chores. It‚Äôs passive resistance training that adds up quickly. You‚Äôll be surprised how much tone and strength you can build just by turning everyday tasks into mini workouts.

# Final Thoughts: You Don‚Äôt Need a Miracle Cream‚ÄîYou Need a Real Plan

Crepey arm skin doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre fading‚Äîit just means it‚Äôs time to show your body some smart, consistent care. This 5-step routine helped me fix crepey arm skin at 60, and I truly believe it can work for you too.

PREVIOUS TOTAL: 2,890,889 yen.  
**CURRENT TOTAL: 3,045,589 yen**

OLD VERSION FROM 3 YEARS AGO:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/wh674m/the\_total\_amount\_of\_money\_kazuya\_has\_spent\_on](https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/wh674m/the_total_amount_of_money_kazuya_has_spent_on)

We will continue from chapter 240, the first chapter not covered by the previous post.

Fortunately, for the rest of the chapters (240-380), the only thing he spent on Chizuru was the date.

However, we also need to take into account all the preparations:  
Clothes: 79,400 yen (as mentioned by Kazuya in Chapter 345);  
Umbrella: \~2,500 yen (he said he bought an umbrella just for this date, I took an average cost for a durable umbrella.)  
Hairstyling: \~6,000 yen (it was a popular brand in Japan)

Practice date costs: (He only pays for himself here, except for the dinner with Mini. Most of the per-person expenses will be counted three times in total due to him paying for himself during the practice date and for both on the real date.)  
Passes into Joypolis: 5,500 yen/person. Kazuya states this on the third page of Chapter 337.  
Lockers: 500 yen/locker. Yes, they DO cost you money to leave your stuff.  
Umbrella stands: 100 yen/umbrella (why?)  
bills lunch:  
\- Pancakes x2 = 4,000 yen  
\- Iced coffee: 800 yen  
\- bills Yellow Curry: 2,000 yen  
....  
They did not state which dishes they ate on this practice date. ;(  
Taking a guess, it is probably \~9,000 yen.  
Photo booth: 200 yen? It was not mentioned, but Mini did ask Kazuya for 200 yen.  
Wild Wing ride: 800 yen/person  
Fortune Forest: 700 yen/person  
Murder Lodge: 700 yen/person  
Halfpipe Tokyo: 1000 yen/person  
Gekion Live Coaster: 1000 yen/person  
Pirate's Plunder: 700 yen/person  
Spicy Taxi: 700 yen/person  
All of the costs on the practice date were seen on this website:¬†[https://tokyo-joypolis.com/language/english/attraction/index.html](https://tokyo-joypolis.com/language/english/attraction/index.html)

Then, on the date itself, we have these expenses:  
Train fare: \~1,100 yen. This is only an approximation because the specific route wasn't mentioned, but they went from Numabukuro Station to Tokyo Teleport Station, as seen in chapters 353 and 354, respectively.  
Lockers: 1,000 yen.  
Umbrella stands: 200 yen.  
All the games in the Arcade: \~2,000 yen. (Taking a wild guess here)  
Lunch: 9,100 yen. Seen in Chapter 360.  
Passes into Joypolis: 11,000 yen.  
Gekion Live Coaster: 2,000 yen.  
Halfpipe Tokyo: 2,000 yen.  
Wild River Ride: 1,600 yen  
Murder Lodge: 1,400 yen  
Fortune Forest: 1,400 yen  
Dinner: \~14,500 yen. (Another wild guess)

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**

R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.

For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.

R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.

R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.

R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.

As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.

R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly

R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.

R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù

R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.

R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.

For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.

It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.

R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù

There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.

For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.

At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù

With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.

R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:

‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù

R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù

R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù

Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù

R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.

‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù

He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.

‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù

He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.

Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù

At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***

R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.

The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.

R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.

R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.

‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù

For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù

The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù

R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th)¬†day of the 13^(th)¬†month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù

R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù

As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.

R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.

Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.

‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.

‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.

‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.

R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù

R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'

He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.

R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.

At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.

‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.

‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.

‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù

R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.

For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.

At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.

‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.

‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.

‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù

With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù

The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.

R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.

A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'

‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.

'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'

Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.

He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.

R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.

R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.

Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù

It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù

‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.

‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.

You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.

When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.

This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.

‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù

‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù

[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)

The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù

The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù

Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.

I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù

The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù

The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù

The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù

Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.

‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù

Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.

‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

After much time eager to get a hario switch, finally pulled the trigger and bought one last weekend. I have been brewing a natural processed coffee from a local roaster, using bottled water from a new brand and a timemore C3 max. In all my brews I have been using 17 clicks and a ratio of 1:16.   
  
I jumped straight to the coffee chronicler recipe and I have been getting a very bitter coffee, although with some sweetness in it. I have tried to replicate the pouring CC shows in his Switch video. I'm hitting his brew times almost to a T. I tried 93, 90, and 85 ¬∞C and all the brews have been very bitter with some sweetness, no clarity and no acidity. I began to suspect the water was the problem. But as a comparison, I brew a full immersion and a CC coffee side by side. For the immersion, I did 91¬∞C, 3 min steep, gave it a stir with a spoon, and began drawdown at 4 min. The coffee had good sweetness, no bitterness, good body, and not much more.  
  
For the hybrid method, I used 90¬∞C and this time when I began drawdown at the 2 min mark I saw a ring of grounds stuck in the paper so I swirled switch to unstuck it, I think I did this either too late or too softly as a ring of grounds remained but the rest of the paper was free of stuck grounds. And I gotta mention that my previous CC brews had some grounds stuck in the paper. Well, this time the brew was way less bitter than previous attempts, maybe a tiny notch more than the full immersion one but I'm not sure, had some sweetness and a hint of acidity.

So basically, I think for my next brew I should try to give it a swirl as soon as I open the switch, although I'm curious, as CC in his video doesn't swirl at all and doesn't even mention it. Anyhow, what do you all think? Sorry if this reads to much like rambling, I'm writing this as I'm getting ready for work so I'm a bit in a hurry lol.",3,1750171104.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

I'm borrowing a family member's 2018 Salem by Forest River 36.5' 31KQBTS travel trailer. The family member that owns it isn't maintaining it and another family member that uses it has dumped a bunch of money into it. 

They spent $350 on a pair of Group TM24 DC batteries with 88Ah each (176Ah total) from Camping World in December 2023 and they've pretty much fried them by not having a disconnect for winter storage in southern York County, PA.

I've done a battery recondition on them but I'm not confident I'm bringing them back around so I'm interested in upgrading to LiFePO4 batteries but both of us that will be using it are novices and have no idea what we really need. I can't see us ever booking sites that don't have shore power so I'm not terribly worried about running things like the AC or coffee maker off of the battery bank. 

As far as I'm aware the main thing we need 12VDC battery for is the breakaway brakes, Electric tongue jack, and incidental light/system checking. How much Ah do we really need? 

We could get a WattCycle 12V 100Ah double pack for $342 right now on their website. That's an on paper increase of 13.6% and more than that when you take into consideration efficiency of the chemistry. ",3,1750171081.0,GoRVing,9,0.81,False

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**

R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.

For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.

R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.

R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.

R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.

As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.

R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly

R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.

R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù

R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.

R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.

For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.

It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.

R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù

There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.

For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.

At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù

With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.

R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:

‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù

R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù

R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù

Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù

R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.

‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù

He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.

‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù

He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.

Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù

At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***

R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.

The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.

R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.

R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.

‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù

For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù

The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù

R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th)¬†day of the 13^(th)¬†month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù

R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù

As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.

R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.

Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.

‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.

‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.

‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.

R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù

R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'

He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.

R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.

At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.

‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.

‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.

‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù

R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.

For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.

At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.

‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.

‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.

‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù

With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù

The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.

R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.

A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'

‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.

'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'

Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.

He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.

R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.

R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.

Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù

It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù

‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.

‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.

You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.

When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.

This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.

‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù

‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù

[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)

The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù

The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù

Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.

I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù

The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù

The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù

The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù

Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.

‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù

Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.

‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

Most of the people I have met here, I have met online. 

I don't drink, so I don't really know where to meet people. I went to the Zone once, because I heard people there are friendly, but the bartender acted weird towards me for not being there to drink. It was a weeknight, so maybe that had something to do with it. I've read other threads where people have suggested the Rook club, but I don't know where to find their events, and it is also a bar. 

I like to crochet, and I saw there was a crochet group at the library, but it is on a day I work. I go to the library sometimes, but it doesn't seem like a good place to meet people because it's a quiet environment. I also go to coffee shops, but I don't know how to approach people there because they look busy. 

I used to go to Bloom, which was an art studio ran by Stairways, when it was still around. Are there any other free or cheap art studios around? 

What do others who don't drink do around here for fun? I want to go to a play at the Playhouse or Warner, but I don't want to go alone. I've gone to the park downtown to hang out, but some of the people there seem to have substance abuse issues and aren't really people I want to hang out with.

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**









R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.



For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.



R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.



R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.



R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.



As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.



R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly



R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.



R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.



It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.



R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:



‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù



There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.



For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.



At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.



R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:



‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù



R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù



Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù



R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.



‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù



He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.



‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù





He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.





Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù



At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***



.

  
.



R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.



The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.



R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.



R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.



‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù



For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù



The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù



‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th) day of the 13^(th) month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù



R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù



‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù





As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.



R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.



‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.



‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.





R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'



He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.



R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.



At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.



‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.



‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.



‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù



R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.



At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.



‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.



‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù



‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.



‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù



The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.



R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.



A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'



‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.



'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'



Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.



He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.



R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.



R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.



Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù



It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù



‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.



‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.



You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.



When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.



This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.



‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù



‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù



[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)



The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù





The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù



Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.



I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù



The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù



The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù



The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù



Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.



‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù





Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.



‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

WALKING THE PATH TOGETHER





**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**









R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.



For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.



R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.



R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.



R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.



As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.



R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly



R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.



R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.



It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.



R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:



‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù



There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.



For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.



At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.



R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:



‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù



R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù



Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù



R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.



‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù



He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.



‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù





He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.





Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù



At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***



.

  
.



R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.



The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.



R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.



R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.



‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù



For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù



The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù



‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th) day of the 13^(th) month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù



R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù



‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù





As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.



R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.



‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.



‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.





R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'



He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.



R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.



At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.



‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.



‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.



‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù



R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.



At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.



‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.



‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù



‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.



‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù



The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.



R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.



A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'



‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.



'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'



Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.



He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.



R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.



R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.



Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù



It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù



‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.



‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.



You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.



When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.



This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.



‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù



‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù



[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)



The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù





The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù



Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.



I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù



The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù



The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù



The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù



Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.



‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù





Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.



‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

1ldos2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1ldos2v/tips_for_getting_more_consistent_restful_sleep/,"Tips for getting more consistent, restful sleep","About three weeks ago, I (24F) had a three day anxiety attack and couldn‚Äôt sleep for those three days. I finally ended the insomnia by taking a costco sleep aid. I‚Äôm now in therapy for anxiety and looking to help myself attain restful sleep. On average, I don‚Äôt think I was getting enough sleep prior to this as I would average 6-7 hours a night (sometimes 4-5 if I procrastinated sleeping due to lack of free time during the day) and about 10-12 hours of sleep on weekends. I‚Äôve realized during this whole process that I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had restful sleep. I already go to the gym and move/workout pretty regularly so I know that isn‚Äôt the problem. I know it‚Äôs anxiety around sleeping and generally feeling like I don‚Äôt have enough free time. I‚Äôve been trying to work on having a sleep schedule so I downloaded the Rise app yesterday as I read good reviews both on here and on other forums. Day one didn‚Äôt seem accurate but I was excited to get into the schedule it gave me. It told me I needed a solid 8 and a half hours a night which seems kinda reasonable. I took a melatonin four hours before bed, relaxed before bed but the only problem is I ate a greasy, cheesy slice of pizza too close to bed (I was hungry and family brought home pizza, couldn‚Äôt resist). The heartburn and slight nausea kept me from getting good sleep as well as taking a full rest day exercise wise because I pulled a few muscles (no lifting, no cardio, minimal walking). Also the pressure of making sure I was asleep during a certain window for sure gave me some anxiety. I am just wondering how I can start to get into the groove of a good sleep schedule. I procrastinated sleeping a lot in high school and college due to revenge bedtime procrastination and homework so it‚Äôs been at least a solid 10 years of kind of a bad sleep schedule. I don‚Äôt want to damage my brain or body any further. I‚Äôve finally started developing a sleep routine today and staying out of my bed unless I am going to bed (I work from home and have a habit of working in my bed). I only drink caffeine (tea, not coffee) in the morning. I hydrate myself, I exercise, I turn my devices on night shift mode two hours before bed and I try to ease my anxiety by deep breathing. I was thinking of picking up meditation as well, maybe yoga.
If I can‚Äôt get to sleep tonight despite being on a solid 3 and a half hours of very light sleep and going to the gym for a workout class tonight, I will take a costco sleep aid as the multiple days of sleep deprivation are NOT for me, but I would prefer not to go that route. Just want to add, I‚Äôve also tried weed and it‚Äôs not for me for calming down. CBD works decently fine but the THC makes me paranoid and anxious to an insane degree, especially before bed. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you <3",2,1750170973.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**









R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.



For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.



R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.



R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.



R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.



As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.



R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly



R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.



R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.



It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.



R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:



‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù



There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.



For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.



At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.



R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:



‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù



R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù



Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù



R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.



‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù



He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.



‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù





He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.





Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù



At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***

R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.



The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.



R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.



R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.



‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù



For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù



The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù



‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th) day of the 13^(th) month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù



R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù



‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù





As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.



R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.



‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.



‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.





R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'



He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.



R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.



At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.



‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.



‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.



‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù



R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.



At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.



‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.



‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù



‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.



‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù



The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.



R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.



A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'



‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.



'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'



Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.



He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.



R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.



R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.



Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù



It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù



‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.



‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.



You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.



When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.



This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.



‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù



‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù



[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)



The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù





The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù



Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.



I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù



The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù



The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù



The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù



Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.



‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù





Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.



‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**









R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.



For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.



R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.



R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.



R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.



As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.



R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly



R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.



R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.



It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.



R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:



‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù



There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.



For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.



At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: ‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.



R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:



‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù



R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù



Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù



R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.



‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù



He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.



‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù





He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.





Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù



At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***



.

  
.



R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.



The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.



R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.



R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.



‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù



For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù



The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù



‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th) day of the 13^(th) month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù



R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù



‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù





As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.



R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.



‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.



‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.





R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'



He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.



R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.



At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.



‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.



‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.



‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù



R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.



At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.



‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.



‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù



‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.



‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù



The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.



R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.



A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'



‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.



'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'



Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.



He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.



R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.



R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.



Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù



It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù



‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.



‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.



You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.



When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.



This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.



‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù



‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù



[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)



The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù





The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. ‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù



Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.



I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù



The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. ‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù



The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù



The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù



Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.



‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù





Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.



‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

It's a medium size manufacturing and I work from headquarters 2 days a week and rest of the days I am on site. Since I started I was told working hours are 8-5 with a mandatory one hour lunch break. I started coming at 8 and realized most people don't show up before 8:20. Then they all go in to the massive kitchen, cook breakfast (their office is pretty nice), brew coffee and sit there watch the news and start talking to their coworkers. And don't work until 8:45-9. It makes me so mad coz I like to come in ready for work but technically no one starts till 9. All are here for visibility. To make matters worst the whole hour thing is forced by owner and he leaves at 4 himself. Then I keep hearing how everyone is watching you. (Why are they watching me. Don't they have their jobs to do. ). Then I went onsite and either people are working from home or leaving at 4. I have no clue how to deal with this. I feel everyone is finding ways to cheat the system. Instead it would be nicer to work on productivity and goals and if people are meeting them who cares what time they come into work. How do I set up my hours without getting too much attention ? I want to come by 8:30 and leave at 4:30. I do not take an hour long lunch break as there is literally nothing to do for an hour around these offices/sites. Most people live near the office and site and go home for the hour.

This is my first time posting, so I hope I am doing this correctly. My wife has had a favorite coffee mug for years since she received it after graduation. Sadly it fell and broke earlier this week and I have had no luck funding any replacement online. 

I have attached photos of what remains (minus the handle which was broken into too many pieces to be of much help). After inspection, I can find no identifying markers on it that could lead me to finding a replacement. 

It was originally gifted to alumni of St. Mary‚Äôs College, a sister school of Notre Dame if that information is helpful. 

Any replacement does not need to have the St. Mary‚Äôs insignia/logo. What I am looking for is a replacement that matches the body of this mug. Color also is not a concern, but just the form as, in my wife‚Äôs words: ‚Äúit holds *just* the right amount of coffee‚Äù. I have a cup of my own that I feel the same way about, so I completely understand her sentiments.

# How to identify a good small business idea

Finding good, profitable small business ideas takes a strategic approach, not just guesswork. Research shows businesses need¬†[two to three years on average](https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/startup/deciding-what-business-to-start)¬†to become profitable. This makes picking the right chance from the start vital.

# Match your skills with market demand

Smart entrepreneurs start by listing their strengths and experience. Think about what comes naturally to you and where your expertise shines. Many entrepreneurs can easily come up with business ideas. The real challenge lies in picking the right one to pursue.

You need deep knowledge of your intended market. Learn if customer needs are growing, stable, or shrinking. You should also know your target audience, the people who will most likely buy your product or service.

While reviewing potential ideas, check out existing competition. Most people think competition is bad, but it verifies market demand. Competition shows you won't need to create a new market, which usually takes substantial resources.

# Understand startup costs and scalability

The first step is to calculate one-time and recurring expenses. One-time costs include business formation fees, equipment purchases, and branding materials. Your recurring expenses will cover rent, salaries, marketing, and inventory replenishment.

Put together a clear¬†[startup costs](https://bask.health/blog/low-cost-startups)¬†report that's easy to understand. This document proves helpful when you talk to investors or lenders. It also helps to set aside a backup fund (usually 10-20% of total estimated costs) for unexpected expenses.

To check scalability, ask yourself these key questions:

* Does your idea meet ongoing customer needs?
* Can you consistently duplicate the product or service?
* Will the idea serve customer needs as the business grows?
* Does your concept need constant review?

# Evaluate long-term profitability

The path to profitability starts with knowing your break-even point. To cite an instance, a cleaning business might need¬†[100 jobs monthly to be profitable](https://www.bgateway.com/resources/quick-ways-to-test-your-business-idea-is-viable). You must verify if enough potential customers exist in your target market.

Market changes can affect your business's future. Some business ideas might only serve temporary needs. Make sure yours addresses lasting consumer demands.

Your passion and persistence matter a lot. Late nights and multiple obstacles will come your way. A full review of your idea against these criteria will boost your chances of building a green, profitable business.

# Profitable business categories to explore

Learning about various business categories shows that certain sectors consistently outperform others in profitability and growth potential. Let's get into the most promising options in a variety of business models.

# Service-based businesses

The U.S. gross domestic product consists of more than 75% service businesses, which makes them an attractive choice for entrepreneurs. The individual and family services industry will add over one million jobs between 2019 and 2029. The construction industry stands out with the highest percentage of small businesses at 99.94%.

These profitable service options stand out:

* [Virtual assistance](https://bask.health/blog/home-based-businesses-to-start)¬†(administrative support for busy entrepreneurs)
* Cleaning services (steady 5.6% growth over five years)
* Personal fitness training ($14 billion in 2023)
* Financial services (bookkeeping, tax preparation, consulting)

# Online and digital businesses

The digital world creates exceptional growth opportunities. E-commerce sales hit $6.54 trillion in 2023 and should grow at a CAGR of 14.7% through 2028. The global software industry will reach $702 billion by the end of 2024.

Digital business models such as subscription services help companies generate regular income and develop lasting customer relationships. Freemium models provide simple services free while charging for premium features, which creates a pathway to steady revenue.

# Product-based and retail businesses

Research shows that¬†[setting the correct product price](https://bask.health/blog/start-small-business-online)¬†determines success. Retail businesses succeed by offering curated selections that big-box stores miss. Specialty grocery stores, coffee shops, and artisan marketplaces do well especially when you have underserved niches.

Dropshipping gives entrepreneurs a low-investment option to sell products without keeping inventory.

# Creative and freelance opportunities

Freelance writers can earn impressive incomes, averaging $74,316 yearly. Content creators ($60,283) and content strategists ($71,937) also earn substantial incomes.

Creative professionals in marketing thrive, with creative directors earning $101,711 annually. Photographers ($69,360) and artists ($62,268) can build environmentally responsible businesses by developing specialized skills and focusing on specific markets.



# Emerging trends in small business for 2025

The business landscape for good, profitable small business ideas will look different by 2025. New opportunities are emerging faster than ever, giving entrepreneurs fresh ways to grow in changing markets.

# Rise of health ecommerce and wellness services

The health and wellness e-commerce sector keeps breaking records. The global market should hit USD 7.00 trillion by 2025, up from USD 4.30 trillion in 2020.¬†[Online health product sales](https://bask.health/blog/shopify-for-healthcare)¬†will likely maintain a 20% annual growth rate through 2026. People care more about their health now, with 58% of US consumers putting wellness first in 2024 compared to last year. This creates room for entrepreneurs to provide customized supplements, wellness subscriptions, and direct-to-consumer health solutions.

# Growth in remote and virtual services

Remote work has become a revolutionary force in creating business opportunities. Digital jobs that can be done remotely will grow by 25% to 92 million positions worldwide by 2030. Virtual service providers are doing well as¬†[36.2 million Americans will work remotely by 2025](https://dwbridges.com/the-rise-of-virtual-services-how-outsourcing-is-shaping-the-future-of-remote-work/)‚Äîan 87% jump from pre-pandemic numbers. Businesses now outsource specialized tasks more often, which lets entrepreneurs provide virtual assistance, customer support, and expert consulting services anywhere in the world.

# Sustainability and eco-conscious business models

Sustainability has grown from a trend into a business essential. Wind and solar energy sectors show great promise, and the Energy Information Administration expects them to lead US power generation growth. Young consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, actively support businesses that put environmental responsibility first. Companies using circular ""borrow-use-return"" models instead of traditional ""take-make-waste"" approaches now have a competitive edge.

# Digital education and online learning platforms

The online learning industry expects an impressive¬†[18.6% annual growth from 2023 to 2030](https://www.dittotranscripts.com/blog/top-10-online-learning-trends-dominating-education/). This growth comes in part from 53% of postsecondary degree seekers taking online courses. New opportunities include microlearning platforms, AI-powered customized education, and virtual reality training experiences, with VR expecting 41.2% CAGR from 2022 to 2031.

1. One usb port, hdmi, sd card and jack are very dirty, I first thought they're rusty but that dirt comes down very easily so I believe it either might be pollen or some spilled coffee leftovers. Anyway can I clean them with 99% isopropyl alcohol? Like dampen the qtip with it and scrub the dirt from inside. I also need to figure out how to clean the thin sd card slot...  
2. What thermal paste you would recommend? Ppl here seem to talk a lot about ptm7950¬†but I can't find it in my location, only from Aliexpress. Also should I apply thermal paste or thermal pad? And is that ptm7950¬†really worth it? I can get ARCTIC MX-4 next day free delivery for 4 euros.

1ldoifb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ldoifb/crashing_out_on_my_uncles_polyamorous_girlfriend/,Crashing out on my Uncles Polyamorous Girlfriend,"Background gossip: Sephora and Duke are in an open relationship. Duke only wants Sephora, he‚Äôs committed to her. Sephora will post on socials about being in an open relationship all the time. About a year ago they broke up for a week. They got back together because while driving separate vehicles she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt take her eyes off of him‚Äù almost crashing into him or running him off the road. Duke's truck has not been working for about a year now. He goes to work and to home. If she‚Äôs available he is hanging out with her. He spends all of his money to ride the train to see her at college. The last time he went to see her she locked him out and left him in the dorm lobby. He consulted me about the issues via text. One hell of a celebration for his birthday. I don‚Äôt understand why they are still together; especially after barely spending 2 nights and 1 day together.

My grandmother planned a beach vacation for her kids' most recent graduations. Friday through Monday.  When planning she knew that the kids would want to bring their friends or partners on the trip. She primitively asked me to talk to Duke (20m) to not invite or bring Sephora (20f) on the trip. I didn‚Äôt have this conversation because I felt it wasn‚Äôt my place to set the perimeters. Specifically because other couples were okay to go. Elijah (18m) and Harmony (19f) along with I, Asher (23f), brought my boyfriend Hudson (25 m). Elijah also invited his friend Oliver (19 m). Hudson and I were roomed with Duke and Sephora. Everyone else to a room down the hall.

Everyone but Duke, Sephora and grandma made it down by 3:00. They were late because Sephora had to pack even though grandma asked the kids Wednesday to take tomorrow and pack and tell guests. Once we got into our room Sephora told Hudson and I that ‚ÄúI have substances(weed), do yall want to partake?‚Äù. We declined because we don‚Äôt smoke. I really didn‚Äôt like that she brought it into a state that weed is still criminalized while being driven by my grandmother. Sephora then asked and offered us money for Hudson or I to buy liquor or wine for her, we denied this request twice. I did buy a Caesar salad kit that she requested. Once we got back she didn‚Äôt like that it did not have chicken. After tasting, she said she didn‚Äôt like that it had black pepper, refusing to finish her portion of Caesar salad. 

After dinner we headed back to our rooms. At any point Duke was drawn into conversation with Hudson or I she would dramatically call attention back to herself. For Example, Duke wasn‚Äôt watching the movie or acknowledging a female character was so hot, or to raise her voice and change the conversation to something that pertains to herself. This attention drawing escalated to the point that she‚Äôd pull out her bag to get her pack(weed), isolating the two of them to smoke. 

Isolating the two of them went into the next day as well. Instead of heading to the beach with the rest of us, they went to the store for her meatloaf supplies. Rain cut the beach time short and we found them back in the room. Oliver came back to discuss plans for when it stopped raining. Sephora stated ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what I fucking want to know there isn‚Äôt an itinaray.‚Äù The group decided to go to the Pier to shop and do attractions. Hudson and I cleaned up after the beach. I wanted to brush my teeth, before stepping out of the room to wait for Duke and Sephora to get ready. With Sephora preparing to shower I brought my toothbrush to the kitchenette sink. She made several comments about how disgusting, nasty, and vile it would be to brush my teeth over the dishes. Sephora exclaimed she would move her clothes from the bathroom counter rather than I use the other sink. I told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do it anyways‚Äù and brushed my teeth as I moved their dishes to the dishwasher. 

The group waited for an hour and 30 mins, and grandma told us to leave them. She did say ‚Äú tell them to pick up her car keys.‚Äù The moment she heard Duke talking to us at our door Sephora from the bathroom yelled to us not worry about them that ‚Äúthey are grown and to go on‚Äù. Group activities were again hit with rain and the two parties never met up. I bought a copy of monopoly to play through the rain. When we went back to the room to change our rain- soaked clothes, the ironing board and Sephora‚Äôs suitcase were blocking the hallway to our room and the bathroom. The two groups reunited in the other room but only for Sephora and Duke to return the car keys. Duke was quite excited by the game being set up, ‚ÄúScooby doo monopoly that‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôve never seen that‚Äù. We asked if they would like to join us but Sephora didn‚Äôt want to play, exiting the room and Duke followed. By the time monopoly finished the meatloaf was in the oven. I complimented that it smelled good and asked when it would be ready. The answer was at least an hour. 

Hudson and I got a Lyft to a mini golf location with a bar. We never received a text to come back for dinner, so we played both courses and left before midnight when it closed. Hudson and I returned to a welcoming surprise, everyone together in our room. I made a plate and ate some meatloaf and mashed potato. Then I started to clean up dishes from the dinner party. We got asked about our time out and asked them what they were up to while we were gone. 

With multiple conversations happening and lack of attention from Duke, Sephora left the room, Duke went to go look for her. This prompts a group gossip session because the two of them are gone again. Sephora comes back, hits the key card to the table and the room goes silent. She opens the hallway door, rolls and slams her suitcase onto the floor to retrieve her pack(weed). Puts her suitcase away, makes it to the door before turning for the keycard, snatches it and leaves again. 

At this point I am upset: firstly of their avoidance and seemingly isolation of Duke, secondly of how I‚Äôm being talked to while performing favors, in passing conversation, and performing healthy habits, and thirdly their behavior is only being discussed among the group when they are gone. 

When Duke and Sephora return everyone is still in the room. Sephora says ‚Äúwhy is everyone still in here? It's 1:30 in the morning.‚Äù I say ‚Äúthat we were waiting to hang out with them‚Äù. Her response is to roll her eyes and she turns to the tv ‚Äúyou‚Äôre watching cars.‚Äù. Sephora changes it to something else. I grab my camera and set up for a photo. I use the wifi controls so everyone can be inside of it. Duke steps over to the table for a photo. Sephora stays on the couch glaring over. I ask her if she wants to stand for the photo, she says ‚Äújust tell grandma I‚Äôm asleep or something.‚Äù I reply ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre sitting on the couch talking to me.‚Äù She is shocked I said something back, honestly everyone is. Elijah, Harmony and Oliver went back to their room shortly after the photos were taken. 

With dinner being out on the counter I ask if we are saving the leftovers. Duke turns to Sephora and she tells him ‚ÄúI just cook the food and eat it.‚Äù He then says ‚Äúthat it would be bad to let it go to waste.‚Äù He helps me cut up the meatloaf into Tupperware and takes the trash out after I help degrease the pan from the meatloaf. I clean the pots. I turned to them and asked what they were talking about when they went outside. No real answers, just a lot of looking at me. I asked if something was wrong. Were yall fighting? Just hanging out? With no answers and being irritated I push into that they‚Äôve carried drugs over state lines into a criminalized state. That they are adults and if something was to happen say disturbance calls it would impact them.  I bring up that it could impact grandma because she drove them down here. Then I tell them ‚ÄúLeaving and separating y‚Äôallselves has only made everyone more comfortable of yall‚Äôs absence, not of y‚Äôall‚Äôs presence. Now, do Yall youngings need help setting up your bed?‚Äù I noticed the sheets for their pull out in our closet when I changed, in addition to Sephora stuffed animals. I carried them out to her firstly and addressed them by their names as I handed them to her. The first night it was a big deal when Hudson picked up her bear to not sit on it. Hudson asked ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this?‚Äù, the bear was snatched from him with ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî- he has a name!‚Äù.

I left the bed making for them and went to our bedroom. Hudson went in early while I was finishing cleaning up the kitchen and crashing out. Next was about 2 hours of hearing the door opening and shutting and the tv volume turned up to cover up the whispered yelling. Still not asleep I rose from the bed, went out and turned their tv off, seeing them sitting at the table. I didn‚Äôt have anything left to say. I went back to bed. 

Later that morning at 7:30 I arose from bed, went for a walk with Hudson around the pond then stopped in for a cup of coffee with grandma. She heard from everyone else last night that there was a bit of a blow out. I told her most of everything, leaving out the weed. She still respects me but I can‚Äôt help but wonder: Am I the Asshole? We could only stay two nights. I had work on Monday. We got back to our room around 9 to still find them in bed. We start to pack up our belongings and put on bathing suits to get pictures by the pool. Grandma wanted pictures of everyone floating down the lazy river. She woke up Duke and Sephora at 10 and asked them to get ready. Duke did, Sephora stayed in bed and remained in bed by the time we were fully packed and leaving. 

Halfway through the drive back, I received a call from Duke. I decided to not take it because I was driving, Siri then read the incoming texts. They found bed bugs on their stuff. They told the staff who put their laundry through several drying cycles. At home we washed all our laundry along with drying it several times (bags and shoes included). We haven‚Äôt noticed any resemblance of bites, bugs, or activity.

For me, I really appreciate when people acknowledge what you do ‚Äî even in small ways.
A simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù goes a long way.
Or when someone is about to make coffee and asks, ‚ÄúWould you like a cup too?‚Äù ‚Äî little things like that feel so thoughtful.

I love when a stranger holds the door open because your hands are full, or offers to help if you‚Äôre struggling with groceries.
These small, kind acts can have such a big impact.

One time, one of my employees left a handwritten note on my desk. I found it in the morning when I arrived. It simply said:
‚ÄúThank you for being a great leader to us.‚Äù
That note stayed with me for a long time ‚Äî it meant so much.

i eat well, exercise, do therapy etc etc but im starting to find withdrawing from people closest to me is the safest way to operate because it gives me some space away from reacting to them constantly.

to me it seems like people are reacting to me more but perhaps thats in response to my mood and low tolerance plus the sensitivity to their personality or flaws has increased.

either way im not coping well and ive spoken to the dr who is going to refer me to a psychiatrist again.

i initially thought increasing the lamotrigine would help and maybe even coming off of sertraline but he suggested an ADHD medication.

the only issue is i think having a stimulant would drive me insane. i cant touch coffee because it makes me go wild and i cant think or concentrate on anything. it exacerbates the above symptoms.

Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick:   I thought you may pass out on me if you didn‚Äôt eat.
So what did you want to ask me?

I loved reading all your posts.¬† Many of you had great points on the subject.¬† We all come from different headspaces so I‚Äôm not surprised by all the lively comments.¬† I feel like I have a lot to say on this subject because I have lived it and had years of working on my life to be a more mature person.¬† I have conservative values, yet I am also liberal.¬† I believe strongly in spirituality but am not religious.¬† I am a very successful small business owner but was also able to be a stay-at-home mom.¬† I see that many things are workable and don‚Äôt have to be one sided or the highway.¬† I have been successful with clients and friends some are liberals and some conservatives and I love them all.¬† I am what most feminists preach, a strong, independent woman, but I valued being a true woman and didn‚Äôt try to be a man.¬†

¬†

So much of what I am saying comes from my successful 35-year marriage to the greatest guy.¬† It just got better as the years went on, we loved each other more.¬† It was never boring nor hateful as the years progressed.¬† I still miss him so much and would do it all over again. ¬†I had been through an earlier marriage starting when I turned 18. But we parted as good friends after five years. We were very young and I had never really lived life on my own, and I needed to do that. ¬†I then put myself through college, got my CPA, worked for different companies for ten years, lived across the USA and traveled and dated various guys.¬† After I had done everything I considered important,¬† I was ready to settle down and have a baby.

¬†

**What we got right in my second marriage.**¬† He was 32 and I was 34 when we met in a TaiChi class.¬† We had great chemistry, similar interests and similar values. It was like we immediately knew we were to be together.¬† He was very intelligent, chivalrous, honest, moral, polite and kind.¬† According to most match criteria we would have been very compatible and were, however, there are always challenges to be dealt with.¬† Looking back, I can see that he probably had something like PTSD that I was totally unaware of and he didn‚Äôt even know the trauma that lived inside him.¬† I found out many years later that his military father was quite abusive to him physically as a small child.¬† This dark side of him came out quickly when I got pregnant.¬† He wasn‚Äôt into me being pregnant and did not want to be a father.¬† It was rather an unpleasant lonely experience being pregnant as he was totally unsupportive at that time. I wondered who I had married as it felt like I was dealing with Jekyll and Hyde. Some days he seemed normal and some days he was so verbally nasty with me.¬†¬†

¬†

Once it got physical as I could be hot headed also, yes I had quite a challenge on my hands.¬† I had a second baby and was dealing with quite a load, running a business, being an at home mom, doing all those chores and living with someone whom I no longer knew.¬† My friends advised me to leave and divorce him.¬† My employee advised me to put arsenic in his coffee, Ha!¬† But we had a house that was paid for and he did love the boys and would babysit sometimes. I didn‚Äôt see any practical advantage of making my life harder.¬† I decided to stay and ignore the verbal attacks and outbursts.¬† If he had died at that point, I would not have shed a tear.¬† ¬†Looking back, I see how strong of a woman this made me.¬† I used to be quite shy and now I could deal with anyone, even hardheaded men business owners.

Back when I became a CPA, I was one of the few women working in mostly male dominated businesses.

¬†

But good things happened, he started changing and getting more spiritual and over his issues.¬† He started helping me and being nice to me again.¬† He saw us as a team and the family became the most important, not our petty, selfish individual wants.¬† He totally supported me in things I was interested in and encouraged me.  I went back to college again and got my fine arts degree.  I became a yoga teacher, a belly dancer, learned to sing and played music, did art workshops, etc.  It was a great life.  My boys call me a rennaisance woman.  He and I got over our immaturities and grew into mature adults.¬† I spent quality time with him doing things he loved like hiking in nature, canoeing and camping.  I forgave him for anything that happened.¬† After ten years, we became best friends again and fell in love again and it continued up until his death.¬†",2,1750170247.0,DatingOverSixty,17,0.6,False

I am a software engineer by trade, with little to none mech engineering experience.

I currently have my tv mounted above the fireplace using this mount, but its thickness makes the TV protrude a lot from the wall making it really unappealing.

I am planning to design (and eventually prototype) a custom mount that provide a similar movement (out and down), potentially using a (couple of) electronic linear actuators (that \*could\* provide the strength to actually hold the 20kg of the tv) and a mechanism similar to a coffe table lift (for example https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coffee-Table-Spring-Pneumatic-Mechanism/dp/B075C8BMNV).

Now for the question (as this is **not** a ""design this for me"" post).  
  
What software could i use to model the mechanism and calculate load resistance, stress and eventual breaking issues? so for example i can iterate over metal thickness and dimensions before I prototype it? (or maybe to scrap the idea completely because i, likely, overlooked a major flaw)

1ldoeg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1ldoeg4/shipping_store_startup/,Shipping Store Startup,"Hello all -

We are looking to open a small independent retail shipping store in an area near us. We had a few questions. 

We have operated a small business successfully out of our home but looking to expand into the retail shipping space. We have been running a very successful eBay store for a few years now and have a good idea generally speaking, about shipping, shipping discounts, properly packaging, etc.. we do know there are a couple of really good organizations that we plan to join to learn more. 

And we are thinking of opening a retail store outside of a very new community that is just being built up and there‚Äôs not a lot around it - no UPS stores, etc. there‚Äôs a small Post Office but it‚Äôs getting ready to be shut down and consolidated with a location much farther away. We are in the beginning stages of building a business plan, but had a few general questions.

I know a lot of the revenue is dependent upon mailboxes so we will have a focus on probably 200 to 300 mailbox to start with.


- Where is the best place to purchase cluster mailboxes? I see a lot of online stores but obviously they‚Äôre quite expensive. I‚Äôm seeing a cluster of 20 can run $2000 or more. I‚Äôm assuming front load mailboxes are better otherwise you have to build a pathway access behind the mailboxes in the store to load mail.

- We are going to really focus on quality service, hiring good employees, but would like to offer some other revenue streams and try to be unique in some capacity. We have not started looking at Space yet, but I wanted to get an idea of typically how much square footage is needed for a shipping store? Would 1500 sq suffice?

Being a successful reseller, we spend a fair amount of time and have a vast amount of experience, sourcing items through estate sales, storage unit purchases, etc. and I do think eventually we may stick our toe into the estate sales, but definitely thinking of offering a very selective clean out service and maybe even incorporate some of our higher in eBay items into the store space as well - perhaps in a display case or small corner of the store. Again, just trying to think of some unique alternative revenue streams. Having been to tons and tons of Estate Sales I see so many situations where people literally want to just liquidate everything they own a lot of it could be junk or trash or simply donatable but some people just want to get rid of everything and there are some really higher end items available in a clean out service for next to nothing.

Other revenue streams we are considering:

-Notary
-Shredding
-Mailboxes (mentioned prior)
-Fingerprinting
-Passport Services
-Key Cutting
-Maybe even a cup of gourmet coffee


We expect the rent in the location we‚Äôre at they‚Äôre probably be north of 4K a month. We are in S. Florida - a little rural but again the area has a humongous neighborhood being built up with 4000 to 5000 homes ranging from 500K to well over $1M.

Anyway, just looking for some general advice I‚Äôve already researched and found some good advice on this Forum as well

R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 06:00 AM. R3K335 hesitates a moment, before he hits the Switch. He breathes out relaxed. He feels well rested. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.

https://preview.redd.it/0zq8bvcluh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db47c3065f035e7c0017d874bbd2da859c9cec25

‚ÄúWhat a strange Dream...‚Äù mumbles R3K335 with a grin on his face. As he looks around his dirty apartment, reality settles in. He sighs. His eyes fall on the dusty guitar in the corner of his room. For a moment the image of himself playing a song in front of an audience in a sunny park, flashes before his mental eye. He shakes off the ridiculous thought.

He wants to get himself a cup of coffee. But his glass of instant coffee is empty. He sighs. ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to last a day without coffee?!‚Äù

Next he takes a shower. The water is lukewarm.

R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. He looks... Refreshed. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.

As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. He forgot to grab the umbrella. Something is off. Something is different. Something that has never happened before. He looks up. The Sky is Gray as always. But for some reason... It doesn't rain. He looks around. The Streets are dry. All the other passerby stand still. Everyone's gaze is locked at the sky. R3K335 nervously grabs a pack of PALL WALL BLUE and hastily reaches for a cigarette. Then he searches his pockets for his Lighter. But... For some reason... He just can't find it. His Lighter is lost.

‚ÄúUgh... My day is already ruined...‚Äù complains R3K335 and throws the cigarette away. He follows the Path under the Bridge.

https://preview.redd.it/svdi2md1vh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=470ef58514191abc5a57863d09d40481f4cc108e

There are a couple of Homeless people warming their hands over a burning bin. R3K335 looks into their eyes, as if he is searching for someone. For a specific face. He can't recognize anyone. Something feels out of place. The Homeless people at the fire notice his gaze. He looks away and moves on.

He passes by a building that is under construction, but nearly complete. A Tower. A Great Skyscraper, that pierces through the dense clouds.

Two construction workers put a sign above the entrance door of the Tower, that spells:

'BABEL'

‚ÄúI wonder if, they actually ever manage to finish it...‚Äù mumbles R3K335 in a moment of lucidity. ‚ÄúThe Shadow of that hideous Strength, six Miles and more it is of length.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/sfm4aw9zvh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7761ee587d460f59b841b3f18e9f8c5d2f6bfbe

As R3K335 walks down the street, shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 has enough of the violence.

‚ÄúWhy are you fighting?!‚Äù he shouts a midst the sound of gunfire.

There is a moment of silence, before both sides answer in unison: ‚ÄúCornflakes!‚Äù

The Fighting begins again. Bullets shoot through the air.

R3K335 sighs disappointed. ‚ÄúNo matter what I say or do, they will just continue to fight, until both sides are destroyed.‚Äù

He takes the underpass into the subway station. The Train arrives on time. Most seats are empty. R3K335 sits alone in a row of empty seats. Just as the doors are about to close someone sticks his hand through the slit. The door opens up again. A homeless man with a white beard in a dirty, blue Hoodie enters the tram.

The Stranger stands in the cart with many empty seats. Even though he could sit anywhere else, he chooses to sit right next to R3K335.

R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúCan you please sit somewhere else?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you happy with the Life you are living?‚Äù asks the Mysterious Stranger. A fire burns in his eyes.

The Question takes R3K335 off guard. For some reason. He doesn't know why... This old Homeless man seems trustworthy.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù confesses R3K335. ‚ÄúI feel like I have missed my chance. Life has moved on without me, while I remain stuck. I always tried to fit in. I sacrificed my Dreams just to conform to other peoples expectations. And it never made me happy... It just made me feel safe... But in Reality I was just too afraid. I Sleepwalked through Life. Because it was easier. Because I was too concerned with how I am perceived. I once created a Song. Something completely Original. Unlike anything you have ever heard. But I never got to play it to any people. I just never had the chance. Now I haven't touched my Guitar in Years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat hinders you from just sharing your song?‚Äù questions the Stranger.

R3K335 laughs. ‚ÄúWell... My Job, for example? I can't pay my bills just by playing Guitar. No... No one wants to see ME, playing Music. I don't have the Voice, I don't have the Talent and I don't have the Looks. No... I need to be realistic... For me, there will only ever be the Factory. That's just how it is...‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat If you were to lose your job Today?‚Äù questions the Stranger. ‚ÄúJust suppose you were suddenly free... I heard that in the park, people often gather around street musicians. Why not give it your try and play your song there? Who knows what happens... Perhaps something that you would never expect...‚Äù

‚ÄúNo... I think, if I were to lose my job, I would probably panic at first... I'd try to apply at a different factory... Or at a convenience store... Or in a Fast-food restaurant... What you suggest is just too far out of my comfort zone... I would just embarrass myself...‚Äù

The old man grins with crooked teeth. ‚ÄúSometimes all it takes is just one moment to change your entire Life. But to create something New, you need to be willing to walk into the Unknown. Otherwise whatever you create will be limited by the Past. Your Fears, your Doubts, all they do is hold you back from fulfilling your Destiny. They are your Tests, your Life lessons. This will now be your chance. To overcome yourself. To step out of your current patterns. Face your Fears, no matter how uncomfortable you are with them. Don't care about what others may think, just focus on giving them the best performance, that you can create.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes... But--‚Äù

R3K335 is interrupted by a ringing Bell, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'

The Stranger stands up. ‚ÄúThis is my stop. Look... In the End it's up to you alone to steer the Ship of your Self. It is your Life and I am not here to carry the responsibility of your Life for you. No one else can do it for you. Only you can free yourself from this pattern you are trapped in... I know that you have been having this thought for a while now. Imagining how it would feel to sing your song in front of a Live Audience. Why do you think this idea keeps coming up in your Life? Perhaps because your subconscious tries to tell you something. Trust your intuition. It's channeling these insights for a reason.‚Äù

The Stranger throws something at R3K335. He catches the object and examines it in his hands. It's his lost Lighter.

‚ÄúMy... My Lighter?! How the Hell--‚Äù

The Tram stops. The Doors open up. The Stranger is heading outside.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù shouts R3K335 after him. ‚ÄúWho are you? Why are you helping me? How do I find you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry Seeker,‚Äù soothes the grinning Stranger, before stepping out of the Door. ‚ÄúWe will meet again.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/fnvev2hlwh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c15f2ed204f1f4b9a0134a01bf8258b1177797f

The Door closes and the Tram moves along the tracks. R3K335 is left awestruck with an open jaw. Sitting alone in the tram, R3K335 gazes bewildered at the door. Memories come flooding into his consciousness. Memories from a Different Life. Memories from a different World. Of a Journey in a different realm.

‚ÄúI am the Seeker,‚Äù speaks R3K335 with burning eyes. His words ignite the air, as if he is spitting fire.

‚ÄúEverything...I remember everything... The Stranger... He was right... It's unbelievable! I will lose my job... This can't be Real! I need to do something about it... I need to work hard... Harder than ever before... This will convince 5508 that he shouldn't fire me.‚Äù

The Tram stops. The Seeker gets out. They run out of the Tram towards their workplace. They don't even think about lighting up a cigarette. The Fear of losing the job chases them to the Bomb Factory in less than Five Minutes. The Seeker clocks in at 06:45 AM, even before 5508 arrives.

They stand at R3K335's position at the conveyor Belt and stare out of the window, observing how a Panthera GX Turbo parks in the parking lot with a label 'CEO'. The Seeker greets 5508 as he walks through the door. He doesn't even look at the Seeker and instead walks right into his own office.

For the next 4 Hours, as the CEO is in his office, the Seeker keeps their full awareness set at assembling Grenades. The Machines can't even keep up with the Seeker's pace. Never before was R3K335 ever as effective and fast as Now. Breaking the record of any daily Quota.

When the Lunchbell rings, the Seeker looks with pride at the stacks of assembled Grenades. R3K335 sits outside next to R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L, R3LL0RC5. They all light up their cigarettes.

The Seeker notices how there hasn't been an urge for a cigarette all day. The Seeker fumbles with the Lighter in their pocket. They let go off the Lighter.

'I have managed without Cigarettes until now... I'll manage even longer,' thinks the Seeker silently, as the others converse about Sport and the Weather.

'Have I convinced 5508 not to fire me? I am a hard worker. I have shown how effective I am... After all, that's all that matters isn't it? That I am productive, right? Why do I fight so hard for this job anyway? I hate this Job! But if I lose it, I will end up on the street... Just like the Homeless... And yet... I really can't do this job any longer... It's wrong! It's meaningless... It's a waste of my potential! Am I the only One who feels that way? Am I the only one, who is done with being assigned to the wrong role?'

The Seeker sighs: ‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù

There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing.

‚ÄúDid you drink the wrong kind of coffee today?‚Äù mocks R3KR0W.

‚ÄúWell, technically, we *are* creating something eternal ‚Äî trauma, fallout, and very permanent regrets. You know, legacy stuff,‚Äù chuckles R3K0M5.

‚ÄúLook at how he's asking questions, like some kind of Scientist or something,‚Äù laughs the Meathead R350L.

‚ÄúWell... on the bright side you won't have to worry about that much longer anyway,‚Äù comments R3LL0RC5, who's captivated by his phone.

Everyone laughs, except for the Seeker. Normally R3K335 wouldn't question this further, but the Seeker remembers how they were yesterday fired.

‚ÄúWait... What exactly do you mean by that?‚Äù asks the Seeker R3LL0RC5.

‚ÄúUmmm... Uhhh...‚Äù flounders R3LL0RC5. ‚ÄúIt's ummm... It's not like... Well... I mean... With your termination...‚Äù

‚ÄúTermi... Termination?!‚Äù gasps the Seeker. ‚ÄúWait... Why would you of all people know?‚Äù

They feel a Gaze watching and turn their head around. 5508 stares at them through the slits of the window blinds. As soon as he is seen, he covers away. The Seeker storms into his office.

‚ÄúAre you firing me?‚Äù confronts the Seeker his boss.

‚ÄúDid R3K0M5 tell you? Or was it R350L?! I told them to keep it to themselves!‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes everyone know about me being fired but me?‚Äù asks the Seeker with an open jaw.

‚ÄúIt was supposed to be a surprise... You know... Like with a Birthday Cake... Only reversed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen were you gonna tell me? At the End of my Shift?!‚Äù

5508 chuckles nervously. ‚ÄúWell yes... Although technically speaking, your Termination was already in effect last Month... Which means that this day is not being accounted for in your final paycheck either. In other words you won't be paid for today. Don't blame me, blame the Economy.‚Äù

Devastated and worn down, the Seeker takes the tram back home. It's 11:11 AM. At home, the downtrodden Seeker walks the staircases up, tears an eviction note from R3K335's door and walks into his dirty apartment. The Seeker falls into the bed.

‚ÄúIt's over... My Job... My Apartment... All Lost... I have failed. Now my Life is over... How should I continue Living?!‚Äù

Watery eyes stare at the dusty Guitar in the corner of the room. The Seeker wipes the tears from their eyes, grabs the Guitar and blows the dust off. They tune the Strings and weep them gently, playing a deep, melancholic song. A song that resonates with broken hearts. A song that expresses the pain of broken dreams. A song about the hardships of Life. But buried under pain and sorrow, there is a deeper emotion expressed through the song. A strength that comes from deep within and shifts the entire song into a completely different melody. Like a voice reminding the Seeker, that things are never truly lost, that there always is a way.

The Seeker suddenly stops. ‚ÄúPeople will never hear this song. Unless I am willing to actually step out of my comfort zone and perform it live... But I am too scared. And yet... I know deep down, that if I won't at least try, I will regret it for the rest of my Life... What should I do?‚Äù

  
.

.

.

The Stranger sits in the center of the Park. The Clouds are dark Gray. A few raindrops fall on the Strangers blue hoodie. He looks at a clock on a Zoo. The clock-hands point at 12:12.

‚ÄúSo it's raining after all,‚Äù sighs the disappointed Stranger as feels the raindrops falling on his fingertips. ‚ÄúThis probably means, that the Seeker won't be coming. Another lost Cycle. I should have known... Hopefully next Time, they will‚Äî‚Äù

Suddenly the Stranger hears the sound of a guitar carried by the wind. He turns around.

  
.



R3K335 walks to the center of the Park playing gently with his Guitar. He steps in alignment to the rhythm of his song. Wherever he steps, the people look up. Addicts, Dealers, passerby, Homeless covered in old newspapers look up as the Seeker plays their song, stepping to the forefront, where all can see and all can hear. The Drunk, the broken, the fallen, the afflicted. All who listen are captivated by the Guitar. All are enchanted by the voice of the Seeker channeled through R3K335. Listening to a song that all can relate to. A song, that they all can feel in their heart.

https://preview.redd.it/5xsjgwksxh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aed4d4d374fa0686db9323c08bed04fa8fd63f8b

Some begin to hum along. Others clap along or tap their feet on the ground in rhythm. Even though, they are all hearing the song for the first time, it's as if they have heard it somewhere before. Perhaps in a Dream. Perhaps long time ago in their early childhood. Perhaps even before they were born.

But there are also those, who can't hear the song. Who hate the song. Who want to stop it from being expressed. They hiss and grunt and scream.

The Rain drops stop falling. The Stranger looks up. Something is happening with the Sky.

‚ÄúIt's happening,‚Äù grins the Stranger. ‚ÄúThe Sixth Wall is truly Breaking.‚Äù

A Huge Split forms between the Clouds. Right Above the Seeker. Their guitar play and singing creates energetic waves of Light. Harmonic Frequencies of many souls join together in One Song. All who have gathered to break out. To break out of the prison of their own mind. To step to the forefront and stand up for themselves.

The Chorus gets stronger and stronger as the Sky above clears up. It's as if beams shoot out through the dense clouds. Rays of Light.

The Haters of the Song also get louder. They are all booing in unison. Some are even throwing stones and glass bottles. But the Chorus only gets more powerful. More Voices join. The Sky above clears up.

Some cower in fear of the Light rays shining down. Others bask in its glory. For the first time, the Light of the Sun shines through the Dark Clouds of the Underworld. Like a Smile it rips through the Heavens.

[The Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiutrNPbT8s) comes closer to it's crescendo. The Song gets louder, deeper, more powerful, the sun shines brighter, everything moves towards the peak. The Great Moment of Ascension.

https://preview.redd.it/xuxqct22yh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96cc611d5a959dce2edfa0f69959423f40d61e86

The Stranger smiles, he whispers: ‚ÄúFinally. We have broken through.‚Äù

Suddenly everything is white. The Seekers body feels very light. Dizzyness. The Seeker needs a moment to reorient themselves. Everything is shaky. The Seeker sits on a chair in a Dark room at a table. There is only a single light-bulb hanging in the room. The Seeker notices how they hold documents in their hand. The document is titled: 'Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL'

The Seeker blinks a couple of times before they realize that they are still in the Secret Developer Room from the last episode. The Stranger stands next to the Seeker.

‚ÄúWhat the... I am Back?! I did not jump into the Abyss? How is this even possible? Did we Time Travel?‚Äù

The Strangers eyebrows pulls up. ‚ÄúWhat? Are you a time cop? No, it's not time travel. You just downloaded information from a collapsing timeline. It's when you read the documents. Now that you have seen the bottom of the Abyss. What will you do? Will you jump in again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI really am back, am I?‚Äù exhales the Seeker with relief. ‚ÄúOh Thank you... I am so glad... I am so glad that I am back. That I have another chance. That it's not too late. Sometimes you first have to go through Hell before you understand, that Heaven is already within you. I learned my lesson. Let us move on from this damned place.‚Äù

From the Seekers eyes fall two coins. The Seeker looks at the coins, before putting them in a pocket.

The Seeker stands up and walks out through the Forbidden Door back into the Secret Developer Room, where the Turtles are still fighting for the DIAMONED MASK OF AWAKENING.

‚ÄúOh Seeker, there you are,‚Äù speaks the D'Artagnan. ‚ÄúWe were just discussing who will get the Mask on which day. Aramis gets it on Sundays and Mondays, Porthos on Tuesdays, Athos on Wednesdays, Me on Thursdays and Fridays and you on Saturdays. What do you say? Is that Fair?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep it,‚Äù speaks the Seeker. ‚ÄúI no longer care how I am being perceived. I don't need that mask.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù responds Porthos. ‚ÄúThen I will take Saturday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should YOU get to have it on Saturday?‚Äù intercepts Athos. The Fighting begins anew. All voices speak at once.

The Seeker walks back to the Portal, that transported them to the Secret Developer Room. The Seeker jumps into the Cracked Air. Spaghettifcation. It's like they are drifting through a Tunnel of Code, Patterns, Geometry. The Seeker and the Stranger spawn on the other side unharmed.

‚ÄúWith Glitches you never know where exactly you end up,‚Äù comments the Stranger. ‚ÄúNo idea, where we are now. We could be anywhere on the map.‚Äù

The Seeker looks around. Standing at a mountain ledge. There is little vegetation. Only moss, grass, mushrooms, a couple of bushes and rare mountain flowers. The environment is completely unrecognizable. Giant Human Faces are etched into stone walls. There's a sign labeled as 'SECRET HEADQUARTERS'

Two Figures are approaching the Seeker and the Stranger. They look very serious.

The Seeker suddenly hears the familiar voice of an old friend in their Head. It is the voice of the Chicken: ‚ÄúOh my God. They found me. I don't know how but they found me. You have to hide me, Seeker. No matter what they say, no matter what they do, they can't find out where I am!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù asks the Seeker.

‚ÄúMy archenemies,‚Äù responds the Chicken. ‚ÄúThe Deepstate.‚Äù

Honey & Peach co-ferment from Traffic

Super funky, super peachy -- after brewing the whole house has a potent peach & coffee aroma which is really cool

I wish I had a 94 Celcius Peche Mortel to compare theirs.  I also found the 94 version peculiar at first, but by the end of the bag it really grew on me

I'd like to try the Green Apple version but it's always the first to sell out!

They meet at a local coffee shop to talk business, connect, get feedback on ideas, strategies, etc. This is a small group of women. They charge $30 for the ticket each time they host it. I thought this would include a coffee or a treat from the coffee shop but it doesnt include anything. So, not sure what the $30 fee each time you go is for. I was actually thinking of hosting something similar via my business, but if I charge a ticket fee I would include a voucher for a coffee and treat at least. Is it ethical to even host this type of event and charge when you are doing it at a public location and all you are doing is chatting? ü§î ",1,1750169788.0,Entrepreneurship,3,0.67,False
