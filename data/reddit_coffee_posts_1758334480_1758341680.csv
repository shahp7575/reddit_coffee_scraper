The new intern had missed ten days of work in her first month. So Sonia Mercer gave her a ""C"" on her performance review.
That afternoon, Sonia's office was trashed.
Files were scattered everywhere. Her computer was soaked in water, and years of project data were gone.
Furious and dizzy with anger, Sonia demanded answers from security.
But everyone avoided her eyes, reluctant to speak up.
Her longtime assistant cautiously pointed upward.
The only office on the top floor of the Vance Building belonged to Sonia's husband, Leland Vance. Confused, Sonia went upstairs, but outside his door, she heard a syrupy female voice.
""Leland, thanks for today. I was so close to being publicly shamed by that witch. Luckily, you were there for me.""
Sonia froze. Through the slightly open door, she saw the intern, Angelina Sewell, sitting on Leland's lap, patting his shoulder.
Leland chuckled, tightening his arm around Angelina's waist and pulling her closer.
""Don't worry. I won't allow anyone to mess with you, not even Sonia.""
Angelina shot him a playful glare yet snuggled against his front. ""Hey, hands off. I see you as a buddy. But since you helped me today, consider this a token of my gratitude.""
Then she kissed him lightly on the corner of his mouth.
Leland laughed softly, cupping the back of her head and deepening the kiss. ""You're so cute...""
His whisper and the sound of their kiss filled the air. Sonia's blood ran cold. She could barely breathe.
Suddenly, she recalled how Leland had pinned her against a wall and kissed her seven years ago—back when she was still a student.
She had resisted, but Leland, usually cold and proud, said earnestly, ""Sonia, you're the only one I love. I don't want anyone else. The others just repulse me...""
Now, Sonia's stomach churned with nausea. Shaken, she stumbled out of the office.
Leland didn't come home until after dark. When he walked in, Sonia was sitting there in the dark.
""Sonia? Why didn't you turn on the light?""
She had been too upset to drink or eat today. Her voice was hoarse. ""When did things start with her?""
Leland froze for a second, then regained his composure.
He turned on the light, sat across from her, and settled into a relaxed, casual posture. Then, with the effortless grace of the Vance heir, he lit a cig and placed it between his mouth.
He loosened his tie, revealing a glaring lipstick stain on his white shirt.
""I've been too stressed lately. I need to unwind,"" he said casually, without showing any guilt. ""The Vance Group's business has doubled. I'm overwhelmed with work. If I don't let off some steam, how am I supposed to keep up with my role as your perfect husband?
""Sonia, don't worry. You are the one I love. Angie's just a fling.
""She reminds me of you back in the day—unruly, lively, cute. I'll have my fun, and then in three years, I'll come back to you. I promise.""
Sonia's heart ached. She didn't expect to hear such words from him.
Was this the same man who used to be so devoted and self-disciplined?!
""Have you lost your mind? I'd never accept this. End this with her right now!""
Leland's expression turned cold. ""I've been nothing but nice. And it's a simple request. So don't act like some ignorant shrew.
""Every man in our circle has two or three women on the side. But none of their wives makes a scene as you do!""
He stood up, his 1.88-meter frame looming over her. Then he leaned in and patted her cheek with a hint of condescension.
""Be good. Don't go messing with my sweetheart.""
He turned and walked out of the house. Heartache left Sonia unable to sit upright. She curled into herself, devastated.
The elite social circle had a notorious reputation for being morally bankrupt. That was why Sonia had once refused to marry into the Vance family. But Leland went to great lengths to prove he was trustworthy.
He'd been unbelievably devoted to her.
He tirelessly pleaded with his parents for permission to marry her, a woman from an ordinary family. And despite objections, he brought her into the Vance Group and personally taught her the ropes of the business. Whenever she messed up, he fixed it. Whenever she worked overtime, he stayed up late with her.
As the heir to a business empire, he had never lifted a finger for housework, yet he personally tended to her every need.
On their wedding day, he had held her in his arms, smiling happily, and promised everyone she would be the only woman he'd ever love.
But now, he was cheating on her.
Sonia drifted off on the couch, only to wake up on the roof of a tall building. Her hands and feet were tied, and she was wearing a bungee jumping harness.
Terrified, she let out a scream and tried to step back, but the bulky bodyguards grabbed her firmly.
A few meters away, Leland was holding his phone, dialing repeatedly.
""Leland! H-Help me!"" Sonia was deathly afraid of heights. She couldn't even stand near windows. And now she felt like fainting.
But Leland responded coldly, ""What did you say to Angie? She blocked me.
""You will have to pay for this.""

Chapter 2
On the roof of New York's tallest building, Sonia was pushed toward the edge.
Tears rolled down her face as she screamed at the top of her lungs, ""Leland, I didn't say anything to her! I haven't seen her today. I didn't send her any messages...""
""You're still lying!"" Leland snapped coldly. ""Who else would threaten her but you?""
He looked up and gave a signal. The bodyguard grabbed Sonia by the collar, nearly shoving her off the building.
Sonia leaned forward, only her toes still on the edge. She couldn't even scream, shaking uncontrollably.
As it turned out, in the grip of extreme dread, even fainting was impossible.
She wanted to close her eyes, but she could only stare wide-eyed at the tiny figures below. Overwhelming dread consumed her.
""Leland, please... I'm scared...""
But he seemed deaf to her pleas, blind to her suffering. ""I told you—I love you. My relationship with Angie is just temporary if you behave and live up to your role as Mrs. Vance.
""Remember this lesson. Don't interfere again behind my back.""
With a cold gesture, he signaled the bodyguard to release her, ignoring her screams.
The sudden plunge made her scream. As she fell, she watched the ground getting closer, her heart pounding with terror.
She thought to herself, ""Am I going to die? Maybe this is a release...""
But just before she hit the ground, the bungee cord snapped back, yanking her up into the air—only to drop her again. The torture repeated over and over.
Sonia was losing her mind.
When the bodyguards finally pulled her back up, she was drenched and limp. She collapsed on the roof, unable to move.
Leland had long since left.
But in her daze, she saw him again—the young Leland, noble and elegant, standing out of place outside her dorm.
Upon seeing her, the usually poker-faced young man finally smiled, carefully grabbing her slightly cut hand. ""Sonia, does it hurt? I'm sorry I failed to protect you.""
Lying on the cold floor now, she felt the past had all been for nothing.
""Leland... I'm in so much pain... I was so scared..."" she whispered.
Silence surrounded her. No one answered.
A long time passed before Sonia could move again. Trembling, she took out her phone.
When the screen lit up, she saw an announcement in the company group chat: ""Angelina Sewell is promoted to be the finance director, effective immediately.""
Many people voiced their congratulations. Angelina posted a confused emoji and inquired, ""What's this about? Leland, Leland, did you decide this on your own?""
No one dared to respond. After a long silence, two more messages appeared.
Angelina: ""Fine, I'll take it, I guess.""
Leland: ""Good girl.""
Sonia's phone screen went dark. Sonia bitterly laughed through her tears.
He just promoted Angelina despite her lack of any contributions. It made Sonia, who'd worked her way up from a regular sales rep, look like a fool.
When she distractedly got home, she immediately opened the safe, took out an agreement, and tucked it between a stack of other papers.
Leland didn't return home until midnight. Seeing how pale she looked, he frowned.
""Is your stomach hurting again? You know you have gastritis, but you still pick fights with me.""
He brought her a glass of water. ""Be reasonable. It's only three years. Promise me you won't bother her. It's better for everyone.""
Sonia took a deep breath. ""Fine. But you have to transfer the shares of the overseas companies to me.""
""That's it?"" Leland laughed. He took the documents and signed each one without reading.
""Such a money lover,"" he teased, leaning in to kiss her, but she dodged away.
""I'm tired. I'm going to bed.""
Using that as an excuse, she went upstairs and retrieved the document she had placed among the others, the one with bold letters on the front page: Divorce Agreement.

Chapter 3
Sonia was plagued by numerous nightmares all night long. When she opened her eyes at dawn, she found Leland's arm slung around her waist.
His hands were strong and well-defined, his fingers long. There was a faint band on his ring finger. The sight made her heart clench.
That was the mark left by his wedding ring.
He'd once sworn to wear that ring for the rest of his life. Yet he'd taken it off after knowing Angelina for barely over a month.
""So this is how fleeting a person's promises can be,"" Sonia thought.
Sonia lay on her side, letting tears slide silently into the pillow, soaking the fabric.
Leland noticed her quiet. He lifted his hand to brush her cheek, and his fingers came away damp with her bitter tears. He sighed, like reluctant surrender. ""All right, you w in. My heart hurts seeing you like this... I'll stay with you today, okay?""
But no sooner had he said that than his phone rang. Angelina's voice bubbled through the receiver, ""Leland, come on, let's go get hot dogs at Westville Market. They're amazing! My treat, don't say no!""
After Leland hung up, Sonia caught a glimpse of the happy smile playing on Leland's mouth.
He cleared his throat softly. ""Angie is an innocent girl. If I don't go, she'll probably wait at that hot dog stand all day. We've got plenty of time later. I'll make it up to you, I promise.""
""No,"" Sonia said, reaching under her pillow and caressing the divorce papers. ""You won't have to 'make it up to me' anymore.""
Leland frowned, hesitation flickering across his face. But when he glanced at a new message popping up on his phone, he turned and left anyway.
Sonia got up and headed to the law firm. After reviewing the agreement, the lawyer nodded. ""Everything checks out. It'll take effect officially once all the procedures are done.""
He paused, then asked, ""Ms. Vance, are you certain you don't want to claim any of the Vance Group's domestic assets?""
""Yes, I am.""
She understood the lawyer's worry.
The Vance Group was once on the brink of collapse. It was Sonia who'd turned things around, working overtime to secure contracts, negotiating and finalizing several high-stakes 0rders that breathed new life into the company over the past few years.
After leaving the law firm, Sonia went straight to the Vance's mansion to hand in her resignation to Justin Vance, the group's de facto controller.
""What did you just say?"" Justin looked stunned. ""Divorce? Are you sure?""
Once, he'd offered Sonia millions in cash to walk away from Leland, and she'd refused. Now, with the Vance Group's value having doubled, he doubted she claimed she would leave without taking a single penny.
""I'm sure,"" Sonia said calmly. ""I'll leave this country, just as you wanted. And I'll never see your son again for the rest of my life.""
Justin nodded with mixed feelings. ""Good... But stay until after the new product launch. You can leave once that's done.""
""Thank you. And please keep it confidential for now.""
As she walked out of the Vance's mansion, Sonia received a phone call.
""Ms. Mercer, please come back quickly! The payment approval for the new product launch's big screen just got rejected by Ms. Sewell!""
Sonia froze. She pulled up the company's approval software on her phone, and sure enough, the request was marked ""Returned."" The reason listed read, ""We can use the existing screen. We must put an end to wasteful spending. Thrift starts with us! P.S. Did someone take a kickback from the supplier?""
It irritated Sonia immediately. She saw Leland's comment, ""My dear penny-pincher. I can trust you with the financial management.""
It was like a bucket of ice water dumped over her head. All Sonia felt was overwhelming exhaustion.
For this new product launch, they'd invited top media outlets and industry elites. Everyone would be focusing on the effect. Using old, undersized screens would make the Vance Group a laughingstock in the industry. And the brand reputation she'd spent years building up could all come crashing down in one day.
Her stomach twisted with pain, but Sonia pushed through, rushing to the company. She scanned around and spotted Leland through the conference room glass.
He was leading Angelina into a meeting with the Operations Management Department.
Sonia's team sat quietly at the back of the table. Leland pulled Angelina up to the front with a gentle look.
""Don't be nervous,"" he said with a double meaning, a playful smile tugging at his mouth, ""Everyone has a first time.""
Angelina's cheeks flushed. She pretended to glare at him, but her eyes sparkled.
They flirted openly, as if no one else was in the room. Sonia's subordinates exchanged awkward glances.
Then Angelina put her hands on her behinds and raised her voice. ""I just want to say this department's spending is out of control! If your leaders won't fix it, I will!""
A few days ago, she'd been a clueless intern, fumbling through basic tasks. Now she stood there, daring to boss Sonia's team around like she was in charge of it.
Several people glanced toward the back door, where Sonia stood frozen. Their looks held quiet sympathy. Everyone could see Leland was humiliating Sonia, throwing her authority to the ground just to prop up his new lover.
Shame and rage burned in her throat. Sonia barely made it out of the conference room before she fled to the bathroom, doubling over to retch.
For this new product launch, she'd pulled all-nighters for weeks, popping pills to quiet her chronic stomachaches. All that effort ended up in today's humiliation.
Sonia wiped away the tears mixed with the acid from her throat. She took several minutes to compose herself, straightening her clothes and dabbing her eyes until Angelina's voice drifted from one of the stalls.

Chapter 4
""Leland's quite good to me, doing pretty much whatever I say,"" Angelina said, pretending to sound casual, but her tone dripped with pride. ""Well, you should've seen the way he looked at me earlier, like he was gonna devour me whole. So intense!""
A shrill voice came through her phone, ""Wow, Mr. Vance bends over backward for you? Angie, why play hard to get?""
Angelina scoffed. ""Please! I know men. They're all the same, fickle. If I give in too easily, he'll get bored fast.""
""He wants me, but a lousy director title isn't gonna cut it. The Vance Group is worth billions. Asking for half of that seems fair to me."" Gone was her naïve tone, but only raw ambition.
Her friend asked, ""But what about Sonia? She's got so much clout at the company now.""
Angelina sneered, ""Clout? Give a break! Leland gave her all that. You didn't see her earlier. She's practically...""
Loud laughter came from the stall. Sonia stood frozen outside, her nails digging so hard into her palms they drew blood.
She pushed open the stall door. Angelina fumbled to end the call, then lunged to grab her arm. ""What did you hear?""
""I don't care about your little games,"" Sonia snapped, yanking her hand away. She turned to leave, but Angelina's eyes flickered to something over Sonia's shoulder. Leland was standing not far away.
A scheming glint flashed in Angelina's eyes. She grabbed Sonia's wrist again, then let out a shrill scream and crumpled to the floor.
In the quiet Vance Building, the sound echoed sharply. Angelina sat on the floor, her eyes red and watery, her voice trembling with fake grievance, ""Ms. Mercer, you can't just use your power to bully anyone...""
Leland strode over, lifting Angelina gently yet urgently. His face was clouded with a terrifying gloom. ""Sonia, you've gone too far!""
""I didn't do anything,"" Sonia said calmly. ""She fell on her own.""
""Leland, put me down,"" Angelina murmured, patting his front weakly. ""This is all your fault! It's because of you that Ms. Mercer wants to punish me. Don't come near me again.""
""Impossible. You're mine,"" Leland declared, his tone possessive. He caught her wrist, pulling her closer to press a kiss to her mouth.
Angelina feigned a moment of resistance, then looped her arms around his neck, leaning into him to kiss back.
They kissed without a care for Sonia's presence. Sonia stared, her gaze sharp with agony, as the blood in her veins froze.
She tried to turn and flee, but Leland stopped her. ""You bullied my girl, and you think you can just walk away?
""You love pushing people around so much? I'll make sure you get pushed enough today.""
He waved a hand. The bodyguards lingering behind stepped forward, grabbed Sonia, and dragged her to the top of the staircase.
Angelina hid her face in Leland's hug, pretending to wince. ""Leland, the bodyguards are so strong. They may hurt her.""
""You're so considerate, my sweet, soft-hearted girl,"" Leland chuckled. ""Fine. Then let her own subordinates do it. She hurt my baby. She'll pay it back tenfold.""
""Do it!"" he barked.
Sonia's face drained of all color as she watched her assistant, whom she'd trusted and worked with for years, step forward. And with a hesitant yet deliberate push, she sent Sonia tumbling down the stairs.
A loud crash echoed as Sonia tumbled down the stairs, slamming into the floor below. Warm blood trickled down her cheeks, sticky and hot.
In her daze, her mind flashed back to the school rooftop years ago. Leland had pulled her into his arms then, glaring at the bullies who'd harassed her. ""Dare to touch my girl? I'll make you regret it.""
Sonia tried to struggle up, but the bodyguards hauled her back to the top of the stairs.
The second push came from the very one she'd personally promoted. The woman shoved her sideways. Sonia hit the railing, a sharp scream tearing from her mouth.
Her subordinates seemed to feel sorry for her. But Leland didn't even glance over.
He was too busy holding Angelina, leaning down to murmur something that made her giggle.
By the tenth fall, Sonia felt no more pain or shame.
She lay on the cold floor, staring numbly at each person who'd pushed her.
They'd respected her for years and thanked her for the opportunities. Now, they actually stepped out to hurt her.
Angelina grew bored, letting out a yawn. Leland noticed instantly, lifting her into his arms. ""Baby, you're hurt. Let's go get you checked out and take a few days off to rest, okay?""
Sonia watched him pass by, not even pausing to look at her.
She let out a bitter laugh, fumbling for her phone to dial 911.
The doctor diagnosed her with soft tissue contusions and multiple fractures. As the nurse gently wrapped her bandages, she asked if she should call Sonia's family. Sonia let out a broken chuckle.
""My family... He's the one who did this to me!"" she said, then laughed harder until the laughter dissolved into tears.
Three days later, Sonia left the hospital, her body swaddled in bandages.
Justin had been calling nonstop. The new product launch was days away, yet Leland was nowhere to be found.
Reluctantly, Sonia picked up her phone and dialed Leland's number.

Chapter 5
Angelina was the one who answered the phone.
Sonia could hear the noise on the other end of the call. Angelina giggled, her tone light with mockery. ""Ms. Mercer? Sorry, Leland's in the middle of a card game right now.""
Sonia's fingers tightened around the phone.
Leland had grown up with an elite education. He'd been disciplined, refined, never one to step foot in bars or waste time on card games. Now, he was tangled up in exactly that.
""Tell him to come back,"" she said, her voice sharp. ""The new product launch can't go on without him.""
Angelina scoffed, dismissive. ""What's the big dea1? Can't you just go in his place?""
A faint scolding from Leland drifted through the line. He must have lost a round. But Angelina only laughed louder. ""Oh, turns out Mr. Vance isn't good at everything... Ms. Mercer, he's having such a great time. How could you bear to ruin it? We've got a romantic dinner planned tonight. And Leland's been looking forward to it.""
Sonia didn't want to hear another word about their romantic plans. She cut Angelina off mid-sentence and hung up.
When she tried calling again, the line went straight to voicemail.
The next morning, Leland finally called, his voice thick with the lazy satisfaction of a night well-spent. ""Sonia, we're gonna stay in Miami a few more days. Handle the new product launch on your own.""
Sonia took a deep breath, forcing herself to ignore the soft moans of a woman in the background.
""Oh, and one more thing,"" he added, as if it were an afterthought. ""Angie's the designer of the new product now. Make it public.""
Rage and disbelief crashed over Sonia, making her ears ring.
""That product was my design from college! You know that!"" she snapped, her voice trembling. But Leland didn't wait to hear her out. The line went dead suddenly.
The shrill ""toot-toot"" of the disconnected call echoed in the room. Sonia clutched the phone, her heart tight with a grievance that felt too heavy to bear.
Back in college, her family was poor. She'd been isolated, bullied by her classmates, trapped in a cycle of despair until Leland pulled her out of it. He'd given her confidence.
It was during those days that inspiration struck, and she sketched the prototype for this new product.
When Leland saw her designs, he showered her with praise, pulling her into his arms and saying in a voice soft with love, ""Sonia, you're my everything. This product is our love made tangible.""
Tears rolled down her cheeks, soaking the new product launch speech she'd written.
Even after three days in the hospital, bruised, she'd still stayed up refining that speech for Leland, like a fool.
Sonia took a shaky breath, picking up the script to rehearse silently. Even if he'd stolen her credit, she still needed this product to launch successfully.
Suddenly, her phone screen lit up. A photo popped up unbidden.
It showed a messy bed, a dark red stain stark against the sheets. Angelina's message followed, ""First-time hurt so bad. Sonia, any tips I should know?""
With a crash, Sonia swept the phone off the desk.
She couldn't hold it together anymore. She collapsed onto the desk, sobbing loudly.
She thought, ""Would Leland kiss Angelina the way he kissed me, trailing from her collarbone down to her waist?
""Would he murmur about being gentle, holding back to ease her pain, like he did for me?
""Would he gasp her name, whispering that he loved her more than his life when he's about to come? And after the madness, would he tenderly clean her up, dabbing ointment on the soreness, like he once did for me?""
Sonia tortured herself with those thoughts, replaying every intimate moment Leland shared with Angelina. She cried until her tears ran dry, and she felt someone had cut her heart open.
She sat there numbly until dusk seeped through the windows. Then she stood up and drove back home.
She walked into the bedroom, reached up, took down the wedding photo hanging above the bed, and tore it in two.
On the dressing table sat the first gift Leland had ever given her, a small porcelain figurine of a blushing nobleman. It had once been one of her most cherished memories. Now, she picked it up and tossed it into the trash.
Sonia went through the house slowly, clearing away every item that tied her to Leland. Bit by bit, she erased their memories.
By dawn the next day, the villa's exterior looked the same. But inside, it felt like a stranger's home.
At noon, Leland returned with Angelina. He frowned slightly as he stepped in.
""Did you tidy up?"" He glanced at the coffee table, as if noticing something missing. ""Wait. Where are our photos?""
Sonia said nothing. But Angelina cut in softly with a flushed face, ""Sonia, Leland says you're so good at taking care of people... My belly hurts.""
Leland's attention shifted instantly. He pulled Angelina close, rubbing her belly gently. ""Sonia, make some nourishing dishes these days. Angie went through a lot with her first time. I don't trust anyone else with it.""
""It's all your fault. You are pretty well-hung!"" Angelina pouted, hitting Leland's front lightly.
Leland caught her hand, leaning in to murmur in her ear with a laugh. ""Next time, you'll know it's worth it.""
They gazed at each other, unashamed. Leland's Adam's apple bobbed as he leaned down, and Angelina tilted her chin up, her mouth parted in a pretend protest that looked more like an invitation.
""Sonia, head to the company first. Come back later,"" Leland said, already lifting Angelina into his arms. He strode toward the master bedroom, not even glancing back as he dismissed Sonia.
The absurdity made Sonia want to laugh.
She thought, ""He expects me to serve his mistress?
""Am I the one going crazy? Or is the whole world upside down?""
Sonia watched them climb the stairs. Leland's hands were in a hurry to pull Angelina's clothes, and Angelina's fingers were already tangled in his pants.
Leland began to moan. Angelina turned her head, her eyes meeting Sonia's as she mouthed silently, ""He wants me.""
Sonia couldn't take another second. She stumbled out, fleeing the villa as fast as she could.

Chapter 6
From that day on, Sonia never went back home.
With three days 1eft until the new product launch, she moved into her office, sleeping and working there.
Leland and Angelina came and went together every day. They looked so intimate and sweet. Sonia forced herself to look away, pouring all her focus into the final launch preparations.
On the day of the new product launch, she slathered rouge over her pale cheeks, pasted on a smile, and greeted each guest warmly.
She took a deep breath and was ready to step onto the stage when Leland arrived.
""Are you joking? You want Angelina to give the presentation?"" Sonia stared at him, stunned. ""No! I won't agree! She'll ruin everything!""
Leland's expression turned impatient. ""Angie rarely wants to try something like this. Give her a chance. Even if she messes up, it's no big dea1.""
No big dea1...
Then what had she been fighting for these past months?
Leland was arrogant, never bothering with tedious details. It was Sonia who'd spent countless hours keeping the Vance Group's operations running smoothly.
Leland knew how much time and energy she'd poured into this launch. And now he wanted her to hand it all over to someone else.
Sonia locked her gaze on him, her eyes stinging with tears. Leland sighed, reaching up as if to brush the corners of her eyes.
""Don't be so petty. The Vance Group is yours. Can't you be more magnanimous?""
A bitter laugh escaped her. ""Is the Vance Group still mine?""
""Stop being so dramatic. Of course, it is?"" Leland smiled, belatedly realizing he'd ignored her lately. He started to say something softer when Angelina shouted from backstage.
""Leland? Are you ready? I'm so nervous. Come help me go over the lines!""
He turned around and headed back, commanding, ""Get a teleprompter set up for Angie now.""
Sonia's heart gave one sharp, final tremor, then went cold. She moved mechanically, doing as Leland said.
When Angelina stepped onto the stage in a glittering dress, the host's voice stuttered, ""Let's welcome Ms. Mer... Well, Ms. Angelina Sewell!""
Murmurs rippled through the crowd of industry elites below. ""Who is she? The finance director?""
""A finance director presenting a new product? What's the Vance Group playing at? Are they mocking us?""
""Heard the gossip? She's Mr. Vance's new lover.""
""What a mess...""
With a blank face, Sonia sat in the front row, holding the teleprompter.
The looks thrown her way shifted from confusion to pity and outright disdain.
In other people's view, she couldn't keep her husband in line and was pushed aside by his mistress. In the upper circles, she was already a joke. No one would take her seriously again.
Even if she left the Vance Group, no company would want to work with her.
Her family's name would be tied to this scandal. Her career was in ruins. But none of it hurt anymore.
Sonia just sat there, staring at the stage, feeling nothing at all. Her eyes were vacant and numb.
Onstage, Angelina stumbled through her lines, mangling words three times a minute, tripping over her tongue. Clearly, giving a presentation was harder than she'd thought.
After another botched sentence, she finally snapped. She slammed the microphone down, pointed straight at Sonia, and shrieked, ""The teleprompter's moving too fast! I can't keep up! Why are you trying to make a fool of me?""
The microphone cut out, muffling her yelling. The guests and reporters all looked confused. No one knew what was happening.
Then everyone saw Leland move.
He marched over, clinging to Angelina's side, and raised his hand to slap Sonia.
The force sent Sonia sprawling to the floor. Her hair fell loose, and her cheek bloomed red and swollen instantly.
Leland roared, ""You wicked wh0re! I've indulged you for far too long!""
Angelina sobbed into his hug. ""Leland, I'm so humiliated! It's a live broadcast! I can't face anyone!""
""Hey, it's okay,"" he cooed. ""Someone else will be even more embarrassed. And everyone'll forget about this soon enough.""
With that, Leland waved a hand. The bodyguards stepped forward, moving with practiced efficiency to yank Sonia to her feet.
The room fell silent. The reporters and elites from all fields all stared in stunned disbelief at the scene unfolding: a public beating, right there at a high-profile product launch.
The bodyguards didn't hold back. Blows landed, and blood trickled from the corner of Sonia's mouth. She swayed, on the verge of fainting.
A few people who knew Leland rushed over to ask what was going on. His reply was cold. ""Sonia did this on purpose. She ruined the launch. I wouldn't be surprised if she took money from our competitors.""
The guests instantly understood.
In the upper class, nothing was more despised than betrayal. Everyone rallied around that shared disgust.
""Good job.""
""The Vance Group treated her so well, and she still pulled this stunt?""
""She must've been tempted by someone else... I bet a pretty wh0re like her will surely do it.""
""Serves her right.""
Camera flashes exploded nonstop. The reporters' eyes glinted like sharks catching the scent of blood.
This sordid tale of betrayal in a rich family was far more newsworthy than any product launch.
The venue descended into chaos. Leland swept Angelina away, vanishing into the crowd. Meanwhile, Sonia, crushed by the double agony of physical pain and public humiliation, finally blacked out.

Chapter 7
When Sonia woke up, she was back in the hospital. Leland sat beside her, with a plate of cheesecake in his hand.
Sonia hadn't cried when she was humiliated or when her ears bled from the beating. But the sight of that cheesecake made silent tears spill down her cheeks.
Her stomach had always been weak. Every time she fell ill and had to take medicine, she'd complain about how bitter it tasted.
Leland would then do magic, pulling out a plate of cheesecake, smiling as he coaxed her, ""Good girl, Sonia, my baby. Take the medicine, and you'll get the cake... Let me feed you, okay?""
Once, he'd treated her like a priceless treasure, unwilling to let her suffer even a little.
But just as Leland held a slice of cheesecake to her mouth, his phone rang.
He answered, and his expression shifted in an instant. ""Angie, don't cry... How could I abandon you? I'll be right there.""
He stood up so fast that he knocked over Sonia's IV line. The needle pulled at her hand, a tiny bead of blood welling up.
The nurse walked in just then, gasping as she rushed to fix the IV. She turned to shout at Leland, ""Sir, are you his family? Please sign these—they're for her eardrum perforation surgery...""
But Leland was already gone. Sonia took over the consent form calmly. ""I have no family. I'll sign for myself.""
As soon as she said that, tears rolled down her face.
The cheesecake slipped from the bed, crashing to the floor. It was just like their relationship. It was gone.
Sonia's surgery was scheduled for the afternoon. She'd just finished her pre-op preparations when her phone rang.
""Ms. Mercer... your mother...""
Her hearing was muffled. She'd forgotten her right ear was impaired, so she fumbled to switch the phone to her left.
""Ms. Mercer, your mother suffered severe bleeding in a car accident. She's in emergency surgery at Vance Medical Centre.""
The phone slipped from her hand. Sonia's blood ran cold. She scrambled off the operating table, stumbling out of the operating room.
Her mother was her last living family member in the world!
Sonia had planned to take her abroad, to start over together. She hadn't even had time to tell her mother.
On the way to Vance Medical Centre, Sonia bit her mouth so hard it bled, keeping comforting herself, ""It'll be okay. She'll be fine.""
She and Leland owned Vance Medical Centre, after all. As Leland's wife, she believed the doctors would try their best to save her mother.
But when she burst through the doors, she froze. The operating room doors stood wide open, and her mother lay alone on the table, covered in blood.
Sonia screamed like crazy, ""Doctors! Where are the doctors? Please, save her. Please!""
She grabbed a nurse, who only shook her head with awkward sympathy.
Her mother's vital signs on the monitor flickered weaker by the second. Sonia ran from nurse to nurse, begging for help like mad.
Then she saw Leland standing at the end of the corridor. It was like finding a lifeline. She sprinted toward him, yelling, ""Leland! He's my husband! This hospital is ours! You have to save my mother, now!""
The nurse who'd been trailing her paled, finally blurting out the truth, ""But ... but Mr. Vance is the one who had all the doctors pulled from the operating room...""
""What?"" Sonia stared at her, dumbfounded.
""The other patient who came in with your mother, Ms. Sewell, sprained her ankle. Mr. Vance had all the doctors pulled to treat her instead,"" the nurse replied.
At that exact moment, a shrill, piercing alarm cut through the air. Sonia's eyes darted to the monitor beside her mother's bed. She only saw a cold, straight line glowing on the screen.
The world seemed to shake under Sonia's feet.
Leland stepped closer, his mouth moving as if he was saying something. But Sonia heard nothing. Only a deafening, roaring static filled her ears, drowning out every other sound.
Several doctors rushed into the operating room. Leland grabbed her shoulders, trying to pull her away, but Sonia resisted. She just stood there, rooted.
""Don't be upset. Angie's a victim,"" he said, his voice muddled in her ears. ""It was your mom who came to her first. She attacked Angie...""
Leland's words came in fragments. Sonia strained to make them out, each syllable twisting like a knife in her heart.
""So you're saying ... my mom saw you two hugging, went up to ask you, and Angelina pushed her? And then she got hit by a car?""
She'd hidden Leland's infidelity from her mother. Never had she thought that lie would murder her mother!
With a choking gasp, Sonia coughed up a mouthful of blood. But she didn't even have the energy to cry.
Leland's face softened, like he felt sorry for her. He pulled her into his arms to comfort her. ""It's okay. Vance Medical Centre has the best technology. Your mom will be fine... When she wakes up, you can explain everything to her and clear up the misunderstanding. Angie's already feeling terrible about this.""
He rambled on about Angelina and clearing things up. Sonia didn't hear him. Her eyes were fixed on the surgery lights.
Then the lights went out. The doctor stepped out, his face grim with sorrow. ""I'm so sorry for your loss.""
A wave of surreal absurdity washed over Sonia. She spoke in a whisper, ""Mom won't be saying anything anymore.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanshin Tigers vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars: A Parlay of Perfection (or a Recipe for Disaster?)**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Hanshin Tigers (-1.5 run line, implied probability: \~68%) are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around 1.44-1.51 (implied probability: \~68-69%). For context, that’s like betting on a vending machine to drop a snack—predictable, reliable, and slightly less exciting than a espresso shot. The DeNA BayStars (+1.5, 33-37% implied probability) are priced as if they’re a team of overconfident interns trying to fake expertise in a Zoom meeting.

The total is set at 5.5 runs, with bookmakers split evenly on Over/Under (odds: 1.83-1.98). But considering Hanshin’s recent 4-0 shutout and DeNA’s defensive woes (they’ve collapsed in the seventh inning recently), the Under feels like the safer bet. It’s the baseball equivalent of betting your buddy won’t spill his coffee on his white shirt—optimistic, but not *unreasonable*.

**Digest the News: Tigers Roar, BayStars Drown**  
Hanshin’s rookie pitcher, Hayakawa, is the real deal. The third-round draft pick has gone from “developmental project” to “ace in the making,” throwing six no-run innings in his latest start. Manager Fujikawa called his performance “promising,” which in baseball-speak means “this kid could be our next MVP or a cautionary tale about draft-day optimism.” Either way, Hayakawa’s got the stuff to keep DeNA’s offense in check.

Meanwhile, DeNA’s recent games read like a horror movie: defensive collapses, a four-game losing streak, and a pitcher who “surrendered four runs in the seventh” (code for “got yanked so hard by the Tigers’ lineup, the earth’s rotation shifted”). Their offense? Well, they were shut out by Hanshin last time—they’re like a group of people trying to start a fire wit

Liliana Daily Thoughts

I am all alone. I may have my mother and Stepdad, Nate, but can I call them my parents? Parents don't do the things that they do to me. Parents don't beat their kids for arriving a couple minutes late. They don't yell things at you that leave scars mentally. They don't try to sell you for money so that they can buy drugs and alcohol. My parents don't care about me at all. My mom used to be a good person, until she started dating the wrong men. This has been going on since I was five, and I am now fourteen. I am broken, and no one will be able to save me.

My daily routine has not changed for the past four years. I get up at 5:30, shower, get dressed in my clothes that cover most of my bruises, put makeup on to cover my face, make breakfast for my parents, leave to go to school, go work at the coffee shop, come home before 5:00, make dinner, hopefully not get beaten, and get ready for bed. Anytime I make breakfast or dinner late, I get a beating so bad, that I can barely walk and the bruises stay for a good week or two.

Unfortunately for me, today is one of those days. I accidentally took too long of a shower and am now running down the stairs as fast as I can so I can quickly whip up some breakfast. I was still cooking when my Stepdad and mom came down, so when they saw me, they pulled me back by my hair.

""You bimbo! You were supposed to have breakfast on the table right now."" He spat at me and threw me against the wall. My mom punched me in the stomach while holding my throat so I couldn't breathe.

""Please...Please stop. I'm...sorry."" I said while trying to take a breathe.

""You should be sorry."" my mom said. She let me go and I fell on the floor, which gave Nate the opportunity to repetitively kick me in my ribs. He eventually stopped, and I then get up to finish making the food so that they don't hurt me even worse. Once done, I put it on the table, and go up to my room to see how bad the beating was today.

The minute I got in front of the mirror, I couldn't hold back my tears. I had a hand shape bruise on my neck as well as a couple of nail punctures. My ribs were already turning into a shade a purple, though I knew it would be worse in a couple of days. I grab my makeup bag and put concealer on to cover the one on my neck. Then, I go to my bed to get the painkillers that I hide underneath it. I take two paracetamol before putting the bottle in my book bag and leaving to go to school. The walk is about twenty minutes but since I am running late, I have to make it in fifteen.

Luckily, I made it to school on time and I go to my locker to see Ariana, the popular/mean girl, standing next to it waiting for me. I ignore her and start to get my books for my classes.

""Did you do my homework for me, bimbo?""

I turn to her and say, ""And why would I do that? I am not your slave."" She look angry and she lifts her hand to slap me. I grab her wrist before it can make contact and twist her arm behind her back.

""You shouldn't have tried to do that."" I whisper in her ear. She tries to get out of my grip but instead of letting go, I throw her against the lockers. If you think I am a bully, you are mistaken. People like Ariana are and I am one of the people that don't take from them so I fight back. Now I don't fight my parents because I know that would make things worse. I leave her on the ground and walk to my first class of the day.

During lunch, I hang out in the library with my tray of food from the cafeteria. I don't have any friends since I am antisocial and quiet. There was a time where I had the best friend I possibly could have. His name was Liam and he was my friend for over four years. He knew about the abuse I am going through but I made him swear not to tell anyone since I would then have to go into the foster system. I was sad when he moved a year ago because he was the only good thing in my life and was the reason I was mentally stable. Now, I suffer from anxiety and depression, which are terrible to go through at the same time. Whenever I have an anxiety attack, I use pain as a way to bring myself back and that is not healthy.

After school, I go to the coffee shop and get to work. Today is also the day I get my paycheck. My parents don't know I have a job so I get to keep all the money I make. Right before I leave, I go see the manager and I get $500 for the month.

I make my way home and start dinner but before I can turn the stove on, I hear a knock on the door. I open the door to see two police officers standing there with a look of pity.

""May I help you, officers?""

The one on the right says, ""I'm sorry honey but your parents got into a car accident and didn't make it."" They both look at me like they expect me to break down crying. I never cry in front of anyone. The last time I cried in front of someone, it was with Liam. Besides, I don't feel sad, I feel relieved that they can't hurt my anymore.

""So where am I supposed to live?"" I ask. They looked a little shocked but still answered.

""We looked at your moms DNA to see if we could find any matches and we found some people willing to take you in.""

""Who?"" As far as I know, my mom doesn't have anyone.

""Your older brothers.""



""What do you mean brothers? As far as I know, I am an only child."" I say. Now they are shifting uncomfortable on their feet.

""You have six older brothers. The eldest, Lorenzo, is now your legal guardian."" My head was spinning with my thoughts. Six brothers! I have six brothers that I never knew of! The officers seem oblivious to freak out session.

""You will have to move too Italy since that is where they all live. Why don't you go pack and we will drive you to the station to get everything settles?"" I couldn't speak so I just nod my head and go upstairs.

It didn't take me long to get pack since I didn't have a lot of stuff. I changed some of the bandages on my cuts that I got last night and apply cream on my bruises. This took only about twenty minutes and then I made my way back to the officers.

""I'm ready to go."" And with that we made our way to the police station. I found out that I have a flight to Italy in three hours so that's great. Once we got to the station, they told me that they just need my name and signature on the paperwork that Lorenzo filled out and sent to them. Then the two people that informed me of my situation drove me to the airport and helped me get checked in.

""Thank you for the help.""

""No problem. I hope you have a good flight. Here's my number so you can text me when you get there. I want to make sure you get there safely."" I thank them again before going to my gate.

About an hour later, we start to board the plane and I was nervous. Not just because I am going to meet my brothers, but because I have never been on an airplane before. For the first hour of the flight, I was lost in my thoughts. I made the decision that I wouldn't let my brothers see how broken I am. I'm going to make sure that I don't let them in and make me vulnerable. Trust has to be earned, and it takes me a while to trust people, if I do at all. I also just realized that I don't know any of their names except for Lorenzo. For the rest of the flight, which was thirteen hours by the way, I slept or watched a movie on the screen connected to the seat in front of me. This is probably the only electronic thing I have had access to; I have never had a phone nor a computer.

We finally landed at about 10:00am, Italy time, which is 1:00am for me. Luckily I got a good amount of sleep on the plane so I should be good for the day. I grab my bag from the overhead compartment and this leads to a shooting pain in my ribs. I wince in pain before continuing to walk down the middle aisle to exit the plane. One thing I realized was that I have no idea what they look like and who is picking me up. Well, they should at least know what I look like so I will be fine. Now you probably think I'm crazy and some random people could claim that they are my brothers but I have a good sense of telling whether someone is lying. Plus, if they try to kidnap me, I will just fight back. Something I probably forgot to mention is that I am an underground fighter and this was how I managed to get my anger out; by punching and kicking my opponents. Obviously my parents never knew, but I used to sneak out twice a week, usually when I was in the least pain, and fight. This has been going on for about eight months and I used to have a trainer but now I teach myself since I was afraid that he would find out about the abuse.

I was sitting down by the front of the airport for about ten minutes before I noticed an older man walking towards me.

""Hi I'm Mark, your brothers personal driver. Are you Miss Liliana?"" He asked. Mark seemed very sweet and I could tell he only had good intentions.

""Yes, that's me and please, just Liliana is fine."" I say and almost smile. Something you should know is that I haven't smiled in over a year, before Liam left.

""Well Liliana, are you ready to go?"" After saying yes, he leads me to this SUV and we start the drive to my new ""home."" During the ride, we make small talk and learn more about each other. His favorite color is blue, which is the same as mine, and apparently his wife works for my brothers as well as the head maid. They must have money if they can afford a driver and maids.

We get to the house and I am in awe; the place is a mansion that looks about three floors and the exterior is gorgeous with the modern look and a hint of medieval to it.

1nlo6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/orengeflame/comments/1nlo6ee/chapter_26_karasuba/,Chapter 26 Karasuba,"Inside the towering skyscraper of MBI, an employee hurried through the pristine, white hallways, clutching a tablet tightly against their chest. Their breath was slightly ragged as they rushed toward the topmost floor, where their enigmatic and eccentric boss, Minaka Hiroto, resided.

The elevator ride felt like an eternity, though it lasted mere seconds. A soft chime announced their arrival, and the doors slid open to reveal a grand, open space filled with holographic screens, data projections, and a massive, reinforced glass window overlooking the city below.

At the center of it all sat Minaka, the self-proclaimed ""Game Master"" of the Sekirei Plan, dressed in his usual white coat, his fingers steepled beneath his chin as he leaned back in his chair with an amused grin. The dim glow of multiple monitors illuminated his glasses, making his eyes unreadable.

The employee stepped forward, swallowing their nerves.

""Sir, we have new intel regarding the unknown Ashikabi.""

Minaka's expression twitched with intrigue, and he sat forward, resting his elbows on his desk. ""Oh? Do tell.""

The employee tapped on their tablet, and a series of images and reports appeared on the holographic display in front of Minaka.

""Our surveillance teams have confirmed that the unidentified Ashikabi has successfully winged Sekirei No. 84, Yashima. Based on our gathered intelligence, he has been working under the alias ‘Issei Hyoudou’ as a construction worker.""

Minaka's grin widened. ""Hoh? So he has another Sekirei under his belt now? How delightful! It’s always fun when an irregular stirs up the game board.""

The employee hesitated before continuing. ""Sir, there's... another issue. We've been deploying surveillance drones to track his movements. However, every time they get close to him, they get disabled. We've lost dozens so far, and we still have no footage of him outside of confirmed encounters.""

Minaka leaned back in his chair, stroking his chin in thought. ""Disabled, you say? Now, that’s quite curious. Drones don’t just drop out of the sky without reason.""

A knowing smirk formed on his face, and he adjusted his glasses. ""There are only two people within the Sekirei Plan who could manage something like that… and only one of them is currently very interested in going against my glorious game.""

The employee shifted uneasily. ""Are you suggesting—?""

Minaka snapped his fingers. ""Indeed! It means this Issei Hyoudou has also winged Sekirei No. 2, Matsu. And if he’s gotten her assistance… that means he’s most likely living at Izumo Inn.""

The employee's eyes widened. ""Then… should we take action?""

Minaka chuckled, standing up and spreading his arms dramatically. ""Oh, no, no, no! We wouldn’t want to disrupt the natural flow of the game too soon! No, this requires a… delicate touch.""

He turned toward the window, looking down at the city as if gazing upon a grand chessboard. ""But an irregular Ashikabi, one who manages to wing Matsu of all Sekirei? Now, *that* is something I simply must see with my own eyes. Or rather… I’ll send someone in my stead.""

Minaka’s smirk widened as he raised a single hand, issuing a command.

""Send Karasuba. Let’s have her… *introduce* herself to our mysterious new player.""

The employee stiffened. ""Karasuba, sir? But—""

Minaka turned his head slightly, the amusement in his gaze making it clear there was no room for debate. ""You worry too much. I merely want her to meet him. After all, it would be quite unfortunate if our precious Sekirei Plan was disturbed by an unknown factor, don’t you think?""

The employee hesitated but ultimately bowed. ""Understood. I’ll send the orders immediately.""

As they turned to leave, Minaka chuckled to himself, his voice laced with anticipation.

""Now then, Issei Hyoudou… let’s see just what kind of storm you’ve brought into my grand game.""

—----------------------------------------------

**Izumo Inn**

Issei sneezed suddenly, rubbing his nose with a confused frown.

""Ugh… why do I feel like someone really annoying is thinking about me?""

Yashima looked at Issei with a small frown, tilting her head as she noticed his slight discomfort. ""Issei? Are you okay?""

Issei blinked, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Just got a weird feeling all of a sudden.""

Before Yashima could ask more, Uzume suddenly waltzed into the room with a bright grin, throwing an arm around Issei’s shoulders. ""Well, since you don’t have work today, how about we go out? Y’know, have a little fun, enjoy the fresh air, and, most importantly—"" She grinned mischievously and pointed at Yashima. ""Take our new Sekirei on a date!""

Yashima’s face instantly turned red. ""D-D-Date?!""

Uzume chuckled at her reaction, clearly enjoying the flustered expression. ""Well, yeah! You just got winged, girl! You gotta have some bonding time with our Ashikabi, right?""

Issei chuckled awkwardly. ""A date, huh? That actually doesn’t sound too bad. I guess it’d be nice to take a break.""

""Great!"" Uzume cheered, then turned toward Matsu, who was standing off to the side, watching with a pout. ""Too bad you can’t come though, Matsu. Since, y’know… *you can’t step outside.*""

Matsu immediately groaned, pushing up her glasses with a sulky look. ""That’s not fair! You know how much I wanna spend with our dear Ashikabi!""

Issei, who had been watching their back-and-forth, raised an eyebrow. ""Wait, why can’t Matsu leave the inn?""

Uzume gave him a teasing smirk. ""Oh, didn’t you know? Matsu here is actually a *criminal*\~.""

Issei blinked. ""*Wait, what?*""

Matsu sighed dramatically, placing a hand on her forehead like some tragic heroine. ""It’s true. I am but a fugitive, doomed to live my days confined within these walls… forever yearning for the outside world…""

Uzume rolled her eyes. ""Oh, come on, don’t make it sound so dramatic.""

Issei turned to Matsu with a more serious expression. ""For real though, what happened?""

Matsu adjusted her glasses and gave him a sheepish smile. ""Sorry, Issei-kun, but I can’t tell you everything right now. Let’s just say… I stole something *very* important from MBI. And because of that, they’ll be after me if I ever step outside. Miya’s protection is the only reason I can even live here safely.""

Issei frowned at her words but ultimately sighed and gave her a reassuring smile. ""Alright. I won’t pry. Just let me know when you’re ready to talk about it.""

Matsu looked at him with slightly widened eyes before her smile turned more genuine. ""Thanks, Issei-kun. You really are a sweetie\~.""

Uzume smirked. ""Aww? We totally got a good Ashikabi, Matsu.""

Issei scratched the back of his head, trying to brush off the compliment. As he thought of everyone living in the inn. ""So wait, does that mean everyone living here is a Sekirei?""

""Yep!"" Uzume confirmed with a grin. ""Even Kagari!""

Issei paused, his brain screeching to a halt. ""...Wait. *Kagari’s* a Sekirei?""

Matsu, Uzume, and Yashima all turned to look at him with puzzled expressions.

""Uh, yeah?"" Uzume said slowly.

Issei's expression twisted in confusion. ""But... I thought all Sekirei were girls.""

The three of them continued to stare at him, as if trying to process what he just said.

Matsu finally spoke first, adjusting her glasses. ""Issei-kun... how did you come to that conclusion?""

Issei shrugged. ""I mean... I’ve only met girls so far! And I haven’t seen a single male Sekirei before now, so I just assumed—""

Uzume groaned, rubbing her temples. ""Oh, for the love of—Issei, did you seriously think the entire Sekirei species was made up of just hot girls?!""

Issei blinked. ""...I mean, yeah, kinda?""

Matsu smirked. ""Not that I can blame him\~. He *has* only met beautiful women so far. His data points are biased.""

Uzume gave her an unimpressed look. ""You’re *not* helping.""

Yashima, meanwhile, looked between them, still unsure what the fuss was about.

Issei rubbed his neck awkwardly. ""Well... uh, guess I learned something new today.""

Uzume sighed and shook her head. ""You really are something else, dude.""

Matsu chuckled, and Yashima just smiled softly, watching their interactions with quiet amusement.

As the laughter died down from their conversation about male Sekirei, Issei suddenly remembered something from earlier that morning. He had been talking with Miya while he was leaving for work, and something about their conversation had stuck in his mind.

""Hey,"" he started, scratching his cheek, ""is Miya married?""

Uzume and Yashima blinked at him in confusion, while Matsu’s playful expression immediately faded into something more subdued.

""You’re only asking that now?"" Uzume asked, tilting her head. ""You’ve been living here for a while, and it just crossed your mind?""

Issei rubbed the back of his neck. ""Well, yeah. I mean, she acts all elegant and kind of like a mom sometimes, but I never saw her husband or heard her talk about him.""

The atmosphere in the room shifted slightly, a weight settling over them. Matsu let out a quiet sigh before speaking. ""That’s because… Takehito, Miya’s husband, has been dead for a long time.""

Issei’s eyes widened in shock. ""Wait… seriously?""

Matsu nodded, her usual playful tone absent. ""Yeah. He was a genius researcher at MBI, one of the few people who actually cared about the Sekirei and wanted to help them. But… well, he got caught up in their experiments and—"" She paused, her lips pressing into a thin line. ""Let’s just say he didn’t make it.""

Uzume crossed her arms, looking unusually serious. ""Miya doesn’t talk about it much, but we all know it still affects her. She acts like she’s moved on, but you can see it in her eyes sometimes.""

Yashima looked down at her lap, her fingers lightly clenching her dress. ""That’s… so sad.""

Issei felt a pang of guilt in his chest. Miya had always been so composed, always carrying herself with an almost untouchable grace. He had never even considered that she might have lost someone important to her.

""...I had no idea."" He murmured.

Matsu gave him a small, sad smile. ""Most people don’t. She doesn’t bring it up, and we don’t push. But she loved Takehito deeply. I think a part of her is still waiting for him, even now.""

Issei stayed silent for a moment, his thoughts swirling. He had always respected Miya, but now that respect deepened. To lose someone that important and still be able to smile, to take care of others like she did… it took incredible strength.

""She’s amazing."" He finally said.

Uzume nodded, smiling slightly. ""Yeah, she is. Miya’s the strongest woman I know.""

Matsu chuckled softly. ""Not just emotionally. You *really* don’t wanna piss her off.""

That made Issei snort, breaking the tension slightly. ""Yeah, I figured. Her ‘Hannya’ mode is terrifying.""

Uzume shivered dramatically. ""Tell me about it. That’s the real reason I behave myself in this place.""

Yashima giggled quietly, the heaviness from earlier lifting a little.

Issei leaned back, exhaling. ""Still… I kinda feel bad for bringing it up now.""

Matsu shook her head. ""Don’t. You didn’t know. And honestly, it’s good to remember that even Miya has things she carries.""

Issei nodded, making a mental note to be more mindful in the future. Even if Miya never talked about it, he’d do his best to show her the same kindness and strength she always gave to everyone else.

As he leaned back against the tatami mat floor, finally exhaling the tension that had slowly built up in his shoulders. The revelation about Miya's husband had hit him harder than he expected—but what comforted him was that Miya still lived, still smiled, even after such loss.

“…I’m glad.” He muttered, mostly to himself, but the girls around him looked at him curiously.

“Glad?” Matsu repeated, tilting her head, curious.

“Yeah,” Issei said, glancing at each of them. “That even after an Ashikabi dies, a Sekirei can keep living. Like Miya… she lost her husband, but she’s still here. Strong, graceful, always helping people. It means… there’s a future for all of you, even if something were to happen.”

The room fell deathly quiet.

Uzume’s eyes lowered. Matsu’s smile faltered. Yashima clutched her sleeve, her brows furrowing.

“…Issei,” Matsu said softly, her voice strangely hesitant, “…that’s not how it works.”

“…Huh?”

Uzume took a breath, her expression uncharacteristically somber. “We don’t get to live on like Miya did, Issei.”

Issei blinked. “Wait, what do you mean?”

Yashima, still looking down, whispered, “The moment you die… we’ll die too.”

The words hit him like a punch to the gut.

He stared at them, disbelieving. “No… No, that can’t be right. Miya’s husband, Takehito-san, died, and she’s still here. So why—why would it be different for you?”

Matsu looked straight at him, her eyes soft but firm. “Because Takehito wasn’t her Ashikabi. He didn’t have the arua—the ability to form a bond with a Sekirei. He was just… a normal man. A kind, brilliant man that Miya fell in love with on her own. No link. No winging. Just love.”

She touched her chest, over her heart. “But we are different. We’ve been *winged*. That bond isn’t just emotional. It’s spiritual. Our lives are now tied to yours, Issei.”

Uzume nodded, her smile strained. “The Sekirei bond is a beautiful thing… but it’s also cruel. It gives us strength, hope, a purpose—but it also means if you’re gone…”

“…then so are we,” Matsu finished.

Issei felt like the floor had been yanked out from under him. He looked at them—Matsu with her usual teasing gone, Uzume with a rare flicker of solemnity in her eyes, and Yashima holding back the storm of emotion behind her quiet expression.

He clenched his fists. “That’s… that’s not fair. That’s not fair at all!”

His voice rose, his emotions boiling to the surface. “You’re all people! You have your own dreams, your own lives! You shouldn’t just—just vanish because of me!”

Yashima looked up at him then. Her eyes, calm and unwavering, met his.

“But… what’s the point of living if our Ashikabi is gone?” She asked gently. “You gave us a reason to live. If you’re not there anymore… what are we supposed to do?”

Issei opened his mouth, but no words came out. The weight of her words sank deep into him. He wanted to argue, to tell her that life was worth living no matter what—but how could he say that, knowing their very souls were bound to his existence?

“I…” he started, his voice hoarse, “I never wanted that kind of control over anyone…”

Matsu reached out and gently took his hand. “It’s not about control. It’s about connection. I chose you, Issei. Not just because I had to, but because it was something I *wanted* to do. From that decision you have given me warmth. Hope. I don't ever want to lose this”

Uzume leaned against him with a grin, though her eyes still held that hidden sorrow. “You’re a pervert, but you’re a good guy. And yeah, it sucks that we’re tied to your life… but that’s the price of the bond. And you know what?” She tapped his chest. “I don’t regret it. I don’t regret how I got winged.”

Yashima nodded beside her, her voice soft but filled with conviction. “I’d rather have a short life by your side than an eternity alone.”

Issei sat there, eyes wide, heart heavy. These girls, they were willing to lay everything on the line for him. Not out of obligation, but because they *chose* to.

“…I’ll protect you all,” He whispered fiercely, more to himself than to them. “I swear… I won’t die. I won’t let you fade away. Not while I still breathe.”

And in that moment, surrounded by the soft golden light filtering through the inn’s shoji doors, Issei Hyoudou made a silent vow to the hearts now tied to his own.

He wouldn’t fail them. Not now. Not ever.

—--------------------------------------

The heavy emotions from earlier still lingered in Issei’s chest, but now, as he walked through the bustling commercial district with Uzume on his right and Yashima on his left, each clinging to his arms.

Of course, every single person around them was *staring*.

“Hey, hey, look at that guy—two girls at once?”

“Are they models? Look at their bodies!”

“Lucky bastard…”

Issei tried not to flinch at every whisper and side-glance. He really tried. But the stares, the judging eyes of women, the jealousy practically radiating from the men who passed by, and the muttered comments from schoolgirls passing in giggling flocks—it was *a lot*. 

“Easy, Issei,” Uzume chuckled, tightening her grip on his arm with a teasing smile. “You’re walking too stiff. Try to act like this happens all the time.”

Yashima leaned in slightly closer, her cheeks pink but her smile content. “Yes, Issei. We’re proud to be seen with you… so you don’t have to feel embarrassed.”

Embarrassed? Issei was beyond that. He was about five seconds from overheating.

Because it wasn’t just their attention—it was the soft, *soft* pressure pressing into both of his arms that made it incredibly difficult to think straight. Uzume’s breasts squished into one side, warm and entirely unashamed, while Yashima’s were more reserved, but no less *present*.

He forced a laugh, trying not to let the blood rush to his head. “Heh… no, no. I’m good. Great, actually. Fantastic, really.”

Uzume gave him a knowing smirk. “You sure about that? You’re walking like you’ve got two bombs strapped to your arms.”

Yashima blinked, concerned. “Ashikabi-sama? Is something wrong with your arms? Are they hurting?” As she tried hugging his arms harder to check for anything wrong.

“N-No, no, not at all!” He sputtered, waving his hands a little too quickly before Uzume reeled him back in with a mischievous tug.

“Easy there, stud,” she purred. “You’ll ruin our date if you panic.”

He was out in the city, surrounded by the sounds of traffic, the bright awnings of stores, and the scent of fresh bread from nearby bakery—and on either side of him were two beautiful women, clinging to him affectionately, strolling through the district like it was the most natural thing in the world.

He glanced around at the gawking onlookers, noticing a group of guys his age glaring daggers into his back.

“Oi,” one of them hissed. “That guy’s living the dream…”

Issei grinned sheepishly and looked ahead, trying to ignore the mounting pressure of their envy.

“Maybe I should’ve worn sunglasses,” He muttered.

Uzume snickered. “So no one can see your ‘I’m totally winning at life’ expression?”

“Exactly,” He said without shame.

Yashima’s grip on his arm tightened a little. “We’re lucky to be with you.”

That stunned him into silence for a second. He glanced at her, surprised. “You really think that?”

She nodded, smiled gentle and sincere. “Yes. Ever since you winged me… my world’s been brighter.”

Uzume gave a playful hum. “You’re not just a pervert, you know. You’ve got a heart under all that ogling.”

Issei scratched the back of his head. “Thanks… I think.” Issei laughed awkwardly, trying to hide how flustered he really was.

Both Sekirei clung to him affectionately, ignoring the blatant stares of envious onlookers. The whispers buzzed around them like bees.

“Is he from some rich family?”

“Two girlfriends… both *that* hot?”

“That’s not fair. I can’t even get a text back.”

Issei tried his best to keep his cool, but the sheer volume of eyes glued to him made that difficult to hide the smile from his face.

Uzume leaned in, her bountiful chest squishing into his right arm. Yashima wasn’t much better on the left, her quiet, shy smile contrasting with how tightly she was pressing against him. He could feel every curve.

“…Nope. I’m doomed.” Issei muttered.

“What’s that, Ise\~?” Uzume grinned, leaning even closer with mischief in her eyes. “Enjoying our first date already?”

“Y-You’re really not holding back, are you?” He choked out.

“Why should I?” Uzume said proudly. “You're my Ashikabi. I’ve got dibs.”

Yashima blinked. “Dibs…?”

“You know,” Uzume smirked, “claiming your man before someone else can.”

Yashima’s eyes widened, then she looked down bashfully. “O-Oh… I’d like to claim him too…”

Issei coughed violently, his brain short-circuiting.

“L-Let’s sit down! That café looks… quiet!” He blurted, guiding the girls toward a nearby sidewalk café before his head exploded from blood loss.

—--------------------------

The three of them settled outside at a small, shaded table, ordering some cold drinks while trying to escape the watchful eyes of the crowd. Things felt calmer. Almost peaceful.

Until *she* arrived.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The sound of deliberate high heels clicking against pavement drew Issei’s gaze toward the street. A tall, elegant woman approached, clad in a gray haori over a black uniform, with long grey hair tied in a loose, regal ponytail. Her presence turned heads, not from beauty—though she had plenty of that—but from sheer, *unshakable pressure*.

Issei felt a chill run up his spine. The smile she wore was pleasant, but something about it was… wrong.

Uzume stiffened instantly. “Oh crap.”

“You know her?” Issei asked, eyes narrowing.

“That’s Kurasuba,” Uzume whispered. “Sekirei No. 4. The ‘Shinigami.’ She’s one of the strongest out there—and completely insane.”

Kurasuba stopped beside their table, smiling with the politeness of a practiced predator. “What a lovely afternoon. May I join you?”

“You just did,” Uzume said, voice tight.

Kurasuba’s eyes flicked toward Issei, assessing, calculating. “So. You’re the irregular everyone’s been gossiping about.”

“Name’s Issei Hyoudou,” He said cautiously. “Don’t believe everything you hear.”

“I believe only what I see,” Kurasuba said. “And what I see… is pathetic.” She looked at the two Sekirei clinging to him. “Winging two in such a short time? How bold.”

Issei frowned. “What do you want?”

“Oh, nothing violent… yet.” She said with a faint giggle. “I’m simply here as a messenger. Minaka is *very* interested in you.”

“Minaka…Who?” Issei said, causing his Sekirei to fall off their seats.

“Hubby. He’s the mastermind of the Sekirei plan.” Uzume explained.

“Ohh. The crazy CEO.”

“*Founder*,” she corrected. “Visionary. Puppet master. Lunatic. Fool. Pick your favorite.”

Uzume glared. “He sent you out here just to check on our Hubby?”

“He wanted to see the irregular for himself. But since he’s too busy pulling strings from his ivory tower, I came in his place.” Kurasuba said lightly. “So I came to deliver a little message.”

She leaned in closer to Issei, her golden eyes piercing.

“Take care of your Sekirei, Ashikabi. The game is about to begin. Welcome to the beginning of the age of gods and you’re already being watched.”

She straightened up, smiled viciously, and walked off like nothing had happened.

The table was silent for a long moment.

“…I really hate cryptic warnings.” Issei muttered.

Uzume let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. “That was her being *nice.* She could’ve challenged you right here and now. The fact she didn’t? Probably Minaka’s doing.”

Issei rubbed his temple. “Great. So now we’ve got MBI breathing down our necks.”

Yashima gripped his hand gently. “We’ll protect you, Issei… just like you protected us.”

Issei looked at them both and smiled despite the worry gnawing at him. ‘*No. I’ll protect you. That’s my job now.’*

“Let’s finish our drinks,” he said. “Then we go back to the inn. We’ll talk to Matsu about this. I need to understand what the hell kind of game I’ve been dragged into.”

—-----------------------------

Issei exhaled, feeling the tension ease slightly as they stepped through the threshold.

“We’re back.” He called out casually.

From the gardin, Miya looked up from sweeping the stone path. Her warm, gentle smile was as perfect as always.

“Welcome home,” she said pleasantly.

Kagari leaned against the sliding door frame nearby, arms crossed, eyes briefly locking with Issei’s. “You caused quite the scene today.” He said as he remembered hearing a guy with two girls.

Issei gave an awkward chuckle. “Wasn’t exactly intentional.”

Miya’s smile never faltered. “You brought no harm to others. That’s what matters.”

The moment passed. Issei gave a respectful nod and motioned to the girls. “We’ll be in Matsu’s room. Something… happened.”

Miya simply nodded. Kagari watched them go, expression unreadable.





Upstairs, the group crammed into Matsu’s cluttered lair. Screens blinked and buzzed, wires coiled across the floor, and the smell of coffee and electronics lingered like smoke.

Matsu spun her chair around and perked up. “Welcome back! Did you bring anything interesting? Local gossip? Buns? Secret government files?”

Uzume didn’t even crack a smile. “We saw Kurasuba.”

Matsu’s cheerful tone dropped. “Are you all right?”

Issei nodded, crossing his arms. “She came to give me a message from Minaka. Said the ‘game is about to begin’ and that I’m being watched.”

Matsu sighed and slouched back in her chair. “I was wondering when you’d finally get caught in the web.”

“What web?” Issei asked. “What the hell is this Sekirei Plan really about?”

For a moment, Matsu said nothing. Then she stood and walked past the girls to close the door behind them.

“…So. You’re really ready to hear it?”

Issei met her eyes. “I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t.”

She nodded, then motioned to a small monitor as she clicked a few buttons on her console. A diagram lit up, showing stylized Sekirei wings, branching lines, and a tower that loomed over everything like a final boss arena.

“The Sekirei Plan,” Matsu began, “is a twisted ‘survival of the fittest’ game designed by MBI and orchestrated by Minaka Hiroto. One hundred and eight Sekirei were released into the city to find their Ashikabi. Once winged, we become bound by more than affection—our very existence becomes linked to yours.”

She paused. “Once enough Sekirei have been winged, the real ‘game’ begins. Elimination. Fighting. Battles to the death between Sekirei pairs until only one Ashikabi and their remaining Sekirei are left standing. The winner gets to climb to the top of MBI Tower and receive a so-called ‘ultimate prize.’”

Issei’s hands clenched into fists.

“So this whole thing is a damn bloodsport.”

Matsu nodded gravely. “And worse. We don’t know what that prize even is. Some think it’s knowledge. Others, power or freedom.”

Issei looked at her, then to Uzume and Yashima. “And you three… Do you want to win this ‘game’?”

Uzume looked away. “No. I just wanted to meet my Ashikabi. Someone worth protecting. Someone… like you.”

Yashima’s voice was soft. “I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just… want to stay by your side.”

Matsu gave a small smile. “I’ve seen enough of Minaka’s madness. I don’t care for his prize. I’d rather stay in this room and keep experimenting on you.”

Issei exhaled slowly, processing it all. “Then we’re on the same page.”

He turned toward them, serious. “We’re not playing his game. We don’t attack. We won’t hunt other Sekirei. But if anyone comes after us…”

His eyes narrowed, and the faint glow of the Boosted Gear shimmered.

“We fight back. Hard.”

Uzume grinned. “Now *that’s* the Ise I know.”

Yashima reached forward and gently held his hand. “We’ll fight… only to protect.”

Matsu gave a small smirk. “I can work with that. I’ll start scanning for other winged Sekirei in the area. If anyone comes close, we’ll know.”

Issei nodded. “Thanks, Matsu.”

Then he looked at all three of them, and for the first time since winging them, he felt a deep, solemn weight settle on his shoulders.

*‘These girls… their lives are literally in my hands.’*

But even so… they were *his*. And he wasn’t letting anyone take them.",1,1758340578.0,orengeflame,0,1.0,False

I'm adding in a subplot involving her courtesan half-brother. (She's an illegitimate daughter who was legitimized because she's the only one the King ever produced, and this is a brother from her mother's side.) My nation's culture is a blend of Austrian and Japanese. The half-brother works within a coffee house where rebels frequent and sympathizes with the cause. A rebel captain is going to reach out to him to recruit him to go to his half-sister and support her in her mourning, but also keep her focused on the benefits of supporting the revolution. 

But this also brings to mind the often debated question of what the difference is between a courtesan and a wife. I have thought about what they could discuss. One of the important conversations I'll have them have is the half-brother telling his little sister that regardless of how she feels, she can't allow her value to the rebellion to be questioned. She is the only royal daughter, she is their own chance to have legitimacy with the Crown and Church. She cannot tarnish her value by being uncooperative and giving these men reasons to look for alternative ways to achieve their goals without her.

Like no matter what I try I’m not making enjoyable cups. In the past I’ve chalked it up to the beans just not being my preference or something. This time, I had this coffee in the shop and loved it. It’s a Colombia Gesha from The Boy and the Bear. I haven’t been able to get a good cup so today, I set out to dial it in properly using “The Champ” on Orea’s site (Martin Woelfl). Based on their grind size recommendation I started with 8.0 on my K-max. It was pretty balanced with sweetness/acidity. Nice but not really any flavor or notes to be found. Kind of dull. Not at all what I got to taste at the shop. I brewed two more cups: one at 7.5 and another at 8.5. Everything else the same using melodrip, further eliminating any pour variation. I figured I would brew with a grind setting that should yield an over extracted cup at 7.5 and an underextracted cup at 8.5 to give me an idea of what to do next. The 7.5 was dull, empty and drying, had a generic coffee taste like you’d expect from over extraction and the 8.5 was weak and a bit sour. 8.0 seemed to be the right level of extraction then but it didn’t taste great either. Water is 50% TWW solution so water shouldn’t be the issue. Not really sure what is going on. This happens to me every once in a while. My question to the community is this: where do you look to make adjustments or changes when the dial in process doesn’t seem to be working? Are there coffees that just won’t taste very good without the perfect water recipe, the $6k grinder, the sibarist filter, and a rain dance? Does TWW solution start to degrade over time?

[More on the main plot here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriting/s/M3UcRVU6Uk)

I'm adding in a subplot involving her courtesan half-brother. (She's an illegitimate daughter who was legitimized because she's the only one the King ever produced, and this is a brother from her mother's side.) My nation's culture is a blend of Austrian and Japanese. The half-brother works within a coffee house where rebels frequent and sympathizes with the cause. A rebel captain is going to reach out to him to recruit him to go to his half-sister and support her in her mourning, but also keep her focused on the benefits of supporting the revolution. 

But this also brings to mind the often debated question of what the difference is between a courtesan and a wife. One of the important conversations I'll have them have is the half-brother telling his little sister that regardless of how she feels, she can't allow her value to the rebellion to be questioned. She is the only royal daughter, she is their own chance to have legitimacy with the Crown and Church. She cannot tarnish her value by being uncooperative and giving these men reasons to look for alternative ways to achieve their goals without her.

1nlnwhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saturdead/comments/1nlnwhw/weekly_story_resignation/,Weekly Story: Resignation,"I was always a curious kid. I’d follow my parents around and listen to what they said when they thought I was up in my room. It was jarring to hear their tone shift and their discussions grow more mature, at first, but it eventually turned to fascination. I learned early on that people can be more than one thing. They can be a loving parent, but a terrible husband. Kind to animals, but an abusive boss.

I wasn’t a liar, per se. I was just very good at compartmentalizing my life and reading between the lines. In school, I was part of the debate team. Much like with poker it’s all about playing your opponent. I was damn good at it too.

I don’t know when the company I would end up working for first picked up my scent. Maybe it was the time I blackmailed my way into a scholarship at a prestigious midwestern university. Maybe it was when I tried (and failed) to get emancipated at age 15. Maybe they keep tabs on everyone.

 

I was hired by a subsidiary to a large corporation at age 22. After three years, I was elevated to a role within the main company hierarchy. Two years later, we were ravaged by restructuring and I ended up in internal reviews and priority project evaluations. In outside memos, we went by the project name ‘Galapagos’, referring to the isolated island and its disconnect from the rest of the world. That’s what we were supposed to be; contained and self-sufficient, but still within the company.

The company is a multinational conglomerate. It would be easier to list things they’re *not* involved in than the things they *are*. They’re in electronics, computer hardware and software, logistics, aviation, security, tourism, agriculture, pharmaceuticals… all of it. You’ve probably seen their logo at one point or another on a particular mechanical part or a curious device. If it is produced by the main division, the logo is usually a pair of crossed hatchets, but sometimes they use the more “outwardly friendly” blue sunflower logo.

I was with ‘Galapagos’ for about ten years. We went through project submissions and reports, internal struggles and budget discrepancies. We assigned go-teams for corrections, adjusted personnel management in cases of a boss overstepping their boundaries, things like that. Sounds sketchy, right?

Well, it was.

 

I’m not just talking sketchy as in illegal. I’m talking sketchy in the ways that the rules we operated under can seem downright alien to outsiders. In some cases, they were literally out of this world. And yes, I am using that word properly. There are entities from outside the realm of our physical boundaries, and we worked with (and against) a lot of them. Historically it created leaps of progress that allowed us to nestle into pretty much everything. But nowadays, we’ve pivoted towards preservation. There’s no point in being the king of a scrap pile.

We had a lot of fun though. You gotta have fun if all you’re doing is watching things getting torn apart, whether it’s your friends, colleagues, a small neighborhood, or your own mind. For example, once we got the Paperhead computer system rolling, we started getting external summaries of suspicious activities from social media platforms. Most of it was of genuine concern, but every now and then we’d get something absolutely absurd. Like, you know those little blue and white sea slugs? They look like little aliens? The system loved flagging them so much that we put up a slug counter in the office. We had a little bell and everything for whenever someone got a slug picture in their review memo. One guy got twelve in a day, so we printed him a diploma.

There were also codes to learn. Codes for containment breaches, stalled convoys, unknown incursions… I think we had three dozen codes to memorize. We had the privilege of coming up with our own code names, so we settled for rock and metal bands. An anomalous flight was a “Code Kiss” after their song ‘Heaven’s on Fire’. A dangerous substance leak or poisoning was a “Code Alice”, after Alice Cooper. You know, ‘Poison’? Makes sense, right?

But the scariest code of all was the Aerosmith. The Aerosmith song “I don’t wanna miss a thing” was synonymous with the movie ‘Armageddon’. So getting a “Code Aerosmith” meant an immediate and present danger on a planetary scale.

And not too long ago, that code went down the pipeline.

 

I was sitting at my desk when it happened. We’d been getting notifications all day that something was going on, but we had no idea what. There is no way to prepare for something like this. It just popped up in our feed, right along with budgetary reviews, complaints, social media reviews, and bi-weekly wrap-up meetings. It was unreal. Like, just an hour earlier, we’d been adding to our snail counter. Now we were facing *doom*.

We were getting errors, warnings, alerts, all of it. People kept throwing around wild accusations and speculations, hoping for someone to take the reins and call the shots. There were protocols for Aerosmith, but none of it seemed applicable. We couldn’t get past the second step. First step is to confirm the accuracy of the alert. Second step is to confirm the source. We had nothing.

While the others in my team started to dig, I took a closer look at what the higher ups and the main division were doing. I saw a lot of movement in the financial sector. Liquidation after liquidation. They uprooted our entire pharmaceutical branch. That’s like a fourth of the company right there. We were selling off patent rights, entire branch companies and subsidiaries – all of it. They were loading up with cash and moving it straight into emergency project development.

I watched those numbers bounce up and down, slowly realizing this wasn’t a joke. This was dead serious. You must consider that this is a *behemoth* of a company. Moving the dial anywhere from 1 to 5 percent can shut down entire towns. This aggressive liquidation was nothing short of apocalyptic. Code Aerosmith. You really don’t wanna miss a thing.

 

Most people slept in the office that night. A couple of them stayed up late on their phones, talking to their loved ones. We didn’t have a timetable to work with, so the literal end of days could be anywhere from hours to a year. I thought about calling my parents, but we’d been estranged for about a decade. Still, it’s in those dark hours when you need to hear a voice that reminds you of a lullaby. That’s when you need to remember you’re a human.

I remember the breaking point. It was about 3 am. Things were moving at breakneck speeds. They were assigning teams to bring in subjects from a turn-of-the-millenium project, and it was all very touch-and-go. We were getting breach warnings on repeat, but it was a drop in the water at that point. But what worried me was the action plan. What were the higher-ups aiming for?

I noticed a lot of money going into infrastructure. They were moving people into this small Minnesota town called Tomskog, setting up perimeters around a hotspot. We’d been monitoring it for some time, and I knew there was a project related to it somewhere in the archives, but it must have been moved to top priority. I checked my logs until I found the name. Project Cenotaph, or Ceno for short. Looking back at it, it struck me as odd. Why Ceno?

I found the old files in an archived hard drive. Turns out CENO was an abbreviation for “Culling Extranatural Obstruction”. The project was very vaguely described, but it surmounted to deploying a weapon to a deep-earth fissure.

Looking closer at recent investments, I could confirm that’s what they were doing. They were moving into Tomskog, Minnesota. The Frog Lake fissure is the largest in the continental United States, with metal-ridden cave systems that seem to go on forever. And as for the weapon, that’s why they were gathering test subjects; extraction. There were certain subcomponents they needed.

They were building a weapon, and fast. It was like watching an army of ants assemble a nuclear warhead; no one ant had an idea what the hell they were doing, but the hive mind was ready to blow it all into kingdom come.

What I was seeing wasn’t hope. This was *resignation*. This was the equivalent of destroying the world to help feed the cockroaches. If they were to succeed, there was no telling what would happen. They were doing it on a whim, on short notice, with a “to hell with it” attitude. There was no review, no discussion, no compromise.

Project Cenotaph was a go, and we had to go along with it.

 

I talked to people around the office. Most of them ignored me, others went to look for confirmation. Some idiot flagged it for review in the system, which immediately caught the attention of a supervisor. Within an hour I saw suspicious movement in our database requests. They’d started to sniff out doubters, and it wasn’t looking too good. And I mean, that was fair. I didn’t *want* them to go through with this. Not when we didn’t really know what we were facing.

Moving around the office, a friend of mine grabbed my arm. He was usually a bit of a jokester, but he’d lowered his voice. I’d seen him smile a thousand times, so I could tell when it wasn’t genuine. This was one of those times.

“You should check the snail counter,” he said, keeping a grin up. “Really.”

I could sense something was up and smiled in kind, tapping him on the shoulder. I went over to check the snail counter, only to see that it had jumped from a couple of hundred to a whopping 1343. A very specific number. Someone had changed it.

1343. In letters, that’s ACDC, and we did have a code for that. They made the song ‘Dirty Deeds’, making up the code for ‘internal wetwork’; as in killing an asset currently or formerly employed by the company. I picked up a cloth, erased the board, and wrote the original number. Looking over at my colleague, he nodded. Maybe it was meant as a warning. Maybe he saw something alarming in the feed. Either way, I had a bad feeling, and a bad feeling was all it took for me to make plans of my own.

I had to get out.

 

You don’t quit a place like Hatchet. You just don’t. If you retire, maybe. They set you up with an approved retirement plan and you get to live out your days with the greatest healthcare that not even money can buy. But even then you can get called back in if push comes to shove – you’re never out of the game.

So what I had to plan was not only quitting a job, it was getting out from one of the most powerful economical and technological entities on the planet. I couldn’t write anything on my computer or phone, or they’d see it. If I was under any kind of suspicion, they’d have me flagged by everything, everywhere. Facial recognition software was just the beginning. You know they got movement algorithms now? They can watch a recording of you typing on a screen or writing on a piece of paper and figure out what you wrote.

I had to memorize what I could and leave the rest. I had to make backups, contingencies, all of it. My life had a timer, and it was running out quick.

 

I noticed a couple of new faces in the crowd. People from other departments coming to check on us. People we’ve known for years. It’s not strange to see them around the office, but the timing was too perfect. I figured they were doing recon; they were very careful about not looking my way. They wouldn’t be that careful on an average day. I just went on my merry way, heading for the quartermaster. I stopped by as casually as I could. He rolled up the protective glass. He was already reserved.

“No checkouts,” he said before I even opened my mouth. “Nothing goes out.”

“That’s fine, I got some returns. We still take returns?”

“Sure.”

I handed him my service weapon and a magazine. He looked it over and tapped it a little.

“Looks jammed. Gonna have to get it to maintenance.”

“You do that. Am I good to go?”

“Yeah, have a good one.”

Of course it was jammed, I’d jammed it earlier. He didn’t notice the small plastic hook I’d slipped under the plastic cover. The moment he turned his back on me, I clicked it open. The repair bin was in the far back of the room, one floor down. It’d give me some time. I reached in and grabbed his tag from his computer. You can’t see it from outside the booth, but if you know where it is and where to reach, you can get to it. It’s just a plastic card, and removing it locks you out of the system, but it allows you to open a couple of doors. That’s all I needed – bridges would have to burn.

I got into the equipment storage. I grabbed a bunch of items. Protective gear, visibility vests, a couple tasers, blank pass cards, surveillance jammers, signal blockers… pretty much whatever I could get my hands on. Two full duffel bags. Good thing I got some heft in my shoulders, those things ended up heavier than I thought.

The quartermaster would sound the alarm soon enough, but he’d have to get back into the system first. I hurried to the nearest trashcan and pulled up the bag, hiding the card in the space between the can and the bag. That’d get me a little more time. A couple minutes maybe.

 

I left the building, heading straight for my car. I knew there were surveillance cameras in the parking lot, and there were probably red lights going off in a security office somewhere. I unlocked my car, fetching a break kit from my glove box. A simple contraption meant to override basic car security systems. I couldn’t leave in my own car, that’d be too easy to shut down. I stole one of my colleagues’ cars instead. Break kits are *wildly* unappreciated.

I have to admit, I was terrified. I’d seen what these people could do if they put their resources to it. We’re talking threats to my bodily autonomy. Mind games. Political assassinations are nothing to them. Hell, we had a protocol for overthrowing the government. *Any* government.

I pulled out the radio and yanked the cables. I didn’t want them to transmit anything to me. They would still be able to track me for a while, but the signal jammer might help. It was all just temporary solutions, and I was still planning in my head. My hands were so sweaty that they kept slipping off the steering wheel as I made a left turn onto the highway.

I was still throwing out electronics through the driver’s side window as I pushed the gas just past 75 mph. Stress makes me think on my feet. I considered leaving the country or going into the woods, but that would just draw things out. I needed a permanent solution, and those are quite tricky to come by. Then I remembered something; the subjects they’d called for extraction. It was quite a long list, but I knew a couple of the ones near the bottom.

That gave me an idea. A crazy idea, but it just might work.

 

See, there’s this woman on the list. She was part of an experiment called ‘The Class of 2000’. Long story. Her name was Jane Bogan, but she went under a lot of names. Dr. Bogan was one. ‘Devil Jane’ was probably my favorite. She was a somewhat normal person, at first glance, but she had this peculiar ability to put images in people’s heads. We never quite figured out how she did it, but I think it was a matter of mental displacement. Basically, she didn’t really put an image in your head; she gave you a vision of something that happened to you in another place, in another time. Sort of like a dimensional glimpse.

But more than that, she was one of the few people in the world who could perform a Stepmind. It’s a curious process where two people effectively swap minds. If I could get her to work with me, we could work something out. Literally changing from one body to another would get them off my back long enough for me to work out a plan.

I would have to take a chance. If I pulled an all-nighter, I could see Devil Jane in the morning. If, that is, they hadn’t gotten to her first.

 

It’s rough being alone with your thoughts all night. Especially under that kind of pressure. You get stuck in your head, thinking of worst-case scenarios. They could deploy a variety of creatures and things to track me down, but I hoped they had more immediate concerns. They were scooping up projects and assets left and right, trying to duct tape some kind of super weapon together. And while I understood their commitment, I couldn’t help but be convinced that it was misguided. It might seem strange to turn your back on something you’re so ingrained with for so long, but this is the nature of the company; you are constantly reminded of being expendable. It’s not like I couldn’t see this coming.

I made it through the night by determination and caffeinated sugar bombs from various off-highway truck stops. I thought about pulling over for a nap somewhere around 6 am, but I figured one more hour and I’d be in the green. Sure, I’d be half-asleep the moment I met her, but I’d talked to a lot of people under pressure. And this woman had a very clear incentive to talk to me, given what I knew about what was going to happen.

I parked down the street from her townhouse a couple of minutes before 7 am. A beautiful street lined with birch trees and trimmed hedges. Even had a classic red fire hydrant. Very picturesque. Lawns watered with sprinklers just smell different.

 

I saw Bogan as she headed for her car, coffee in hand. I whistled at her, giving her a wave. She turned, slowly. She was in her mid-40’s, but if it hadn’t been for her sunken eyes, it was sort of hard to tell. She really didn’t look that out of the ordinary. Well, maybe the hair. She liked to have a lot of volume. She always gave me a bit of an Elvira vibe.

“Can I help you?” she asked.

“Dr. Bogan!” I called out. “We have some important matters to discuss.”

“I’m late for an appointment; you have to reschedule with Lloyd.”

“That’s not an option.”

She put down her coffee cup on the hood of her car and curled her fingers. It was a tell; she was preparing to do something. I stopped at a safe distance, making sure to show my empty palms.

“There’s a squad being deployed to bring you in as we speak,” I said. “I think I can help you.”

That softened her a bit. She looked me up and down, picked up her coffee cup, and nodded.

“You can talk while you drive.”

 

She had me drive the car while she finished her coffee. I lowered the volume on her radio. She didn’t seem too happy about that. It was a nice car. Electric, very quiet.

I did my best to explain the situation. An emergency going down at Hatchet. She was very aware of them; they’d been in contact before. I told her she was going to be brought in for ‘extraction’, which was a procedure that very well may kill her. And if it didn’t, she would probably just be sent through it again until it did. There would be little to no way to get away from them at this point, but I could probably give her a warning and a fighting chance.

We drove across town, finally making it to a parking space outside her office. She’d finished her coffee but cradled the paper cup like a teddy bear. For all her unusual qualities, she was still very much human. And humans get scared.

“What do you suggest?” she asked. “And what do you want in return?”

“We can probably cook up a tool to help you,” I said. “And I need to, uh… stepmind.”

That caught her attention.

“That’s temporary,” she said. “And relies on a sound trigger.”

“We can work out the kinks,” I said. “You think you know anyone who might want to trade?”

It was a tough ask. Someone willing to completely trade bodies at a moment’s notice? I couldn’t think of a person like that.

“I suppose we have some work to do,” she said. “It’s going to be a long day.”

 

She invited me into her office and told her assistant to cancel all her plans. The man was about her age, and equally tired. It’d been rumored that ‘Devil Jane’ had a side effect of causing nightmares to people in her general vicinity after prolonged exposure, but we hadn’t confirmed it yet. But looking at her assistant, Lloyd, I could tell something wasn’t quite right.

I had a couple of ideas that might be able to help her. See, our teams used a tool called an inhibitor to stop extranatural communication. This thing was bulky though, imagine something the size of a car tire. You don’t just carry that around, it takes a dedicated team to operate it. However, the inhibitor itself relies on update feeds. With the right tool, those feeds could be flooded. If they were, the inhibitor would glitch; giving Jane and the other captives a couple of seconds to cause as much mayhem as possible. In my experience, a glitch in the system can do all the difference. It would probably come off as a power outage.

I borrowed a keyboard from her desktop computer, plugged it into one of my stolen gadgets, and wrote a simple flooding script. It was the code equivalent of ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’. The Paperhead system could adapt and fix itself eventually, but it would probably need a quick reboot. During that time, the inhibitor would spin and spin but have nowhere to go.

I compiled it and transferred it to a small chip. I had a couple of vitamin capsules that I could put it in, making it easy enough to swallow on short notice. After that, it just needed a trigger phrase to activate. I’d settled for ‘born in the USA’. It felt fitting, somehow.

 

When Jane came back, I explained the plan and handed her the capsule. She was a bit skeptical, but one tool was better than no tool. And to my surprise, she seemed to have a willing participant. Someone willing to stepmind and change places.

“Lloyd here wouldn’t mind trading down, what, ten years?”

“Something around those lines,” I said.

I wasn’t enthused about the idea of losing close to a decade of my life, but it was better than losing all of it. It was a work in progress, but it could work. Besides, it would be less suspicious.

“You got any issues I ought to know about?” I asked.

Lloyd shook his head and spoke in a monotone voice.

“Other than my charming personality and dashing good looks? No.”

“And you’re sure about this?”

“Why the hell not.”

I looked at Jane. She shrugged it off. I thought this part would be the most difficult, but it turns out it was probably the simplest.

 

The stepminding process could easily be a series of books on its own. I don’t know how Jane mastered it, but she did. You don’t even realize it’s working until you’re looking at yourself from across the room. It feels like stepping out of a mirror. One breath, I’m me. In the next, my lungs are different. Heavier, roomier. I had to take deeper breaths just to fill them up. A crucial part of Stepminding is the unraveling; the way to return. Usually it was something simple, like three snaps of a finger. Sort of like when you cancel hypnosis. Luckily, Jane had a couple of tricks up her sleeve. She tied the process to the midnight strike of a specific clock, which didn’t have any batteries. So if I ever needed to reverse the process, I could just buy some batteries.

All in all, it took a couple of hours. Jane had her breakout tool, I had camouflage. Hell, even Lloyd came out a winner. No offense to the man, but he’s the one who got the upgrade. I wasn’t exactly forthcoming about him being hunted though, but I’m looking out for number one. There’s more to this than just my well-being.

We parted ways. It would just be a matter of time before they closed in on her, and by then I had to be far away. I still had things to do, and I had to get an update on how things were going. That, and I had a body to adjust to. It’s difficult to explain just how alien it feels to walk in someone else’s shoes. It’s even more alien that they’re *comfortable*.

 

I took a long walk and ended up just outside of town. I ended up taking a nap on a bench by an old hiking trail. It is freeing, in a way. Being a new person with nothing to tie you down. When you truly have nothing, you can look at things for what they are. With nowhere to be, you can just enjoy the moment. Your needs and wants become more immediate. And yes, I had to look forward. If Hatchet was mad enough to go through with this, it could spell the end of life as we knew it. There was no way to tell, but from what I’d seen, I didn’t trust them to make an informed decision.

I made a plan in my head. By now, the rest of my old team were probably either fired, imprisoned, or dead. There was no way they wouldn’t consider them traitors by association. In fact, the guy who wrote 1343 on the snail counter was probably the first to go. I hadn’t considered that until then.

I ducked in and out of a restless sleep on that bench. I thought about people I could turn to. There was the Yearwalker, Perry Digman. Anyone who’d been in contact with John Digman was a direct threat to Hatchet, so if they hadn’t picked him off already, there was hope. Our surveillance reports had last spotted him working at some shitty restaurant until he went dark. He got in contact with a Tomskog ex-cop, Tamara. We hadn’t seen either of them for some time.

There was also Evan. Such a common name for such a strange creation. He was the offspring of a Class of 2000 test subject. The father was… complicated. Time works for these creatures, it’s more like a river. Let’s just say he’s close to perfect. I think we called him Adam.

 

I woke up in a daze after a complete six-hour crashout. Lloyd’s body wasn’t meant to sleep on park benches. It was only then that I started to realize just how different we were built, and what that meant going forward. I would have to adapt, and quick.

I made my way to a gas station. I could probably snag a car from there and be on my way. But first, I had to get something to eat. I wandered inside, only to notice people staring at a TV behind the counter. Four different people, and the attendant, all staring at a screen in disbelief.

I had no idea things were gonna go downhill so quickly. A newscaster was screaming at the screen.

The vice president had been shot in a kind of internal coup by the sitting president. It was a move to further secure their position. A couple of military figureheads had gone rogue to assist. There was a riot at the Capitol, and several congressmen had been put under house arrest. A member of the supreme court was detained and beaten. In response to this, a third-party private military contractor had been called in to balance things out and bring back order in contested areas. You can guess which company they belonged to.

It had all happened in a *day*. Hatchet had put *all* their cards on the table. They’d staged what looked like a coup so they could swoop in and play the hero. I recognized their spokesperson; he was basically the head of security at one of our black sites. I’d seen this man sitting across from me in a suit, drawing doodles on a napkin as he waited for his company lunch. Now he was on the news in full army fatigues, yelling fire and brimstone into the microphone.

It was upheaval; the first step in a claim to power. Indirect power, but power nonetheless. And I must admit, they were damn efficient when they wanted to be.

 

The news just kept rolling. I saw the headlines outlined in red, running under images of violent riots. ‘Company spy shot during routine traffic stop’. ‘Internet service providers hit with malicious computer virus’. ‘Near-earth object collapses as pieces hit the Atlantic’.

Curfews. Martial Law. Different channels reporting different things. Rolling blackouts in West Virginia, video of a military convoy rolling out from Massachusetts. Then, the TV just shut off. Black screen. Just a bunch of stunned faces looking back from a poor reflection, mouths open like a silent choir.

“Holy shit”, said a man in a trucker hat. “Holy shit, what’s even… what’s going on?”

“End of the world,” said the man behind the counter. “But don’t get any funny looting ideas.”

“What’s the point of the end of the world if you can’t do any looting?” another chimed in.

“That’s it, we’re closed,” said the man behind the counter. “Get out.”

“I haven’t paid!”

“I don’t care!”

We were thrown out as they turned the sign to ‘Closed’ and shut off the lights. There were sirens in the distance. I was ready to bet my bottom dollar that my original body was dead at this point. Jane Bogan was probably taken into custody. Hatchet was not gonna take this one sitting down.

 

But for now, we were just a bunch of middle-aged men standing outside a pre-emptively closed gas station, listening to the world falling apart somewhere out there. It was surreal.

“Y’all really think it’s the end of the world?” someone asked.

“Nah,” the trucker cap man said with a shrug. “We’ll be aight.”

“I’ll hold you to it.”

I was offered to hitch a ride to the next town over, which I graciously accepted. Trucker cap man seemed alright. Jovial fellow. The moment I sat down, he turned off the radio and started up his playlist. I almost choked on my spit when that first song started playing.

Aerosmith, with ‘Don’t wanna miss a thing’. What are the fucking odds?

 

There were a lot of things I didn’t know as we drove off. I had no idea Jane Bogan had been taken in, along with the rest of the ‘Class of 2000’. I didn’t know she’d whispered her trigger phrase. I didn’t know how badly it had mutilated an entire extraction facility.

But most of all, I had no idea what was to come. How something had broken through the sky. How something was stirring in the deep. How someone was crowning themselves an unknown king, waiting for the world to know their will. But I knew where I was going, and I knew what I would do when I got there.

I was going to help Perry Digman. With a little help, I could make a real difference.

Prologue

A royal guard kneeled in front of the king’s throne. He was breathing hard and panicking.

""Pardon me for disturbing you, Your Majesty, but I have something very important to tell you.""

The king looked at him while still kissing the neck of the woman who was sitting in his lap. His expression was showing boredom and disinterest. But he still signed him to stand up and talk.

""We found her.” He stopped what he was doing and looked at the man with a hint of interest in his face. They found her… After five long years, they finally found her.

""Continue,"" He ordered. The royal guard bowed his head before starting to talk.

""We found her in the middle of the forest inside the territory, roaming around. It looks like she's picking some herbal medicines."" He answered.

""How come I didn't feel her?"" He asked himself.

""Fool. You rejected her remember?"" His wolf replied angrily. His face darkened. It has been very difficult to tame his wolf since that night. The night when he rejected his human mate.

""Shut up!"" He hissed.

""Yeah, whatever."" His wolf lifelessly replied.

""We decided to approach her, but before we could reach her destination, she looked at us and began running away. We chase her, but she's too fast for a human, and then we lose sight of her."" The royal guard continued.

His fist turned into a ball. He couldn’t believe that he didn't even feel her presence within his territory. His warriors found her, but she escaped? Careless idiots.

""When did this happen?!"" He angrily asked him. He couldn’t help but get frustrated with what’s going on. He had been searching for her for long time and now they found her, she managed to escape? A mere human they can’t even locate? Damn it.

""Just a few minutes ago, Your Majesty."" His jaw clenched as his grip tightened onto the woman in his arm.

""Find her now and bring her to me!"" He ordered. They quickly nodded their heads.

""Yes, your highness."" They bowed their head before leaving the throne room.

He let go of the woman in his arms.

""Leave now, and don't come back."" The lady quickly left in fear.

An enraged alpha is frightening enough, but imagine the terror when it is the Alpha king himself. That would be truly terrifying.

Chapter 01: The Rejection

Her Point of View

Five years ago

I was lying down on my bed while reading my favorite book, Pride and Prejudice, when Amanda, my best friend, interrupted me from reading.

""Come on, Harper, get your ass off to your bed and prepare!"" She energetically exclaimed to me.

Geez, she's too loud and alive.

""I'm not coming, Amanda,"" I replied without even looking at her.

""Argh, seriously, Harp? You've got to be kidding me, and tonight will be a remarkable day because it is the ceremony of the next king! Did you hear me? The coronation of the new werewolf king!"" She literally yelled at my face.

I stop reading my book and look at her carefully.

""Stop yelling, Amanda. Look, I don't need to attend that ceremony, and you know the reasons why, Am,"" I calmly said to her.

""Look also, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, get your lazy ass out the bed now because you're coming with me to that ball tonight, and it will exactly start 3 hours from now."" She seriously commanded me

I can't help but smile. I found it so funny when I saw her so serious like this.

""Okay, fine,"" I answered while closing my book and carefully putting it back on my bookshelf.

She clapped her hand twice and smiled so widely. I know I can’t win any argument with her. Still the same Amanda I know. Manipulating freak. But a good one.

""Alright then, come on."" She happily said and winked at me. Here we go again; I groaned silently and glared at her.

This would be tiring. I walked outside my room and followed her. When we arrived there, I saw a blue backless gown. I immediately look at her. She's grinning from ear to ear, flashing her mischievous smile. It looks like she's planning something not-so-good.

What a cunning girl. I pouted mentally.

""I will not definitely wear that shit.""

""Well, watch me."" she grinned even more.

We argued for a few minutes, but later on, she made me wear that damn gown.

""Argh, I hate you now, Amanda!"" I complained and gave her a death glare. But she just smirked at me.

""Oh please, don't hate me. You look smoking ‘hot babe,""

I frowned but still glared at her.

""Hurry up, you're not done yet. Do your make-up. I'll be back later."" She hurriedly said and went to the bathroom. But before she completely got in, she winked at me again, which I just cringed.

What's wrong with her?

I just did my make-up while waiting for her. After a few minutes, she walked out, wearing a strapless green high-cut slit gown.

I raised one eyebrow at her.

"" What do you think, Harp? Do I look smokin' ‘hot like you?"" She playfully asked me.

This time, I smirked at her, time for her to pay back.

""Not even a bit."" I teased her.

""You're so mean,"" she said dramatically and frowned. I chuckled softly.

""Nah, I'm just kidding. You look great.""

""Just great?""

""Yeah, what else?” It’s not only her who know to tease, I can do better.

Amanda is an incredibly beautiful young woman with ginger hair, dark green eyes. She could pass as a supermodel.

""No smoking hot?” I chuckled again.

“Yes, you look smoking hot, and I know that you know that, so… no need for me to tell.""

""I thought so; you won't let me down. That's why we're friends."" She sat on the chair beside me, and we looked at ourselves in the mirror.

""Do you think I’ll find my mate tonight?"" She asked me suddenly so I looked at her.

""You know, I'm dying to meet him. It's been two years already since I turned 18, but until now..."" She stops and sighs.

""Until now, I can't still find him,"" she paused again and faced me.

""I'm starting to think now that I don't have a mate."" She continued.

I held her hand and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Stop thinking about it, drama queen, you have your mate. Maybe you need to wait for the right time. I know you'll find him soon, so don't lose hope."" She smiled at what I said and loosened up a bit.

""Do you really think I'll find him?"" I nodded my head. “Of course, you will.”

""Alright, you're right. I shouldn't lose hope and be optimistic. And speaking of mate... Maybe you'll find yours tonight!"" I immediately shook my head.

""We both know that I don't have a mate. I'm a human Am, and that's also one of the reasons why I don't want to go to the ball. I do not belong there."" This time, she's the one who held my hand.

""Who said you don't belong there? You're one of the few people who know our existence, and that makes you rare, Harper. You don't know how fate works. We don't know, maybe you had a mate. I think there are some cases in which a human can have a werewolf mate, vampire mate or any creature."" She said to me.

I just smiled at what she said. Possible but impossible in my case. It’s very rare for a human to have a mate.

""We should stop this drama now, Am; it was giving me goosebumps.""

She playfully punched my shoulder and laughed with me. We make ourselves pretty for the ball party.

Me and Amanda live near the palace where the royal family is living. I met her a year ago at the Blue Moon Festival. We talk until the moon is replaced by the sun. So much talk, right?

From that moment, we became friends.

""Are you ready, Harper?"" She asked me. I nodded.

We left her house and went to the grand entrance of the palace. Everyone is invited to come, but I don't think I'm also allowed.

I heard that the new king has a thing against humans. He hates humans, and I don't know why. I glance at her; she's so happy right now. Maybe hoping that she'll find her mate tonight. I wish her luck.

""Miss Amanda,"" the guards at the gate greeted her and bowed their heads.

Amanda was the daughter of the Royal Chief Warriors; she had two younger siblings and an older brother.

She nodded at them and smiled.

""Is the ball already started?""

""Yes, Miss Amanda,"" one of them answered emotionlessly. Sometimes, I’m thinking if the royal guards were robots. They seldom show emotions.

""Oh, okay, well, we'll go ahead now."" She said and held my hand. Before we passed by, I saw them murmuring the word “human”.

They are also aware that the new king hates humans. I wish that the king won’t see or pay attention to me tonight.

""Look, Harper! My father was there!"" I look from where she pointed. I saw a man in his late fifties. He's standing straight while having a serious expression on his face.

He had an intimidating aura.

""The person behind him was my brother."" She continued.

And then my glance travels to the person behind her father. I saw a young man in his mid-twenties. He looks great, and I think it runs in their blood.

I was busy observing the surroundings when I felt Amanda's grip tighten.

""What's wrong?"" I asked her.

She looks scared, stunned, and so lost. She's bothered.

""The king’s watching us,"" She whispered.

""Oh? Maybe he's not. Where is he?"" I asked.

""Above, don't look. Please don't talk to him. Stay away from him, just tonight.” I nodded my head and held her hand on my arm.

""Yes, I will, don't worry.""

""Alright then, let's go there."" We were about to walk when she stopped again. What happened this time? Don’t tell me the king came down to drag me out?

""Did you smell that scent?"" She asked me.

I confusedly stared at her.

""Smell what? Aside from food and different perfumes, I smell nothing.""

""Oh my... This smell..."" Her eyes widened.

""Smell of my mate."" She said to me. I blinked once. Did she find her mate now?

""I'm so sorry to leave you here now. I'll go and find him now. I don't want to waste this opportunity. But I promise I'll be back soon."" She said hurriedly. I nodded my head.

""No worries, but promise me, you will find him. If not, I'll smack you. I'm just kidding. Go ahead now, and good luck.""

She laughed softly and tapped my shoulder.

""Alright, see you later!"" She said and then left.

I looked around again, but then suddenly, I saw something. I was so stunned when I met a captivating pair of grey eyes.

""Mate."" My wolf, Reenah, yelled in joy.

Yeah, I know that I'm lying to Amanda, but don't blame me. It was for her safety and mine. No one should know about my true identity.

""Don't be a pussy, Reenah, obviously, he doesn't even want us."" My demon, Venice sassily replied.

""Will the both of you stop arguing?!"" My witch, Wendy, tried to stop them.

Here we go again; they will argue nonstop. Before they can start shouting, which will definitely be annoying. I blocked them.

I looked in his direction again; he was still staring at me. He’s aware that I was his mate, but he's not making any move to claim me.

Whatever.

I just shrugged and went towards the buffet table.

""Go to him, please, Alizah."" My wolf begs me. I shook my head.

""No, Reenah, we both know that we can't have a mate,"" I said to her.

""We can. Please, I need him; we need him."" She pleaded. I let out a sigh silently.

""Miss?"" I heard someone call me from behind. I looked at him and gave him a questioning look.

""The king wanted to see you,"" he replied.

Oh really?

""Go to him now! I knew it; he wanted us also!"" My wolf happily said.

I doubt that, but okay, fine. I'll face him. I nodded to the man and followed him.

We went to a huge and beautiful room. It's screaming wealth and power. The man who brought me here immediately leaved.

""So, you're my mate."" I stiffened and searched where the voice came from. I found him near the window, and his back was facing me.

He slowly turned around to face me, and the first thing I saw was his greyish eyes. I can clearly see anger and disgust on his face.

""What's your name?"" He asked me seriously; coldness was also evident in his voice. As what I expected from him. Be cold and distant to me.

""Tell him now, Alizah!"" My voice shouted. She's too happy; I'm afraid there will be a high possibility that her heart will break into a million pieces later.

""I'm Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur,"" I answered. He devilishly smirk and approach me slowly.

""I, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery, Reject you, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur as my mate and the future queen of werewolves.""

My wolf whimpered from what she heard while me? I'm still processing in my mind what the heck he just said.

The way he told me that he was rejecting me was as if it was just nothing to him.

""Bastard!"" My demon cussed him.

""He's not a bastard Ven!"" Reenah yelled back.

My mind was chaotic now. I calmed myself and blocked them again. I step once and smirk at him.

""May I know why you're rejecting me?"" I asked him calmly. His jaw clenched, and he glared at me.

""Isn't it obvious? You're just a pathetic, weak and useless human. And clearly, a human can't be my mate!"" Why he's so angry? I didn't even do something terrible to him.

""Tell him, Alizah? Tell him you're not human!"" My wolf begs me. I don't know what I will do now. I closed my eyes and tried to block them, but it seemed like I couldn't control them now because of this situation.

""Don't beg him to accept us; it's not our loss, it's him,"" Wendy said to me. Venice agreed too, but my wolf was saying differently. She was telling me that I should tell him who, really, I am.

""I'm sorry, Reenah, but I'm choosing us over him.""

I looked at him and smiled. He called me pathetic, weak and useless human. I'm wondering what makes him hate humans so bad.

""Okay, fine, yes, I'm just a human, and do you know what that does mean? Rejection can't hurt me."" I confidently said and looked directly into his eyes.

""I, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, accept your rejection, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery as your mate and the future queen of werewolves."" After I said that, I smirked at him, which made him mad and confused.

I could feel that he was in pain like I felt right now, but of course, I didn't show him that I was hurting.

Reenah was begging me to take back what I've said, but what I've done is done; I can't undo something that already happened.

Our bond was slowly fading as I could feel the strong pain in my heart. It feels like it's ripping me apart.

""Leave now, Alizah,"" Wendy said to me. Before I can turn my back on him, he grabs my arm so firmly in the way I can feel so much pain.

""Listen carefully, human; I know that you can't feel the pain I felt right now, so get out of my fucking territory and don't come back!"" He angrily yelled in my face.

I gave him a death glare. If he's thinking that I'll be scared of him, well, he's wrong. I jerk away so his grip loosens. A loud and hard slap touches his cheeks.

""That's what I'm going to do, dumbass! Do you think I would like to stay in this fucking place with you? Don't be dumb! I don't need someone like you, and I don't fucking care if you're the werewolf king! "" I yelled back angrily.

I'm starting to lose my shit too. His face darkened, and in just a matter of seconds, he slapped me so hard that it made me fall to the ground.

Before I could stand up, a bunch of warriors came and literally dragged me up.

""Take her away from my territory, and don't let her come back. That was an order!"" He yelled.

""Yes, Your Majesty!""

Before they could drag me out, I gave him a death glare. Don't let our paths cross again, King. I won't forgive you easily. Not until I find a good and valid reason for me to forgive you.

As we reach the ball hall, they all stop dancing and look at me with confusion. All of them don't have any idea what's going on.

""Harper!"" I heard someone yell from the crowd.

I searched where she was, and I saw her running towards my direction.

""What are you doing to her?! Let her go! She did nothing wrong!"" She shouted, trying to defend me.

The warriors were still dragging me out while Amanda is still following us.

Outside the palace, I saw a sleek black car parked at the end of the red carpet.

""Stop! Stop now! "" She ordered, but they didn't obey or even listening to her.

""No! Don't take her away, she's innocent!"" She begged when she saw me getting into the car.

The car started to move; I saw in the side mirror she was still looking at the car where I am right now.

""I'm sorry, Amanda for leaving; I'm so sorry also for lying to you. I'll promise when our paths will cross again; I'll make it up to you. Take care, Amanda Carnelian."" I mind-linked to her

After that, I was exiled to the place where my mate, my ex-mate precisely, ruled.

# Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Her Point of View

Present Time

Time passed by quickly. It’s been five years since the day he rejected me. What could be more exciting? He banned me from entering his territory! Isn't he an asshole? My wolf cried nonstop for the first year after he rejected me. She was in pain, unable to talk for a long time.

Blame that stupid king. When Reenah started crying, my vampire, Venice, ranted and raved at her, which is fucking annoying.

Their argument makes me feel sick, completely making me lose my sh\*t.

I admit that handling the three of them is a nightmare, but it is also fun. Having wolf, vampire, and witch blood may be both a blessing and a curse.

My father was an alpha but he died with the pack because they protected me. And what about my mother? I am still wondering where she is right now. I have not seen her since I was born.

The only thing I am sure of is that she is a half-witch and a vampire, which makes me even rarer.

I have lived in the human world since he threw me out of his kingdom. Life annoys me in my first week in the human world.

Having a wolf, whimpering in agony and a vampire thirsty for human blood. Thanks to Wendy, she is not causing me too much discomfort. Except for her strange stuff like making potions, medications, etc.

""Alizah! Are you okay?"" I jolted back to reality when I heard someone called my name.

""Yes?"" I muttered, glancing at her, puzzled.

It is Mindy, one of my coworkers at the coffee shop where I work.

""I'm wondering if you're okay. It looks like you're spacing out again,"" she worriedly asked. I shook my head and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Nah, I'm all right. Umm, maybe I'm just tired,"" I replied and continued wiping the table.

""Are you sure? You looked bothered?""

""Yeah, I'm fine. I'll wait until my shift ends, and then, I'll head home."" She let out a sigh and nodded.

I waited for two more hours before my work hours finally ended.

""See you soon, Mindy, bye!"" I said before I left. She smiles and waves her hand.

""Bye, Alizah! Rest well, okay?"" I nodded again and left.

I was heading back home when I felt that someone was following me. I look back to see who it could be, but all I see is darkness.

When I arrived at my house, I quickly open the door and locked it. I lay on my bed and dropped my sling bag on the table. Life is exhausting. I close my eyes to relax and calm down.

Three years ago, I became aware that someone, or rather, a group of warriors, was following me. And I was not born yesterday not to know who’s the mastermind behind it.

I can see them thanks to my unique abilities, but they cannot see me.

I am still wondering, what does he want? He rejected me already. Does he want me dead? Oh, that dumb king who only values himself. He is so selfish.

What do I expect? A man like him is cruel and does not know how to love. He is a filthy bad boy, a heartbreaker, manipulative, and an impulsive decision-maker.

He said that he did not want me to be his mate. So, I don't need him in my life either.

I opened my eyes. I dragged myself out of bed and went into the bathroom to bathe.

After bathing, I changed into my nightgown and applied cosmetics to my face. I didn't know such things at first, but thanks to Mindy, I now do. She claims that such products will whiten and moisturize my skin.

I nearly laughed that time. You see, having werewolf, vampire, and witch blood got some perks too. I don't need beauty products to be beautiful because it's already inborn.

But I eventually got used to it and used it every day. When my phone rang, I stopped applying lotion to my body. When I realised it was Mindy, I instantly answered.

""Yes?""

A couple of silences later, she still didn't talk. I blinked once and waited for her words.

""Mindy?""

""Umm..."" Huh? Is there something she needs to say to me? I think something is bothering her.

""Yes? Are you all right?"" She didn't answer my question. Probably she's deciding if she'll going to tell or not.

""We... We ...""

""We what?""

""We?...""

""We?...""

""We lost our job."" She finally said.

What?

""What do you mean?"" I ask her.

""When you left earlier, our big boss came over and told us bad news. He said he would sell this coffee shop because his income is low, and he said a condominium will be established later."" She explained.

Oh? I see.

""He said he's so sorry, and your last salary has already been transferred to your bank account,"" she continued.

That's a big deal—three years of working at that cafe, and now it's over. Nothing in this world lasts forever.

""Okay, Mindy, thank you for informing me,"" I calmly told her.

""You're welcome, Alizah. Anyway, what will you do now?"" She asked me.

""Honestly, I don't know. Maybe, I'll relax. Thanks for the concern, though.""

""Hmm, okay, if you need help, I just want you to know I'm here for you."" Oh, that's so kind of her.

""Thanks again, Mindy.""

""All right, I'll hang up now.""

""Okay, bye.""

""Bye.""

And the call ended.

All right, I'm a jobless person now. What a nice day.

""I want a peaceful life,"" Wendy mumbled.

What? A peaceful life? Aren’t we having a peaceful life already?

""You mean we'll leave this city?"" Reenah asked.

""Uh-huh."" She replied. That was an excellent idea.

""What? Wait! I don't want to leave this place!"" Venice exclaimed.

""If we're going to leave, where should we go?"" I asked.

""Let's return to where we came from,"" Wendy suggested.

""To our mate?"" Reenah asked, holding out hope.

""Come on, Reenah. It’s our ex-mate."" Oh no, not again. I spoke up before they could start debating.

""All right, we'll go back there without causing any trouble, and besides, if I go inside his territory one more time, they won't notice me,"" I remarked. They agreed with everything I said.

""I'll go back tomorrow, but for now, I just want to rest,"" I sighed, I feel sleepy suddenly.

""Me too. I'm so tired,"" Wendy yawned.

I went straight to my bed and lie down there. I wake up early in the morning to perform my morning routines, and prepared some items for travelling.

I used to live in a cabin in the middle of the forest before meeting Amanda. The cabin is small, but it is not cramped. It is hidden yet a perfect place to stay at.

Furthermore, the entire area was shielded by a barrier that I made.

Speaking about Amanda, I miss her terribly. I'm curious how she's doing right now. She must upset because I lied to her?

Is she already married with children? I wonder if she and her mate end up after what happened five years ago.

We'll see each other soon, Amanda.

I withdraw money from my account and bought several good stocks before leaving the city. I'm ready to go after that. If a warrior finds and sees me, I'll either flee or show them what I'm capable of.

I took a cab and went to the edge of his territory. After I paid and got out, clutching my belongings in both hands. Before I faced the border of his land, I watched the cab leave.

I felt good; it's great to be back. I'm sure he'll be furious and irritated when he realizes that I will live on his land without him knowing anything about it.

As an alpha or the Alpha King, he will be the first to notice that an outsider has entered his territory. With a mischievous smirk on my lips, I carefully moved my feet and entered the woods.

""Take over now, Reenah. Wendy will cover your scent while you, Venice, help Reenah boost her strength and speed,"" I ordered.

""Copy,"" I placed my belongings on the ground and began shifting into my werewolf form, allowing Reenah to take control of my body.

I'm a pure white werewolf, not as big as a male werewolf but far bigger than an average werewolf. That's hardly surprising, given my Alpha blood.

Reenah run fast, thanks to Venice. We arrived at the cabin without being seen by anyone. The house was quite old, and certain parts had been devastated by various natural disasters.

When I entered, I was greeted by dust and spiderwebs. Why am I anticipating a long day? I returned to my human shape and put on my clothing. I looked around the room and then took a deep breath.

This cabin needs a makeover, and I need to repair the damaged parts of the house. Okay, I sighed deeply and smiled. I'm sure I can do it. Let this old house be clean and comfortable once more.

I began cleaning, sorting, repairing, and discarding useless items outside while producing new items to place inside. I altered the design of the house to make it more welcoming and comfortable.

I reorganized my bedroom and washed the bedsheets and curtains. I fixed the door and windows, and the floor was as gleaming as the furniture.

My door and windows are solid and long-lasting. My room resembles a five-star hotel suite. I'm fantastic. But the truth is that I'm exhausted. It's already past 8 p.m. I didn't eat my lunch, so I'm starving now.

I went to my spotless and gleaming kitchen. I cooked my dinner and ate it at precisely 9 p.m. I scrubbed the dishes after eating and then caved in on my bed since I was skeptical.

The darkness whisked me away into a deep slumber in minutes. When I get up in the morning, it's already past ten. Oh, I did sleep over, but it's relaxing. I stretch my arm while yawning.

""I hope for a good day,"" I mumbled, knowing no one could hear me.

I get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I need to go shopping for cooking utensils and equipment.

I also need some technological devices because it's boring here. I have a hydroelectric transplant here, which allows electronic equipment to function.

I examined it recently and was relieved to find that it was still operational. I was dressed in black leggings and a white hoodie. I wore my black mask and knotted my silver-like hair.

Before I left, I locked the door to my cabin and went to the nearest market, which was also close to my old apartment. Amanda's house and I wonder whether she still comes to our flat.

I found out a year ago that her mate was the Royal Beta. I'm delighted for her because her mate welcomed her entirely without any concerns or confusion.

While mine, he rejected me without even knowing who I was. He's an asshole.

""The king is so hot! Oh gosh, I hope he'll pick me. I'm willing to be his bed warmer. Yum,"" the girl giggled.

Yum? That's disgusting. Anyway, no one is stopping her from being his ""bed warmer"".

I calm down myself. I bought everything I needed and returned to my cabin with everything I had purchased.

# Chapter 03: Meet Again

Chapter 03: Meet Again

Two weeks Later

Her point of view

I was actively collecting herbs when I heard voices nearby. I stopped and took a look around. Holly shit! I noticed some royal guards wandering around, and one of them noticed me.

Have I gone too far? The man who is staring at me... He appears to be quite familiar to me. Staring at him, I came to a realization. My eyes widened. He’s Amanda's brother.

When I saw them approaching, I took a step back.

""Do you want me to kill them all?"" Venice sassily asked. Damn, how I would love to, but I can't.

""No. Wendy, let Venice take over. We need to get out of here now,"" I replied.

""What? Why do you need to run away? We can kill them all in one shot!"" Venice scoffed. My brow furrowed, nope.

""We don't kill for no reason, Ven, so just do what I've said!"" I insisted. If I could see her right now, she probably roll her eyes at me. They switch quickly, and I flee as fast as possible before the Royal Guards can approach me.

I was aware that they were chasing after me. They transform quickly into their werewolf form while I use my vampire speed.

They were now chasing me and yelling at me to stop. Some were cursing me in their heads, which I could read.

I was eventually able to lose them after an hour of chasing. I'd gotten away. When I got to my house, I reinforced the barrier around it. I lay down on my couch and sighed.

""That was so close,"" I mumble.

""Yeah, right,"" Wendy agreed.

""And hella exhausting,"" Reenah added.

""It's better if we just kill them, "" Venice still insisted. Sometimes, I'm thinking if I'm the one who owns my body or not.

""We never kill for no reason, Ven. How many times do I have to tell you that?"" I chastised her.

""No reason? They were chasing you and possibly wanted to murder you. Is that still no reason? We have reason to kill them,"" she reasons out. I facepalm mentally. She’s right but I can’t hurt Amanda’s brother.

I lied to her five years ago and I can’t add salt to her wounds.

""That's not enough, Ven. I don't want to argue with you anymore. Let's take some rest,""

""Yeah, whatever,""

Even though she’s hard to please and tame, she's still part of me.

I headed to the kitchen to get some water to drink. I sighed again, wondering what to do if that stupid king could find me. Should I tell him who I am and what I am capable of? No. In his eyes, I will always be a weak creature.

But... I'm going to make him regret not knowing who I am. If he comes back later, I will not let him kill me. Instead, I will kill him.

I don't care if he's the fucking King of the werewolves or my ex-mate. I stopped thinking when I felt someone touch my barrier. No, someone is destroying the barrier.

He arrived earlier than I expected, huh? I went outside and saw him. He was the only one who arrived here.

I cross my arms and watch him destroy my defense. He's not in his wolf form, but he's causing havoc on the barrier I've built.

How powerful is this man? I almost forgot he's a king. The werewolf King. The Alpha of all Alphas.

When I noticed a crack, I stepped back to prevent him from destroying the barrier. He was caught by surprise by what had happened.

""Hot, he's so handsome."" I overheard Reenah say. That’s gross, Reenah.

""He's not handsome, Reenah, "" Venice disagreed. Here we go again.

""Stop arguing, Reenah and Venice. You both aren't helping. "" I warned them. Thankfully, they stopped.

I looked at him and noticed him staring at me with longing eyes. What? Longing? That's complete nonsense! Maybe it was rage and hatred.

We exchanged a few more glances before he began walking in my direction. He just stopped walking when he was in front of me.

""What are you doing here?"" He demanded angrily. I wanted to laugh and curse him right now.

""I know I'm exiled and unable to stay in this place, but I'm not making any scene or troubling you. "" I answered emotionlessly.

Oh, wait, why am I explaining to him anyway? He remained silent and just stared at me.

""I want to live in peace. You rejected me already. What else do you want from me?"" I seriously added. He silently came closer and grabbed my waist.

""How come I didn't feel your presence?"" He whispered in my ear. I wanted to smirk but didn't; I tried to push him away.

“Does it bother you?” I mocked.

""Answer my question, woman!"" He warned me and tightened his grip on my waist.

What the hell is going on? I don’t believe it’s my fault if he doesn't notice me. He wouldn't, of course. Wendy cast a powerful spell, disguising my scent and presence.

""I don't know,"" I simply answered. His grip loosens up, and he raises an eyebrow.

""What are you?""

A powerful creature that you just rejected, asshole. I wanted to answer, but I stopped myself. He doesn’t deserve to know.

""Isn't it obvious that I'm a human?"" I sassed out. He abruptly let go of my hand, and I stared at him.

What the heck?

""I want you to come with me,"" He coldly asked--- no he demanded. What? Is he fucking kidding me?

""Go with him, Alizah. I can still feel the bond. The bond was still there,"" Reenah remarked optimistically.

My brow furrowed. How might the connection still exist? I accepted his rejection five years ago. I feel the bond breaking, and we lose the connection. And now, how?

""Go with him, and let's figure it out,"" Wendy suggested.

""Why will you go with him? He's a worthless son of bitch!"" Venice angrily cursed.

""Ven, watch your words!"" Wendy warned her

""Yeah, whatever. I’m just stating the truth here."" I let out a sigh. This situation is killing me, damn it.

""Why would I go with you?"" I questioned him. He looks at me with his dark and intense eyes

""Because you're mine."" Because of what he said, I laughed hard. Damn, I'm his? Haha, are you kidding me?

""It seems like you forgot, Your Majesty. You rejected me five years ago. So you don't have the right to put a claim on me anymore."" That was hilarious. I'm his, my ass.

""Rejected or not, you're still mine, mine alone and forever,"" he replied firmly. Damn, is he serious?

This time, instead of laughing. I only smirked.

""Your claim on me is long gone and late, your Majesty. You had the chance and right five years ago, but you ruined it,"" I said seriously, and every word I uttered was true and firm.

Pain shot across his eyes, but it went as quickly as it never happened. He's skilled at concealing his true emotions and feelings, right? His expression turned chilly and stern.

""I'm not asking your permission to go with me. My words are clear, and it's an order,"" he continued, his tone threatening.

Is he trying to use his alpha voice on me? Did he also forget that I am not a member of his pack? What a jackass. But whatever.

""Okay, I'll come with you."" He immediately looks at me, slightly surprised by my response. I'll go with him and make sure he suffers. Later, he will regret what he did.

""Alizah? You'll go with him, right?"" Reenah asked me with hope in her voice.

""Yes,"" I could see Reenah was happy.

""All right then, let's go,"" he said coldly, turning around. He's something.

""Hold on,"" I stopped him. He looked at me.

""I have something to get first before I go with you,"" I said solemnly. He only nodded and turned his back on me without saying anything. He's a scumbag. I just rolled my eyes.

I start heading to my cabin to get my belongings. I noticed him standing beside his expensive grey sports car when I went outside. So, he drove himself here.

""What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go now!"" He ordered.

Jerk! Venice angrily murmured. Wendy and I agreed with her, but Reenah did not. She’s jumping with joy right now.

I let out a sigh. If I'm not curious why we still had the bond, I won't go with him into his fucking Mansion, castle, whatever they called it.

I got into the backseat of his car. ""What are you doing?"" He asked me. I confusedly look at him. Isn’t it obvious?

""Sit here in front,"" huh? Do I need to do that? What's the difference? I'm still coming with him, sitting in the backseat or the passenger seat.

We rescued her over 10 years ago. She’s been a great and funny family dog. I love her.

Within the last year though she has had one super bad episode of dementia. She didn’t know where she was, and was hiding in places of the home she had never once went to in all 10 years of living with us. She was pacing and shaking. It was terrible. This lasted about a day. This happened about 3 or so months ago. 

She had less intense episodes of where she would circle our coffee table, shake a bit, and she wouldn’t want to return to the house when we brought her on a walk. She would want to keep walking away, and we’d have to carry her home.

The bad episode and the less intense episodes haven’t happened in awhile though. A few months it’s been.

But she permanently has lost bladder control, she needs to go out every 2-3 hours. She has forgotten some commands. She barks much more often than she used to. 

We decided that we want to put her down before it gets bad again. But I’m afraid we’re doing it TOO soon. What if she’ll be okay for a few more months?

Another factor is that the family is genuinely exhausted of bringing her out every few hours. She has ruined our carpet from her accidents. We tried using diapers to prevent some accidents but they aren’t fool proof. But that feels like a selfish factor😟

I was so on board with it just a day ago, I was ready. She had an amazing 10 years with us, and I want to put her down while she is happy. But she isn’t physically disabled, she walks and lays just fine. She is mentally more here than she has been in awhile. Shes been as close to normal as she’ll get the last few months. 

I’m so confused and scared and guilty. I love her, I want what’s best for her, but it hurts. I feel like I’m doing something unforgiveable and selfish. I don’t know what to do now

We’d be bringing a happy-seeming and physically capable dog to the death table, but at the same time she could plummet at any moment mentally, but what if she’ll doesn’t? I don’t know

Broadcast Transcript — Kyle Domelicker, Voice of the Static | Commander, Star Truth II
Location: Wherever the signal isn’t being buried

Truth seekers — sit down, strap in, hold onto your synth-coffee. This one’s big. Bigger than the usual wreckage-and-rumor feed you get from the owned channels.

The Aurelians have arrived in the Settled Systems, and the Gal’Nuge is the first Vision-Class cruiser we’ve seen here in human space since before humans were good at leaving the planet. Not a typo. Before.

I got time with the Gal’Nuge’s captain — Captain Ty’Nak — who, full disclosure, is very charismatic, very polite, and very, very alien. If you get past the pink skin and the voice that sounds like it’s singing a lullaby while filing a lawsuit, they look disturbingly human: broad-shouldered, built like a champion, and with fingernails that extend into four-inch retractable claws. Yes — claws. Retractable claws as diplomatic accoutrement. You don’t see that every Tuesday.

Biology & culture quick brief: Aurelians are tall, long-lived (200–250 Earth years), and they bloom blue under stress — the famous Blue Bloom — which is as much a cultural metaphor as it is a biological tell. Their doctrine is “Peace Through War.” Discipline, restraint, meritocracy — but make no mistake: restraint is expensive and their default answer to a threat is overwhelming force. That’s not scaremongering — that’s a feature of their worldview.

The Gal’Nuge itself is not a parade piece. Armor and weapons stacked in resonant bands; systems that make a single Vision-Class vessel punch like a small fleet. Jump range? Close to 100 light-years on a full cold run. Top transit pace? Comparable to small fighters on short runs. Ty’Nak told me the ship is here to open communications with the UC and the Freestar Rangers — framed in honor, duty, cooperation. Smooth. Diplomatic. Watch the hands when he talks — claws sheathed, always a gesture.

But don’t let courtesy fool you. I caught two field reports that set off every alarm in my skull.

A spacer captain — callsign “Rook” — swore to me he was the sole survivor after his band tried a hit on the Gal’Nuge during its approach:

""We came in hot, railgun blazing. I saw the flash, and then the cutter was just a cloud of debris. The crew? Vapor. The Gal'Nuge didn't slow down. Didn't even twitch a sublight engine. My fighter pilot was screaming into the comms... then silence. And then, gone. There was no battle. This wasn't a fight. It was an execution.""

That’s not a dogfight. That’s a message.

And from a UC captain on a larger escort:

“It passed by us before the radar even had time to blink. One moment empty space, the next a hulking silhouette drifting off our starboard side. My crew was in shambles. I felt small. We recalibrated our entire watch and systems after that. If I have to be blunt — it scared us.”

High praise from men in armor: worry about the ones who make the veterans uneasy.

A race that uses “Peace through War” and sends a battleship with no fear of being outnumbered, we should be concerned about. 

Aurelian politics: High Command rotates between interventionists, isolationists, and pragmatists. Clans still play political roles, but battlefield merit is the key to rank. Their rites — the First Foray for youth, the claw-etching ceremonies — aren’t quaint. They’re how a people reinforce cohesion and power. When a culture’s founding myth is a century of war ended by a warlord who blunted his claws and demanded restraint through strength, that tells you how they justify using overwhelming force as the cost of peace.

So what am I saying? The Aurelians check troubling boxes: heavy armament masquerading as “defense”; a doctrine that prizes force; ancient ties to places we haven’t charted (their ruins predate our maps); and a diplomatic parade that includes a Harbor-class heavy on the schedule. Don’t mistake the velvet for lack of teeth. They bring answers. They bring a doctrine. They bring a choice.

Final note from your man on the static: I didn’t need the Gal’Nuge to confirm my hunch that other life is out there — I’ve been sniffing that trail for cycles. But friendly? Friendly is a small word for a giant with claws and a policy manual that says might makes calm. Watch their meetings, track who signs what tech transfer, and keep the scanners warm.

If you want me chasing down what comes next — the Ta’Nug science vessel or that Harbor-class dreadnought — keep the Star Truth II in the void. Fuel the signal. Repair the scanners. Donate to GalBank_Truth_Fund.

The next morning I wake up to my wife screaming. She has a note in her hands. It says, ""Welcome to our new home, I am looking forward to our time here."" I call the police, after searching every closet in the house. The police find nothing. I am up late night 2, watching over my wife until I eventually doze off. We wake up and everything is fine, no notes. We walk into the kitchen for coffee, where I see a note on the table saying, ""I am borrowing your steak knives, and if you call the police again there will be consequences.""

I swing by the station to tell the sheriff how serious it has become. He tells me there is nothing they can do. I storm out of the station feeling irritated by their casualness towards the situation, and go straight to buy a gun and security cameras from the store. My wife begs me to leave, but I tell her I will not let a stranger chase us out of our own home. I sit on the couch with my gun in my hand, hoping the stranger shows up so I can take care of the issue.

I wake up the next morning to a quiet home. I don't remember dozing off but am glad to not be waking up to the sound of my wife screaming. I go to our room, only to find it empty. I try calling her but her phones in the room on the bed side table. I immediately call the cops, who arrive surprisingly quick as I prepare to check the cameras.

2 officers arrive and start looking for signs of a break in. I watch last night's footage but there is nothing for the first few hours. At around 2 am, the camera leads into our home and then our room before going black. The footage resumes at 3:34 am, showing my wife tied up in a ditch and crying hysterically at the camera as dirt is scooped onto her.

I am about to go tell the officers outside but freeze in my chair. The stranger quickly slits her throat and I look away in anguish as blood spills out of her. The camera then turns around revealing the stranger and his maniacal smile. I lock eyes with the stranger in the video, and cannot believe what I see. The man is me. I run to go puke.

The officers eventually leave to go assemble their search team. I don't bother to stop them, my focus is on the stranger.I pull out my gun and look at the stranger in the mirror. The maniacal smile from the video appears on my face again as I lift it to my head and pull the trigger.",5,1758338615.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Let's meander through a bookstore,"Calling fellow introverts. People who enjoy company and companionship, but are drained after new social interactions. Let's skip the small talk, and just sit there enjoying each other's company. We’ll pick out a book for each other, hopefully something we wouldn’t have chosen on our own. 

We'll chat a little bit here on Reddit to get a feel for each other, and when we're ready we can trade photos. The next step will be a short video call to verify (safety first!). If we decide to go on the date, we’ll map out where we will go so we both know what to expect. 

We’ll start at a bookstore, taking our time as we peruse the spines lining the shelves. They all seem to be vying for our attention, don’t they? We’ll read author bios and front covers, waiting for just the right selection. After we’ve made our choices, we head out for a short walk and a coffee, and make our way to the park where we can talk over a bottle of wine (or I will just read to you if you’re into that). At the end we’ll part ways, hopefully having planned our second date. 

Before you respond, here are some things about me:

* I'm 5'7"", shaved head, piercings, many tattoos, dad bod. 
* I'm quiet and introverted but I think still good conversation.
* My interests include chess, hiking, music, art, working out, cooking and just generally enjoying food, video games, anime, and volunteering.
* I'm non-monogamous with a lovely nesting partner, we are somewhere between garden party and parallel. 
* My age range is 25-40, with a bit of flexibility if you really think we'll get along.

If this appeals at all to you, please get in touch and tell me a bit about yourself! Most importantly, tell me whether you are a bookworm or book dragon. Please be comfortable with exchanging photos and moving off of Reddit to chat.

Location: Wherever the signal isn’t being buried

Truth seekers — sit down, strap in, hold onto your synth-coffee. This one’s big. Bigger than the usual wreckage-and-rumor feed you get from the owned channels.

The Aurelians have arrived in the Settled Systems, and the Gal’Nuge is the first Vision-Class cruiser we’ve seen here in human space since before humans were good at leaving the planet. Not a typo. Before.

I got time with the Gal’Nuge’s captain — Captain Ty’Nak — who, full disclosure, is very charismatic, very polite, and very, very alien. If you get past the pink skin and the voice that sounds like it’s singing a lullaby while filing a lawsuit, they look disturbingly human: broad-shouldered, built like a champion, and with fingernails that extend into four-inch retractable claws. Yes — claws. Retractable claws as diplomatic accoutrement. You don’t see that every Tuesday.

Biology & culture quick brief: Aurelians are tall, long-lived (200–250 Earth years), and they bloom blue under stress — the famous Blue Bloom — which is as much a cultural metaphor as it is a biological tell. Their doctrine is “Peace Through War.” Discipline, restraint, meritocracy — but make no mistake: restraint is expensive and their default answer to a threat is overwhelming force. That’s not scaremongering — that’s a feature of their worldview.

The Gal’Nuge itself is not a parade piece. Armor and weapons stacked in resonant bands; systems that make a single Vision-Class vessel punch like a small fleet. Jump range? Close to 100 light-years on a full cold run. Top transit pace? Comparable to small fighters on short runs. Ty’Nak told me the ship is here to open communications with the UC and the Freestar Rangers — framed in honor, duty, cooperation. Smooth. Diplomatic. Watch the hands when he talks — claws sheathed, always a gesture.

But don’t let courtesy fool you. I caught two field reports that set off every alarm in my skull.

A spacer captain — callsign “Rook” — swore to me he was the sole survivor after his band tried a hit on the Gal’Nuge during its approach:

""We came in hot, railgun blazing. I saw the flash, and then the cutter was just a cloud of debris. The crew? Vapor. The Gal'Nuge didn't slow down. Didn't even twitch a sublight engine. My fighter pilot was screaming into the comms... then silence. And then, gone. There was no battle. This wasn't a fight. It was an execution.""

That’s not a dogfight. That’s a message.

And from a UC captain on a larger escort:

“It passed by us before the radar even had time to blink. One moment empty space, the next a hulking silhouette drifting off our starboard side. My crew was in shambles. I felt small. We recalibrated our entire watch and systems after that. If I have to be blunt — it scared us.”

High praise from men in armor: worry about the ones who make the veterans uneasy.

A race that uses “Peace through War” and sends a battleship with no fear of being outnumbered, we should be concerned about. 

Aurelian politics: High Command rotates between interventionists, isolationists, and pragmatists. Clans still play political roles, but battlefield merit is the key to rank. Their rites — the First Foray for youth, the claw-etching ceremonies — aren’t quaint. They’re how a people reinforce cohesion and power. When a culture’s founding myth is a century of war ended by a warlord who blunted his claws and demanded restraint through strength, that tells you how they justify using overwhelming force as the cost of peace.

So what am I saying? The Aurelians check troubling boxes: heavy armament masquerading as “defense”; a doctrine that prizes force; ancient ties to places we haven’t charted (their ruins predate our maps); and a diplomatic parade that includes a Harbor-class heavy on the schedule. Don’t mistake the velvet for lack of teeth. They bring answers. They bring a doctrine. They bring a choice.

Final note from your man on the static: I didn’t need the Gal’Nuge to confirm my hunch that other life is out there — I’ve been sniffing that trail for cycles. But friendly? Friendly is a small word for a giant with claws and a policy manual that says might makes calm. Watch their meetings, track who signs what tech transfer, and keep the scanners warm.

If you want me chasing down what comes next — the Ta’Nug science vessel or that Harbor-class dreadnought — keep the Star Truth II in the void. Fuel the signal. Repair the scanners. Donate to GalBank_Truth_Fund.

Stay loud. Stay skeptical. Stay curious.

I wanted to share my notes on Greek cases and how they work.  
  
Yes, I know vocative is not here yet, I don't really understand it that well.  
  
Please do correct me if there is something wrong.

Also, please pardon if my English isn't the best at times, it's not my first language.

I hope this can help anyone, even if it's just a little bit.

\------- Greek Cases (By Theo :3) -------

Grammatical cases in Greek (and in every language that has them), are used to explicitly say what's the role of each part of the sentence.

# Nominative

Nominative case marks the *subject* of the sentence. Answers the questions: About who (or what) is it talking about? Who (or what) did it?

It is marked by prepositioning the article corresponding with the subjects (GRAMMATICAL) gender... IF, the subject is an object/person(proper name). But if it's a pronoun (e.g., αυτός) or a verb (whose tell the pronoun implicitly) like πίνω, it's not marked explicitly.

\## Examples:

Πίνω νερό

Πίνω: (I) drink -> subject

NOTE: No, Πίνω is ***NOT*** the subject, Πίνω is a *verb*, only nouns, proper names or pronouns can be subjects. Just like I mentioned earlier, this verb has the pronoun εγώ (yo) embedded in the -ω ending. Which means that the subject is actually εγώ, not Πίνω.

Πίνω το νερό του Γιάννη

same as before, Πίνω = I drink (εγώ is the subject)

Η Σκάρλετ πίνει τον καφέ

Η Σκάρλετ -> subject. (Who is drinking the coffee? -> Scarlet)

# Genitive

Genitive case is used to mark **property**. It's marked by con μου, σου, του, της, μας, σας, τους.

# Example:

Πίνω το νερό *του* ***Γιάννη***

I drink John's water

Πίνω: Εγώ is the subject (nominative)

το νερό: direct object (accusative)

του Γιάννη: possessive complement: genitive

# Accusative

Accusative case is used to mark the direct object. Answers the question: To whom (or what) was it done? It is marked by:

* τον (masculine singular),
* την (feminine singular),
* το (neuter singular),
* τους (masculine plural),
* τις (feminine plural),
* τα (neuter plural).

# Brief expansion

There are some prepositions that demand accusative:

* στην/στο/στη: it's not exactly these, rather σε, which is ALWAYS contracted (you don't say **σε** την, you say **σ**την)
* Μένω στην Αθήνα (I live in Athens)
* Μένω: I live. Εγώ is the subject, in nominative.
* στην Αθήνα: in (the) Athens. Since στην is a contraction of σε + την and σε demands accusative, this part is marked as accusative.
* για:
* Είναι για έναν φίλο (It is for a friend)
* έναν φίλο: expression of purpose. It is *for* a friend, accusative.
* Είναι: implicit ""it"" subject, nominative
* μέχρι
* Μέχρι τις δέκα (until (""the"") ten)
* Μέχρι demands accusative. Since it's at the very beginning of the sentence, the whole sentence is in accusative.

# Examples

Let's look at the previous examples once again:

Πίνω **το νερό** του Γιάννη

I drink John's water

Πίνω: subject (nominative)

In this case, Πίνω has εγώ (yo) implicit in the -ω termination, meaning that the subject is εγώ, not Πίνω.

το νερό: direct object (accusative):

In this case το νερό is the direct object since it is what is being affected by a previous action (Πίνω)

του Γιάννη: possessive complement: genitive

Του Γιάννη is in the genitive case since it marks that the water belongs to John (Γιάννη)

Η Σκάρλετ πίνει **τον καφέ**

Η Σκάρλετ: Subject, nominative.

τον καφέ: direct object, accusative

In this case, Η Σκάρλετ is the subject exactly because of the same reason in the last example: she is the one drinking the coffee (doing the main action),

while τον καφέ is in accusative since it's being affected by the last action",3,1758338052.0,GREEK,1,1.0,False

1nlndj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nlndj5/5_months_postpartum_and_cannot_stand_my_in_laws/,5 months postpartum and cannot stand my in laws.,"For context: 30 F married to 35M. Married for almost 3 years with a 5 month old. Mother in law lives (75 F) with us. Highly superstitious (cannot see the difference between delusion and devotion). 

Current situation: On multiple occasions I have found my MIL mixing weird powder-like substances in our food/water. In her defence, she believes these things and wants to “help us” lead better lives; for instance, my partner is a social drinker, consumes a beer or two every fortnight or so, as per her faith, that’s a sin and it must be corrected and some random powder will make my partner stop drinking. (do you get how absurd it gets?). 

Anyway, as soon as I found out that I conceived, I stopped consuming food/water at home (to the extent that if I’m not cooking the meal, I’m not eating it). Thank god that my parents live not so far from us, and they truly stepped up and took over my food and nutrition needs. My quarrels with my husband increased significantly, in that, I expected him to step up and take care of the situation at home but, much to my dismay, he didn’t. 

Now, I’ve been at home for the last 20 weeks or so, on maternity leave. Since the birth of my daughter, I’ve tried setting up rules and principles for my daughter that I’m trying my best we follow. I believe in research and reading up on things (important because this will come back later).  First, I was given way too much grief for not allowing people to kiss her or touch her (unless they washed their hands). I happily accepted that for my daughter’s Wellbeing, I’ll be the villain to the rest. The doctor specifically mentioned that we just avoid burning incense sticks in the house atleast for the first year, until her lungs fully develop. However, to my annoyance, my mother in law lights them up twice a day and lies about it because she does truly believe that either I’m too dumb to see the smoke, smell or the incense sticks itself or that I will break the rules. Adding to this, where we live mosquitoes are a big problem, but this lady decides to open the doors and windows of our home at 6pm because apparently, that’s when “gods come home and bless the house” <where is the god helps those who help themselves when you need it>. So now, my infant daughter has to fight mosquitoes as well or I have to light up the chemical filled mosquito repellant to protect her. 
Please bear in my mind, her mixing random things in our food and water still continues so I have to fend my food and water too. She gets visibly upset if I chose to eat my meals at my parents, I’ve started doing that, because caring for a five month old and preparing to go back to work in the next few weeks is all what my bandwidth can take. 

Additionally, she has a scissor mouth. So she’s constantly made comments about how I’m parenting my child and proven to me how she did a finer job with her kids. Eg; early on my milk supply was a little low, so I had to top up with formula, which ofcourse meant that I had to boil water and cool it down in a very short while. Sometimes, in this period she would cry her lungs out (total time being 5-7 minutes) while I soothed her and cooled the water down; she would enter the room and start saying what a bad mother I am that my child keeps crying and I’m unable to fulfill her needs. Another very recent example, I signed up for a 3 day conference, in the city which kept me away from my infant for about 6 hours, I obviously left her with my parents, I pumped and ensured she had enough milk for the three days along with managing whatever I could nurse. I pumped while driving, the night before and have about 14 L of milk frozen. Anyway, at the end of day 3, she chimes into some random conversation she wasn’t a part of saying my daughter looks weak and pale and that I’m being a bad mother by leaving her like this. I have such stories from almost everyday my daughter has been born. Ugh. 

My husband claims that he has tried communicating my annoyances to his mother, but apparently, “she’s like this only”. So obviously, our relationship is sinking since I’m having troubles trusting the fact that he can care for us and he’s getting annoyed that I’m expecting him to make some remarkable changes so I can exit survival mode and go back to living. 

Cut to last weekend, where I had 3 severe anxiety attacks, where I found myself finding it difficult to enter the house. I legit took my 5 month old for a 2.5 hour walk and continued walking until my husband got back home from him morning workout. Anyway, with my helplessness, I called up my husband’s much older sister (they’re about 15 years apart). Hoping that maybe she might be able to help me because I’m getting visibly frustrated and annoyed and can see myself snapping very soon. That evening, they (her and her husband) called us over to talk things through, and that dinner was an eye opener. 

During the course of the evening, I was called too sensitive, that I’m being paranoid and that they cannot a 75 year old to change so the 30 year old should be smart enough and adjust to make the marriage work. My husband suggested, if their mother could go live with them for a bit, until things settle at home, and they outright refused claiming that their son is in his senior year of high school and they cannot manage her. < I was left thinking, if their mother isn’t problematic then what difference will her presence make in the boy’s school result????>. I told them that I have to build my boundaries and be firm about them as it’s impacting my mental health significantly, to which they said that I’m. “Over educated” for my own good. Then they go on to say that their 16 year old doesn’t eat almonds so she grinds them up and adds it to his morning cold coffee. Then she has the audacity to ask me, “if tomorrow his partner says I’m mixing things in his food and does drama like I do, what will happen”. And at that point, I’m just dumbstruck, I almost wanted to laugh and go like “what the actual fuck????!”  We are 30 and 35, by mixing almonds also in our food you are taking away our right to make that choice   A concept I don’t think their small town brains can fathom. 

Anyway, am I the asshole for being annoyed with them and just wanting to cut all contact and focus on my daughter ? I’m tired of fighting with my husband, I see his perils and I feel bad that because of all this he’s also constantly stressed. But I’m truly feeling helpless. I wake up irritated and through the day my irritation reduces a bit. But the minute I see my MIL or even hear her walk in the house I get triggered. I’ve started locking ourselves (me and my daughter) in our room. I only step out when I scan the corridor and confirm she’s not outside her room. 

I’m open to suggestions on how to make this work. Long story short, none of my MILs 3 kids (she has an older son too) has had to deal with her when their kids were thins young. The other 2 are unwilling to help us out and invite her to their homes, so we’re sort of STUCK. ",3,1758337989.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False
1nlnddo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlnddo,My Hyderabad Chronicles: Roadside Street Vendors - Convenient but Hygienic?  (5/n),"
Walk through any busy road in Hyderabad and i can spot them: the street food vendors - serving tasty mouth watering breakfasts and lunches!

Morning starts with idlis and dosas steaming away on a cart, served straight onto leaf plates or paper sheets. 

Crowds of people gather around these 4-wheelers to grab a quick breakfast before rushing off.

Hygiene? Hard to say. The oil, the batter, the chutneys, no one really questions where they come from. 

As long as the taste is good, people seem to care a damn. A couple of fluffy idlis for just ₹20 - with unlimited chutneys - and the deal is done.

Come lunch, the game changes. 

You’ll find rice with chicken or mutton curry, sometimes biryani - all under ₹100. A plate of chicken biryani for less than the cost of a coffee at Starbucks!

And I must admit people love it. 

Rather than eating at home, many prefer the spicy, greasy, tasty food from these roadside stalls. 

Why? Probably it’s convenient, it’s cheap and it’s everywhere - outside offices, near bus stops, tucked into colonies, everywhere!

The most likely street food back in the day (3decades ago) was mirchi bajji or idly wala. Now the game changed.

In a city filled with health campaigns, fitness clubs, and diet food brands, the street food culture is thriving stronger than ever.

I surely understand the employment to these vendors. They work really hard to get that food into our plates - waking up as early as 3am, grinding the batter overnight, preparing the chutneys freshly at the early hours and so on! Must admire their dedication for sure!

My question is - would risk hygiene for taste and convenience?

     Hi, my name is seth 25m  from the pnw in the united states. I enjoy art and creating, i largly spend time with my cat and working and i definitely want to find a penpal to help me slow down. I also work in healthcare and over all im also looking to find somthing to do to help me reduce the stress as well. Ideally id like to find a female penpal but a male pen pal around my age is totally alright by me as well. Just a heads up i really only write in cursive and rarely print so sorry if its an inconvenience. 
    Over all im just looking for a friend to talk to in a slower format that makes me really focus on what i have to say and why. Unlike the ability of out modern devices that allow us to spew our thoughts out onto the screen without taking thr time to really think about it. Im also definitely down to find a penpal who is an artist who is looking to trade both write and art over the male as well. And truth be told im pretty much an open book about anything. Life, relationships, my views on various books and movies, art history, archeology, and philosophy are definitely some of my favorite thinks to talk about. I am also a black belt in karate and really enjoy talking about it. 
     I also recently have gotten into fountain pens and inks so dont be suprised if the ink shifts from blue to pink or something along those lines. I am currently studying japanese and speak asl to a near fluent level (although that dosent really translate well over text hahaha) and im excited to be going to japan coming up in October. So dont be suprised if you get a letter from there. 
    To be honest im looking for genuine human connection and to find someone to help my slow down and enjoy the process. I do have adhd and dyslexia so it can definitely be hard for me to focus on things like grammar and spelling at times. But for you i will do my best. My vocabulary is quite extensive but i try and keep things simple over text.
     The dream of sitting at my local coffee shop listening to music as the pain pours outside as i pen you a letter after your last reply. Truly sounds like something that i would deeply enjoy. Since I live in thr pacific north west it tends to get vary boreing during the rainy months and winter and that truly sounds like a super fun way to spend some of my free time.
     I will be honest I deeply look forward to hearing your future correspondence my future friends. Id ideally like to find 1-2 of you to exchange letters with. Please feel free to reach out to me in thr comments or through the dm feature here on reddit. Once we connect i am more than happy to give you other forms to contact me at so we can facilitate the exchange. Over all I am beyond extatic with the prospect of communicating with you going forword. My mail box is a lgbtq+ safe space. While myself am not part of the community I am a strong ally that you can count of for suport if you are a part of that community. 

Tldr: 25m looking for 1-2 penpals. Preferably female or males around my age. I only write in cursive because of my dyslexia and 
Things i enjoy
Travel, books, coffee, reading, my cat, philosophy, martial arts, and art.

Still figuring out how to quickly dial in fresh bags of beans, especially when switching up. Any rules of thumb there greatly appreciated - haven't found much advice on this grinder specifically.

What you're looking at is a Zylann plugin terrain decorated with ""bushes"", ""grass"" and a variety of trees of my own design.  For the last few weeks (it's been \*weeks\*), as I continued fleshing out this environment, I noticed my in-game performance getting worse, and \*worse\*, and WORSE.

Not only that but the \*editor\* was getting increasingly laggy.  Like at the end it was \*comically\* laggy.  (Which I hadn't realized was happening, I just felt like I was going insane.)

Finally the other day I snapped and dropped everything and The Investigation began.  As I brainstormed and learned things, I surveyed my world in-game , looking for any kind of lead.  I actually ended up raising a lot of graphics settings I had dialed down, so that was beneficial... anyways...

It was capsule colliders.  So many of them, interacting with my Zylann terrain - piercing the surface of the terrain mesh \*and\* overlapping the colliders from neighboring bushes in a group.  The collision system was just, constantly, silently, screaming: because of my dozens and dozens of innocent-looking, performance-destroying bushes.

I went down the hierarchy and rooted out each one of these little fuckers and fixed it.  I kid you not, the editor responsiveness was improving in real-time.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Maybe you’ve been told you’re “a strong personality” or “an empath” — but that didn’t answer:

When will I get married?

Why does love keep failing me?

When will my career finally stabilize?

Why do health issues keep returning?

What is my purpose?


This is where Vedic Astrology comes in. It doesn’t just describe you. It times your life events, explains why they happen, and shows how to work with them.


Why clients reach out to me worldwide

For over a decade, I’ve guided people across the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, UAE, Singapore, Italy , France , DibSouth Africa, and India.
Here’s what I help with:

Marriage & Love Life – When will you meet your soulmate? Love or arranged?

Children & Family – When will children arrive? How to overcome delays?

Career & Finances – Job changes, promotions, foreign relocation, sudden losses.

Health & Karma – Vulnerable years, remedies, and karmic lessons.

Birth Time Rectification – For those unsure of their exact birth time.

Family Karma – Hidden dynamics with father, mentors, or authority figures.

Soul Planet Guidance – Discover your strengths and align with your path.

Numerology, Palmistry, Vastu – Extra tools when the chart requires deeper decode

Real talk: what makes Vedic Astrology different?

It pinpoints events to the year, sometimes the month.

It shows karmic patterns from past lives shaping today.

It uses Mahadashas (planetary periods) and Gochars (transits) to map your destiny with precision.

It goes beyond personality traits ... it shows timelines, remedies, and results.


That’s why people who’ve had dozens of Western readings often say:
“This is the first time I finally have clarity.”

My story with skeptics

Three months ago, someone told me:
❝Astrology is nonsense. You’re a fake.❞
I smiled and said:
❝Time reveals what the ego can’t.❞

When Saturn hit their chart, everything changed. They came back in tears, asking for guidance. Today, they tell me,
❝I wish I had listened earlier.❞

Why you should act now

Think of this as a monthly health check-up for your destiny.
You spend on shoes, coffee, dinners but one chart reading can shift how you see your whole life.

📅 I am opening appointment slots for this week and next.

I don’t even care if no one believes me anymore.

My name is Lena. A week ago, there were five of us: me, Dylan, Carmen, Jay, and Alex. We were just bored, drunk college kids looking for a scare—something stupid to break the monotony of life.

So we downloaded this *ritual game* off some dark corner of the internet. I’m not even gonna tell you the name. I wish I never found it. It was supposed to “summon a spirit that answers your questions”—like a Ouija board, but more “authentic.” The rules were specific, cryptic, and obsessive:

* You needed a mirror that had *seen death*.
* Three drops of blood from each participant.
* A sealed room with no lights.
* And you had to chant its name *until it answered*.

We thought it was edgy, a dare. We joked around at first. Dylan bled the most and pretended to faint. Carmen kept laughing. Jay was filming for TikTok. Alex didn’t say much—he just kept staring at the mirror, like he already knew something was wrong.

But when we started chanting, something… changed. The air shifted, like the room had been vacuum-sealed. Sound got *sucked out*. Jay's camera stopped recording and the mirror fogged from the *inside*. Then we saw it.

**A figure, not ours, standing behind us in the reflection.**

It was tall, too tall. Thin. Its face was blurred like someone smeared wet ash over it. It didn’t move. It just *watched*.

We ran. I don’t remember unlocking the door. I don’t remember leaving. One second we were inside the basement, and the next I was vomiting on the grass outside, shaking like I’d been electrocuted.

That night, Dylan texted me:

>

I didn’t reply.

By morning, Dylan was gone. Not just missing—gone. His room looked like it *had never been used*. No clothes. No bed. No posters. Not even dust. His *parents* claimed he died in a car accident *three years ago*. Like he never existed last week.

I checked my phone. Our texts were gone. Our pictures from the party? Blurred. *Faces missing*. The video from Jay’s phone? Corrupted. Black screen with only static, then a single frame at the end: the spirit’s face—right up against the lens.

Next was Carmen. She called me crying, saying her reflection was smiling when she wasn’t. That it moved differently. She said it was learning how to be her. Then the line cut. When I tried calling back, someone answered. It wasn’t her voice.

It said my name in *her* voice, like it was trying it on.

Jay and I tried to leave town. We didn’t even pack. Just bolted. But we never made it past the gas station. Jay went in to grab snacks, and… never came out. I checked. I *saw* him go in. But inside, it was empty. The clerk looked at me like I was insane when I asked if he’d seen someone matching Jay’s description.

I ran to the bathroom, and written in steam on the mirror were the words:

**“Only one left.”**

I’m alone now. Alex is gone too. He disappeared during the night, but not before leaving me a note.

It read:

>

I haven’t slept in two days. I don’t *look* in mirrors anymore. I can feel it watching me from the glass of my laptop, the blank screen of my TV, the reflection in my coffee.

Sometimes, in the corner of my eye, I see a face that isn’t mine staring back.

And every time I blink, it’s closer.

If I disappear after this, remember this:

**It doesn’t want to be summoned.**  
**It wants to** ***replace*** **you.**

And the more people who know its name,  
The easier it can get through.

*I never said the name.*I don’t know how long I have before it finds me again, but I need to get this out.

By morning, Dylan was gone. Not just missing—gone. His room looked like it had never been used. No clothes. No bed. No posters. Not even dust. His parents claimed he died in a car accident three years ago. Like he never existed last week.  
I checked my phone. Our texts were gone. Our pictures from the party? Blurred. Faces missing. The video from Jay’s phone? Corrupted. Black screen with only static, then a single frame at the end: the spirit’s face—right up against the lens.  
Next was Carmen. She called me crying, saying her reflection was smiling when she wasn’t. That it moved differently. She said it was learning how to be her. Then the line cut. When I tried calling back, someone answered. It wasn’t her voice.  
It said my name in her voice, like it was trying it on.  
Jay and I tried to leave town. We didn’t even pack. Just bolted. But we never made it past the gas station. Jay went in to grab snacks, and… never came out. I checked. I saw him go in. But inside, it was empty. The clerk looked at me like I was insane when I asked if he’d seen someone matching Jay’s description.  
I ran to the bathroom, and written in steam on the mirror were the words:  
“Only one left.”  
I’m alone now. Alex is gone too. He disappeared during the night, but not before leaving me a note.  
It read:  
  
  
  
“We didn’t summon it.  
  
It summoned us.”  
  
  
  
I haven’t slept in two days. I don’t look in mirrors anymore. I can feel it watching me from the glass of my laptop, the blank screen of my TV, the reflection in my coffee.  
Sometimes, in the corner of my eye, I see a face that isn’t mine staring back.  
And every time I blink, it’s closer.  
If I disappear after this, remember this:  
It doesn’t want to be summoned.  
  
It wants to replace you.  
And the more people who know its name,  
  
The easier it can get through.

1. **QUIZ > REREAD** – Flashcards, practice Qs, anything. Rereading notes is FAKE PRODUCTIVITY.
2. **SHORT SESSIONS ONLY** – 30–45 mins MAX. Cramming = INSTANT brain melt.
3. **REVIEW BEFORE BED** – 5 min skim → your brain does FREE STUDYING while you sleep.
4. **MOVE YOUR BODY** – Walk, stretch, dance like an idiot. ENERGY ↑ FOCUS ↑.
5. **SCENTS ARE REAL** – Peppermint gum or rosemary oil = memory boost. Idk why but it WORKS.
6. **BREAKS + NAPS** – Pomodoro (25 on, 5 off). And yes, a 15-min nap >>> coffee.
7. **TINY SUGAR BUFF** – Little candy/juice = focus up. Too much = CRASH.

A regular customer noticed more money was removed from his gift card then what was shown on his receipt.

His card was down to 0$ so we reloaded 50$, the balance was then exactly 50$.

He bought a coffee for 3.10$ (after tax) so the balance should have been 46.90$ but the balance was 46.72$. 

The money was loaded onto a Canadian gift card, with Canadian currency and he was charged in Canadian. 

There is nothing on the receipt that shows where the extra 18 cents went. 

I've shown it to my manager and district manager and both werent able to give an answer.

Is there an explanation for this?

I've checked if this happened on other customers gift card transactions and it is happening on some but not all.

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Zotta, Expeditionary Fleet Xeno-Biologist

**Date:** January 29, 2158

I was at my wits end at this point. I’d been chewing my claws from both ends trying to make heads or tails of the genetic samples I’d gotten a couple of days ago and each result only brought with it more questions. The only thing I could say for sure was that whoever these xenos had been they’d done a great deal of tampering with their own genome for technological use. All three samples I had taken, the small creatures, the tree-like ones and the ship itself all shared at least some of the same genetic code. The real question that had continued to eat me up was the connection between the trees and the smaller creatures. Which was the actual sentient?

With little left I could learn from simply pouring over genomic data any longer I finally was forced to call Officer Monahan down to assist me in the task I had been putting off… examining the cadaver we had brought back from the alien vessel. My stomach was already feeling queasy as I recalled the creature’s unique… odor.

For his part Monahan didn’t look any more excited than myself to pull the creature out of the freezer and have the medical drones start scanning it. I had opted to use the drones rather than a more classic autopsy since I dreaded to even think what that creature must smell like on the inside. Thankfully Dr. Trilf had accompanied the bulky human down to the lab, bringing with him three small vials of liquid, passing one to Monahan and myself while keeping the third for himself. The Zurulian popped the cap on his own vial, pouring a small dab out onto one of his paw pads before dabbing it under his nose.

“It’s called peppermint oil.” Doc explained, “One of the human medical professionals finest inventions. Just do as I did. You’re going to need it.” Monahan and myself followed suit, dabbing a bit of the oil under our nostrils. Instantly a potent, almost spicy scent filled my nose, making me cough. It wasn’t unpleasant but it certainly was powerful.

With our sense of smell properly fortified, Monahan finally opened the freezer on the far side of the room, pulling up the black, sealed bag containing the dead xeno. The human quickly brought it over to one of the free desks and laid it out, unzipping the bag as he turned his head away. Thankfully, between the peppermint oil and the freezer the smell of the corpse had been toned down enough to at least make it tolerable.

I twitched my whiskers as I eyed the strange being in the bag once more. It was so vastly different than anything in any of the archives.

“The first mollusk with sentience ever found.” Doc spoke up at last, climbing up onto a nearby stool so he could see on top of the desk, “That will certainly be quite a notch on your resume.” I cocked my head at him, twitching my ears inquisitively. “I read your findings.” He explained, seemingly sensing my question, “The presence of familiar Mantle Secretome gene variants as well as Shell Matrix Proteins is hard evidence to dispute.”

“Thank you Dr. Trilf!” I squeaked, feeling a bit giddy that someone else on the crew had read and apparently appreciated my logged report.

“Think nothing of it dear.” The Zurulian said, waving his ears in a dismissive gesture, “Now what say we have the drones begin a full medical scan? I’m most interested to see what our odiferous friend’s internals look like.” I flicked my tail in the affirmative, glancing over to the pair of shiny metal orbs that had been floating expectantly in the corner. They lacked most of the manipulator parts that the maintenance drones had, but made up for it in the sheer number of scans they could perform as well as the amount of first aid supplies they carried in their side compartments.

“Begin full spectrum medical analysis on the target.” I ordered, gesturing my head towards the corpse. The drones noiselessly floated over, turning the array of lenses on their front side towards the body. There was no visual indication of what the two devices were doing, since most of the scans they ran operated well outside the visual range of most living things, but it was obvious by their slow movement back and forth they were working.

Within a few brief moments we had our results, indicated by a small ping on my holopad. I quickly picked it off my belt and opened the result notification. The drones had scanned for several different things simultaneously and, although the chemical detection scans were interesting enough in themselves it was the xray and MRI scans that caught my immediate attention. I quickly made a couple of taps on my pad to send the resulting images to the holoprojector in the corner of the room.

A three dimensional rendering of the results came shining out of the projector for the group to see. The creature was… remarkably simple considering its fairly large genetic code. A few things were immediately obvious. Firstly was its digestive system. It appeared to be nothing but a straight tube running from the top of its stalk down to the bottom where the legs intersected. No stomach or similar organ in sight. Aside from that was a lack of any visible form of respiratory exchange. No detectable lung or gill like structures. Something else noticeably missing were any sort of internal skeletal structure. That last one though hadn’t been entirely unexpected. Ever since I had made the determination that these xenos were some sort of mollusk analog I had suspected it would be the case. Their physical structure was mostly maintained by the loosely jointed, shell-like structures on their outside. I could see that they possessed at least rudimentary vision organs that seemed to be located in small, eye-like structures around the top part of their stalk, giving the creatures no less than a dozen eyes. Although judging by their size and complexity it was doubtful they had possessed very good vision.

Doc was the first one to notice the most remarkable thing of all though.

“What an unusual brain structure.” The Zurulian remarked, leaning in further and squinting his eyes at the holographic projection, “While it’s impossible to tell without a living one to do some comparative neural analysis on… I’d venture a guess that it has very little in the way of a pre-frontal cortex.”

“And this section over here looks similar to an olfactory cortex but… it’s huge.” I noted with a point of my own, “But I don’t even see a respiratory system on any of these scans.”

“It isn’t entirely necessary to be able to breathe in order to have something akin to a sense of smell.” Doc suggested, “In fact a large part of the Kolshian’s sense of smell was entirely derived from chemo receptors on their skin.” I paused to consider that. It was certainly conceivable although I still wondered how these creatures had survived without any sort of gas exchange system.

“Lord save me.” Monahan sighed, reaching into a pocket on the dusty brown jacket he was wearing and pulling out a small metal flask, “I have no idea what you lot are saying.” He finished, twisting the cap off of his container and taking a deep swig from it. I was tempted for a moment to ask him if it might be coffee when the holoprojection seemed to flash, the flickering image getting my attention and pulling me back to it.

The projection quickly faded away and was instead replaced by a series of jumbled characters. As I looked at it the visual portion of the translator implant seemed to freak out, twisting and jumbling possible translations for a moment. The problem was fairly evident. Whatever was written there was in a mixture of alphabets. I could recognize a couple of human letters from their western hemisphere languages. There was also two Dossur letters and a couple of instances of the Vinlil’s flowing script.

After a moment of work the translator app finally seemed to settle on a translation of whatever this bizarre anomaly was.

“So proud. Grown. Worthy. Beautiful. Worthy.”

“What the hell’s going on with the projector?” Monahan asked, cocking his head at it, “What’s that nonsense its’ spewing out?”

“Not sure.” Doc grumbled, reaching for his own holopad, “I’ll send a quick message to Gothlir on the ship’s message board to look into… oh.” The old Zurulian paused, prompting Monahan and myself to look over his shoulder at his holopad. The ship’s message board (which we usually reserved for simply filing maintenance requests) was already full. It seemed every single crewmate, save for the captain who was already on the bridge with the Gojid, had filed something within the last few seconds.

“Oh joy.” Officer Monahan grunted, stowing his small metal container back in his pocket, “Wonder what’s up? Think the maintenance drones are spying on Leo and Vakks again?” Doc offered an uncharacteristic chuckle at that. I was about to ask what they were talking about when a sudden message came out over each of our holopads.

“This is Captain Reynolds. Requesting all crew members to assemble on the bridge.”

I sighed, dropping the subject before scampering myself across the table and leaping up onto Monahan. The Terran just laughed as my tiny claws bit into his synthetic pelt and I pulled myself up onto his shoulder.

“You think they found the black box on that old Federation ship?” I squeaked hopefully, although in my head I was more than certain this was probably about the string of odd maintenance requests.

One short elevator ride later and I would get my answer which, to my equal delight and dismay was both! The rest of the crew had seemed to beat us there. Leo and Vakks were taking their usual seat in the back of the available crew positions with Mok’lil carefully positioning herself as far to away as possible. Gothlir was busy rushing his bulky frame back and forth between several machines while occasionally stopping to frantically tap out something on his holopad.

“Before anyone says anything I KNOW about the spehing system errors.” The Gojid cursed, “I’m worried there was a payload in the black box we found on the Fed wreck. We remote downloaded the data and this drahk started.”

“Language while on the bridge ensign.” Captain Reynolds growled, her face stuck in that stern, unreadable form that I had seen her take many times by now, “Regardless the black box is over a century old. Even if it’s causing some bugs its still outdated Federation garbage. Gothlir should be able to get everything smoothed out shortly and we can view the contents.”

“Never heard of the Feds putting malware or something in black boxes.” Vakks grumbled skeptically from the back, “I still think this is related to the drones the last night.”

“And would you care to elaborate onto your reasoning Ensign Vakks?” Reynolds asked, turning her attention to the Skalgan.

“Because I got a fucking notification on my drahking holopad that was just a picture of me and… well it was a picture from the drone that was malfunctioning!” She blurted back, although after her slight pause I noticed a slight orange tinge sneak into her cheeks and ears. It still amused me how much the hot tempered Skalgan used human curses. I imagine she must have gotten them off Leo. I made a note to get her to tell me what she was talking about with the drones though. I hadn’t heard anyone else mention that yet.

As Monohan took a seat he looked over at her with a strange “half smile” gesture that I believed was meant to look… smug perhaps?

“Anyone else in that picture Cottonball?” He asked with a laugh, even earning a quiet chuckle from the good Dr. Trilf who crawled his way up into the seat beside us.

“Cottonball?” I repeated, the translator implant giving the me description of a plant based swabbing instrument typically used by Terrans for first aid.

“Yeah.” Monahan explained, gently reaching up and rubbing one of his massive, apposable thumbs across my head in an affectionate manner, “I used to call her that as a kid. You shoulda seen her! So much wool that she looked like…” He was cut off as Captain Reynolds loudly (and pointedly) cleared her throat.

“OFFICER MONAHAN.” The Captain spoke, her voice loud and demanding, “I would ask you to behave yourself in a professional manner during a clearly pressing security matter.”

“Of course Cap’n.” He responded, though that half grin gesture never seemed to leave his face. Vakks for her part hadn’t spoken back up, only appearing to grow even more orange tinted at the security officer’s words.

“I g…got a… a p… poem.” Mok’lil spoke up, “I…. it was quite bi… bizarre.”

“What sort of poem?” The Captain asked, seeming to take the Krokotl’s account just as importantly as the rest. Though if I thought about it getting a poem seemed like an awful silly thing to report a potential bug on the ship message board.

“M… my room’s tel… tel… television. It s… started scroll… scrolling th… this over and over al… along with my holopad!” She squawked, pulling out her own datapad and hurrying over to pass it to the Captain. I let out a silent sigh of relief at that. Mok’lil was a nice enough lady when she wasn’t slipping some underhanded predator comment at you but… I think I would have chewed my own tail off if I had to listen to her stutter out a whole poem.

Reynolds looked down at the holopad, slowly darting those binocular eyes back and forth across the screen as she read the full transcript. “Your children are not your children… they are the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself…” She muttered, barely loud enough for my translator to pick up on it. Her eyes narrowed as she stared at the holopad, seemingly lost in thought. “I… I know this.” She said at last, that cold, collected look on her face passing for just a moment. In t=its stead I saw something new. Something I hadn’t seen from her before. A brief moment of… sadness? No. It was more than that… heartbreak. As quickly as it appeared though it passed and the UN officer in her regained her composure.

“Thank you for your input Dr. Moklil.” She continued, handing the holopad back to the Krokotl researcher, “I’m sure we will have all of this figured out shortly.” She turned her binocular gaze back onto the frantically scurrying Gojid. Seemingly sensing her eyes upon him he turned back up towards her.

“Well the AI finished decoding the black box contents but as for the ship errors it’s still working on that.” Gothlir explained, “Want me to pull up the contents while we wait?”

“Please.” The Captain answered, flicking her chair about to face the room’s holoprojector. A moment later the holographic display shimmered to life, the image of a small, 3 man crew of Kolshians appearing on the three-dimensional image.

 

**\*Command log, \[Standardized Human Date: \*\*\*\* 1928\]\***   

The screen showed a crew of five Kolshians, each seated at a command terminal as the one the we would have to assume is the captain looked straight ahead at the camera. It wasn’t a memory transcript but those weren’t as common back then. The assumed captain stared straight ahead at the camera lens.

“This is captain Noljiz of Federation scout #738. We have arrived in the system from which the massive energy signature originated. What we’ve found is…” He turns in his swiveling chair, staring out the forward viewport of the ship he was in, clearly showing a desolate field of debris.

“Destruction. A level of destruction that civilized prey society has never seen. We can only assume that a predatory species is responsible for this.” The Kolshian twirled his tentacles in front of his chest. I didn’t recognize the meaning of that but from the way his large, bulbous eyes darted about I made the assumption that it was a nervous gesture. “Our current scans of the system show no apparent life signs. No potential planets and…”

A voice from somewhere out of frame pipe in, “We’ve charted a basic debris free rout Sir. But… We see several vessels sitting around the secondary planet.” The figure of Captain Nolkiz turned around, eyeing the figure off screen with a sense of alarm.

“Do we have a read on their vectors?” He asked anxiously, to which one of the other two Kolshians who were in view of the recording turned around.

“Most of them are moving off in the opposite direction."" The secondary crew member announced, “Although we do see one vessel headed towards us.”

“Make preparations to initiate FTL!” The captain exclaimed, his frantic tentacle movements becoming more and more agitated, “We need to get out of here and notify the Commonwealth!” As he gave the order though the screen seemed to dim, signaling the loss of seemingly all lighting on the bridge of the scout vessel, save for a single glowing communication monitor that could be seen nearby.

“Forgive us.” Came a cold, chilling voice that was clearly not speaking in Kolshian (Though what language it was in was hard to say) “But we are so few left. We can’t let you tell the rest of your cult.”

“Who… whoever this is…” The captain’s voice stammered out, the vague outline of his form being visible in the soft green glow of the only lit monitor, “I am Captain Noljiz of the Galactic Federation, We did not come seeking conflict…”

“You lie.” The strange, cold voice cut him off, “But it is only because you do not know better. Even now, monstrous as the things your people have done may be… we still love you. One day we will come back when we have prepared… we will save your people Captain. We will save those you have hurt and those you yet wish to hurt. I only wish you could have been there for that day… Forgive me.” A moment later the screen lit up with a bright light as the sound of Kolshian’s screaming echoed before fading into static….

 

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Desmond Washington, Ambassadorial Escort

**Date:** January 30, 2158

 

The trip back was even worse than the trip there. Sure the trip there had been nerve wracking in the sense that everyone was expecting the worst but… the trip back? The trip back was everyone KNOWING the worst. I didn’t even know how to wrap my mind around it. These tin-cans decide to show up out of nowhere and just announce their gonna suck out everyone’s brains and put us into machines? Or was that even the case? From the way the alien robot had been talking he (if that thing could even be said to have a gender) seemed to not even be sure if he actually was a person in a metal body or just a copy of a person in a metal body?!?!

“Hey mate.” Came Ruta’s voice as the Yotul elbowed me, “Come out of it. Spiraling isn’t gonna help.” The diminutive marsupial gave a wag of her tail, a gesture I think was meant to be encouraging, “If humans can come straight out the burrow and crush a government that’s ruled for over a thousand years you can take a bunch of rusty metal heads that just showed up right?”

I smiled, appreciating my friend’s attempt to pull me back together, even if she sounded more uncertain about things than I felt.

“Plus I need someone sane to talk to.” She continued, her voice a whisper now, “Sergeant Basu is having a panic attack because they won’t let him call his wife and Walters is…” She paused, looking over to where Cassius had seated himself next the Vinlil Captain, Hult. The two seemed to be sitting quite close, their faces next to one another so that they could talk without being overheard.

“Being Walters.” I finished with a disbelieving groan. How could he possibly think about flirting with some alien he just met at a time like this? I swore that if these Directorate assholes conquered us tomorrow Walters’ would still worry more about getting laid than the fate of his own life. I looked around the cabin, finding most of the other occupants in an equal state of silent agitation. At least on they way here our holopads had been working and we could watch videos or make calls. On the return trip the ship had forcibly disabled any long range communication. As adept as our new enemies were at cyber warfare and as willing as they were to use it, any form of off-ship communication was deemed too dangerous to risk.

I could feel the anxiety and dread starting to form tight knots in my stomach, making me feel physically ill from the stress. The sight of the previously optimistic ambassador Reyneros sitting dejectedly in a corner, silently staring at the metal floor of the transport only made it worse. “R… Ruta…” I panted, putting a hand up to my lips as I felt my mouth begin to fill with saliva, “I think I’m gonna be sick…”

“Go!” The Yotul exclaimed, pushing me towards one of the two available restrooms on the ship, “Go before you throw up!” She insisted.

I rushed over to the latrine, throwing open the door and rushing inside as I felt the bile begin to rise in my throat. In a flash I slammed the door shut and leaned over the toilet as I lost it. I gagged loudly as hot, acrid stomach acid began to pour out. I silently wished I had eaten more today as my stomach quickly emptied itself and yet I continued to heave, my throat convulsing as nothing came up. After a moment the wave of sickness seemed to pass and I sat there, holding onto the toilet and sitting on my knees trying to catch my breath. Then, suddenly, the message alert on my holopad went off.

I reached down, pulling the pad off my belt in confusion. This ship’s signal jammers should have prevented any incoming or outgoing messages, and yet I could see a video chat invitation waiting on my holopad. More confused than ever as it registered as “unknown caller” I simply pressed the answer button out of curiosity. I quickly regretted it.

As the video feed loaded I found myself facing that horrific, hulking pile of metal and sugarcoated threats that we had left at the rendezvous point the day before. Well at least I assumed it was the same one. I really had no way of knowing. It certainly looked just like it though.

“Hello the Desmond.” Came a voice over the call, this one certainly different from the envoy we had encountered on the deserted planetoid. The other had come across the translator with an almost British sounding cadence and masculine in tone. This one sounded more like… a girl. A young girl.

“Who… who is this?” I asked, wiping the drool and slime from my chin with the back of one of my sleeves.

“I am the Seeker.” She (at least I was going to assume it was she. Hell could you even apply a sex to a machine?) “I… I wanted to talk with you.”

“That’s not really a name. Can’t you at least tell me your name if you’re gonna hack into my holopad?” I pressed. There was a moment of silence from the other end.

“I do not understand. You asked what I am called? I am called the Seeker. You are called the Desmond. Is this not correct?”

It’s a fucking weird naming convention but I think I get what she’s saying now. “Ok. Yeah. Close enough. Why are you messaging ME?” I pressed, leaning back away from the vomit filled toilet and leaning against the restroom’s wall, “You know I’m not the diplomat right? I can go get her if you…”

“No.” The Seeker said quickly, “It is you I wish to talk to. I saw the video supplied by The Envoy. He showed all of us your reaction. That is what I am curious about the Desmond. Why… why do you not want our gifts?” I felt a sense of confusion at that question… or more accurately at the tone in which she asked it. She sounded absolutely flabbergasted that someone wouldn’t just throw themselves at the opportunity.

“Why?” I repeated incredulously, “You’re threatening to use force if I and my whole species… hell the whole damned GALAXY don’t just agree to have our brains uploaded to a computer and die?” The strange, tentacled mass of metal on the video projection shifted, its tentacled eye/hand structures twisting in a way I could only interpret as a gesture of awkwardness.

“The Directorate feels it is best.” She said at last, her words coming slowly and carefully, as though she were being mindful of saying something she might regret, “The Directorate feels that it is the only way to be certain you are safe.”

“Safe from what?!” I growled, my voice rising a bit more than I had intended as the same sense of enraged disbelief that I had felt back at the meeting with the envoy overflowed inside me, “Cause the only thing I see threatening us right now is you!” I scowled down at the screen, watching the small, holographic projection of the thing’s mechanical limbs pull back, as if trying to get away from me. I was about to really lay into this “The Seeker” when a loud slam came on the bathroom door, making me shoot my gaze over to the closed entrance.

“Hey! You ok in there bud?” Came Ruta’s voice, clearly having grown concerned when she heard me raise my voice.

“Yeah.” I shot back quickly, “Sorry! Be out in just a second!” I turned back towards the holopad, prepared to cut the conversation short, only to find that my mysterious caller had already closed the line. All that now appeared on my holopad was the familiar “Services Currently Unavailable.” Notice.

Thinking about my own childhood and growing up….comparing some things…my mother who was born with CP (Cerebral Palsy)…that limited her walking and holding certain things like a cup of hot coffee for her own safety or a pot of pasta in hot water that had to be drained….but she would find a way to be able to live a normal life without the help of others….it was on extremely rare occasions there was anyone there to help her but I ALWAYS remember a hot homemade breakfast every morning before school…a homemade lunch packed to bring to school…an ironed and cleaned uniform (went to catholic school 12 years) every day…she would walk me to school every day and would come back and pick me up when school was let out including the winter with snow and ice on the ground…we had a homemade rounded dinner every night but Friday we always had pizza…I never ate junk food…she would walk to the supermarket…shop…walk back home and bring all the groceries in and put it all away….she always helped me with homework and was there for after school activities after homework I was allowed to watch a movie or tv show then in the bath I went then into a clean bed that she would change and clean the bedding once a week…laundry was done every day…she taught me to respect others…I wasn’t what #2 and #3 are….i respected my parents and never talked back….i was ahead for my age…way passed my milestones growing up…after my clothes were cleaned they were either hung up or put in the dresser….she swept,vacuumed and mopped the floor every day….you could eat off her floors….i NEVER had black feet….she went food shopping once a week….her dining room table and kitchen table were always clean…her whole house was spotless…dusted…windows washed…she washed all the dirty dishes that were used that day at night before bed…there was no dishwasher…nothing was left in the sink overnight…she never had a maid or housekeeper….she managed a 3 floor home….she did everything herself unless it was something she felt it wasn’t safe to do then my father would do it…my father worked all day and lots of time did overtime…my mom did it ALL with no complaints and always a smile on her face until she died…

Barge should know what it’s like to be disabled….its amazing the comparison…BARGE is a pig…she lives in a pigsty….she has unruly children….children that don’t bath everyday…eat junk constantly….wrinkled clothes to go to school….i could go on and on….

I don’t want to brag but I’m pretty lucky that my mom was able to do everything she did having CP and Barge does nothing compared to her…

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.

If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.

“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.

“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.

“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.

“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.

“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother’s voice above the others.

“If he doesn’t find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.” Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

“I will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don’t have a say in it, Mother.” I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

“What is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?” I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

“Shadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.” Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

“I didn’t know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?” I ask the question that is probably running through everyone’s mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn’t strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

“None of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.” Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn’t his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

“Why don’t you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?” My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

“Sorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.” Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

“We did that on purpose, Daxton.” She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn’t afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack’s Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn’t stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don’t seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

“You seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don’t I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?” Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius’ p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn’t until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don’t understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don’t respond and I don’t have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother’s relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn’t given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston’s bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack’s downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn’t think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta’s Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

“Darius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta’s Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.” Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden’s eyes.

“Then she isn’t suited to be Daxton’s Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.” Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

“Darius is Silver Eclipse’s Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.” My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

“What do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.” Ruth, Rayden’s Mate, asks.

“Nice safe, Rayden.” I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn’t taken that into consideration.

“You are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don’t like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton’s status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.” My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

“I’m sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn’t deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.” Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

“Ruth, I don’t like what you are implying…..” My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

“I am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can’t see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.” Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn’t used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn’t have a problem doing both.

“Daxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.” My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

“Okay, let’s see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?” Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don’t believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

“Captain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.” Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn’t link me. “You have your block up, Captain.”

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn’t just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan’s room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

“I wish they wouldn’t do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.” I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

“It will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.” He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan’s lover.

It wasn’t until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

“Elder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn’t want to get distracted.” I say as I sit down behind my desk.

“No worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don’t think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don’t bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

“We both know that Nico and Lucy don’t have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

“How long do we have?” I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

“You have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.” Elder Jensen replies.

“Okay, Joshua. Let’s get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.” I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

“Get in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.” I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

“Let me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?” He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.

Well, good luck. Most Alphas are arrogant, obnoxious, and rude; they truly believe that they are the Goddess’ gift to women.

# Read Link: [**https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/devotion-1/**](https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/devotion-1/) 

After the divorce, my mom set me up again. 

He was an engineer. Good-looking, well-off, and out of the country most of the year. 

The only catch? He had a son who wasn’t quite… right. 

My mom asked if I minded being a stepmom. 

I just laughed. A ready-made kid is a lot easier than nine months of pregnancy. Isn’t the government encour aging people to have children anyway? 

I’ll take him.

Michael’s work was demanding, so our first meeting was at a café beneath his office building. 

He was dressed in a pair of light-gray work coveralls, his features sharp and handsome, his smile disarming 

y warm. 

was floored. I had no idea my mom had access to this caliber of blind date material. 

Over coffee, he gave me the rundown of his life. Thirty-five, a six-figure salary as a global support enginee for a heavy machinery company, constantly traveling for overseas assignments. 

When we were done, he made it clear he was more than happy with me, but then he brought up the delicate 

subject. 

‘I’m not sure if your mother mentioned it, but I have a five-year-old son. He’s in kindergarten.” 

I nodded. 

I get it, teenagers can be rebellious, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how a five-year-old could be “not right.” 

Was Michael violent? Did he have some kind of weird fetish? 

My eyes scanned him again, from head to toe. His hands were clenched into tight fists, a sign of his nerves. He offered me a devastatingly earnest, almost goofy smile. 

He seemed harmless enough. 

“Can I ask why you and your ex-wife divorced?” 

Michael went quiet for a moment. “We didn’t divorce. I’m a widower. She died from an amniotic fluid embol- ism during childbirth.” 

I froze. That was a detail my mom had conveniently left out. 

“When my son was born, I was flying all over the world for work. He lived with his maternal grandparents. I brought him home to live with me when he was four, and that’s when he…” 

He trailed off, rubbing his hands together awkwardly as he waited for my verdict. 

I thought it over, then finally said, “I have a three-year-old daughter. She has to live with me. I don’t know if you’re okay with that.” ",1,1758335522.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1nlmkxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1nlmkxu/i_read_40_books_last_year_and_heres_what_i_learned/,I read 40+ books last year and here's what I learned,"this year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Book summary apps are overrated. I tried Blinkist, Shortform, and several other summary apps thinking they'd help me consume more content faster. Big mistake. These apps give you the illusion of learning without actual comprehension. You remember facts for maybe a week, then it's gone.

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I'm happy to share specific strategies that worked for me.",22,1758335508.0,Discipline,4,0.96,False

I’ve been talking to a guy for a few weeks and we’ve been on one date. And have another planned. He seems nice so far, but I can’t stop interpreting everything he does as being a stage 5 clinger. Some examples:

When we first starting talking, he didn’t respond for two days. Then said “I’m sorry I took so long to respond. My notifications weren’t on.”

*My thoughts: “Two days isn’t that long. He must be expecting constant communication.”*

I mentioned I had just gone to a concert. He had never heard of the artist and said “oh, I’ll go check him out!” 

I mentioned that I like playing tennis and he says “I used to play tennis a lot. Maybe we could play this weekend!” 

*My thoughts: “He’s trying way too hard to be interested in the same things I am”* 

So we play tennis on our first date. I had a perfectly nice time. And at the end he says “We should do this again sometime. I’ll be around tonight if you want to grab a drink later.”

*My thoughts: “He wants to hang out twice in one day. He’s already obsessed with me.”* 

I tell him sure, maybe sometime this week. We start talking again on the app a few days later and he asks me again about the drink. I agree and then he comes back and says, “oh I just looked at your profile again and it says you don’t drink alcohol. Want to do coffee instead?” 

*My thoughts: “He’s just been staring my profile all day.”* 

Logically, I don’t think any of this is unreasonable. In fact, it’s very considerate of him to check if I drink. But it’s setting off alarms for me. The last guy I dated was very needy, so maybe it’s just triggering that experience for me? How do I get rid of these thoughts?!",8,1758335239.0,AvoidantAttachment,16,0.83,False
1nlmhr3,https://i.redd.it/agij8xo8d8qf1.png,The Forgotten Princess & Her Beta Mates,"My Mate

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.



If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.



“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.



“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.



I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.



No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.



Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.



On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.



I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.



If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.



I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.



Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.



“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.



My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.



I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.



Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.



I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.



Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.



This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.



So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.



I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.



Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.



Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.



Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.



I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.



I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.



“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.



She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.



It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.



I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.



My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.



Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.



“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.



“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.



I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.



New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.



Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.



I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.



My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.



Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.



Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.



I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.



“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.



I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.



I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.



“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.



I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.



Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.



“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.



“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.



“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.



“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.



I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.



“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.



“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.



“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.



Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.



The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.



“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.



“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.



More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.



My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.



“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.



Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.



“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.



GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.



“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.



“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.



I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.



At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.



Six months later



I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.



I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.



Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.



It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.



I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.



A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.



I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.



We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.



I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.



I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.



My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.



I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?



After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.



My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.



Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.



I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.



Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.



“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.



The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.



Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.



Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.



It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.



None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.



Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.



My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.



My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.



“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.



“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.



“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.



“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.



Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.



“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.



“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.



I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.



“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.



Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.



“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.



“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.



“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.



I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.



The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.



“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

While yes this is stupid, I’m just a salesperson, I didn’t make this decision. 

Well today this horrible Karen absolutely lost her mind that we charged for gift boxes. Immediately started screaming, cursing, calling me and my coworker “disgusting”,  and that we would “regret” not giving them the gift box for free. She even attempted to essentially steal the box by snatching it out of my coworkers hand, and shoving the (one) item she purchased in there. Shockingly the Karen did end up eventually paying for the gift box and leaving. 

The entitlement of these customers is truly insane, like I genuinely cannot imagine screaming at workers because they won’t give me a product for free. (Oh and yes we did offer our free gift wrapping option which is our store bag fluffed with tissue)

I have one restraint to this issue that I deem highly relevant to this and it is that I can only comfortably use the freezer of our shared fridge by my landlord in our apartment - he is quite the fussy old man and doesn't really like taking up too much space in the fridge, and this is why I have resigned to only using the freezer.

This will be a coffee oil cake with a blueberry filling that I will give as a gift - I imagine the cake type and flavor is probably a non-issue, but if it does, please inform me so I can pivot as needed. I have a few ideas for now that I will list but if you have any better ones then I will consider them:

1. I will bake the cake layers, cool them to room temp., then wrap them in layers of cling wrap and plastic bags for transport. I imagine freezer burn doesn't really set in that much with either oil or chiffon cakes, but if it does, I only have to choose between making an oil or chiffon as that is what I am familiar with making.  
2. The blueberry filling can be safely stored in a jar, though I might make it on the day since cornstarch loses its thickening capacity when frozen and thawed, and will just bring the ingredients on hand. I do have a simple cooking setup in the place I currently reside so it won't be that much of an issue.  
3. I might make an ermine frosting, as that is my primary choice of frosting, being not that sweet and needing less sugar and butter than other types of frosting. A quick search says that it holds well to being frozen and just needs rewhipping after thawing. Another option would be to just buy premade powdered whipping base and just add cold water and whip, but I choose the ermine for now as I find it to taste better and I have most of the ingredients on-hand already and instead not purchase the powder.  
4. I am going to transport these components separately, then keep them in the freezer for three days, then assemble on the day I am gifting it.

You cancel plans, you stay inside,With every pulse, the urge to hide.But still it lingers, sharp and near,That voice that feeds on doubt and fear.

\
Alt text: Business professionals in a modern meeting room. which Majlis meetings to never, ever skip.\
Bahrain stands out as a regional hub for cross-border business activities, offering globally minded investors transparent regulations, a business-friendly tax regime, and digital-first government services. According to Forbes Business, Bahrain’s cross-border trade volume topped $44 billion USD in 2025—a 7% rise over 2024, driven by fintech, logistics, and manufacturing. Reuters recently highlighted the government's new 2025 Foreign Investment Law update, which further streamlined approval processes for international companies.\
But what does it really take to launch and operate a Bahrain-based company with cross-border ambitions? Drawing on years of direct experience and recent regulatory changes, I’ll guide you through the regulations, strategies, costs, and insider methods for Bahrain company formation—with both practical examples and expert-level insights.\
\
Bahrain's Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. shows Bahrain’s GDP expanded by 4.1% in Q1 2025, with the financial services and logistics sectors leading the surge. Gulf News reports that the Economic Development Board (EDB) has attracted over $1.2 billion in new FDI during the first half of 2025.\
Importantly, Bahrain’s regulatory environment is tailored for international business:\
- 100% foreign ownership is possible across most sectors (details), a rarity among GCC neighbors.\
- The tax regime is straightforward: 0% corporate tax for most activities and no personal income tax.\
- The Commercial Companies Law was amended in January 2025 to further relax minimum capital requirements for WLLs and broaden permitted cross-border activities.\
Comparison time: Unlike the UAE, where free zones dominate, Bahrain allows foreign investors to set up on the mainland (including in Bahrain Bay and Seef) with near-full control and less bureaucratic friction. I’ve seen firsthand how this flexibility speeds up market entry and reduces ongoing compliance headaches.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Regulatory Backbone\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.). The most popular options for international entrepreneurs are:\
* With Limited Liability Company (WLL)\
* Closed Joint Stock Company (BSC Closed)\
* Branch of a Foreign Company\
* Single Person Company (SPC)\
* Representative Office\
I always recommend starting with a WLL for most cross-border ventures—especially if you plan to trade or export beyond Bahrain’s borders. The MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) portal (Sijilat) is your main gateway, but don’t underestimate the value of meeting government officials in person at the Diplomatic Area service center. (On my second company, a single face-to-face at MOICT cut two weeks off my CR approval time.)\
Ownership Regulations:\
- Since June 2025, the threshold for foreign ownership in “activities open to international business” has been raised to 100% (specifics), with a short list of exceptions (e.g., some local retail).\
- Certain activities still require a Bahraini sponsor or agent (sponsorship details), but workarounds often exist with free zone registration (free zone guide).\
Key Regulatory Bodies:\
* MOICT: Company registration, licensing\
* LMRA: Work visas and employment approvals\
* EDB: Investment support, incentives\
* Tamkeen: Funding and training support\
Bahrain’s “one-stop shop” portals (like Sijilat and LMRA) genuinely work better than the legacy systems in much of the GCC. But technical glitches do surface—the classic trick is to apply for your Commercial Registration (CR) right at 8:05 am on Mondays, before the online queues spike.\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Cross-Border Company Formation in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. to confirm cross-border eligibility. The MOICT Sijilat portal lists accepted activities for 100% foreign ownership, export permissions, and regulated sectors.\
2. Reserve Your Company Name\
This is surprisingly competitive; use Sijilat’s online tool, but follow up with a call to lock it in (names are released if not confirmed quickly).\
3. Prepare Constitutive Documents\
\
Memorandum and Articles of Association (template available from EDB)\
Proof of address (office lease agreement from a recognized commercial address in Seef or Diplomatic Area—avoid older buildings to speed up municipality checks)\
Valid passport copies of owners/directors\
Proof of initial bank deposit (for some activities)\
\
Shortcut: Rent a virtual office in Bahrain Bay for CR purposes—Keylink provides these, and their staff understand what the inspectors actually want to see.\
4. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR)\
Process everything online through Sijilat. Schedule a physical office inspection for later in the week to avoid end-of-week crunches.\
5. Obtain Additional Regulatory Approvals\
Certain activities need sectoral approvals (insurance, banking, medical). Start this in parallel with your CR application; don’t wait until after (my biggest mistake was handling these sequentially, which delayed our launch by three weeks).\
6. Register with LMRA for Work Visas\
Submit employee details and apply for investor/employee visas. Tip: Filing right after the new immigration shift at 9:00 am saves you from digital “queue hell.”\
7. Open a Corporate Bank Account\
Major banks like Bank ABC, National Bank of Bahrain, and Al Baraka are the easiest for foreign shareholders. Avoid month-ends—relationship managers are swamped then, and approvals stall.\
8. Finalize Municipality and Tax Authority Registration\
VAT registration is required for annual turnover above BHD 37,500. Prepare for compliance requirements—see accounting & bookkeeping tips for automated solutions.\
\
Cost Considerations: Bahrain Company Formation and Cross-Border Activities\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.:\
- MOICT registration fee: BHD 30–50 (one-time)\
- CR issuance: BHD 50–300 (depends on activity)\
- Virtual office rental: BHD 350–700/year (Seef, Diplomatic Area)\
- Legal/attestation fees: BHD 150–500\
- Other administrative costs: BHD 200–400\
Annual Operating Costs:\
- Accounting/bookkeeping: BHD 400–800/year (service options)\
- LMRA work permits for expats: BHD 72 per permit + monthly BD 5–10 per employee\
- Municipal fees: 10% of annual rent (applicable only if you lease physical premises)\
Compare detailed breakdowns at Keylink’s cost guide.\
A word of caution—many entrepreneurs skip the virtual office or use a residential address. This almost always triggers additional inspections and delays. My advice: Spend the extra BHD 100–200 for a recognized commercial address in a business district.\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Ongoing Requirements for Cross-Border Operators\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Submit annual VAT returns (if applicable)\
- Maintain up-to-date records for all shareholders and directors\
A common mistake—forgetting to update your board resolution documents or failing to report minor shareholder changes. This can freeze your CR renewal. (I had to scramble for last-minute notary appointments at Al Salam Tower because I ignored a minor statutory form!)\
Insider tip: Hire a local accountant or corporate secretary with Sijilat experience (recommended partners). They know which “unofficial” paperwork the authorities expect, which saves both time and face.\
Recent Policy Change: Starting March 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT now requires all cross-border entities to maintain a digital shareholder registry, accessible to both regulatory and compliance officers. Implementation has been smooth for those using cloud-based accounting (details), but paper-based businesses have faced delays.\
\
Cultural and Practical Tips for Business Success\
\
Alt text: Professional business support..\
- Ramadan hours mean everything opens late and closes early; adjust your timelines accordingly.\
- Government buildings in Seef District are busiest midweek—plan your license pickups for Saturdays, and avoid last-minute runs before major holidays.\
Slight tangent: I once attended a business breakfast at Al Fateh Grand Mosque’s conference center. At first, it felt unrelated to my IT consultancy. But a single networking chat there landed a logistics contract in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, all because I understood Bahrain’s unique approach to business hospitality.\
Bahrain’s regulatory authorities respond better to proactive, respectful follow-ups—face-to-face meetings and WhatsApp chats with government contacts can resolve issues faster than emails or support tickets (especially in the Diplomatic Area MOICT building).\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Cross-Border Business Regulations & Insights\
Q1: Can foreigners really own 100% of their businesses in Bahrain, and in which sectors?\
Yes, since the 2025 amendments, most sectors—including trading, consultancy, and digital services—allow full foreign ownership. Certain strategic or retail sectors may still require local participation. Full sector list here.\
Q2: What are the main post-setup compliance headaches I should anticipate?\
Annual CR renewals, up-to-date shareholder documents, annual audits, and VAT reporting (if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500). Using an efficient accounting service can eliminate most hassles.\
Q3: Is there a significant cost difference between mainland and free zone company setups in Bahrain?\
Free zones can offer lower operational costs and faster setup for certain activities (see guide), but mainland setups grant greater business and hiring flexibility. For most cross-border traders and service firms, the cost difference is minimal—budget BHD 1,200–2,600 for full initial setup.\
Q4: What are the most common mistakes entrepreneurs make when setting up cross-border companies in Bahrain?\
\
Using unrecognized addresses for CR registration\
Failing to align business activity codes with export goals\
Delaying regulatory approvals (banking, sectoral) until after CR is issued\
\
Prevent these by pre-booking your office lease in a business district, confirming all activity codes with an expert, and running approvals in parallel. More prevention strategies here.\
Q5: Are there recommended professional services to help with company formation and ongoing compliance?\
Absolutely—firms like Keylink are well-established, speak fluent English and Arabic, and know the “unwritten” insider tips. They can also expedite document clearances and bank introductions (I used them for my third business and cut the setup time by 30%).\
\
Final Thoughts\
Bahrain’s pro-business environment, digital-first public services, and welcoming culture make it one of the GCC’s top destinations for cross-border business. But success isn’t just about ticking regulatory boxes: it’s about timing, relationships, and local savvy. Start with the right structure, invest in personal connections, and use proven local partners for setup and compliance. And never underestimate the power of a well-timed cup of coffee in the Diplomatic Area.\

**What I had:**  
\#02-05 Uncle Louis Famous Chicken Rice  
Steamed Chicken Rice + Char Siew + Roast pork $8.00 ($4 base + $2 per meat)  
  
Did I order too much? Yea. But gotta go for the review.   
It was a friday so there wasn't a queue at all, usually, I see the queue snaking until the escalator there. 

**What I liked:**  
White chicken was extremely tender; I ordered chicken breast to see if it was dry or tough, and I'm happy to announce that it's neither. 

Roast pork was extremely crispy and juicy, the skin was crisp like Filipino chicharon; you bite into it, and the whole pantry can hear. The fat-to-meat ratio was also perfect, giving you an oil-filled enough bite that still pack the flavors of the meat. 

Chilli packed a good punch. 

  
**What I didn't like:**   
Char Siew was a little dry, which is unfortunate because the sweet sauce caramelization was actually quite decent. The fatty bits were nice too but the juxaposition between soft fats and dry meat created a very confusing texture while biting. 

Dabao and order-issue but the sauce drizzled on the  rice was a bit too much and overwhelming. You have the chicken rice sauce and the char siew sauce sprinkled on the rice and the rice soaking up all the sauces and juices for 7 mins while i walk back to my office - creates a very mushy texture on some parts of the rice by the time I dig into it.

Brief Health background: I'm 27, I'm overweight, I smoked vape and weed before pregnancy. I stopped vaping the moment i found out i was pregnant. This is my first pregnancy

We had just recently moved out of our apartment and had zero furniture at home. We had an unexpected pregnancy, and I was told I had an ectopic pregnancy in January (Week 8), but that was malpractice by the doctor; turns out I just had an anterior placenta.  
I smoked weed to eat as i was losing a lot of weight due to nausea and vomiting, and coping with the grief of a possible miscarriage, but I ended up using it once a month when I was stressed out. In February, I was terminated by my workplace, and so I sued them without a lawyer, so I had to go through all the hearings by myself (stressed and angry). When we had enough financial stability, we continued our check-ups at a renowned hospital, and the baby kept growing normally.

I found a job that same month (February) and had to prove myself worthy, and so I overworked myself. My husband and I got into fights weekly, and I kept saying things I didn't mean about me and the baby's health. (It's like I was claiming it). I stopped smoking weed in July, and I think the drastic shift stressed me out, and then the problems started to happen in August.

At 35 weeks, I self-diagnosed myself to have possible pre-eclampsia, this was due to my severe swelling, so i started to monitor my BP and then got myself tested at the laboratory and got traces of protein in my urine + i had IUGR and low amniotic fluid, i immedietly went to my OBGYN and she recommended i undergo immediate C-section but i didn't trust her anymore, she was very passive during our previous appointments and missed an important detail and i couldn't afford to pay for NICU so we went to a public hospital and i got confined until i could safely deliver through an induction at week 37 and they gave me medication to control my blood pressure + they gave me folic acid but still told me to continue on my prenatals (I used Pregnacare Max) and asked me to return on the 21st of August.

At 37 weeks (August 21), the attending doctors said I should get induced immediately, and due to previous malpractices I faced, I refused, rescheduled for August 30 (just so my baby could complete 38 weeks). I have been checking my blood pressure, my oxygen levels, and bought a Doppler to monitor them at any time. I also relied heavily on ChatGPT to tell me if my stats were normal. So I thought I got it under control, everything seemed fine.

On the night of *28th*, I missed my (Hypertension) dose due to sleep, and when I woke up, my blood pressure reading was lower than normal, but the doppler showed the baby still had a heartbeat. I went to the hospital on the 29th to get a refill on my medications, and the doctor asked for a CTG, They found no heartbeat and confirmed it through an ultrasound. I underwent induction and had to give birth to my stillborn child.

Ironically, my baby was born and rested on August 30.

Below are the specific things I did during my pregnancy that others have warned me about. Whether it's superstition or medically related.

**Do NOT do what I did — a checklist to avoid:**

1. **Ignore medical advice for serious conditions.** If your doctor warns about IUGR, oligohydramnios (low fluid), or preeclampsia, take it seriously. These aren’t minor issues you can “wait out.”
2. **Refuse induction or recommended delivery without understanding the real risk.** If induction or C-section is recommended for medical reasons, don’t decline because you “don’t feel ready.” Waiting can be deadly.
3. **Use substances during pregnancy — even “small” amounts of weed or vaping.** I used tiny amounts of weed (0.1 gram) once a week, thinking it was harmless. I kept justifying it because others seemed fine. It’s a risk you don’t need to take.
4. **Trust anonymous internet stories as proof that risky behavior is “safe.”** “I knew someone who smoked and was fine” isn’t medical evidence. Don’t gamble on anecdote over advice. I was following bluntblowinmama and their stories.
5. **Stop or miss prescribed medications because of convenience or money.** I missed doses and delayed refills. If you’re prescribed blood-pressure meds or other treatments, keep taking them and refill on time.
6. **Skip prenatal appointments or delay tests because life is hectic.** Work, money, or shame are not good reasons to miss monitoring that could save your baby.
7. **Prioritize other people’s opinions (or “saving money”) over recommended care.** I listened to family who said private clinics just make you do things for money. Don’t let that stop you from following medical recommendations. Trust your gut always; no one else matters.
8. **Let stress, court cases, or job anxiety swallow your pregnancy care.** Legal fights, work, and money are stressful — but don’t let them push prenatal care and your health to the back burner. Don't stress yourself out, try and find ways to cope.
9. **Starve yourself or neglect nutrition and supplements.** Skipping meals and stopping prenatals when you can’t afford them is dangerous. Talk to your provider or social services if you need help getting supplements.
10. **Delay going to the hospital for monitoring when you notice problems.** If you have decreased movements, high/low BP readings, or your doctor tells you to be monitored — go immediately. Don’t wait until tomorrow.
11. **Assume home monitoring (Doppler, BP checks alone) replaces professional assessment.** Home devices are helpful for reassurance but not a substitute for clinical evaluation when risks are present.
12. **Refuse help and isolate when you’re scared or ashamed.** Shame kept me from fully engaging with care. Ask for help — from doctors, social workers, or friends — even if it’s difficult.
13. **Use relationship conflict as an excuse to avoid care or make impulsive choices.** I let anger, fights, and family stress cloud judgment about medical decisions. Don’t let emotional turmoil lead to life-threatening delays.
14. **Think “it won’t happen to me.”** Pregnancy outcomes can change fast. When professionals say there’s a risk, act as if the warning is urgent — because often it is.
15. **Your birth plan does not matter, just because you have it written in bold "" trust your body"" doesn't mean you forget about your instincts and your logical thinking**
16. **If you're not feeling the doctor**'**s diagnosis, get a second or third opinion.**
17. **It doesn't matter if you're not ready, whether you haven't done the photoshoot, the baby shower the gender reveal**

Superstitions/things they've told me or warned me about during my pregnancy that replays constantly in my head. (I come from an east asian household)

The cause of stillbirth is still unknown in some cases. If even the slightest thing can make a difference, I hope you take into consideration that I could be a hysterical grieving mother, and I really do not wish this type of loss on anyone.

1. Don't oil your belly your amniotic fluid can dry up (Superstitions)
2. Don't step over cords
3. Don't wear necklaces (older people said this caused the cord to wrap around their necks)
4. If your pet get's jealous of your unborn child, they will take it away (Superstitions)
5. Don't watch things that make you scared or sad
6. Don't risk drinking caffeine as it could dehydrate you (I drank coffee and Diet Pepsi a lot)
7. Don't wish ill things on you or your baby, cause they hear you  (Superstitions)
8. Anterior Placenta is a bad omen (Superstitions). Ask them to monitor your placenta and monitor blood flow
9. Don't sleep with open windows or exposed windows (Superstitions), spirits come and take your baby away
10. Speak to your baby frequently and tell them to be healthy and come out safely
11. Count the kicks even if your placenta is Anterior (any change in movement needs to be recorded and a doctor needs to be informed)
12. Not knowing the gender earlier on (I found out on the 25th and started to bond with the baby more than the idea of it )
13. **It won’t happen to me.** was something I said the whole pregnancy too
14. Be there in the moment, no matter how hectic life gets, you never know when's the last time their heart beats.
15. **DO NOT RELY ON CHATGPT FOR MEDICAL ADVICE**

It has been three years since we broke up he still tries to contact me but I am fully no contact with him but nonetheless main point is, I am healed and ready for love and last year I asked out my crush for a coffee, he is my neighbor and we also attend the same college, but he said no saying he was moving on from something and it had been a WHILE since I felt anything for a guy. I am really stuck on this thing that I may never find love because I even tried bumble and hinge, but they did not work out for me at all. I went into astrology to look at when is my “love period” but that passed too and I haven’t found anyone. I know I am too young to actually find love so early but I feel it in me now that my soul wants someone who would love me. I have always been the mother of every friend group and always been the one who shows up for people, who loves everyone, cooks for all, checks up on them, but I now want someone to do that to me too. I want someone to actually “love” me not like in a lustful way but more in a feeling loved by someone by “the one”. I don’t know when will I even find him or not but I just keep losing hope everyday that I will actually find anyone. I really want to know from the people who are happy and in love, that when do you actually find your person “the one”, who actually holds on to you when everyone leaves who is your equal supporter and someone who would accept my love and support for him.",2,1758334555.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I've been using electric kettles for years, and I recently discovered some game-changing cleaning methods I just had to share. If you're like me, you've probably noticed that nasty limescale buildup that makes your morning tea or coffee taste a bit off.

I remember when I first got my electric kettle from https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle - it was all shiny and perfect. But after a few months, I started noticing white crusty deposits inside. That's when I knew I needed to step up my cleaning game.

Here's what I've learned works best:

The Vinegar Method (My Go-To):
- Mix equal parts white vinegar and water
- Fill the kettle halfway
- Boil the mixture
- Let it sit for 20 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly
- Boil fresh water twice to remove any vinegar smell

The Citric Acid Solution:
- Add 1-2 tablespoons of citric acid to a full kettle
- Boil water
- Let it sit for 15 minutes
- Rinse well

The Lemon Method:
- Cut a lemon into quarters
- Add to kettle with water
- Boil and let sit for an hour
- Rinse thoroughly

Pro Tips I've Learned:
1. Clean your kettle monthly to prevent heavy buildup
2. Never use harsh chemicals - they can damage the heating element
3. Don't scrub the inside with abrasive materials
4. Always rinse multiple times after cleaning

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle that's easier to clean, I recently found some great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. The ones with wider openings are much easier to clean and maintain.

One thing I've noticed is that filtered water helps reduce limescale buildup significantly. I switched to filtered water about six months ago, and it's made a huge difference in how often I need to clean my kettle.

Also, don't forget to wipe down the exterior and base regularly with a damp cloth. It's amazing how much dust can accumulate around the heating element.

I hope these tips help keep your electric kettle clean and your beverages tasting great! Let me know if you have any questions or other cleaning methods that work well for you.",1,1758334530.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
