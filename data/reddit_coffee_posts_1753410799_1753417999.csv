I’ve never been to Bukidnon myself and first time niya sa PH. So I’m looking for suggestions for the following:

* Airbnb/hotel
* Coffee shops (we love coffee)
* Restaurants
* Hiking spots (a dayhike or anywhere good for a long walk)
* Bars/speakeasy (or a good spot na ma enjoy niya ang pinagmamalaki kong San Miguel pale pilsen hehe)
* Local shops for souvenirs 

What are some areas that are difficult to navigate? What are some precautions to take when driving around the area? 

We’re thinking of a 4D3N stay. Nothing too crazy, just a trip to relax and get away from the city and work. We chose Bukidnon because we both love the mountains, and it’s the first place that I thought of.

1m8pqsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1m8pqsz/he_broke_up_with_his_gf_because_of_me/,He broke up with his GF because of me.,"Problem/Goal: what to do? Is it right to accept his courtship? I like him a lot.  

Context: I have a long time HS friend whom I haven’t seen in a very long time.  We saw each other again in a friend’s birthday.   It was a casual get together with a very chill interaction.  

In HS, we were friends, we liked each other but not to the point that we engaged in a RS since we both prioritized our studies.    We went to separate cities for college.  Though we had some hi and hellos in FB over the years, that was it.   I’m not really into socmed especially FB, I have IG but I rarely post, follow or accept invites.  So we haven’t had any communication in a long time. 

After a few weeks, we saw each other again with friends.   This time, he really engaged me with his time.   Asked more personal questions and how I was…. asked me if I was single and I said yes.  He also told me he is in a current relationship with his gf of  4 years.   We did not discuss more of it but focused on where we were or have been doing to the past years.  That was it and I haven’t seen him for the next 1 and a half month.  

I got an invite from another mutual friend for some coffee and brunch together with some HS friends, he was there too when I arrived.  It was the usual get together like in HS as if years has not passed.   Again, he engaged me most of his time.  and this time he asked for my number and said that we should get together sometime.  I felt there was more about it coz I can sense it from his tone, body language and in his eyes.   He was a bit anxious but determined.  

I hesitated and told him flatly that his gf might be bothered about it and I don’t want to cause any trouble.   He said he was already single and no one will be bothered by me.  I was already about to leave that time so I just gave it to him without pressing for more details.  

That night, he messaged me to say that it was really nice seeing me again and said “good night” 

Two days later, he messaged me if he could call me over the phone.  I accepted his call and he asked me  if  we could meet in person just the two of us.  We met that afternoon in the same cafe and there he honestly told me his intention to pursue and court me.   Sabi nya, he was in love with me for as long as he can remember but didn’t get the chance to show and tell me.   This time he said, “ayaw ko na pakawalan ang chance na ito”.  

Nag paalam daw sya ng maayos sa former girlfriend and he said the truth about seeing me again and told her that he realized that I was really the reason why he couldn’t commit to marrying her or to attempt to propose to her since they were already both in the marrying age and has stable income. 

I just listened to what he had to say.   I told him I admire his honesty but did not promise or say anything about his courtship.  I asked him to give me time to digest the things he said and for me also for myself to reflect on this.   

The thing is, the feeling had always been mutual.  
But is it right to accept and let him court me when he just broke up with his gf just two months ago? 

I just received flowers by delivery this morning and I know, ako mag de decide eventually but I need inputs, advice or anything, point of views to help me settle this situation.

1m8pofw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1m8pofw/my_ghost_stories/,My ghost stories,"‼️I want to let everyone know that I have very bad dyslexia so I wrote this out In my notes app and then asked chat gpt to fix all my spelling mistakes. I hope that’s okay, these stories are all real and all mine. I have so many more moments I could write about and so many stories from my family‼️


I come from a long line of Spanish gypsies. The women in my family all of us have felt things, seen things, lived through moments that are hard to explain. I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, but I’d love to share a few of mine with you.

1- When I was just two years old, my godmother was staying with us. I used to play on her bed all the time, and one afternoon I was there, bouncing and giggling, completely full of joy. She walked in and asked, “Why are you laughing so much?” Without thinking, I said, “Grandad’s playing with me!”

She froze. Then she ran out and brought my mum back. They both stood in the doorway watching me as I kept bouncing and laughing. My godmother asked again who I was playing with, and I said, “Grandad! He’s doing the funny thing with his teeth!”

My grandad had false teeth, and when my older cousins were little, he used to loosen them and clack them around in his mouth to make them laugh. But here’s the thing he passed away when my mum was only three months pregnant with me. I never met him. I’d never even heard about him. My mum never talked about him, not even once.

The moment I said that, my mum just broke down. She scooped me up and hugged me tight, crying into my shoulder. I asked her what was wrong, and she whispered, “Nothing, baby. I’m just really happy you’re playing with your grandad.”



2 - Years later, when I first started dating my now-husband, I used to stay over at his family’s house. Every time I walked past the garage, I’d see an old woman moving around inside. I didn’t say anything at first I didn’t want to scare him off. But after a couple of months, I finally told him, “I think there’s something in your garage.”

He gave me this look and said, “Yeah, sometimes I feel someone’s back there… in the back left corner.”
I hesitated and said, “That’s weird. I always feel it in the back right corner.”

He just stared at me and said, “That’s actually where I always feel it. I was trying to test you.”

Then it all made sense to me. I told him, “I think it’s your grandma. Do you want me to ask her something? Something only she would know?” So I did. And she answered. She told me she was watching over the family. That I’d be good for him. That she trusted me to take care of him. 

3- There was a time in high school that truly scared me. I started hearing voices not just one or two, but what felt like dozens, maybe even fifty, all speaking over each other in different languages, from different places. I couldn’t shut it off. I felt like I was being pulled in a hundred directions all at once.

I finally told my mum after a few weeks of this happening , we called in my nanna. The three of us did a full ritual candles, prayers, everything. My nanna is deeply spiritual, strong, and wise. When it was done, she looked at me and said, “You’re a vessel. They’re not trying to hurt you. They just want your help.”

I had to be blessed, protected, shielded — and slowly, the voices faded. But for a while there, I really thought I was losing my mind. It wasn’t until it all went quiet again that I realised… I’d just been open. Too open.

4-   then there was the night I’ll never forget. I was 11. We’d just moved back to New Zealand and were staying at my mum’s friend’s place. One night, I woke up and saw my Uncle Dennis standing over my mum while she slept. He leaned down, kissed her on the forehead, and said, “Everything’s going to be alright.”

Then he turned and saw me awake. He walked over, crouched by my bed, gave me a big hug, and kissed my head. “I’ll always be here to take care of you, poppet,” he said. He was the only person who ever called me that.

And then he was gone.

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen while Mum was making her coffee. I said, “Uncle Dennis passed away last night.” She stared at me, then rushed to call my aunt.

He’d died at 3:40am.

My aunt asked how we knew. My mum just said, “Tiana saw him say goodbye.”",2,1753417221.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False
1m8po6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1m8po6d/im_doing_christianity_wrong/,I'm doing christianity wrong,"Hello, everyone. This will be long. Sorry for my english. 

So all my life I (25 F) believed in Jesus, I was baptized as a baby, did my first communion and confirmation (idk if they are called the same in english) all in a catholic church. But me or my family wasn't practicant. I went to sunday church maybe a few times a year, and prayed like once every month. When I tried to do it more regurarely, I forgot with time. I was focused on boys, and parties. Since I turned 18 (legal drinking age) I focused my activities around drinking. A lot of my sins include drink. I used to think saying ""I believe in Jesus"" was enough. I want to believe I was ignorant, but the Lord was always there. It was me who chose to look away. 

What started to bring me back was a couple of reasons. First, I learned about sin in music, artist who claim to sell their soul. I used to love secular music. It was my idol. Specially metal, system of a down, avenged sevenfold, and even trendy ones. I started to avoid the songs that were blasplemous, but then, obviously, the artist of said songs. It was like a year process when I stopped listening to music at all. I tried to look for reasons to listen to any artist, but truth is that, if they are famous and don't praise the lord, I shouldn't listen to them. That's just how I feel. We believe  By that mindset, there weren't any left (I wasn't familiar with worship music). 

Second, I study film. I wanted to be a filmaker, make comedy films, etc. But, similarly to the adobe, I stopped watching films little by little. The world doesn't need more distractions. (like I am distracting myself in this post while I should be praying).  Also, pizzagate, Iluminati and stuff. It's almost safe to say that I stopped watching those reels months ago for my mental health, and started to focus on the light. Now I don't know if I should leave my studies or finish them (I have one year out of 4 left to get my degree), mostly because my parents pay for my studies, I owe them that. It's just the idea of finishing, not living of that.

Third, I did something bad while drunk, that brought me to church to ask for help from the lord. That led to going back again and again. Also went to a psychologist from that church to learn how to navigate this- he was nice and lectured. I started to read the bible I bought a couple months back (jerusalem) and we are here. Jesus helped me, that mistake was the last time I drank. And now I don't think of anything else.

The thing is... Now my family don't recognize me. And I know it makes sense but let me elaborate. When I started going to church, all my sins sent me to bed- specially horrid intrusive thoughts I always pushed back but the holy spirit led me to confess. I couldn't eat, stand or anything, the only way of being a fully commited christian I knew was to become a nun, I cried that I wanted to become a nun, that God is the only one who could help me (I still believe this last part but now idk about becoming a nun, I learned there's more things but I will do whatever Jesus wants me to do if he gives me strength) . My parents were really worried- as you could imagine. (I'm old but am the younger of my siblings by a wide difference, I am treated- and acted my whole life- as a baby. I repent.) They thought it was this psychologist- I could never share the intrusive thoughts part to them- So they looked for another one. 

This other psychologist was really nice and understanding. But she wasn't a christian, so at first I was reluctant. But the second day I woke up and I felt in my heart that God put me there. So I told her everything. I still believe God send me there because she understood my spiritual doubts (e.g. I met a evangelical girl, I learned big differences that messed with my brain. Now I feel like love for Christ is what matters always) SO she gave me the number of an ex nun whose vocation was to help and heal spiritualy. 

This woman stopped being a nun because she felt her work there was done, she is still catholic. I told her what I wrote here. About my doubts and anxiety. She invited me to a healing mass- my prayers where being answered. They have this community and worship on tuesdays, I've been going for the last month. But I thought the spirit healing would be a one time thing, I've gone to two in the last month and- tho I feel incredibly BETTER. My personal life is kind of drifting me away. 

SO, my parents are worried- and so am I. They wake up and see me praying at 6:30 -  because I realized that when I open my eyes I should start my day, if I keep sleeping I dream horrid things and/or feel bad about myself bc I was always lazy. I started helping more around the house. They see I don't sugar my coffee- I feel guilty or something. I TRY to go to mass every day, they see me fast and don't get it- specially since I started to fast in a trip- which in their mind made no sense and meant I wasn't sympathetic with them to let them enjoy the trip- but I felt the lord was telling me to. Then, I went to this ex nun for the first time and she said ""no, the lord doesn't want to see you suffer. EAT"" and I got a stomacche for all the sweets I ate that week after. I felt happy again but idk.

 I feel this guilt, but also I know Jesus died for my sins and I'm saved. I feel like Jesus wants me to share this intrusive thoughts with my family, but also it would destroy everyone, and also the times I've confessed them I was told they sound like the devil is making me feel bad, not God. And if God wanted me to share that it shouldn't feel absolutely panicking. 

Because my parents are worried sick, the made me spend my college vacations with them. I was reluctant at first because I wanted to volunteer or retreat, but then I was like God will take me were I should go. It was nice, but I had to come back for a week to the city for some college tasks I left behind bc of the month I was depressed. My parents thought I was lying to get my way, but I wasn't. Lies makes me nauseous. Here, along my tasks, I went to church, prayed, etc. 

Yesterday, I met a homeless man before church, he was sitting across the street and I had some blanket to give away (given by my dad). So I gave it to him and told him to go to mass. He went. We made an appointment to have coffee the next day. I was really happy, I felt God was there. We had coffee at the park, we talked for hours about God. It was gold. On my way there I felt the need to offer him to shower, I live in my parents house and my parents weren't on town.- You could imagine how this ends. He mentions a shower, I invite him, I try to find other ways. But I felt like I couldn't leave him without his warm shower in winter. I knew my parents would freak out, but I thought it was worth it. I felt it's what Jesus would have done, but what do I know?. The thing is, everything went cool with this man he left after 40 min. But my parents freaked out crazy when they found out (The guards told them when he was in the building), I obviously understand why, criminality is crazy in my country. My parents were dissapointed and close to heart attack, they think I'm gone insane (sometimes I think so too). My sister disowned me for causing months of torture to my parents, I think she should and I know I haved. 

My chest aches most of the time. I pray to God to do his willing and not mine everyday, for I know nothing and He know everything. The best for the sanctification of my soul and the others. I'm scared of not doing what He wants, I'm scared of not knowing the voice of my Sheperd. I'm scared of causing pain to my parents- is that what God wants?. I'm scared of going to hell. I'm scared of going insane. I'm scared of becoming apathetic, we have to love our neighbour but ""despise"" our family? Honor our mother and father but leave them. 

I want to give my life to the Lord but by leaving everyone I feel a bad person and selfish. I feel like all of what I wrote is selfish, did I really wanna help this man?, or I just didn't want to feel bad by leaving him? Did I acted only because I felt God was watching? . I lost interest in EVERYTHING but God because I know He is all that matters (SO WHY I'M I SO FOCUSED ON MYSELF- I HEARD) but I feel like Im dragging people around, causing pain to my beloved parents who gave me everything they could and more, maybe I don't how to love... I  know there is a way but tell me what is wrong with me. I know there are plenty of things so PLEASE. 

Makes no sense to give this info but: The month I was depressed I received A LOT  of help from college friends and teachers. So I didn't fail the semester. It was so much that I took it as a sign to continue my studies. One of those supports was to finish something in my winter break (now). But after this thing with the homeless man, I have to go back to my parents, leaving this class and failing it.

I have a boyfriend and did then too but we hung out as friends and it was very magical, but boundaried. Although sometimes it felt like he was way too energetic and erratic but I took my distance when that happened. But towards the end of trip he admitted to me he had feelings (but he's also an addict so looking back he might've been on substances..definitely was). I was going through a new life stage then and he was really helpful (going into art world).his career has been on decline due to substance and family issues (divorce, kids, moving etc) but he's still incredibly talented. He told me I inspired him a lot and probably reminded him of that new time to the world before it ended for him. 

He came to NYc where I live for a trip with his son months later. We met up on the last day of his trip and it was lovely and he told me he feels so comfortable around me. We said we were both nervous to see each other again.

Then the following summer, we overlapped in Berlin one day and we hung out all day and went day drinking and the day ended with him confessing his feelings to me and then us ending the night. I didn't know what to say. Then he distanced himself and didn't talk to me for days until I reached out because we had plans to do a workshop in nyc together the following month. When I tried to bring it up to talk about it he said ""what's there to talk about you have a b f and this is hypothetical"" and I was trying to say well I wanted to just be clear and air things out so we can stay friends because I truly value him.

He's had a few trips like this in the fall to nyc and each trip we hang out all the time. Since his last trip in November , he's been sober.

Fast forward to last week- I was in Berlin and he kept asking to hang out. I was trying to pace myslf but my friend said , just go in  you guys have a beautiful friendship. Hung out for one hour and all the feelings I have came back. I'm confused because I'd never leave my partner for him but I really love him and love hanging out with him. Then when I came home he was texting me to hang out next day (business as usual).

We hang out the next day. This time for hours. As usual on these trips. We talked about everything. He told
Me about this women he's had a crush on for years and how his kids met her kid and they kissed but then he ran home because he felt like she's too precious. Then we talked about my bf and he was so sweet with post grad school advice. I got comfortable with our flirty banter and ast one point I said you have such nice eyes (to be fair I'd say that to a friend too). But this time he got all coy. We went to dinner and he posted a pic of a beautiful  flower on his instagram and tagged me and then he rode me on his motorbike (which I have historically refused to go on) to my next  hang out. On the bike he asked me really personal questions about my family and held the stories with so much tenderness: but once he dropped me off, he didn't even say a proper goodbye and just waved and rode off. Then he texted me and said he loved today. Thank you so much but then what happens is that it got weird and the next day he didn't speak to me and the following day he didn't either and usually he always constantly reaches out to keep hanging out and then he started sending me memes, but nothing to intense then when I reached out on Tuesday before both of us left the city, I asked him to get coffee and he said he just got coffee with an Afghan refugee woman who broke his heart and then he didn't really follow up for coffee and then we both left the city and he just text me a picture of my favorite book that he bought and since then he's been communicating with me, but with a lot of distance and I just don't understand why all of a sudden he got so distant with me ",1,1753416737.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I’m 37, West Coast US-based, introverted, and prefer meaningful 1-on-1 deep chats over group settings. I spend most of my time with family and recently got into collecting Pokémon cards with my nephew/godson—I’m officially hooked.  
My humor tends funny: deadpan, dry, and occasionally dark—people say they dig it (or at least they tolerate it). I take my coffee black, and I’d never say no to tacos.

I'm obsessed with Sudoku, love watching *Cracking the Cryptic* on YouTube, and enjoy reaction videos, puzzle games, and board games. I’m exploring anime and various TV shows—but I find them way more fun when watched with someone else.

# Who I'm Looking For:

* Around my age (36–40-ish), though I’m open if we click.
* Someone who writes more than one-word replies (bonus points for detailed, curious messages).
* Open‑minded, non‑judgmental, and genuine.
* Willing to share thoughts, photos, random curiosities, or just chat about your day.
* Flexible with time zones—location doesn’t matter as long as we make time.

# Shared Experiences I’d Love:

* Writing longer messages about daily life.
* Exchanging photos of things that catch our eye, funny memes, or whatever sparks joy.
* Watching anime, *Cracking the Cryptic*, reaction videos, or shows together—even if streamed separately, just chatting during it.
* Co‑op gaming or light puzzle challenges—if you’re into that!

# Why I’m Posting:

I crave connection. I used to have a best friend I met online, but time zones and life drifted us apart. I’d really love to find one or two people to build something similar with again. No pressure, no expectation—just seeing if sparks fly.

You will get the understanding of I don't know what to do about my family part 2 The baseball game issues. Now to get the understanding RJ and Sheila B relationship during this time period please read  2020 RJ and Sheila B. Falling out/I don't know what to do about my family prequel.

I am using real names and ages not revealing any last names. RJ Peter and RayRay are aware l have written their names in these stories. RJ Peter and RayRay has shown very strong support that I am writing this story of true events. Nicklaus John our relationship is  currently NO CONTACT. So Nicklaus John has no idea he is in the story because of the NO CONTACT relationship. Nicklaus John set the guild lines of NO CONTACT and I am respecting his wishes. Duster is mine and Nicklaus  John brother. Duster is homeless and very happy to be homeless. I don't get it myself why Duster enjoys being homeless. I have NO CONTACT with Duster because of his lifestyle choices that he wants. Me and Sheila B relationship is there are some  contact  to low contact at this point.

Another reason I use real name so everyone has a right to write the events though their POV. These event are written though my POV. RJ wants to write his side of his POV. RJ has a hard time writing his side though his POV. I have a hard time writing though other people POV. RJ did tell me to tell everyone what l have written though my POV is great right on point and it reminded him how RJ lived though it.

Now for some back story how Nicklaus John talks  and commutates to other people. Nicklaus John thinks he is a lawyer. Nicklaus John isn't a lawyer at all.  He will say things like there is copyrights slander here say objection and over rule and I am gonna to hold you in contempt. I wish I was joking. I keep telling Nicklaus John when he starts acting like a Lawyer. I would hire Joe Pecsi from MY COUSIN VINNY and get better legal advice than from Nicklaus John. Nicklaus John also think he is the  patriarch, of our family. Nicklaus John thinks he speaks and represents  for the whole family and everyone needs to do what Nicklaus John says. I told Nicklaus John many times he isn't the patriarch, of me and he also doesn't speak for me.

Ok on Jan 2022 Sheila B was going turn 65 In June 2022. Me and Nicklaus John wanted to start making plans and Ideas to celebrate Sheila B birthday. So Nicklaus John found out On Sheila B birthday the Philadelphia Phillies and the Arizona Diamond Back were playing baseball games in Philadelphia. we were both excited with Philadelphia Phillies were playing. Me and Nicklaus John are big Phillies fans since we were children and other Philly teams like the Philadelphia Eagles. Also I thought it was a great idea. I could pick up Herrs potato chips and ring bologna. I could pick up scrapple for RJ. RJ loves scrapple and I hate it.  Also go to Pats and Genos you guess right to pick up PHILLY CHEESESTREAK SANDWHICHES. I would pick up one of each. Also doing other fun vacation things to do in Philly. Me and Nicklaus John though this would be awesome plans. So Nicklaus John talked to Sheila B about the cool ideas for her 65th Birthday celebration. Sheila B said she needed to think about it. Now this I don't understand from Sheila B. Sheila B owns 2 kitties and when Sheila B would go out of town someone was able to look after or house guest to check up on her kitties. Both me and RJ have watch over  her  babies  the kitties with no issues. Her 1 friend has check up on her kitties. So Sheila B told me and Nicklaus John the reason Me and Sheila B couldn't go  to Philly because of  her girl kitty. Me and Nicklaus John were very upset that was the reason. Again it is Sheila B birthday she has a right to celebrate her  however she wants. That includes not having RJ apart of it. Fine with me.

Now Nicklaus John has decided to  come to Tucson. Both me and Nicklaus John decided to go to Arizona Diamond Back and LA Dodgers game. So Nicklaus John purchases the game tickets for us. I told Nicklaus John on that date and many times after that please let me know how much money l owe  for my ticket. I didn't expect to get them for free. Nicklaus John wouldn't tell me the price I owed him for my game ticket. Nicklaus John kept on telling me in his Philly accent FORGET ABOUT IT. Now Sheila B has been bugging me to pay for my baseball game tickets. I told Sheila B I keep on asking Nicklaus John each and every time how much the tickets so I can pay Nicklaus John back but he refuses to tell me how much l owed him. The only thing I got info for the game tickets. The game was on a Sunday no time when the game start.  So I figure it is an evening game because when I order baseball games their usually in the evening. I learn the day before it was an afternoon game to me no big deal. 

Day 4 Sunday THE BASEBALL GAME ISSUES Part 1

Here is the plan Me and Nicklaus were suppose to go to the baseball game. After the game Me and Nicklaus suppose to meet up with RJ at IN and OUT BURGER to have dinner. Nicklaus John never told me what time the game was or what time we were suppose to leave to go to Phoenix at all. So I had coffee and breakfast. After I ate breakfast and had my coffee. Nicklaus John inform me we are leaving in 15 minutes. I didn't have time to take a shower. So I didn't want to start an argument  at this point. I quickly got dressed to go to the baseball game. Sheila B handed Nicklaus John the money l have save up for this vacation. Not to me Nicklaus John. That pissed me off royally. Again I didn't want to get into a disagreement with Sheila B treating  me  like a 5 year old.

Now the drive to Phoenix you would think this is great a brother and sister on a short road trip. Guess what you would be so wrong. 

1. Nicklaus John was blasting the music in Sheila B. car. Nicklaus John told me I need to speak up so he can hear me. Nicklaus John had ear buds in his ears listening to the GPS and the blasting music at the same time.  So when I would speak to Nicklaus John he was accusing me of yelling at Nicklaus John. Which cause a disagreement with Me and Nicklaus John.  Nicklaus John was accusing me of yelling and getting mad at him for no reason.

2. I wasn't yelling at Nicklaus John. Trust me the music in Sheila B car was so loud l couldn't hear myself think at all it was beyond normal loud music. Being at a Rock concert was much quieter than  what Nicklaus John volume had it at.

3.. At this point Nicklaus John start to really yell at me. Nicklaus John was also cussing including saying F words at me. Now I just learn while yelling at me. Nicklaus John never ever mention to me he has a heart condition. Nicklaus John started accusing me possible heart problems he was having. So we pull over to gas station to hopefully settle Nicklaus John down. I went somewhere for me to have a smoke to calm my nerves I was having at this point. 

4. Nicklaus John started to yell at me about me smoking at this point l told Nicklaus John please leave me alone enough damage was done with the two of us.  Nicklaus John was acting like a dog with a bone wouldn't let go  with me smoking and his heart problems.  Mind you I never knew about his heart condition at all I was surprised to learn this. I asked him as calmly l could. Why didn't you tell me you have a heart condition. Nicklaus John said he didn't have to tell me because of HIPAA. He doesn't have to   tell me anything about his health problems.

5. I told Nicklaus John I think it is important to let your family being aware of health problems especially having heart trouble so we know how to help and handle the situation. If something happen to you Nicklaus John with your heart it is your fault for not telling your family. Nicklaus John got even more mad at me for a statement. I am sorry if I am an asshole for that statement but it is the truth.

6. Me and Nicklaus John and I got  back into car to go the baseball game. I didn't  talk or answer of anything he said to me. I just didn't want to be blamed if Nicklaus John would get a  heart attack. At this point I didn't want to take my chances with Nicklaus John at all. So we get to Phoenix and the Baseball Park. I took my purse. This point is important. I took this purse a year before going this game. We get to the baseball gate they wouldn't let me take my purse in the park because of a new rule l wasn't aware at the time had to be a clear purse.  So I ask Nicklaus John for the keys for the car. So I can take the purse in the car. Nicklaus John refused to let me have the key to car. Instead he had walk me back to the car like I was a little child to put my purse in the car and was yelling at me the whole to the car and baseball park.

7. At this point l couldn't enjoy myself at this game. I lost the love l had this day was gone from me at this point. The game was over the LA Dodgers won that game. So I couldn't wait to leave the baseball park and I was hoping IN and OUT BURGER would be a better time for us. I was hoping to salvage what was left of this day at this point. 

Day 4 IN and OUT BURGER part 2

1. Now here is plan with IN and OUT BURGER time. We are suppose to meet up with RJ at IN and OUT BURGER. Nicklaus John is asking me what the address of IN and OUT BURGER. I told Nicklaus John where IN and OUT BURGER was at. Nicklaus John GPS the wrong IN and OUT BURGER. So Nicklaus decided to get after me about the Job I have and I need to get a job like being a CEO some where. I told Nicklaus John stop it. I have a job. I paid Sheila B rent and other bills buy my own food. I still have money left over what is his issues with me with a job. You need to have this talk to Duster not me. Duster is homeless has no job no money unless some kind stranger gives him. Duster also has no goals. Except doing Illegal substance. So I had enough with this subject.

2. Nicklaus John blew up and his heart was acting up again. Again l was there I might be an asshole again. Nicklaus John I swear at this point he is putting himself to have heart issues. I am starting not to feel sorry for his heart problems. Than the GPS took me and Nicklaus John to wrong IN and OUT BURGER. Nicklaus John  started to yell at  about me with punctual. How people should show up 15 minutes early than anyone. After awhile he got the right address blame me for what the GPS did.

3. We finally get to IN and OUT BURGER. We saw RJ and meet up with RJ l hugged RJ at this point I felt relief at this point. I told RJ I was having a smoke and RJ knew what to order for me. I figure let RJ and Nicklaus John could catch up. So they did. After we got done eating I refused to talk to anyone including. Nicklaus John ask RJ to take me home so Nicklaus John left at this point.

4. RJ at this point asked what happen. I told RJ my side of what happen. I spent another hour with RJ than  he took me home.

If you're a fan of [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/) like I am, you love the power and transparency of plaintext accounting. But let's be honest, sometimes the manual entry can feel a bit... verbose.

Writing this out every time can slow you down, especially when you just want to quickly log a coffee purchase:

```beancount
2025-07-21 * ""morning coffee""
  Assets:Cash                          -5.0 USD
  Expenses:Food:Coffee                  5.0 USD
```

This was my motivation for creating **Beanquick**, a native Mac app with a single mission: to make entering double-entry bookkeeping transactions as fast and intuitive as possible. And I'm thrilled to announce it's now available on the Mac App Store!

### How does Beanquick work?

The core of Beanquick is a feature called **Quick Mode**, which lets you use a fast, natural language syntax that compiles into proper Beancount format.

To log that same coffee purchase, you just type this:

```beanquick
5 from:cash to:coffee |morning coffee
```

Beanquick instantly converts that into the full Beancount entry. The magic happens with **account aliases**, which you can configure in your settings to expand simple names into full accounts. For example:

* `cash` → `Assets:Cash`
* `coffee` → `Expenses:Food:Coffee`

### 🚀 The Real Power-Up: Templates

This is my favorite feature. For repetitive or complex transactions (like payday or credit card payments), you can create powerful shortcuts using the **Jinja2 templating engine**.

You define a template command, like `/coffee`, in your settings:

```jinja
{{ today }} * ""{{ narration | default('morning coffee') }}""
  Assets:Cash                    -{{ args[0] }} USD
  Expenses:Food:Coffee            {{ args[0] }} USD
```

Then, in Quick Mode, you just type:

`/coffee 5`

...and it expands into the full transaction. You can even pass named arguments to override the defaults:

`/coffee 5 narration=""iced latte""`

Templates can handle variables, logic, and automatic calculations, making them incredibly powerful for automating your bookkeeping.

---

### Where to Get It

**You can now download Beanquick for FREE directly from the Mac App Store!**

[**-> Get Beanquick on the Mac App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beanquick/id6748978029)

### We'd Love Your Feedback!

Beanquick is built for the Beancount, and I'd be thrilled to hear what you think.

* What are your first impressions?
* Which features would be most useful for your workflow?
* What would you like to see added in the future?

I was angry at him because I wanted to spend time with him and we were running out of time. He was on his phone and I think he didn’t listen. So I got mad and threw the coffee on the floor and yelled. He was mad but seemed ok because he started telling me how he’ll marry me and tattoo our names and have kids with me. Two days later he broke up because of the coffee and apparently he didn’t like my body count. This was my first time throwing something and I did apologize to him.

Hi, I won't say my name, but I will. I'm 18 years old (F) and the man in this story is 28(M)

This story begins in November 2023. I ended my first relationship. I was devastated, and all that pain lasted until December of that year. During that month, I entered a phase of forgetting that person. But at a New Year's party, everything got out of hand, and while I was drunk, I kissed my best friend's boyfriend. We never spoke about it again, and it only remained a kiss. But in May 2024, she contacted me on Facebook to ask if we could talk. It turns out my best friend had temporarily moved to a new city to prepare for college. She told me she'd be away for the next three months, but that wasn't the reason she contacted me. He told me he had several questions about what happened between us at the New Year's party and that, if I agreed, we could chat over coffee. I agreed without hesitation. I didn't suspect anything that day he picked me up in his car, he told me that he had to make a stop first, until that moment I didn't give it much importance but when I saw that the stop was his house I began to suspect but I convinced myself that it was just my ideas, when I arrived at his house he told me to go with him, I told him that I preferred to wait in the car, he left me in the car for 30 minutes then he told me that the plan to go for coffee was canceled that we would stay at his house since he was doing a project for the company he works for, then I entered and noticed that there was no one at home and he took me to his room, he finished his work and then we were watching a movie, I begin to feel that he approaches me and begins to touch my leg, he told me that he had the memory of the kiss and that he wanted to repeat it ... one thing led to another and we ended up doing it anyway we have been seeing each other ... now if the reason for this publication arrives in August 2024 his girlfriend returned to the city but only to stay the rest of the year, because this year she had plans to go to college, I wasn't jealous at all because I could also go out with other boys but everything got worse at the 2024 new years party he was with his girlfriend (my best friend) and I didn't want to spend this day alone so I invited a boy (who was a friend), it seems that he didn't like seeing me with this boy and the problems started, we fought for a week that's why I distanced myself from this boy because I prefer him and to top it off when his girlfriend went to college 16 hours away his jealousy increased he began to be controlling, manipulative and possessive he began to verbally and physically assault me he began to subdue me by force first he forced me to do things that I didn't like in s3x and escalated to taking me by force he has played very hard with my feelings and my psychology I depend emotionally on him, I am physically finished but I can't get away from him ... I know that what I did was wrong but I don't deserve all this and if that weren't enough his girlfriend found out and told everyone. Now everyone hates me. I can't go out without people gossiping, making fun of me, or giving me dirty looks... I'm seriously considering leaving the city just to relax and have peace, but that's only possible next year. Until then, I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm sinking further, and I repeat, I don't deserve this. People are so cruel. My best friend is so cruel. I never thought it would be like this with me.",2,1753416300.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

TW: religious trauma

I grew up in an extremely religious and mysoginist household. Imagine the most toxic neo-evangelical household you've ever met, and then dial that up to 11. I realized at 17 I was never going to be loved by my parents the way I should've been. Got kicked out at 20 because I bought a box of instant coffee with my own hard earned cash. Good grades, graduated with honors, was working a steady job right out of highschool with plans for college, but coffee was all it took. Crazy, right?It's a long story, but the short version ends with my entire extended family shunning me for leaving their weird cult-like church. Safe to say, I had captors, not loved ones.

I've spent the last 6 years almost completely alone. I've been proud of what I've accomplished without any help so far, but lately I'm realizing just how much I'm missing now that is almost impossible to repair alone. I'm trying to raise myself from scratch... But maybe I don't have to. It might be time to admit that maybe I do need help.

I just want to know what it feels like to be cared about by a parent unconditionally. What it would've felt like to have good parents instead of the kind who refused to help me with my homework because, 'women become stay at home mothers, and therefore it isn't important.' I have severe PTSD associated with the religious trauma now though unfortunately, so if you keep a Bible on your bedside table, you'd probably best move on and let someone else help. Otherwise, I might get worse instead of better.

It might be really healing, or something like that. Idk. It's worth a shot.

1m8pc82,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8pc82,The Unit Economics Masterclass: Are You Actually Making Money on Each Sale?,"Let’s be honest. As a business owner, you’re juggling a dozen different roles. You’re the CEO, the head of marketing, the lead salesperson, and sometimes, even the janitor. With so much on your plate, it’s easy to look at the big number in your bank account at the end of the month and think, “Okay, we’re profitable. We’re good.”

But what if I told you that this high-level view could be masking a critical problem? What if your best-selling product is actually losing you money with every single sale? What if your fastest-growing customer segment is secretly draining your resources?

This isn’t a scare tactic. It’s a reality for countless businesses that look successful on the surface but are built on a shaky foundation. They’re a ticking time bomb. On the other hand, the most durable, scalable, and wildly successful businesses have one thing in common: they have an obsessive, crystal-clear understanding of their **unit economics**.

Welcome to the masterclass. In this guide, we’re going to demystify the critical math that reveals if your business model is a goldmine or a time bomb. We'll ditch the confusing MBA jargon and give you a practical, step-by-step framework to understand if you are *actually* making money on each sale. This is the key to unlocking true **business profitability**.

# What in the World Are Unit Economics?

At its core, unit economics is stunningly simple. It’s the process of breaking down your business into its most basic component—a single “unit”—and analyzing the revenue and costs associated with that unit.

By doing this, you can answer the most fundamental question in business: **For every one thing I sell, am I making more money than it costs me to produce and sell it?**

If the answer is yes, your business has a path to sustainable growth. If the answer is no, you are effectively paying customers to take your product, and no amount of marketing or sales hustle can fix a broken model.

# So, What’s a “Unit”?

The first step is to define your “unit.” This will vary depending on your business model:

* **E-commerce Store:** Your unit is one product sold. If you sell shoes, your unit is one pair of shoes.
* **Coffee Shop:** Your unit is one item sold, most likely one cup of coffee.
* **SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) Company:** Your unit is one customer subscription, typically for a month or a year.
* **Consulting Agency:** Your unit is one billable hour or one project.
* **Marketplace (like Etsy or Airbnb):** Your unit is one transaction completed on the platform.

The key is to choose the most logical, repeatable building block of your business. For the rest of this article, we’ll focus on the most common models: e-commerce, physical retail, and SaaS.

# The Golden Metric: Contribution Margin

Once you’ve defined your unit, you need to find your **contribution margin**. This is the single most important number in your unit economics analysis.

The contribution margin tells you exactly how much profit you make from one sale *before* accounting for your fixed costs (like rent, salaries, and insurance). These fixed costs, often called “overhead,” are the expenses you have to pay regardless of how many units you sell.

The formula is simple:

**Contribution Margin = Revenue per Unit - Variable Costs per Unit**

Let’s break that down.

* **Revenue per Unit:** This is the easy part. It’s simply how much you charge for one unit.
* **Variable Costs per Unit:** This is where the real work is. These are the costs that go up and down in direct proportion to the number of units you sell. If you sell zero units, your variable costs are zero.

Identifying all your variable costs is the most critical step. Business owners often miss a few, which completely skews their understanding of profitability.

# Example 1: The E-commerce T-Shirt Shop

Let’s say you run an online store selling custom-designed t-shirts for **$30 each**. That’s your **Revenue per Unit**.

Now, let’s hunt down the variable costs for selling *one* t-shirt:

* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
   * Blank t-shirt: $5.00
   * Printing cost: $4.00
* **Transaction Fees:**
   * Credit card processing (e.g., 2.9% + $0.30 of the $30 sale): $1.17
* **Shipping & Fulfillment:**
   * Box or mailer: $0.50
   * Shipping label: $4.50
   * Packing labor (if you pay someone per package): $1.00
* **Marketing Costs (per sale):**
   * This can be tricky, but a common way is to use your average Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) from your ad campaigns. Let’s say you spend $500 on Facebook ads and get 50 sales. Your CPA is $10 per sale.

Now, let’s add up our **Total Variable Costs per Unit**: $5.00 (shirt) + $4.00 (printing) + $1.17 (fees) + $0.50 (box) + $4.50 (shipping) + $1.00 (labor) + $10.00 (marketing) = **$26.17**

Finally, we can calculate the contribution margin: $30.00 (Revenue) - $26.17 (Variable Costs) = **$3.83**

**The Verdict:** For every t-shirt you sell, you make **$3.83**. This $3.83 is what’s left over to contribute to paying your fixed costs (website hosting, software subscriptions, your salary, etc.) and, eventually, become pure profit.

You can immediately see how powerful this is. What if your shipping was $1 more? Your profit per shirt would drop by over 25%. What if your ad costs creep up to $14 per sale? You’d be losing money on every single shirt sold. You now have the levers you can pull to improve your **business profitability**.

# Example 2: The Local Coffee Shop

Now let’s imagine you own a coffee shop. Your most popular item is a latte, which you sell for **$5.00**. That’s your **Revenue per Unit**.

What are the variable costs for one latte?

* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
   * Coffee beans: $0.40
   * Milk: $0.30
   * Cup, lid, and sleeve: $0.25
   * Sugar/syrup (average): $0.10
* **Transaction Fees:**
   * Credit card processing (e.g., 2.9% + $0.30 of the $5.00 sale): $0.45
* **Wasted materials (spoilage):** It's wise to add a small buffer for waste. Let's say 5% of your COGS: $0.05

Let’s add up our **Total Variable Costs per Unit**: $0.40 + $0.30 + $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.45 + $0.05 = **$1.55**

Now for the contribution margin: $5.00 (Revenue) - $1.55 (Variable Costs) = **$3.45**

**The Verdict:** Every latte sold contributes **$3.45** towards paying for your rent, utilities, barista salaries, and other fixed costs. This is a very healthy margin! This analysis might lead you to realize that while lattes are great, drip coffee (with a lower COGS) might have an even better contribution margin, and you could run a promotion to encourage its sale.

# The Special Case: Unit Economics for SaaS Businesses

For subscription businesses, the game is a bit different, but the principles of **unit economics** are even more critical. Here, the ""unit"" is the customer, and the analysis revolves around two key **SaaS metrics**: Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** This is the total cost of sales and marketing required to acquire a single new customer.
   * **Formula:** (Total Sales & Marketing Spend over a Period) / (Number of New Customers Acquired in that Period)
   * *Example:* If you spent $10,000 on marketing and sales last month and acquired 100 new customers, your CAC is $100.
* **Lifetime Value (LTV):** This is the total revenue you can expect to generate from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship with your company.
   * **Formula (simple version):** (Average Revenue Per Account or ARPA) / (Customer Churn Rate)
   * **Churn Rate** is the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions each month.
   * *Example:* Your customers pay an average of $30/month (your ARPA). You find that each month, 2% of your customers cancel (your monthly churn rate).
   * LTV = $30 / 0.02 = **$1,500**

# The LTV:CAC Ratio: The Holy Grail of SaaS

The magic happens when you compare these two numbers. The LTV:CAC ratio tells you the return on your investment for acquiring each customer.

**LTV:CAC Ratio = Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost**

Using our examples: LTV = $1,500 CAC = $100 LTV:CAC Ratio = $1,500 / $100 = **15:1**

**The Verdict:** For every $1 you spend to get a new customer, you get $15 back over their lifetime. This is an absolutely phenomenal, world-class ratio.

* **A ratio less than 1:1** is a catastrophe. You’re losing money.
* **A ratio of 1:1** means you’re breaking even on each customer. Not a business.
* **A ratio of 3:1** is widely considered the benchmark for a healthy, sustainable SaaS business.
* **A ratio of 5:1 or higher** suggests you have a powerful growth engine and should probably be investing *more* aggressively in marketing to grow faster.

Understanding your LTV:CAC ratio is non-negotiable for a SaaS business. It dictates your marketing budget, your pricing strategy, and your entire growth model.

# How to Use Unit Economics to Make Smarter Decisions

Calculating your contribution margin is not just an academic exercise. It’s a strategic tool that empowers you to build a better business.

**1. Optimize Your Pricing Strategy:** Is your contribution margin too thin? You might need to raise your prices. Many business owners are terrified of price increases, but if your unit economics show you’re barely breaking even, a small bump can dramatically improve your viability. A $2 price increase on the t-shirt from our example would more than double its profitability per unit.

**2. Get Smarter with Marketing Spend:** Knowing your contribution margin per unit (or LTV for SaaS) tells you exactly how much you can afford to spend to acquire a customer. If your t-shirt only generates $3.83 in profit, you know you can’t afford to spend $10 on Google Ads to get a sale. This forces you to find more efficient marketing channels, like SEO, content marketing, or email marketing.

**3. Attack Your Variable Costs:** Lay out every single variable cost in a spreadsheet. Can you find a cheaper t-shirt supplier without sacrificing quality? Can you negotiate a better rate with your shipping carrier? Can you switch credit card processors to one with lower fees? A 5% reduction in variable costs often flows directly to your bottom line.

**4. Identify Your Most Profitable Products & Customers:** Don’t assume your best-selling product is your most profitable. Run the unit economics for every product you sell. You might discover that a less popular, higher-margin item is your hidden gem. You can then feature this product more prominently on your website or in your store.

Similarly, analyze different customer cohorts. Are customers from Facebook ads less valuable over their lifetime than customers from organic search? This knowledge allows you to focus your resources where they will generate the highest return.

# Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

* **Be Brutally Honest with Costs:** Don't forget the ""small"" stuff. Packing tape, payment fees, software plugins—they all add up. The more granular you are, the more accurate your picture will be.
* **Separate Variable vs. Fixed Costs:** A common mistake is lumping costs together. Your web designer's monthly retainer is a fixed cost. The cost of shipping a product is a variable cost. Keep them separate. Your contribution margin should *only* include variable costs.
* **Revisit Your Numbers Regularly:** Your costs are not static. Your shipping rates will change, your supplier prices will increase, and your ad costs will fluctuate. You should re-calculate your unit economics at least quarterly, and especially before any major pricing or marketing decisions.
* **Don't Forget Returns and Discounts:** Factor in the cost of returns and the impact of discount codes. If 5% of your t-shirts are returned, that’s a cost you need to account for in your overall model.

# Conclusion: From Guesswork to Goldmine

Understanding your unit economics is like turning the lights on in your business. You move from hopeful guesswork to data-driven clarity. You stop focusing on vanity metrics like gross revenue and start focusing on what truly matters: building a profitable, sustainable engine for growth.

The math isn't complicated, but its impact is profound. It gives you a framework for every strategic decision you make, from pricing and marketing to operations and product development.

So take an afternoon. Define your unit. Hunt down every single variable cost. Calculate your contribution margin. The number you find will be the most honest and powerful metric in your entire business. It will tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, whether you’re sitting on a time bomb or digging for gold. And it will give you the map to ensure you’re building a true goldmine.

----

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/ir8QCV88mM): **July 17, 2025**

I (30F) have been with my fiancé (30M) for 12 years. We met in school, got engaged 2 years ago and have a 5-year-old daughter together.

He’s a kind man at heart, but he’s a workaholic. Over the past few years, he’s become more and more consumed by work, often staying up late, waking at 3am to work again, falling asleep on the sofa most nights. I’ve asked for help repeatedly but nothing changes.

I work full-time, study in the evenings, exercise to manage stress, and I’m the default parent, every routine, every meltdown, every bedtime, every household task. He promises to help and then just… doesn’t.

**Example:** The other night he said he’d put our daughter to bed. At 9:30, I found him snoring while she watched cartoons on his phone after he gave her chocolate before bed. She was wired until 10:30PM and I had to take over again.

Last night, I broke down crying. He asked if I wanted to talk. I said no. I was too exhausted to speak and he just went to sleep on the sofa again.

I came downstairs after studying, saw him still asleep (dishes not done like he promised he would do) and quietly took off my engagement ring and left it on the table.

This morning, I got a long message from him. He says he now truly sees the damage, that he’s been emotionally shut down from his own trauma, that he’s been in a dark place and taking me for granted. He says he’ll go to therapy, change how he works, show up better, and is asking for 30 days to prove himself.

And now… I’m torn.

Part of me wants to believe him. It’s everything I’ve wanted him to say, months ago. But another part of me feels like it’s too late. I’ve been holding it all together alone for too long. I’m tired, hurt, and honestly unsure if I even want to try anymore.

So Reddit, I need advice:

Can people really change after years of emotional absence?

Has anyone tried a “trial period” like this? Did it help or just delay the inevitable?

How do I protect myself (and my daughter) emotionally if I do give him this time?

I’m not wearing the ring anymore. I haven’t promised anything. I’m just trying to figure out if there’s anything left worth saving or if I’ve already outgrown this version of us.

Thanks for reading. Any insight or experience is deeply appreciated.

**Edit / FAQ:** Thanks for all the responses so far. I just wanted to answer a few common questions that keep coming up:

1) Does he work extra hours because we need the money? No. We could live off my salary alone. We have everything we need, a house with a low mortgage, no car payments, and no major debts. His extra hours don’t bring in extra pay (he’s salaried). He’s a project manager at a large corporate firm and is working toward yet another promotion. He’s a “yes man” at work, always overextending himself even when it means logging on in the middle of the night. He says it’s for the family, but truthfully, it’s about career ambition and people-pleasing.

2) Have I helped him with his trauma? This is the first time he’s ever opened up about trauma. I knew his childhood was a bit rough, but for years he insisted it didn’t affect him. Now, suddenly, it’s being named as a reason for his emotional disconnection. I’m not minimizing it. I understand trauma is real but until now, it was completely buried and never talked about.

3) Have I brought this up before? Yes. Over and over. I’ve told him clearly, calmly, even desperately, what I needed. He always says he’s “helping” by working so hard. And if he does the dishes or takes our daughter to bed once in a while, he wants a medal. He genuinely believes he’s doing enough because his intentions are good but good intentions don’t carry a household.

4) Context on my life/career: I work in a law firm (it’s often very stressful), and I’m currently sitting my FE1 exams which are the Irish equivalent of the Bar. I could have qualified years ago, but I kept putting my own career goals on the back burner to support his. Every time he needed flexibility, space, late nights I gave it. I don’t regret supporting him, but I do regret losing myself in the process.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You told him, repeatedly, that you were unhappy. He didn’t take steps to change until it impacted HIS potential happiness/comfort.

Leaving the ring on the table was you saying “Too late, I’m done “. And now he promises change?

Where was all this when you were begging for help?

He doesn’t listen when you tell him there is a problem. Not until you make it his problem. Is this really the relationship you want? Because it’s the one you’ve got.

**Commenter 2:** 30 days isn't going to prove anything. He can turn it on for 30 days, but that doesn't mean it's going to last beyond that. What's 30 days against however many YEARS of this behavior from him?

**Commenter 3:** Honestly emotional trauma - therapy and 30 days don't mix. He saw the damage, just ignored it. Now he's just sorry you're putting your foot down. At least that's what it looks like to me.

**Commenter 4:** This has been a problem for a long time. You've told him about it multiple times. If he wanted to change, he would have. He's had plenty of chances.

He's only talking about changing now because his inaction is about to deliver consequences. It was never important until it was about to affect him. It was never important to him. All your requests and complaints and troubles were not important to him. Think about that. This is nothing new. You didn't drop a bomb on him with information he didn't have before. He knew. It wasn't important to him.

Don't listen to the sounds coming out of his mouth. He can say anything he wants. If you want to stick it out a little bit longer, watch his actions. Tell him what you want, but don't lift a finger to help him do it. You want him to go to therapy? Then he makes the appointments, and he goes - or he doesn't. You want him to help around the house? You can suggest basic directions, but then watch what he chooses to do. The same with parenting. Let him know when it's his turn and then watch what he does.

If he really wants to change, he will step up. Otherwise, he will offer excuses. If he steps up, great! Still watch, because if the excuses come back, it must not have been that important to him.

And if you're honestly done? Go ahead and be done. He could have made these changes at any time. It wasn't important to him. You don't have to stick around.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/BVSMDoZFAW): **July 18, 2025 (next day)**

Thanks to everyone who responded to my original post. Your advice and outside perspective really helped me see things clearly.

We were supposed to talk tonight, just one honest conversation to see if there was anything left to save. But he fell asleep putting our daughter to bed and never came down. No message. No effort.

That moment confirmed what I’ve been feeling deep down for a while. I’ve been holding this relationship together alone. Giving chances. Getting my hopes up and being let down every single time.

To be fair, over the past two days he did try. He was suddenly being the partner I’ve been asking for. He cleaned without being asked, made me coffee (which he rarely did), and sent me long, apologetic texts. He acknowledged how much he’s hurt me and even told me he booked a therapy session for Monday.

But the truth is, I feel like it’s too late. It took me reaching my breaking point for him to react. And even now, when we finally had a chance to talk, he fell asleep again. He’ll wake up in our daughter’s bed and find the message I sent, telling him that I’m done.

I don’t even want to speak to him at this point, though I know I’ll have to for the sake of our daughter. I’m hurt, exhausted, and emotionally checked out. After 12 years together, and five of those raising a child, I’ve hit a point where love has turned into resentment. I don’t recognise us anymore.

I know this won’t be easy. But I also know it’s necessary. I need peace. I need clarity and I need to stop trying to fix something that’s been broken for far too long.

Thank you again to everyone who helped me feel less alone in this. It meant more than you know.

tl;dr: Fiancé and I (both 30) have been together for 12 years and have a 5-year-old daughter. He’s a kind man but a workaholic who’s been emotionally and practically absent for a long time. I reached my limit. He made a last-minute effort the past two days, cleaned, made coffee, booked therapy. But tonight, when we were meant to talk, he fell asleep again. I sent him a message ending it. I’m heartbroken but also at peace. I can’t carry this alone anymore.

**Commenter 1:** I have had this happen also - they do everything you've ever asked of them when they know you are done. They think this helps.

What they don't realize as it just **PISSES US OFF EVEN MORE** because now **WE KNOW** they knew what and how to do what we asked for all along, **they just DID NOT CARE** until we are walking out the door. TOO F\*CKING LATE AH!!!

**Commenter 2:** Spoiler alert:  He won’t change.

**Commenter 3:**

Oh for two whole days? No.

Also, this means he was capable all along but just didn't want to. Do with that what you will.

Hey fam! 🌟 So, can we all agree that sometimes showing our faces feels like climbing Mount Everest in flip-flops? Seriously, how many times have we thought, “I just want to sit in my pajamas and let the magic happen”? ✨ But guess what? Just because we’re opting for a more faceless approach doesn’t mean we’re sacrificing the gains! Let’s chat about some growth strategies that are actually working in Q2 without requiring us to dazzle the world with our fabulous mugs.

Here’s the deal: in this digital age, there are tons of ways to create content and grow our businesses 🤷‍♂️—and they don’t all revolve around us personally being the star of the show. **Let’s break down some killer faceless strategies that can seriously bank you some gains this quarter!** 

### 1. **Content Automation is Your BFF**  
Why work 10 times harder when you can work smarter? Tools like AIContentAutomators are a game-changer. (Side note: if you haven’t checked it out yet, you’re missing out. Just sayin’! 💁‍♀️) Here’s what you can do: 
- Use AI to churn out blog posts, social media updates, and email newsletters. 
- Schedule them so you can basically set it and forget it. 

### 2. **Leverage Stock Footage and Graphics**  
Let’s face it, not all of us are natural-born videographers. But that doesn’t mean we can’t create stunning visuals! 
- Websites like Unsplash or Pexels provide incredible stock images for FREE. 
- Use platforms like Canva to add your branding or text over these images to make them feel uniquely yours without needing a personal photo shoot.

### 3. **Engage with Your Community**  
While we might not be putting our faces out there, building relationships is still crucial. 
- Create polls, quizzes, or even fun challenges to get your audience talking. 
- People love sharing their opinions! Why not prompt them to engage even more without the need to show off our selfies? 

### 4. **Utilize Voiceovers and Narration**  
Do you have a voice? (I’m not talking about the one in your head, but hey, if it’s motivating you, more power to you!) 
- Pick a niche where you can narrate scripts or use text-to-speech options to convert written content into audio. 
- This can be an excellent opportunity for creating podcasts or tutorial videos without that front-facing pressure. 

### 5. **Focus on Building a Brand**  
Don’t get too caught up in the personal brand aspect. Shift your focus to your **business brand**. 
- Craft a unique brand voice that people can resonate with.
- Share behind-the-scenes content without having to show yourself! Show your desk setup, your quirky coffee mug, or your pet getting involved in your workday. 

So, are you feeling fired up about leveraging these faceless strategies? Imagine being able to build growth while relaxing in your PJs or, let’s be honest, binge-watching your favorite series. 📺

I’m throwing this out because the last two times I went by for some 7 everything oddly lined up.

I can’t lie I was asking for some sort of guidance from my Father “The universe maker”

And oddly enough I had been able to see you talk to you and then….Intrusion….i didn’t take it as bad he was doing his job and you had just happen to say hi.

But thinking back anytime I come by you pop out or try and say hi.

You tell everyone Mr.C… is a great guy

Oh that’s Mr.c

While it’s odd hearing someone call me Mr.

I know you’re just being respectful.

I like that but the first time we talked I complimented your neckless I thought it was Sumerian and you had corrected me and I already forgot but it was months ago.

I did complement your goddess neckless.

It reminded me of the fertility Goddess but more so reminded me of deans neckless.

You know from supernatural.

But I just wanted to say I appreciate seeing you and having someone seem interested in talking or seeing me.

I’m very guarded and it wasn’t weird or anything now I seek it in return but I’m definitely cautious you know my name and speak so highly of me it seems even to co workers I leave after getting my coffee and my ear burns the good side…so I believe maybe it’s you talking to your coworker the one that was very overly nice but I wasn’t even looking towards her I turned that corner saw you and….Damn…🙃 

Here I am writing this getting high and forgot about my food….but it’s been a long time since someone threw me off like this it’s hard when I’m so guarded.

Maybe your just being nice is what I convince myself that it’s just part of your job.

That’s it your nice and friendly because your job?

Sorry I’m just confused slightly because you made a joke….so this gives it away big time….you had asked if it was me because I didn’t get the Banana Bread. Instead I got my old drink I didn’t drink 24/7 like the banana bread.

But yea this is how I’m gonna work through it.

Don’t get me wrong I definitely wanted to go back and see about talking to you more but that’s weird…

Even though we had laughed about me being a doppelgänger because I didn’t get the banana bread. My response was no it’s just me…..you continued and I responded with…. as far as I know I don’t have a doppelgänger and you laughed.

I kind of laughed slightly inside because you hit 6 instead of 5 and I’ve done that kind of thing on any touch screen.

So leaving this here and telling myself it’s just you being kind and expressing yourself at work. 

It doesn’t mean we had any chemistry or anything.

If we did I would like to understand it better.

Only time will be the judge but writing it helps the best I would love to be that guy that makes you feel special for going out of my way and coming back just to talk to you.

However without  better understanding I don’t want to be that weird guy that comes through and makes it awkward.


😬 Yikes but this is interesting definitely asked for some kind of clarification with you.  I prayed and each time I saw you.

Each time you got busy or the other employee out spoke you and wouldn’t let you say almost anything to me and I was just like….but I would have rather talked to her first…that’s another thing you know my first and last name…..I don’t need to know but I’d like to know besides referring to you in my own words as “Her” 

I’ll do the only thing I know that leads my sails…..Pray….Ask God and have him lead me.  I’ve been stranded for quite some time.

But I’ve asked prayed and been reading my bible more then what’s been common for myself.

The more devotion I show the more of a response on guidance I seem to be getting buts it’s just very strange how everything is going Smoothly that’s the thing I’ve heard….


If it’s a door from god there isn’t any discomfort it’s easy and smooth comfortable.


If it’s something that’s uncomfortable or causes you grief it’s probably not a door from god.


Using this and asking with obedience I’ve started to get alot of guidance.


Just FYI this is my perspective and my experience.

I was confused because he's not at all a coffee chain drinker, much more Starbucks. Masaya na siya sa instant coffee and Nono's lang yung gusto niyang kape from outside. Tsaka ano yung praf/prap?

This is the first time I've made an attempt for some sort of help and advice with my life.

For starters, I came from nothing. A broken home that led to many foster homes.

 If there's one thing I've learnt in life is to cherish what you earn and even as a kid I did so, maybe I cherish things to much since I never had anything has a kid.
 I've completed a lot of goals over the years such as owning a house, having a good laying job and children. My house has always been my biggest accomplishment and I was super proud of it, however my two children and my wife seem to take things for granted and always have. Basically anything and everything has been broken one way or another toilets, the tub, all the closet doors, a 3 thousand dollar oled TV, a ps5, the walls, the fridge, the dishwasher (I've replaced them but they are continuously being abused), some cupboards (literally ripped off the hinges) they've went through 4 tables, my daughter has went through 3 beds and god knows how many sheets and blankets, multple coffee tables. The wife has destroyed multiple of ours as well.

I work away 6 months of the year (2 week on and 2 off) so this all usually happens when Im away. Im listing only a few things here. My house is fucked and I probably have 20-30 thousand dollars worth of damage from the 5 years we've lived there. My daughter is 11, the son 5 and the wife seems like a toddler as well. Ive given many ultimatum of how sick of it I am. I try to take care of anything I own.

I've wanted to replace or fix it all but what's the point when something is broken a week later. Plus its getting to a stage I can't afford these things anymore. Life is to expensive and Im just at my wits end.

My kids are also extremely hard to deal with. I feel the house is so loud and full of negativity. I try to teach my kids how to do things the right way or what I consider is the right way but when I leave for work everything is back to 0 when I return. They get 0 discipline when Im gone and the electronics become their baby sitter. 

I've gotten to a point where I can't even move anymore, all I think about is how dissapointed I am with how my life seems to have ended up. I always thought I wouldn't always have to live in misery or some kind of abuse.

Maybe Im over reacting and Im the one who's fucked up, maybe this is normal? How the fuck am I to know. I guess thts why Im reaching out, this is me venting and I need an opinion. 

I've thought about running away and leaving it all just for some form of peace but what kind of person would I be to do that to my kids. I feel they can be corrected and maybe its just my wife I need to leave. But then again how would she survive without me when Im the source of income. 

Im angry all the time and frustrated. This is all I ever think about. I love my kids but I feel a deep hate towards my wife on why nothing changes. The hundreds of conversations we've had about it. 

Am I making this all about me and not considering them? 

Like I said Im not good with writing. Maybe someone can understand what Im trying to get across. Im done with having to be angry all the time, or the bad dad that has to the only one telling his kids no.

A year ago, I was overweight, unhealthy, po\*n addict and not doing much with my life. After the breakup, I decided to join the gym and focus on becoming better. I stopped drinking and eating junk food and stopped all my bad habits. ***Ya'll are welcome to visit my profile and judge my photos lol***

In ten months, I got fit and in best shape of my life. I started getting attention and I have been told I look better than before. I feel I can't just use the moment for my favor. I feel I have some kind of part time social anxiety when I am around people.

Weekdays 5 days a week I am busy at work and gym. I only get go outside on weekends like dance class and coffee shops where i read books. In dance studio I enjoy dancing, but when I’m in a room full of strangers (mostly women), I don’t always feel like myself. It’s like I shrink a bit instead of opening up and unable to talk to anyone. Most people in dance studio know each other.

I do get attention in my regular coffee shops, but I just don't approach anyone, and I also don't want to be recognized by staff as guy who keeps hitting on chicks on same coffee shop. People in work find me entertaining as i know them since 3 years. Its just hard to break ice with new people these days. I am trying to read books that help me to go out of comfort zones and help on avoiding small talk.

So far in last 7 months I have only approached 3 girls and all from gym.  So far 1 gave her number, other two had boyfriend. The chick I got number I really lost interest on her as we kept talking small talk in gym and I got frustrated. I don't think gym is a great place to do all this thing lol.

Some days I feel outgoing, confident, and can hold great conversations. But other days, my social battery is so low that even if I get the chance to talk to someone attractive, I just make small talk and walk away. I don’t really know why it happens. I am really lost as of now as nothing is happening anyway. Dating apps are waste of time at this point. I feel it's better outside to try than dating apps lol.

1m8ou43,https://i.redd.it/yl4puljhxxef1.jpeg,"Cardinal Scents, Andromeda’s Curse and Adventuress Soap Co Sample Review","Hello everyone! This is my first review post ever, I’m really new to indie perfumes and perfumes in general. I decided on a whim to check Etsy for perfume one day in late May and ended up stumbling into this side of fragrance. I ordered some samples from Cardinal Scents, Andromeda’s Curse, and Adventuress Soap Co. They arrived mid June and me and some friends got together to smell them from the bottle. After that, I began testing them on my skin, one sample per day, and rating them on a scale from 1 to 10. I’ve decided to share my ratings and some thoughts I had about each scent because it looked fun.

On my scale, scores 5 and above meant a perfume smelled nice and scores 8 and above meant that I’d be interested in buying a large one!

**Cardinal Scents**

Gentle Reader (old book pages, vanillin, orris butter, vintage amber): This was the first perfume of the samples I tried on my skin and I was instantly in love. It smells exactly like yellowed old paperbacks, with a hint of smoke like someone read them by the fireplace. I was so amazed that such a specific smell could be captured in a perfume. This was my first and only **10/10** from this round of sampling. I put it in my cart the same day!

Kitchen Table (bread, woodsmoke, labdanum, benzoin): This one was surprising to me. I think that my skin really brought out the other ingredients other than the bread and smoke. I wasn’t too familiar with benzoin or labdanum so I had to look them up, but from descriptions online, they seemed to be the things I smelled the most. It smelled really sweet and like flowers to me. Oddly enough my dog loved this one. He kept shoving his face against my wrist and trying to lick it. I didn’t let him because I don’t know if perfume is bad for dogs. I was a bit disappointed, I really wanted to smell like bread. I rated it a **5/10** because it still smelled nice, just not how I wanted.

Night Owl (rain, jasmine, ivy, bergamot): Night Owl gave me a flashback like that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes one bite and goes back to his mother’s house. For me, this scent took me back to being about 3 years old, sitting in the cool night air on the porch with my dad. Something about that combination of flowers just smelled exactly like the night air at that time in my life. No one else in my family had that reaction to it, but they agreed that it smelled very nice and listened to me rave about it. To me, it had a very “purple” smell, like if the essence of the color was made into a smell. By the end of the day I think I got more rain and bergamot than ivy and jasmine. This was a **9/10** for me and also instantly went in the cart for a larger size.

Ink Blot (amber, vanilla, cedar, bergamot): I shot myself in the foot a bit with this one by trying to apply it from the sample while running out the door for work in the morning. I ended up accidentally putting way too much on, which I think contributed to a lot more sneezing and overwhelm than I would have felt from dabbing a smaller amount. Something about this perfume gave me my faintest allergy symptoms, like I was visiting the house of a friend with a cat, but the cat was in another room. I washed most of it off while going about my work day, and by the end of the day it faded to a similar  sweetness to Kitchen Table. Ink Blot was actually a freebie included in my order and I’m grateful I was able to try it! But I gave it a **6/5** because while I liked how it faded, it took a long time to agree with me.

Morning Paper (coffee, newsprint, palo santo, sandlewood): This one felt like a push to get things done. I put it on and was almost instantly motivated to clean off my desk, remake my bed more neatly, and start laundry. It smelled like a nice latte that wasn’t too sweet or too bitter, and like a fresh newspaper. I felt like I could smell the ink super clearly. This scent would make a good scent for school and studying for me, I hope it keeps that productive feeling to it with the full size. Because I’m getting that full size alright! I rated this one an **8/10** because I kind of wished I could smell the woods a bit more but the coffee and newspaper were lovely on their own. This was another kind freebie, thank you Haley Dee!

Familiar Spirit (milk, white sage, sea salt, amber): This one surprised me as well. I don’t know why, but I felt like the milk would be less literal. But that actually smelled like milk to me. There was a point while it was drying where the sage was way stronger than everything else, which kind of hyped me up because I love sage. But unfortunately, after that point, the smell kept shifting between a pleasant herbal scent with milk, and a slightly soured smell, like milk that’s been out too long. I can’t tell if it was something with my skin or with my brain or what. But I was kind of heartbroken. But sad enough as I was about how the smell shifted, my dog really liked this one too! I was glad he enjoyed it. I rated this one a 7/10 at the beginning of the day, but it’s more like a **5/10** now that I’ve gone a full day with it. This scent was also a freebie, and I was lucky to be able to try it, Familiar Spirit was actually on my list to try from Cardinal Scents at some point.

**Andromeda’s Curse**

Goblin Market (figs, plums, pomegranates, pears, peaches, apples, black cherry,long grass, musk, vetiver): This perfume broke my fantasy-loving heart and gave me some fantasy racism towards goblins. If I were a fantasy villager and I heard the goblins were having a market in my town, I’d take to the river boats and flee if they smelled like this. This scent is one that I’m sure my skin chemistry completely ruined because I spilled some on my phone case and it stayed smelling fruity and nice. On my skin, this one started fruity, but quickly became sickening. Some overwhelming scent took over the fruits and made my stomach hurt and my eyes water. Even tilting my head down towards my hands sent a new wave of nausea over my body. I suspect the musk, simply because the overwhelming smell didn’t smell much like grass or vetiver. A **3/10** just because I liked how it smelled wet on my skin before it turned evil and sinister.

Sea of Trees (hinoki wood, bamboo, black musk, cedarwood, agarwood, incense): I ended up building up this one in my mind as some magical experience. I thought the bamboo would make this perfume smell so fresh and green, and the hinoki would lend its sweet and bright scent more to the overall scent. However, when I put on Sea of Trees, it smelled like soap and incense, and then just incense. I was sad that the incense overran the whole smell for me. Unfortunately, there were a lot of strong food smells at my work today too, so the whole scent took on a kind of BO quality with the incense and the air around it. Hinoki is one of my favorite woods to smell, so I was especially bummed that I couldn’t catch even a whiff from this perfume. I’ll keep my eyes out for a fresh hinoki scent that’s more like what I imagined. This was a **7/10** to me because the incense smell itself wasn’t too bad. I still wouldn’t full size though.

The Sun (lemon, orange, neroli, green fig, musk): This perfume was citrusy and very nice when I first put it on. I was worried it would smell like lemon soap, especially since we use lemon scented soaps a lot in my house, but it wasn't like that. It was sweet and very subtle on me. By the end of the day, the zestiness of the lemon and orange were faded and I think I was just getting the neroli. I was bummed with how it faded, I found it really pleasant but wasn't sure if I'd regularly use a large bottle often enough to warrant rating it above a 7. So after some debate and some outside input, I rated it a **7/10**. 

Tempestarii (thunderstorm, muddy dirt, wet grass): I loved this in the bottle and on my skin. It smelled perfectly like dirt, rain, and wet plants. It was kind of ironic, my town almost always smells like it's been rained on because it rains almost constantly, but I tried this on a rare warm sunny day. I was really really delighted with it, it was so much more accurate than I expected in the best way possible. I rated this a **9/10** and will definitely be getting a big one to wear often. 

The Magician (sage, bergamot, anise, tobacco smoke, dusty books, dragons blood, cedarwood, oakmoss): I was pretty nervous to try this one. It was described as ""masculine"" on Andromeda's Curse's Etsy, and I thought that maybe that meant it would smell like oversprayed Axe body spray in a high school weight room. But my love of sage drove me to add it to my cart anyway, and I'm so glad I did. This perfume went through many gorgeous phases throughout the day. It started off with the bergamot and anise I believe, it smelled bright and kind of spicy. A few hours after drying, it smelled like a super realistic version of rained on plants. It was my town's usual weather that day so I went outside and experienced my smell completely blending in with the air around me. It was amazing. By the evening, the main smells I could sense were the sage and tobacco smoke, both smells I adore and find comfort in. The Magician was easily a **9/10** for me. 

Vega, Deneb, and Altair (orange blossoms, honeyed peaches, watermelon slices): This scent was kindly included as a freebie with the other samples. It's not one that I think I would have chosen myself, mainly because I don't really like watermelons. I don't like eating watermelon and I never gave much thought to the smell. However, this perfume smelled almost exactly like a hand soap to me. It was floral and sweet and soapy, but like an expensive hand soap that someone picked because it was a favorite. I didn't mind it but I thought to myself that I didn't necessarily want to smell like soap all the time. But I'm still thankful that I learned this about my tastes for the future. I rated this a solid **7/10** and will likely use the rest of the sample anyway because it was pleasant and more subtle and ""normal"" than some of my favorites. 

**Adventuress Soap Co**

Blueberry Boba (blueberry, thyme, lavender, vanilla): This scent was very artificial on me. It smelled like some kind of candy, my first thought was Smarties. I'm sure this is just the type of scent that would be right for someone, but I was definitely not that person. I couldn't stand it and washed it off after a few hours. I rated it a **4/10**.

Strawberry Matcha Lemonade (matcha, strawberry, lemonade): Remember when I said I used a lot of lemon soaps earlier? This is exactly what I meant. It smelled like straight up lemon soap. I remember thinking that if I wanted to smell like lemon hand soap, I could just go wash my hands. I rated it a **5/10**.

Blushing Boba (peony, peach, citrus zest): I thought this one smelled like a perfume I would have tried out as a tween in the grocery store and really liked, before remembering that ""I'm not like other girls"" and quickly putting the bottle back down before someone caught me being feminine. It smells fine and I can see why people would like it, but with my current tastes, I wasn't a huge fan. I rated it a **5/10**

Night Market (ginger, amber, coconut): There must have been some poor reaction with my skin to the ginger or coconut because this perfume was just as bad as The Goblin Market on me. It got sour and bitter and also gave me a stomachache and a headache. I had to quickly scrub it off. I have terrible luck with perfumes with Market in the name I guess. I rated it a **3/10** for the poor reaction with my skin. I think I've had poor luck with this house in general, and will not be trying anything from them again. 

This was my first time ordering samples from anywhere and my first time making a review post like this! I had a lot of fun trying everything and choosing rankings. Today I ordered some more samples from Andromeda's Curse and Cardinal Scents and the full sizes of the perfumes I adored, and I'm already looking forward to making another haul review like this one! And then taking a long break from trying new perfumes because the fall semester will start...",8,1753414563.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

I’m not trying to be that guy who makes someone uncomfortable, but at the same time, I don’t want to just sit around waiting for some magical moment to happen. Sometimes I’ll see someone I find attractive in public—a coffee shop, bookstore, or at a concert—but I hesitate because I don’t know what the “normal” or respectful way is to start a conversation.

I’m not talking about pick-up lines or trying to “game” people. I’m just asking from a human-to-human perspective: what’s a good way to start talking to someone naturally without making it feel forced? Is there a “right time” or a situation that makes it less awkward? Does it all depend on reading the vibe?

Also, if there are any women here reading this, I’d really appreciate your perspective. What actually works on you? What makes you feel safe or open to talking to a stranger, and what instantly makes you shut down?

I’m working on becoming more confident and genuine, and I don’t want to rely on social media or dating apps 100% of the time. I’d rather just be able to talk to people like a normal human.

Any honest advice would be appreciated. I know it sounds simple, but in today’s world, I feel like there’s a fine line and I don’t want to cross it.

Hey everyone, 20M 6’3, ~200lbs here. I’d say my bf% is ~26%, just an estimation though, never got tested. I go to the gym at least 5 days a week with regular cardio (30min 15 incline treadmill at 3mph). I wanna get down to like ~20 bf%, which means about ~165-170lb I’m guessing for my height. I’m eating around ~2200 calories daily: 

Cal, protein: 

Breakfast : 3 eggs (fried) - 300cal, 18g
Lunch: 
1 cup uncooked basmati rice - 3 cooked cups - 600 cal, 12g
Chicken breast- ~200g - 330cal, 62g
Vegetables (steamed) - 50cal, 2g protein

Pre-gym: 
Coffee-protein snack (self-made) - ~120cal, 8g

Dinner: 
Protein shake (1.5 scoops) : 180cal, 37.5g
Greek yogurt (1 cup) : 100 cal, 3g
Fruits: 50 cal, 2g

Any misc. oils etc: 400cal

Total: ~2200cal, protein ~145g


Tldr: 20M, 6’4, ~200lb with ~27% bf eating around 2200cal daily, is this enough or am I at a risk of losing muscle? 

I want to lose fat quickly, and I know that extreme dieting isn’t the safest route—but I feel like this plan is working for me slightly. The 400 “misc” calories are just a buffer for things like oil or random bites. I use spray oil, so there’s no way it’s actually 400—but I add it just to stay on the safe side. I tend to overeat pretty easily, so I want to set a stricter limit for myself to stay in control. That said, I usually end up binge eating during one or two cheat days each week.

Ik this is long, I’m sorry, any advice is appreciated.

Here is a scene that is less dark or full of spoilers than the others I’ve written so far.,"“Vela, you’re pretty knowledgeable on earth stuff right?”

Her eyes lit right up. Not often did Vela have anyone ask her about her interests, and certainly not someone like Astrid. 

“Yes Astrid,” she responded with cartoonish glee. She was trembling as she awaited any oncoming query, gripping tightly onto the cafe table with just her fingers. 

“What was that thing you were yapping about- the time thing-“

“OH YES!” Vela jumped up with pure joy and slammed her fists down on the table. “The earth stars-“

“Yeah, you should tell Lich about that.” Astrid was quick to cut her off, a hint of sarcasm in her voice as rose from her seat, “I’m gonna grab another drink.” The two millisecond pulsars exchanged glances as she passed by.

“Why do you hate me, Astrid,” Lich remarked jokingly as Astrid made her way toward the counter. “I thought we were friends.” 

Astrid let out a short breathy laugh and paused. “We are,” she started, glancing down at them over her shoulder with a smirk, “which means if I have to suffer, then so do you!” With that, Astrid wandered off. 

Lich huffed quietly, “this is not a game I consented to playing.” After another moment had passed, they reluctantly returned their attention to Vela who was posed right next to them, eyes still twinkling brightly. 

“A little too close for comfort love, don’t you think,” they commented, gently shooing her back with their petit hand. 

“Oh don’t worry, I’m very comfortable here,” Vela responded with a toothy smile as she rested her head in her hands propped up on the table. 

Lich audibly sighed as they attempted to keep their cool. “Back up puñeta, just a bit?” They put their hand out with a pushing motion. “I don’t appreciate unfamiliar stars entering my orbit. Surely you can understand that.”

The message seemed to click the second time around as Vela responded with no hesitation and floated her way to the other side of the table. “Oh, I’m sorry!” She laughed nervously, bumping into the seat behind her, nearly knocking it over. 

“It’s quite alright, darling,” they accepted her apology dryly as they took a sip of their beverage. “I am to a degree familiar with the general social ineptitude of a juvenile star such as yourself. Allow yourself time and experience, and you‘ll adjust to our societal norms accordingly.”

Vela struggled to understand most of what Lich said most of the time, and she didn’t want to be a bother by asking them to reword themself repeatedly, so she just nodded along and hoped for the best. Lich was one of Astrid’s closest friends, and she wanted to make a good impression on them. Considering how kind they’ve been toward her thus far, Vela was certain she was doing a good job. 

“Ugh, what did I miss,” Astrid questioned with heavy exaggeration as she returned to her seat, hoping she’d missed the meat of the spiel. 

“You missed a riveting discussion about personal space,” Lich quipped back in a similar tone. “I though perhaps you wouldn’t want to miss your charming friend’s little story.”

Astrid winced and took a sip of her drink. “Wow, thanks,” she grunted through her teeth. 

“The pleasure is all mine.” Lich sat in their place unmoving while they awaited a response from Astrid that never came. In due time, they turned their attention back to Vela. “So what we’re you going to tell us about the earth, Vera?”

“Oh, it’s actually Vela,” she politely corrected them. 

“Yes, that’s right.” Lich rolled their eyes shielded by their bangs. “You were going to share some factoids you found on your informal escapades of knowledge seeking.”

“Oh yes,” Vela nodded and started up again, as excited to share as ever. Finally, someone was taking interest in her and the things she had to say. How unfortunate it was she could not pick up on the irony of her current situation. “So the stars on Earth have found a universal way of keeping time, so everyone is always on the same schedule!” Her grin was wide as can be as she gazed across the table. Astrid looked pretty much like she usually did with a rather stone cold expression, and Lich seemed a little perplexed at the information she had just thrown their way. “Isn’t that neat?” Even she could tell she was losing them fast.

“I’m sorry; there are stars on the earth?” Lich cocked their head slightly to the side as they swirled their drink around in its cup. “How does that work?”

“Well, yeah- what else would be there?” Vela did her best to defend herself and her statements. She knew that she knew what she was talking about. Lich diverted to Astrid in a little sidebar.


“I thought you said she was an expert,” they accused with an soft voice as they did not want their conversation to be picked up by the nuisance at the other end of the table.

“I didn’t say that,” Astrid retorted somewhat aggressively, “I said she knows some shit!”

“Evidently, she does not. This is nonsense-“

“Look,” Astrid snarled in a whisper,” I already had to sit through this once. Do me a solid, would ya?”

Lich took a pause, closing their eyes and taking a slow sip of the coffee-like beverage in front of them. “You owe me for this, Astrid.”

“Fine, whatever.” She scoffed before the duo returned their gaze to Velas rather lousy presentation. “What about those things-“ she blurted to Vela, patience wearing a bit thin at this point. “What did you call them, “dags” or something?”

“Days,” Vela corrected again, not missing a beat. 

“Yeah, that.”

“The stars there are very precise with the way they track time.” Her enthusiasm alone was enough for the three of them- which was probably a good thing, as the other two certainly were not enthused. “It’s like a cascade of bowls- they have days, days contain hours, which contain minutes, which contain seconds- and there are different amounts of each of them!”

“Fascinating,” Lich contributed.

“But it means nothing to us,” Astrid added on, arms crossed. “I mean, how can you even scale something like that?”

“Maybe I’ll try an earth schedule! Every instant is tracked, what could be better than that,” Vela chimed in, sinking her teeth deeper into her side of the discussion. She was admittedly getting a little agitated by the other two’s reactions. “24 hours in a day, then I’ll go to sleep-

Lich cleared their throat and set their cup down, placing their hands one in the other in front of themself atop the table. “I think what Astrid is trying to convey is that without a point of reference, these words are just that- words.” Their demeanour became distant, but their attitude toward her suddenly seemed warmer than prior. “These are arbitrary concepts, not quantizable within the fabric of our society. What is an hour, Vela- what does that look like?”

“Well, I-“ she started, choking on her own words. The consistent challenging from Lich was leaving her frustrated and socially exhausted. “I haven’t exactly figured that out yet-“

“Because you can’t.” Lich had officially had enough. They were done entertaining this illogical concept, and they sternly turned to Astrid. “I had strongly advised you to refrain from engaging with this one. Now look at where we are.”",2,1753413796.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Eiffel Tower Vase market presents a wide range of materials, sizes, and finishes. Understanding the key features will help you narrow down your choices and find the perfect vase to complement your decor.

**Material:** The Eiffel Tower Vases are available in various materials, including metal (aluminum, iron, and stainless steel), glass, acrylic, and even ceramic.

The choice of material significantly impacts the vase's durability, weight, and overall aesthetic. Metal vases, especially those made of stainless steel or iron, offer excellent durability and a modern, industrial look. Glass vases provide a classic and elegant feel, allowing the flowers to be the center of attention. Acrylic vases are a lightweight and affordable option, while ceramic vases offer a unique, handcrafted touch.

**Height and Size:** Eiffel Tower Vases come in a wide range of heights, from petite tabletop decorations to impressive floor-standing centerpieces.

The ideal height depends on the intended use and the size of the space where the vase will be displayed. Smaller vases (under 12 inches) are perfect for accent tables and shelves, while larger vases (over 24 inches) make a bold statement on dining tables or in entryways. Consider the scale of your flowers and the overall visual impact you want to achieve when selecting the height.

**Finish and Color:** The finish and color of the vase play a crucial role in its overall aesthetic appeal.

Common finishes include polished metal, matte black, antique bronze, and painted colors. Polished metal finishes offer a sleek and modern look, while matte black and antique bronze finishes provide a more rustic and vintage feel. Painted colors allow for greater customization and can be used to match existing decor. Consider the color palette of your space and the style of your flowers when choosing a finish and color.

**Base Stability:** A stable base is crucial for preventing the vase from tipping over, especially when filled with water and flowers.

Look for vases with a wide and sturdy base, preferably made of a weighted material. The base should be designed to evenly distribute the weight of the vase and its contents, minimizing the risk of accidents. Check customer reviews to see if other users have reported any issues with stability.

**Construction Quality:** The quality of construction directly impacts the vase's durability and longevity.

Examine the joints and seams of the vase to ensure they are securely welded or glued together. Look for smooth edges and a consistent finish, free from imperfections. Higher-quality vases are typically made with thicker materials and more meticulous craftsmanship.

Key features of the best Eiffel Tower Vases include:
* Durable Material
* Appropriate Height and Size
* Complementary Finish and Color
* Stable Base

I’m 20F and I’ve been thinking it’d be nice to have someone to text regularly without it feeling like a chore. Just someone who actually replies, doesn’t vanish into thin air (unless you’re a magician, I guess), and enjoys random, possibly chaotic, possibly wholesome conversations throughout the day.

My vibe? Somewhere between a golden retriever and a raccoon with a phone. I like dumb memes, deep 2am thoughts, and spiraling into topics we know nothing about but are completely invested in for no reason. One minute I might be asking what your zombie apocalypse plan is, and the next I’ll be telling you about how I accidentally made my coffee with orange juice instead of milk. True story.

I’m not picky about who you are or where you’re from. If you’re kind, can handle random bursts of energy followed by chill silences, and enjoy sending voice notes, cursed images, or ranting about weirdly specific things, we’ll probably get along.

If you need a text friend to hype you up, keep you company during boring days, or just share the tiny wins and weird thoughts with, message me. I’m not perfect at texting 24/7 but I try to be consistent and genuinely enjoy talking to people.

1m8odjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m8odjm/not_getting_any_interest_from_anyone_online_or/,"Not getting any interest from anyone online or offline, need help.","I'm 31F but have never had a boyfriend - though not by choice. I studied an STEM major and have been surrounded by guys in a male dominated field both as a student and at work for over a decade and in all that time only 1 guy showed any interest in me but he was a coworker 9 years older than me and was training me when I was new to my job. (For context, though I was really interested, we had a lot of chemistry, but I was young mid 20s and inexperienced, and afraid of dating at work so I panicked and declined at first: but he rejected me horribly when I tried to approach him a few months later, when he was secretly seeing someone else but giving me mixed signals at the same time. Ever since then he's been unpleasant, deflecting blame on me as to why things didn't work out and he called me manipulative and delusional, acted hot and cold and even pryed on my personal life like asking me if I have a big bed. He recently got engaged but the whole experience left me hurt and questioning whether he was just playing with me or was actually interested).
But in the years before and since, no guy has ever expressed any interest in me. I've asked a different guy out IRL (after someone else saw the chemistry between us) but he brutally rejected me publicly with no second thought. I get a few matches in dating apps most of which are both of poor quality (I'm allowed to have some standards) and quantity (get close to zero matches even if I sent the likes first and pay for the apps). I've been on something like 6 first dates over the last 4 years from the apps but none got past the first coffee - got ghosted even though they seemed like reasonable dates. I went to speed dating and not a single one matched afterwards. I may be average looking but beauty is in the eye of the holder.
I just can't figure out why I'm getting such a high degree of repeated rejection:  I put a lot of care, kindness and loyalty into all my relationships and friendships, I've put effort into dating and effort presenting myself but somehow I can barely get a first date let alone a second one. And IRL guys don't even consider to approach me or ask me out even if there's ""chemistry"".
I'm a bit reserved/serious by nature but can hold a conversation and have humour too so surely someone likes that too? I'm also a minority and vegetarian (though open to date a meat eater). Are there other women in this boat too, with little to none dating experience because no men show interest in them? Is it compatibility, luck or is it something else?

1m8od7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1m8od7s/vicious_cycles_and_peanut_butter_sandwiches/,Vicious Cycles and Peanut Butter Sandwiches,"*(****Author's note****: This story was originally published in* [*Illustrated Worlds Magazine*](https://www.illustratedworldsmagazine.com/#/)*, issue 9)*

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kia Tigers vs. Lotte Giants: A Tale of Two KBO Powerhouses (With a Side of Gold Coins)**

The KBO’s latest blockbuster showdown pits the **Kia Tigers** against the **Lotte Giants** in a July 25 clash that’s as much about legacy as it is about runs. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game feels like a circus—complete with acrobatic pitching and fans throwing gold coins like confetti.

---

### Odds Breakdown: Giants Favor, Tigers Tread Water

The betting lines make this a lopsided lovefest for the Lotte Giants. At **decimal odds of 1.48-1.50** (implied probability: **67-69%**), the Giants are the clear favorite, while the Kia Tigers hover around **2.60** (implied probability: **38-39%**). For context, the Tigers’ chances of winning are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich. Not great.

The spread reinforces this: Lotte is favored by **1.5 runs**, and the total is set at **10 runs**, with even money on Over/Under. If you’re betting on the Tigers, you’re essentially buying a lottery ticket—except the jackpot is a moral victory, and the ticket’s a fire hazard.

### News Digest: Gold Coins, Records, and a Star’s 2,000th Hit

The Lotte Giants are basking in the glow of **Jeon Jun-woo’s historic 2,000-hit, 1,000-RBI milestone**, celebrated with a fan-driven event that netted 12,000 congratulatory messages and 10 gold coins (because who *doesn’t* want a gold coin in their sock?). The Giants aren’t just winning games—they’re winning at fan engagement, with **39 sold-out home games** this season. Their average attendance? A staggering **27,782 per game**. If this were a coffee shop, they’d be the Starbucks of baseball.

Meanwhile, the Kia Tigers are… well, they’re the underdog. Recent news about them is sparse, save for a vague mention of their M

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

1m8o336,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1m8o336/fellowshipping/,“fellowshipping”,"31M. I’m 15 months sober and loving it. I go to 1-3 meetings a week and I went to a new meeting tonight. 

My parents met in AA 35+ years ago so I grew up very indoctrinated with AA stuff. Therefore, I rejected it when I was young as sort of the “religion” I was raised in. So it took me a very long time to finally stop being a know it all miserable drunk and go to rehab. I was arrogant, and you guessed it, thought I was going to quit on my own or “some other way” besides AA. I guess I found it cringe and judgey and hypocritical… I thought I knew everything about it, being raised “in” it, but never truly giving it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and welcomed with open arms. The only thing that got me sober was taking other people’s advice. 

Here’s the thing. The #1 reason I started and continued drinking was social anxiety. I have done a lot of work on this, including rehab, IOP, weekly therapy, a social anxiety clinic, and meetings and stepwork. 

My ENTIRE family (my dad & mom + her 6 siblings, my siblings, my cousins) are in AA. All their friends are from AA. I think that’s beautiful and lucky and rare. I also think it’s a little much sometimes. I have said from the beginning to my very codependent family that my sobriety needs to be my own, and I have stuck to that. My brother is pretty much the opposite of me: total social butterfly and has a million friends in AA. 

I feel SOOO fucking awkward at meetings. Like, I’ll talk to people, I’ll share, I’ll read, whatever. But at the end I just wanna get the fuck out of there. An hour a day plus prayers and readings at home is kind of all I can spare. I don’t understand how people have so much time for 5+ meetings a week + always dinner or coffee after, every single time. I get that it’s their social life, that’s who their friends are. But it doesn’t feel natural to me? My social battery runs out very quickly. It’s not that I don’t like them or feel superior or something, I just really don’t feel the need to introduce myself and hang around, turning a meeting into a several hour event. Sobriety IS my priority, but making a bunch of friends really is not. 

The topic of the meeting tonight was about loneliness/fellowship and how it’s an essential part of AA. I absolutely couldn’t have gotten sober without the AA community, but it’s also not my entire personality and social life? 

Am I doing it wrong? I feel good about my sobriety, I don’t have any cravings or urge to drink. But I always feel guilty that I skrrt out of there when the meeting ends, or that I’m not doing enough service work or something. (Yes, I was also raised Catholic-ish and the guilt runs deep). I’ve heard people say they stopped calling 5 alcoholics a day and that’s what eventually led them to relapse. But like, that’s my personal hell, I hate phone calls. 

I met a guy once who was sort of an AA drifter, he rarely went to the same meeting twice. I wish I could do that but I’m afraid people will think I’m either a) rude or b) well on my way to the drunk tank. 

TL;DR Can you do AA without the nonstop “fellowshipping”? ",3,1753412251.0,alcoholicsanonymous,10,1.0,False

1m8o2ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1m8o2ho/he_pulled_the_steering_wheel_today/,He pulled the steering wheel today.,"He said he would pull the steering wheel over ans crash the car. He would hit the barrier if he had to. He grabbed it with his left hand and did a quick tug as a white car was next to us. Not enough to completely enter the lane but enough to move the car over. He said he would turn the car off as we are driving. He put his hand on the ignition button. 

This was after he had yelled at me for 15 minutes. I told him I was done being yelled at (a boundary i have set NUMEROUS times) and i stopped reacting completely. My legs were shaking the entire time but I kept as calm as I possibly could. Im shaking as im writing this now. I had a panic attack outside earlier... atleast that is what it felt like. Rocking back and forth, just bawling, with my heart racing. Absolutely sick, bottomless feeling in my stomach. I was wretching. I hope my neighbor didn't hear. But then again. I hope he did. 

I pick him up from work about 20 minutes prior to him tugging the steering wheel. He gets in the car and says he had a crazy day, tells me a little about his day. Never asked me how my day was. I had been telling him i felt awful all day via text, he never acknowledged it. I am in so much pain from driving which i told him about prior to that. I have had 11 back surgeries and my sciatica has flared. Ive been working extra (while doing 99% of the household stuff). When i am in a lot of pain I grit my teeth. He then said he wishes I could work just one shift of his. I reply ""why is that?"" 
Him: so you can see why I say and do some of the things when I am at home. This was after he told me it was a crazy day but it was a good day. I told him that doesn't give him the right to treat us mean and disrespect me and call me names just because he had a crazy day work. 

Him: I'm not mean to you. Dont disrespect me. [Didnt he just kind of admit he doesnt treat me/us well when he made that initial statement????] When was the last time i called you a name?

I said last week on Saturday. He called me a crybaby. He has done that numerous times after I had told him I dont like him calling me names.

Him: God see why do you have to bring up the past.

Me: Wait? What? How can I answer that question without talking about the past? 

He then is yelling at me/mocking me for 15 minutes. Somethings i do remember:
- He made fun of me for using the words ""safe and secure."" He called them ""clinical"" and asked where I learned them from. He asked if I was using AI and I said ""No, you know I dont like AI or ChatGPT. Those are my feelings.""
- treat him like a piggy bank (I dont buy anything extra for myself, he admits this. He spends money on games every week. I just buy household essentials. I just replaced shirts that were a few years old and way too big because I have lost 20 pounds this year. I felt bad even buying $5 shirts at Target)
- he doesn't feel loved because there is no intimacy. I didn't ""finish him"" the last time we had sex. I told him yes. Because I had no energy and you acknowledged that. He said he still doesn't like that. I told him he has hands. He needs to respect me if I can't have sex. He told me i was disrespectful for saying that he has hands.
-it would be better if I just kept my mouth shut. The day that he purposefully didn't talk to me was very peaceful and it should be more like that. 
-more and more


And then later at home:

He said he wanted a divorce.
I said I didn't want that but I think we atleast need therapy. 
He doesn't want to to to therapy. He said he doesn't need to go. There isn't anything he needs to work on.
I said well we need to do something because you said you are unhappy with me being here. Let's separate then and see if thats still what we truly want. I can work on myself. We can work on ourselves  I will work two jobs, around your job so you can save too. We can separate the laundry, food, dinners. Ill still take the kids to and from school. 

Him: Or wouldn't it just be easier to give me the respect and _______ (i don't remember the other word he kept using. He repeated this numerous times) I deserve. I do so much for you. I provide for you. 

Me: wait, what? I just offered a less extreme step than divorce and you say that? Why are you flipping around like that? This isn't working. You acknowledge it isn't working but want a divorce. Now you want to keep me around after I suggest separating?

He keeps saying he isn't flipping it around. I keep saying he is. 

Then he goes on and says therapy is ""bonkers."" I tell him I dont think so we could atleast try. I asked why he was a psych nurse since that is a *core* part of psych nursing (actually, all nursing requires therapeutic communication at the minimum. I was a nurse and remember those care plans well). Do you tell your patients this? Not to go to therapy?

He said ""ehhh."" Then he completely changed subject to him mockingly saying:

""You say you dont feel 'safe and secure.'"" Making air quotes. Then says he doesn't mean to mock me. (Wtf) 

I then said well, yea you grabbed the steering wheel today. That didn't make me feel very secure. 

He brought up that I did that in the past. ""I didn't feel secure about that when you did it.""

[Yes. I did that in the past (2016) when I was taking Lyrica and experiencing lyrica-induced psychosis. I also threw something at a wall and broke a TV. I went to the doctor immediately after that and he recognized what was going on and took me off Lyrica.  I've never had a violent outburst since.]

Me: I was having psychosis from a drug. I apologized for that. Why did you do it today? I wasn't in my right mind and you know that. You did that because I wasn't talking to you. I went to the doctor and got help. Are you not in your right mind? People dont do that. You need help. 

Him: Well if you dont want me bringing up the past then you dont talk about the past. [I was so confused by this statement since he brought up the past! I didn't say anything! I was takking about an event that happened two hours before]

He kept getting away from the initial point (do not remember what he was going on about) about him flipping it around on me. So i tried to refocus him and asked him the question again: why won't you atleast go to therapy? You say you want a divorce i am suggesting something not as extreme. You say no. Then I tell you okay let's try separating and you say (I repeat what he says).

Him: i just dont understand. Ive never been physical with you. 

I tell him yes he has he was a few weeks ago when we went to the park. 

[We were going to play Pokémon Go... I am a gamer, though i dont do much of that nowadays... We got into a fight in the car (i dont remember what over, this was before I started documenting things). It was escalating, he was yelling then I was yelling. I told him I wanted to just go play the game and he could join me after he cooled off. My phone was in the console. I went to grab it and he went to grab it. The phone fell onto the passenger floorboard. I went to pick it up and he pinned my arm in his armpit. I told him to let go because he was hurting me. He said no because I was going to run off. I said no I just want to go walk. I kicked open the door and screamed at the top of my lungs ""stop it."" There were a few guys playing disc golf and they looked our direction. He dropped the phone and let me go. I had bruises on my arm from it. I did not take pictures. I was afraid to. I wish I did. He has taken/threatened to take my phone away in the past numerous times and I've told him not to do that. I have never done this to him]

He said ""thats not what happened. I was trying to stop you from running out into the street. You were screaming at me.

Me: what? No. You grabbed my phone and wouldn't let me go. That's why I screamed. You were hurting me.

[I am so glad I am starting to document things because wow. How many things have I really thought happened that didn't and vice versa]

I tell him about all the times he has poked me in the side, kicked my shins, yanked the blanket off me, pulled the pillow out from under me, etc. He just stays silent for a few moments. 

He then says fine he thinks we are better off alone and he cries himself to sleep at night anyway, every night. (We do sleep separate so I can't verify this) this will probably be the last time we will have a conversation. I ask why and he says because we are getting separated. He said I am the abusive one because I don't respect him like he deserves because he provides for us, I give him attitude, I'm not intimate with him, being mean to him. Telling me I need to apologize. I tell him I am tired I want to go downstairs and do what else needs to be done so im setting a timer (he will monologue). He said ""fine I dont want to talk if youre only going to give me 15 minutes."" I just went downstairs. 

He works again tomorrow. I usually get up at 5:15am to make him coffee, his breakfast and lunch. I do not want to tomorrow. I just dont know how he will react if I dont. I want to call my sister and tell her everything that is going on. I need someone to know. But im afraid of getting them involved. I know she will probably tell my mom and my mom will *possibly* go scorched earth... Maybe thats what needs to happen. I just feel so broken. He says i am the broken one.

I do want to leave. I am going to leave. I need to make a plan. I have been reading ""why does he do that?"" on pdf since recommended on here. Its been quite enlightening so far of what i have read. There are other factors, like my chronic health issues/finances/kids. He is already suspicious of me recording things or looking at self-help things and mocks me for them.

It’s only been three days without redbull and it’s going horribly. I slept for 9 hours last night, woke up and had a latte, sat in some zoom meetings, then took a two hour nap from 1-3 (I wfh), and now I’m in bed ready to sleep for 9-10 more hours.

1m8ns5d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8ns5d,"Canadian trip, part 2: Winnipeg - Edmonton","Hi everyone. I'm glad to see that many of you enjoyed my report on the first leg of my trip through Canada by train. I'm back with the second part, although this one is a bit shorter than the first.

*Monday, July 21st*

We arrive at Winnipeg's train station at 8pm, having enjoyed four days in the city. Back on the Toronto-Winnipeg leg of the journey we were warned by a few Canadians that we would get bored in Winnipeg without a car and that there's nothing going on in the city, but honestly? We loved it. The Forks with its parks and shops, the museums, and the Winnipeg Fringe with great performances turned our stay there into an absolute highlight of the trip. If any of you plan a trip through Canada, I highly recommend paying Winnipeg a visit.

Still, we're happy to start our second train trip because we loved the first one so much. The train is supposed to arrive ad 7.30 pm and depart at 9.30 pm, but of course, that almost never happens. Today, there's a 80 minute delay, which isn't too bad, and boarding is announced for 9.20, so we sit and wait for a bit. It's less comfortable than the wait in Toronto, because there is no lounge for sleeper plus passengers and the waiting area is very basic and functional. Still, it's pleasant enough and the people watching is way more entertaining, because there is more of a mix. There are more families this time, some with younger kids, and they're dressed in comfortable clothes, clutching pillows and blankets, clearly preparing for a night on semi comfortable train seats. I used to do night trains on seats in Europe all the time when I was a student. I sure don't miss it.

Boarding starts with a 20 minute delay. We're in Car 15 and have Berths 1U and 1L this time. Closer to the toilets then Berths 3, but during daytime, there's a window on both sides while in 3 you're next to a wall on one side. I'm looking forward to snuggling into my blankets, so I don't even wait for the attendant to talk to us about the safety features to get myself ready for bed. When he tells us that in case of an emergency, we should make sure there are no bears before we climb out of the window, I'm already tucked in. Somewhere between 10 and 11pm, we depart. I'm out like a light before we leave Winnipeg behind us.

*Tuesday, July 22nd*

Like last time, I wake up shortly before 5. It's grey and foggy outside, from the wildfires up north, as I'm later told. I grab a coffee from the activity car and head up to the dome, which is almost empty, and enjoy the landscape. Where Ontario impressed me with an abundance of lakes and trees, Manitoba does so with its flatness and its vastness. There is so much space and so much sky, I find it almost terrifying. It's mainly agricultural, with huge yellow fields of what I believe are oilseed crops. The dome car fills up as it gets closer to breakfast time (6.30) and I get a hot chocolate and head back to my berth to watch the fields some more as I wait for my partner. 

We head for breakfast at 8, she has the omelette and I have the transcontinental breakfast without the hash brown. I forgot to take a picture, but her omelette looked like an omelette and my transcontinental looked like fried eggs, bacon and toast. Both are delicious. We ask about the mealtimes, because we couldn't choose our seating when checking in at Winnipeg. We're told there are only two seatings this time. We choose the second, which is at 1.30pm for lunch and 7pm for dinner. That should leave us with enough time to eat dinner before getting off at Edmonton, where scheduled arrival is 8.50 pm. Emphasis on *should*. I'll get to that later.

One thing we notice is that this train isn't as cold as the last one, where my partner basically had to wear three layers to fend off a cold from the AC. It's much more comfortable in the dome car like that, so we spend the morning up there. The car never fills up completely, so we can stay there without feeling bad about hogging the seats. 

There's a 30 minute stop at Saskatoon and we get off to find...not much. The train station is well outside the city. That seems to be the case for many Canadian train stations, whereas in Europe, they're usually in the city center. We still enjoy the chance to stretch our legs.

Lunch is a smoked beef sandwich for me and vegetarian chili for my partner. It's delicious as expected, but the highlight is the apple crumble we get for dessert. Definitely the best dessert we've had on the train so far. 

I spend most of the afternoon in the dome car again, while my partner enjoys the more spacious benches downstairs. I drink my body weight in coffee and watch as a wilder version of the prairies appears, with gentle slopes and grasslands rather than fields of crops, the kind you know from movies. It's beautiful, and I enjoy it even more when wine tasting begins. 

When the first seating for dinner is called, my partner joins me in the dome car again. Shortly before 7pm, the landscape suddenly becomes more urban and in the distance, skyscrapers appear. We wonder what city this is, until an announcement tells us: it's Edmonton! We're told that we can leave our train at 7.20pm, 90 minutes before we were supposed to arrive, and also 10 minutes before our meal seating. Our attendant in car 15 is as surprised as us, and he tells us that he's never seen the train arrive this early. He tells us that we can stay on the train to have our meal, but then we have to wait 2 hours before we have the chance to get off again, because the train has to leave the station between arrival and departure. We opt to skip dinner and head to our hostel instead. It's too bad about dinner, but we'd rather get to bed early, because we're starting a road trip through the Rockies in a rental car the next day. The attendant still feels sorry for us and hands us a few chocolates. 

We leave the train and collect our checked baggage at the tiny station which is - surprise- well outside of Edmonton. Taxis are lining up to pick up new arrivals, so getting to our hostel is still very easy.

All in all, I enjoyed the second leg just as much as the first one, even though arrival didn't quite go as planned. We were told to expect delays but we weren't quite as prepared for arriving too early. Still, I'd never complain. It's part of the experience. And I can't wait for part 3.

P.S.: I'm writing this from the balcony at a beautiful lodge outside Golden, BC, looking across the Columbia river at the Rocky Mountains. As much as I'm enjoying the Canadian, taking it in sections and having time to explore this beautiful country in between was the right decision for us. I highly recommend this approach to anyone who's never been to Canada before.",57,1753411341.0,ViaRail,2,1.0,False

by Nelson Rodriguez

So many choices… but where to go?
all I hear is silence.
my instinct telling me to move—
The mind paralyzed by failure,

fearful of the adversary afoot.

The mountain…
the one I fear to climb.

My doubts, necromanced—
smirking through the voices
of ghosts I thought I buried.

Reminded of my past versions,
frozen…
screams preserved in ice.

But the longer I wait,
the colder it gets—
burdened by the truth
that a decision must be made.

Then courage erupts,
provoked—enraged
by fear and its lies.

Like hot coffee on a winter morning,
I feel it sink into me,
its warmth spreading through my chest…
thawing out the part of me that still believes.

It chants:
“I can.
I will.
I must.”

I had 3 “bridesmaids,” one of whom is my sister. I put bridesmaids in quotes because it was really only a title. I let them pick their own dresses, let them decide on their own shoes, hair, makeup, etc. and didn’t ask for a shower, bachelorette party, or anything else. I bought their bouquets, and while they stood up there with me, they didn’t have to walk down the aisle or make speeches or anything like that. They did have to purchase their plane tickets and lodging to attend the wedding. I wanted to get them each a little something to thank them for making the trip out. I wrote them each a heartfelt thank you note and got them each a candle from a local candlemaker, a bag of chocolates from a local chocolate place, a nice lip scrub, and a coffee giftcard. Now I’m worried that it wasn’t enough. My bridesmaids went above and beyond setting up decorations for a mini surprise shower and getting me gifts such as a custom jacket, lingerie, and monetary gifts. None of this was expected at all, and I am so grateful, but now I’m worried that my gift to them was cheap and underwhelming. I see so many brides getting elaborate gifts for the wedding party, but I didn’t think that was necessary since I had such a small wedding and tried to keep expectations and costs as low as possible. Plus gifts aren’t my love language, I’m really not a “stuff” person and don’t like giving stuff for the sake of giving stuff. But now I’m self conscious that I didn’t do enough. Am I overthinking this, or did I mess up? Is there anything I should do to make sure they know how much I appreciated them? ",10,1753410817.0,Weddingsunder10k,14,0.82,False
