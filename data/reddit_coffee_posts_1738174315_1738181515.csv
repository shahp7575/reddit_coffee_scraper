I’m not sure if the higher end machines just have more granular intensity and that level 5 is equivalent to level 3 of lower end?—Or that level 4 and 5 resulting in more coffee grounds than the lower end level 3?",1,1738181261.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I feel like if I go to the doctor they are going to run tons of test and it’s going to be a lot of money and time for the possibility of them finding nothing . ( to give context I have some basic auto immune issues and the more extreme one is undiagnosed cause I couldn’t keep paying for ct scans , test , ect . Those I got under control more or less now (my auto immune issues started at 16)) 

So anyways Ive been experiencing random spouts of nausea for the past month . However in the past 2 weeks it’s gotten worse and in this past week even more extreme . I wake up - I feel like I could vomit buckets , i struggle throughout the day spending almost all of the day now nauseous. I’m so nauseous that smells or even food makes me want to throw up. I start gagging. I’ll be hungry and want to go eat but just the thought of eating makes me want to vomit and when I do eat I feel sick afterwards. 

Due to these issues I’ve been eating a lot less , I can only eat a little bit before I can’t eat any  more . Lack of appetite due to that . I’ve been very fatigued and even my pee has started to smell like sweet coffee ( I haven’t been drinking any ) or butter popcorn. I can’t even speak sometimes I’m so nauseous. I tried moving something a bit heavy the other day and not only did my nausea interfere- I broke out in a cold sweat and was crazy dizzy .

Though I’ve been gagging a lot due to just existing I haven’t been throwing up . I typically start sipping water or lay down to stop the gagging . Anyways - idk if this is just auto immune issues or if something is very wrong . I’m aware that from the sounds of it you cannot tell if it’s auto immune or if something is wrong, but if anyone could guide me on things to try at home to help this or if you think you know what it may be ? 

To add - no I’m not pregnant , I do not drink or smoke . The only medication I take daily is birth control which I’ve been on way before these issues started . I eat lots of different things but most meals are simple since I already have auto immune issues ( nothing spicy , no heavy junk food , low acid , ect ) I eat vegetables or fruits with most meals . I weigh 120 pounds and am 5’2 . Pepto bismal does  not help with these symptoms. I do not have extreme anxiety or stress currently either . 

I did get an infection from a cyst a few weeks back and was on doxycycline for a week. The cyst is gone and I’m healed  . My problems started after that ( I wanted to include this incase maybe doxycycline has a side effect but it’s been a month since I took it ) ",1,1738181055.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to become a coffee master and to get my black apron for a long time so when I started at my current store I really started pushing for it. We’re not corporately ran and the old lead didn’t follow almost any sbx rule, and was also the only person in the store to have a black aprons. So when our new leads took over they didn’t know how to go about it and had to figure out all of the starbucks ways and rules by themselves basically from scratch. But we got it sorted, went through the process, I finished the certification almost 4 months ago and our aprons finally came in! (Took a while for them to figure out what channels to go through to report the progress and get the aprons ordered) I am very excited to be the first person in our store (since old lead) to get their apron!!

Separate excitement for pics 2-4:
During that time our new leads decided they wanted to get theirs and for the other baristas to get certified, so we now have a 6-coffee master store!! The smaller group photo is all of our coffee masters! The larger group is (almost) everyone in our little starbucks family🫶

Our small, 16-employee, store currently has the highest satisfaction rating through the app for the whole state, and raving compliments from our new district manager saying we have the highest rating of any store in her jurisdiction and the tech that just installed our new mastrenas said it was the cleanest most accommodating store he’s worked in throughout 3 states so we are currently BEAMING.

It’s a lot of work a lot of pressure but a LOT more pride!!

We had a little ceremony at the end of our meeting last night, black aprons were passed out with a printed certificate and cups as a treat :D
Our upper management team is very sweet and supportive and we’re very blessed to have them!!

1id32f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1id32f5/coffee_causes_popping_inside_head/,Coffee causes popping inside head,"I find it hard to believe how intolerant my body has become to caffeine and how severe the symptoms I experience are. After drinking 6-7 cups with two teaspoons and smoking over a pack of day for years, I finally quit smoking altogether and reduced my coffee consumption to one cup a day in October of last year. I wanted to quit caffeine completely, but that would have meant being constipated all the time, so I kept one cup of powdered coffee from a packet, seemingly equivalent to one teaspoon. I then added a second cup with one teaspoon in the evening in order to be able to stay awake and functional for more than 12 hours a day. 

I don't think this amount is excessive and I don't expect it to be harmful to my body, yet sometimes the second cup gives me mild panic attacks, and most strangely of all, after consuming either cup, I hear popping sounds in my head. They're kind of like the sounds that my neck makes when I turn it, except that they seem to be coming from the middle of my head and to be caused by very slight movements, in the range of milimeters. It also feels like my head is swollen from the inside. My guess is that I've developed some kind of allergy to coffee (I tested positive for caffeine intolerance on a blood test) which causes the mucous membrane in my sinuses to swell up (they were swollen on my MRI), as a result of which the mucus inside them makes popping sounds. My hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that my Eustachian tubes close up when this happens, so much so that I can't even blow air into my ears using the Valsalva method.

Does anyone else get this kind of popping?

It's extremely unpleasant and feels like my brain is twitching. Since caffeine also gives me bad anxiety, I start panicking that my brain is actually twitching or bursting while it happens, until I calm down an hour later. I'm thinking about eliminating caffeine altogether; dealing with constipation seems less terrible than this.",1,1738180864.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

Very often I end up doing a dirty fast which in my experience is not so effective (bulletproof-like coffee in the mornings with cream/butter around 200 kcal) or I stop fasting and do OMAD instead on the fasting day - I feel like the fasting day was already ""defective"" because of the keto coffee etc. 

I was annoyed about it since it is kind of difficult anyway and takes willpower, but I make it less effective, therefore prolonging the process of losing weight. 

These last days I had success with a simple trick: I ""locked"" my fridge symbolically with two magnets that hold a string over the opening of the door. It's not really an obstacle to open the door but it helps as a reminder, those few extra seconds that help me to find my willpower. 

My willpower is weakest in the morning when I get up. I'm not hungry, I can live very well without breakfast but getting up for work is so depressing in my morning mood that I tend to cut me some slack - ""Why don't I have cream/butter in my coffee instead of drinking it black, that will make me feel better!""

So, the symbolic lock helped me to curb this impulse in the morning. And having made the right decision in the morning helps me to stay on track for the rest of the day. ",1,1738180825.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.67,False

For a startup that could face make-or-break moments at any time, I realized remote work was seriously holding us back. The communication gaps were killing our momentum - ideas would get lost in translation, responses would take forever, and that spark of innovation you get from quick back-and-forth just wasn't there.

So I ended up doing something that probably sounds crazy to most people: I convinced my small team to literally move in together under one roof. Honestly? It was a total game-changer. Now we can bounce ideas off each other instantly, solve problems over coffee in the kitchen, and there's this amazing creative energy that you just can't replicate over Zoom. The speed at which we can iterate and innovate has gone through the roof.

Looking back, getting everyone together in one physical space was hands down the best decision I've made for the company. Sure, it was unconventional, but when you're running a startup, sometimes you need to throw the traditional playbook out the window and do what actually works for your team.

The difference in our productivity and team chemistry has been night and day. Those 'quick 5-minute chats' that would have been scheduled as 30-minute meetings in the remote setup now happen organically throughout the day. We're not just colleagues anymore - we're a tight-knit crew working towards the same goals, and you can really feel that difference in everything we do.

We’re reading Smile, You’re Traveling. The 3rd Black Coffee book. https://chat.whatsapp.com/EdK0IbiNqYrFzNSnHoBNXo

We’re 50 pages in but feel free to jump in. And feel free to join the Saturday zoom meets even if you haven’t read all the weekly pages. 

It’s all good. :-)

My book club is under the umbrella of the CPTSD support group, which started on Reddit then migrated. There are rules re respectful behavior so only join if being compassionate and open-minded and respectful is your thing.🙏🏼 Keep in mind it’s a group for trauma survivors, so if you join, come with a supportive mindset. 

Yes, I’m aware of the irony here, but my book club is for people who see Henry’s philosophies as problematic trauma responses just as often as they are guideposts for a healthy life. ⚖️ We aim to throw out the Henry bathwater but keep the Henry baby lol!

The umbrella group is wonderful. Amazing resources and amazing, kind people. Lots of other cool sub-groups you can join. 

Again, don’t let a lack of time to read everything or have deep mind-blowing insights hold you back. It’s not for homework and stress, it’s for connection and fun.

Used Stella Parks' recipe (linked at the bottom), and the cake was a success. It isn't quiiiite what I'm looking for personally but it's still very good. I was too lazy to make my own frosting this time, so it's store bought, one 12oz can for each flavor (the pink is strawberry and the outer is just chocolate). If I were making this cake for an event or something, I'd want to have 36oz of frosting to make sure I had enough for in between the 2 layers, the crumb coat and decorating. 

I layered the cakes in the wrong order, don't @ me. I know 😭. The thinner bottom layer was supposed to be on top but I was most likely distracted. 

The cocoa powder I used was Valrhona dutch chocolate I got as a gift for Christmas. For the chopped chocolate, I only had semi sweet chips on hand so I used those, but I don't think it affected the flavor very much. The coffee I used was a medium roast that a friend roasted that has a slight fruity flavor (4Tbs finely ground with 12oz hot water). Personally, I think I will add 1-2Tbs of grounds in the batter directly since I would like a slightly more coffee flavor. 

The cake was made with two 8 inch cake pans (23-23.25oz of batter in each pan) at 350F for 35 mins. The cakes were still too wet at the 30 min mark. I used the leftover batter in a jumbo muffin pan to have plain cakes for me, myself, and I.

I have been drinking protein drinks for years, on average about 90g a day for the last 7 years for sure. Usually, I don't care what flavor I buy, just as long as it's drinkable and the product is a fair price.  
  
After reading an article about high levels of lead and cadmium found in chocolate-based protein drinks, I switched protein powders from a chocolate-flavored protein to a vanilla-flavored protein powder, and I am absolutely stunned by how low my energy has been. I have been barely able to keep my eyes open come 9:00 PM, when normally I go to bed around 11:30 PM.   
  
I've been decaf'ed for about 8 months or so at this point. No coffee, tea, or chocolate. This isn't my first rodeo either; I went about 9 months without a few years ago and had some success. I had checked the label on the protein, and there was no caffeine that had been added in the ingredients.

The bottom line is, the cacao in protein powder, at least for me, has a level of caffeine in it that can be used to sustain the habit. I thought I had been off for 8 months, turns out I've been coasting on the residual caffeine in

PHIL (awed whisper):
This is it, gentlemen. The Disneyland of danger.

1id21zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1id21zn/how_do_you_be_intentional_about_networking_oc/,How do you be intentional about networking (OC advice)?,"Your network isn’t just about who you know. It’s about who knows what you know, and how they help you achieve your goals. Whether you have a robust resume or just starting your career, an intentional and thriving network is essential if you want to progress and find the right opportunities that fulfill you.

For me, there are 5 key areas that help me build genuine and authentic connections while making the biggest impact.

# 1. Build Your “Personal Board of Directors”

Thanks to a great mentor years ago, I learned that it's best to be really intentional about your networking, otherwise you're just getting to know people. While that's nice, there's potentially more strategic ways to spend your time.

Think of it this way. You want to build a team of advisors, each playing a critical role in guiding your professional growth. Just like organizations have a board of directors to help them steer the strategy, you should have a personal board of directors for the same reason.

I have a template for this - click the first link in my bio for resources if interested.

**Here's a brief descriptions of the roles:**

* **Sponsor/Advocate:** Someone who speaks on your behalf and connects you to opportunities. This should be someone highly visible with great credibility. Look a few levels above where you are today and find someone there.
* **Mentor:** A trusted guide who shares wisdom, offers advice, and helps you navigate challenges. When meeting with a mentor, come to those meetings with questions and make sure if they give you homework - you do it on time and thoughtfully. Mentors are so important and often see potential in ways you may not have seen before.
* **Peer:** A colleague at a similar career stage for shared experiences and mutual learning. You should be able to vent safely to a peer, share frustrations, feel relaxed. This could be your ""bestie at work"" or even someone at a different organization. The key is that they should be in a similar place as you, but offer different perspectives.
* **Coach:** A motivator who pushes you to achieve your goals through honest feedback and accountability. This person should be someone that you are comfortable with, but also won't cut you any slack.
* **Consultant/Specialist:** This is designed to be a little more flexible, someone who is there to help you with shorter term goals. It could be a subject matter expert, such as an enthusiast, instructor, or industry leader in skills aligning with your professional development goals in IQ, EQ, or AQ.

Don't worry about having more than one director and some backup ""candidates"" - these positions will change over time and should be reevaluated regularly for maximum effectiveness.

# 2. Focus on Meaningful Connections

After building your Personal Board of Directors, you should still keep networking with others. But it shouldn't be just adding people as connections on LinkedIn; it’s about building meaningful connections.

**Here are some ways to foster authentic relationships:**

* **Start with Shared Interests:** Connect with people who inspire you or share your professional interests.
* **Follow Up and Stay in Touch:** A quick note or sharing an article can keep relationships alive over time. Offer to meet virtually or grab a coffee if they live in your area or if you're traveling near them.
* **Respect Their Time:** Make sure you're not just connecting to connect. Make sure you bring at least 1 question or valuable thing to discuss in case the conversation doesn't just take off in a direction. Offer time back if you don't have much to talk about past that.
* **Offer Help First:** Helping others, whether through introductions or advice, creates goodwill and strengthens bonds.
* **Consider the Emotional Bank Account Philosophy:** You need to make deposits before you make withdrawals.

The strongest networks are built on trust, mutual respect, and shared growth.

# 3. Leverage Online Communities and Platforms

Online communities offer opportunities to connect with professionals who understand your challenges and experiences.

* **LinkedIn Groups:** Join communities on LinkedIn to exchange ideas, share insights, and grow together. Bonus, you're building connections on LinkedIn at the same time. Introduce yourself and participate actively. Engagement builds visibility.
* **Specialized Forums:** Reddit communities are great for learning and collaboration specific to your interests/field.
* **Professional Associations:** Organizations can open doors to new mentors and peers.

Remember, networking is a two-way street. Contribute value by answering questions, sharing resources, and supporting others.

# 4. Adopt a Growth Mindset

As your career evolves, so should your network. Embrace curiosity and courage. Seek out new perspectives and be open to learning from others’ experiences.

Each person you connect with adds a unique layer to your network. With every conversation, you gain insight that expands your understanding and possibilities.

# 5. Don’t Be Afraid to be Uncomfortable

Networking can feel intimidating, especially when reaching out to someone influential. But growth happens when you take risks.

**Start small:**

* Send a LinkedIn connection request with a personalized note.
* Ask someone for a virtual coffee chat.
* Join discussions in an online forum. Be supportive and authentic, and you'll usually be met with the same energy!

Remember, every step out of your comfort zone strengthens your network and your confidence.

# What's Next?

Building a network that grows with you takes time and intention. Start by reaching out to one person today. It may be a mentor you admire, a peer in your field, or someone you’d like to learn from.

Your future self will thank you for the effort, and doing just a little bit every day will make an enormous difference in a week, a month, and a year from now.

I'm a large man so I know these results are not typical but I know there are other large men out there who might could use my example as motivation.   
  
I started very strict: only baked or boiled potatoes (russet, yukon gold, sweet potatoes and garnet yams) and water or black coffee; no seasonings whatsoever. I lasted 5 days super strict and had a bad headache and lethargy on days 3 and 4, which felt like my body was in withdrawal from sugar and fat. On day 5 I woke up and sprang out of bed. Joint inflammation way down, I actually felt like going for a walk for fun and not just because I need to walk. On day 5, I added a little ketchup for my russets. Then I went pretty crazy with fat/oil-free condiments and still continued to lose weight at a steady pace. 

I'm telling you right now that I'm not the best at sticking to a diet. I've been in a bulking phase my whole life and, though I once lost over 1 hundred pounds on the keto diet, I felt miserable and deprived. So starting on day 6, I decided to incorporate condiments into my potato diet: any ones I wanted, as long as they were fat/oil-free and what I deemed ""reasonable"". I bought several fancy mustards. I bought sriracha, hoisin sauce, and chili-garlic paste. I added garlic salt, onion powder, marmite, and Tabasco to my 'taters. I added Ponzu sauce, a little maple syrup on occasion, and Chili Gods hot mustard. Not a ton of condiments were ever used, but enough to keep things interesting. 

I ate potatoes when I felt hunger, sometimes heated up in the microwave or crispy-skinned from the oven, sometimes cold with a squirt of bbq sauce in front of the fridge. I didn't force myself to eat and I took potatoes with me in a container (along with some hot sauce packets) when I was going to be gone all day and thought I might get hungry.

On day 17, I ate a turkey club sandwich with bacon and some Sun Chips while on a date with my wife. Then I went back to eating potatoes.

On day 24, I ate 2 slices of pepperoni pizza from Costco because the smell of it was causing my brain to go haywire and my eye to twitch. Then I went back to eating potatoes.

When I hit my first big goal (just 2 lbs. away!), I will eat a steak and have sour cream on my potato if I feel like it. Then I will go back to eating potatoes again until I hit my next goal.

I eat, generally speaking, 95% potatoes and it has simplified my life, saved me a LOT of money, and improved my health. I will continue this diet, strict sometimes and with the occasional non-diet meal, for the rest of my life as long as my health allows. 

Here are the raw numbers: I went from 373.2 lbs. to 352.0 lbs. in 29 days, weighed this morning. My blood pressure (that I track daily from multiple reading at the same time of day) went from 142 over 93 all the way down to 114 over 75. My doctor is happy, my spouse is happy, and I do not feel deprived of what I want.

I’ll start with a few:

“Morally gray”: Can now apply to any character who is rude sometimes. 

“Enemies to lovers”: Have they both tried and nearly succeeded at brutally murdering one another? Did one of them spill coffee on the other 5 years ago and mumble “sorry,”but the other character didn’t hear it so now it’s a whole thing? Fuck if I know, because this trope could mean either option or anything in between! Gotta market those tropes! 

“Stabby”: I may or may not be venturing into hot take (or at least lukewarm?) territory here, but this seems to now mean “FMC I didn’t like.” Not saying there’s no legit criticism of this trope - there is!!! Plenty! But so many of the complaints just apply to general bad writing and characterization. 

(Super extra bonus points if the poster tells us how the FMC being good with swords/knives/whatever makes her a misogynist not like other girls girl while making sure we know what a stupid bitch every FMC they don’t like is. Thank you, brave soldiers, for defeating sexism.)

**27.01.25 - Monday**  
Woke up at 0300 too pee and was awake. Stayed awake instead of sleeping until 0400.  
**0310  - 0400: Meditation BOTEC 1 or 2 (can't remember)**  
I sill felt ill. Lil headache and stuffed nose. It is more difficult to meditate with this symptoms. And I can only imagine how hard it is when you actually feel pain everywhere and still do the meditations.

\#people from stories of transformations

Today I again only slept 6 hours. I was wondering if right now I only need 6 hours of sleep, instead of 7,5 hours, because I don't do that much weightlifting as I used to and maybe my body is more rejuvenated through the daily meditations

**0403 - 0428: Meditation Generous Present Moment (1,5x speed)**  
In the BOTEC meditation before I wanted to do the meditations GOLOV and NLP (9 mins), so I have more time doing taxes. But this is thinking about the future. So I decided to do present moment meditation instead + a lil bit of stretch.

**0455 - 0610: Work on tax stuff**  
During this time, I sometimes had the urge to go to work right now, lol. My mind is playing tricks on me.  
**0615 - 1800: Work**  
**1830 - 2018: More tax stuff**  
**2025 Sleep**  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**Todays's total meditation time: 1 hour and 15 mins (27.01.25)**  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**28.01.25 - Tuesday**  
Slept on purpose until 0430, because I still felt ill.

**0437 - 0511: Meditation Synchronizing heart and brain**  
I tried meditating sitting in bed, because it was more comfortable and I could protect my neck from the cold air with bed sheets. I liked it. So I will continue meditation in bed until I am not feeling ill anymore.  
Also, my mind wanted me to work on tax again right now. That’s why I again did the present moment meditation instead. Keep that sucker (mind) on a tight leash.

**0512 - 0558:** **Meditation Generous Present Moment**  
**0615 - 1700: Work**  
**1715 - 1930: Tax work** 

On 27.01. I didn't do GOLOV, Gratitude or NLP. So my streak would be gone. And then there is a book called ""Tell yourself a better lie"". And since I wasted like zero seconds during Monday and Tuesday since I was working on tax, I will just tell myself the monday didn't exist and I will keep the streak going today.

**Which better lies could you tell yourself?**

**1957 - 2006: NLP**  
I have so much on my mind what I want to do, but I feel good and way less stressed out about ""all the stuff to do"" (personal, tax and work related). Also, my sense of time is a lil bit off and funny. I think its Wednesday or Thursday already, but its only Tuesday.

**0615 - 1843: work**

I was off coffee for about 6 weeks. I drank one on the first day and today, because I felt really tired. But apart from that, my energy levels are good. Sure, I could boost effciency by drinking a coffee, but I don't have the ""inner need"" for a coffee.  
Also, I don't feel bad for not training for a week again, because of my illness. So, that's cool.

I will do a ""meditation plan"" next. Which meditation to do when. So I don't have to waste thoughts about which meditation to do.

**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques**

* **Italian love**
   * See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
   * Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
   * Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?
* **Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**
   * When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
   * And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
   * Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
   * Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe. Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
   * Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?
* **Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**
   * Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance
      * or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
   * and see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
   * know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you having already banished your old self from your current life
   * and your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
   * PS: I'm not kidding.
* **Banana Boss**
   * I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
   * Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
   * As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
      * One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
      * Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
      * Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
      * One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
      * One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and say ""This a\*\*hole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.
   * Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
   * NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this. It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.

The next morning, Nuria stirred lazily in bed, sunlight streaming through the curtains of her new room. She stretched her arms with a satisfied sigh, then slid out from under the covers. Pulling on a loose-fitting top and a pair of leggings, she ran her fingers through her hair before heading downstairs.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the faint clink of dishes greeted her as she reached the kitchen. Tim was already there, sitting at the small breakfast table, nibbling on a piece of toast while glancing at his phone.

“Morning,” she said casually, her voice still a bit raspy from sleep.

Tim looked up, managing a polite smile. “Good morning.”

She poured herself a cup of coffee, sitting down across from him. Her eyes trailed over the table, noticing the half-empty plate of toast and jam.

“You’re up early,” Nuria remarked, sipping from her mug.

“I have to head to work,” Tim explained, folding up his napkin and standing to place his dishes in the sink.

Nuria arched an eyebrow. “Work? Already? You’re just going to leave me here alone?”

Tim gave her an apologetic shrug. “It’s my regular schedule. I leave around this time every day.”

She frowned but didn’t press further, instead watching as he moved to grab his bag and coat. Her gaze followed him to the counter where his car keys lay. The moment his hand touched them, Nuria’s voice broke the silence.

“Wait.”

Tim turned around, confused. “What’s wrong?”

Nuria leaned back in her chair, casually swirling her coffee. “Where do you think you’re going with those?”

“Uh, to work?” Tim said hesitantly, holding up the keys.

Nuria clicked her tongue disapprovingly. “No, no, no. That’s not going to work for me, Timmy. I was thinking I’d take the car today.”

Tim blinked, his grip tightening on the keys. “But I need the car to get to work.”

Nuria smiled, as though she found his response amusing. “And I need the car to enjoy the neighborhood. I want to see the area, maybe visit some shops, take a walk in the park. If I have to take the bus, I’ll lose so much time.”

Tim’s mouth opened slightly, his frustration mounting. “If I take the bus, I’ll lose time too, Nuria. I’ll be late for work.”

She gave an exaggerated shrug. “Well, I’m sure your boss will understand if you explain.”

Tim frowned. “This isn’t fair. I need the car more than you do today.”

Nuria tilted her head, fixing him with a firm, expectant stare. “Fair? Tim, my comfort comes first. You know that by now, don’t you? Or do I need to remind you?”

He hesitated, glancing at the clock on the wall. Time was slipping away, and arguing with her was clearly a losing battle.

Nuria tapped her fingers on the table, her tone softening slightly. “Come on, Timmy. Don’t make a big deal out of this. It’s not like I’m asking you to walk. There’s a bus stop at the end of the street, right?”

Tim sighed, his shoulders sagging. He moved toward the door, clearly reluctant to continue the conversation.

“Tim,” Nuria said sharply, her voice cutting through the air.

He froze, turning back to look at her. She extended her hand expectantly, her fingers wiggling slightly. “The keys,” she said simply.

Tim glanced at the keys in his hand, then back at Nuria, his expression torn between frustration and resignation. He walked over to her and placed them in her palm.

Nuria’s lips curved into a satisfied smile. “Good boy,” she said teasingly. “And you can pick up my shoes next weekend… My mom has some work for you to do this Saturday.”

Without another word, Tim turned back toward the door.

“Oh, Tim?” Nuria called out, making him stop once more.

He looked back over his shoulder, his expression tired. “Yes?”

“Cheer up, will you? It’s not the end of the world. The fresh air from walking to the bus stop might even do you some good.” She grinned, twirling the keys around her finger.

Tim didn’t respond. He stepped outside, shutting the door behind him. As he walked down the driveway, he could hear the faint sound of Nuria humming cheerfully to herself from the kitchen.

By the time he reached the bus stop, Tim was already dreading the rest of the day.

The day at work had been grueling for Tim. By the time he trudged up to his front door, all he could think about was collapsing on the couch, putting on some mindless TV, and unwinding for the evening. As he stepped inside, he immediately noticed two things.

First, the house was completely quiet. No loud music, no chatter, and no demands for him to fetch something or clean something. Second, his car wasn’t in the garage. Nuria was still out.

For a brief moment, he felt relieved. It was rare to have the house to himself these days, and Tim decided to savor it. He dropped his bag, kicked off his shoes, and sank into the couch with a long sigh. A small smile crept onto his face as he flicked through the TV channels, enjoying the calm.

But the peace didn’t last.

A buzz from his phone interrupted his bliss. He glanced at the screen and saw a message from Nuria:

“That shop near your work sells the best fried chicken I’ve ever had. Can you grab some on your way home?”

Tim frowned, reading the message twice. He typed back quickly:  
“I’m already home.”

Moments later, her reply came through:  
“...”

Tim stared at the screen, confused. What did she mean by that? After hesitating for a moment, he typed:  
“?”

Nuria’s response was almost instant:  
“I thought you were smart, Timmy. By now, you should’ve figured out that this means you’ll need to get back on the bus, go back to your work area, and grab the chicken. Then take the bus home again. Simple.”

Tim groaned, running a hand through his hair. He quickly typed back:  
“I can’t do that. I just got home, and with the traffic, it’ll take me at least 40 minutes to get there and back.”

Her response came swiftly, and it was as direct as ever:  
“Well, I have my heart set on fried chicken now. So figure it out.”

Tim stared at his phone, dumbfounded. For a moment, he considered ignoring her message entirely, but he knew better. She had a way of making his life miserable when she didn’t get her way. With a long sigh of defeat, he got up, slipped his shoes back on, and stepped out into the crisp evening air.

 

The bus ride to his work area was torture. The streets were clogged with traffic, and every stop seemed to drag on forever. The bus was packed, and Tim had to stand most of the way, clutching the overhead bar as the vehicle lurched forward in the stop-and-go traffic.

By the time he finally reached the chicken shop, he felt drained. But at least he was here. He walked into the brightly lit restaurant, placed the order, and waited for the food to be prepared.

While standing near the counter, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, and sure enough, it was Nuria calling. With a heavy sigh, he answered.

“Hello?”

Her voice was cheery on the other end. “Timmy! Change of plans. My boyfriend just suggested we grab a bite to eat together. I’m about to pick him up, and we’ll probably just drive around until we find a nice place to eat.”

Tim’s jaw dropped. “Wait, what?”

But before he could get another word in, she cut him off. “So, you don’t need to bother with the fried chicken anymore. Okay? Thanks, Timmy!”

“Nuria, I’m already—” Tim started, but the line went dead before he could finish.

He lowered the phone, staring at the blank screen in disbelief. He’d just spent nearly an hour on the bus to get here, and now it was all for nothing. He glanced at the counter where his order was being packed. A frustrated laugh escaped his lips, but it was humorless. He grabbed the food when it was ready, stuffing the bag under his arm, and headed back to the bus stop.

The ride home felt even longer. The traffic hadn’t improved, and the chicken in his bag only served as a mocking reminder of the wasted trip. By the time he finally walked through the front door, he felt completely drained.

The house was still empty. Nuria’s absence was both a relief and a sting. Tossing the bag of chicken onto the counter, Tim dropped into a chair at the kitchen table, resting his head in his hands.

The silence of the house wrapped around him again, but this time it didn’t feel comforting. Instead, it felt heavy.

He glanced at the chicken, knowing he didn’t have the appetite to eat it himself. His stomach churned at the thought of the entire evening wasted on someone else’s whim.

Shaking his head, he pushed the bag aside and trudged upstairs, ready to collapse into bed. Maybe tomorrow would be different, but he doubted it.



Tim was jolted awake by the unmistakable sounds coming from Nuria’s bedroom. At first, he thought he had imagined it, but as he became more alert, there was no mistaking what was happening. Laughter, whispers, and then the rhythmic creaking of the bed. His jaw tightened. It was like she was doing it on purpose—making sure he could hear every single thing.

Axl’s voice was deep, teasing, murmuring words that Tim couldn’t quite make out. But Nuria’s voice was crystal clear. Loud, deliberate, unashamed. Every now and then, she let out an exaggerated gasp or moan, almost as if she were putting on a performance. And then there were the bangs—the repeated thuds against the thin wall separating their rooms.

Tim squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself to block out the sounds, but it was impossible. His pulse pounded in his ears, matching the insistent creaks of the mattress. He turned onto his side, pressing his face against the pillow, but the sounds only grew louder. He clenched his fists.

Then, after a long, drawn-out cry from Nuria, the noises finally subsided. He exhaled in relief, but his reprieve was short-lived. Their voices started up again, this time softer, more relaxed.

""That was good,"" Axl said, his voice lazy with satisfaction.

Nuria giggled. ""I told you you’d enjoy staying here.""

Tim tried to focus on his breathing, but his ears were still picking up every word.

""Tomorrow,"" Nuria continued, ""I’m making sure you get breakfast in bed.""

Axl chuckled. ""Oh yeah? You cooking for me now?""

Nuria snorted. ""Please. Me? Cook?"" She laughed and then, in a tone loud enough for Tim to hear, she added, ""No, I’ll make sure Timmy takes care of that.""

Tim's stomach turned.

Axl laughed. ""You really got him trained, huh?""

""Oh, you have no idea,"" Nuria purred. ""Just wait until you see how obedient he can be.""

Tim gritted his teeth and pulled the blanket over his head, trying to drown them out.

Tomorrow was going to be another long day.

 

Tim was already awake when he heard Nuria’s voice calling from her bedroom. At first, he tried to ignore it, hoping she would give up. But then her voice became sharper.

“You have three seconds to get up here, Timmy.”

Tim swallowed hard and quickly made his way upstairs. He hesitated in front of the door, unsure whether to enter or not. He gently knocked instead.

“Come in,” Nuria’s voice carried through the door, sounding both amused and authoritative.

As he stepped inside, his eyes widened. The room was a complete disaster. Clothes were strewn across the floor, shoes kicked in every direction, and an unmistakable haze of cigarette smoke lingered in the air. The scent was thick, mixed with perfume and something heavier.

Nuria sat on the bed, lazily draped in a thin sheet, a cigarette between her fingers. Beside her, Axl lay back against the pillows, looking half-asleep yet complese. He glanced up at Tim with a smirk.

“Good morning, Timmy,” Nuria purred, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. “I hope you slept well. We, on the other hand, had a… very busy night.” She wintely at eaked playfully at Axl, who chuckled.

Tim cleared his throat awkwardly. “Uh… what do you need?”

Nuria tilted her head as if she were surprised by the question. “Breakfast, of course. But not just any breakfast.” She leaned forward slightly. “We want a deluxe breakfast. Fresh croissants, eggs, bacon, fresh-squeezed orange juice, fruit, maybe even some pastries.”

Tim sighed. “I really don’t have time for that. I have to catch the bus soon to get to work.”

Nuria’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “Oh, the bus,” she repeated slowly, as if savoring the words. “Yes, that’s right. You take the bus now.” She exchanged a glance with Axl before returning her gaze to Tim. “Well, today you’ll just have to take the next bus.”

Tim frowned. “But I can’t be late for work.”

Nuria exhaled another cloud of smoke and smiled. “I’m sure they’ll understand. I mean, this is important. You wouldn’t want your landlady to go hungry, would you?”

Tim blinked. “You mean housemate.”

Axl laughed as Nuria smirked. “No, Timmy. I meant what I said. Landlady. You’ll get used to it.”

Tim clenched his jaw slightly but remained silent. There was no arguing with her when she got like this.

Nuria stretched lazily and then snapped her fingers. “You may use the car to go get breakfast.”

Tim was genuinely surprised. “Really?”

She waved a dismissive hand. “Just this once. But don’t get used to it.”

“Thank you,” Tim mumbled.

But Nuria had already lost interest in him. She turned back to Axl, kissing his neck as if Tim had already left the room.

Tim shifted uncomfortably. “Okay… I guess I’ll go now.”

Nuria didn’t even look at him. “You’d better hurry. Twenty minutes, Timmy.”

Axl grinned. “I hope the coffee’s hot.”

Tim nodded stiffly and walked out, the sound of Nuria’s soft laughter following him down the hall.

1. My local Starbucks closed for remodeling and reopened as a to-go only store. There is no longer any place to sit, inside or out. This shop was on my regular rotation for walking my dog, and we would sit outside, but we can no longer do that. So I’ve quit going there.
2. Despite news to the contrary, none of the Starbucks I’ve visited has an area for customers to add their own cream, sugar, etc. If you ask, they’ll give you a wasteful amount of cream in a cup. If you ask them to put cream and sugar in your coffee, it’s never the right amounts (usually too much).
3. Service is extremely slow due to the large amounts of mobile orders. Some stores with seating have become teen hangouts, making service even slower. The lines at airport locations are usually ridiculously long.
4. Prices have gone up, and Starbucks was never inexpensive. Starbucks has also cut way back on rewards. I used to get free drinks all the time but rarely anymore.
5. Like many stores, Starbucks was hit hard by Covid, but that’s now ancient history. It seems like S never got over it, as evidenced by getting rid of seating and their reluctance to let customers add their own cream and sugar.

1id1nkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ElectrikMetriks/comments/1id1nkg/how_to_cultivate_a_network_that_grows_with_you/,How to Cultivate a Network That Grows With You [LINKEDIN Contribution],"Your network isn’t just about who you know. It’s about who knows what you know, and how they help you achieve your goals. Whether you have a robust resume or just starting your career, an intentional and thriving network is essential if you want to progress and find the right opportunities that fulfill you.

For me, there are 5 key areas that help me build genuine and authentic connections while making the biggest impact.

# 1. Build Your “Personal Board of Directors”

Thanks to a great mentor years ago, I learned that it's best to be really intentional about your networking, otherwise you're just getting to know people. While that's nice, there's potentially more strategic ways to spend your time.

Think of it this way. You want to build a team of advisors, each playing a critical role in guiding your professional growth. Just like organizations have a board of directors to help them steer the strategy, you should have a personal board of directors for the same reason.

If you need a template for this, no sweat - I created one for you. [You can download it for free here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107a2QAw3Leh9J-ZbCSk0vC4SPIpdiVVowYoKEV1yxo8/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Sheets.

Here's a brief descriptions of the roles:

* Sponsor/Advocate: Someone who speaks on your behalf and connects you to opportunities. This should be someone highly visible with great credibility. Look a few levels above where you are today and find someone there.
* Mentor: A trusted guide who shares wisdom, offers advice, and helps you navigate challenges. When meeting with a mentor, come to those meetings with questions and make sure if they give you homework - you do it on time and thoughtfully. Mentors are so important and often see potential in ways you may not have seen before.
* Peer: A colleague at a similar career stage for shared experiences and mutual learning. You should be able to vent safely to a peer, share frustrations, feel relaxed. This could be your ""bestie at work"" or even someone at a different organization. The key is that they should be in a similar place as you, but offer different perspectives.
* Coach: A motivator who pushes you to achieve your goals through honest feedback and accountability. This person should be someone that you are comfortable with, but also won't cut you any slack.
* Consultant/Specialist: This is designed to be a little more flexible, someone who is there to help you with shorter term goals. It could be a subject matter expert, such as an enthusiast, instructor, or industry leader in skills aligning with your professional development goals in IQ, EQ, or AQ. Need help identifying some of those areas? Check out my article [Unlocking Success as an Analyst: Building Your “Q” Skills](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unlocking-success-analyst-building-your-q-skills-zack-martin-mbatc/) for more on that.

Don't worry about having more than one director and some backup ""candidates"" (as outlined in the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107a2QAw3Leh9J-ZbCSk0vC4SPIpdiVVowYoKEV1yxo8/edit?usp=sharing)) - these positions will change over time and should be reevaluated regularly for maximum effectiveness.

# 2. Focus on Meaningful Connections

After building your Personal Board of Directors, you should still keep networking with others. But it shouldn't be just adding people as connections on LinkedIn; it’s about building meaningful connections.

Here are some ways to foster authentic relationships:

* Start with Shared Interests: Connect with people who inspire you or share your professional interests.
* Follow Up and Stay in Touch: A quick note or sharing an article can keep relationships alive over time. Offer to meet virtually or grab a coffee if they live in your area or if you're traveling near them.
* Respect Their Time: Make sure you're not just connecting to connect. Make sure you bring at least 1 question or valuable thing to discuss in case the conversation doesn't just take off in a direction. Offer time back if you don't have much to talk about past that.
* Offer Help First: Helping others, whether through introductions or advice, creates goodwill and strengthens bonds.
* Consider the [Emotional Bank Account](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/emotional-bank-account-dean-crisp/) Philosophy: You need to make deposits before you make withdrawals.

The strongest networks are built on trust, mutual respect, and shared growth.

# 3. Leverage Online Communities and Platforms

Networking in the digital age is about more than just attending events. Online communities offer opportunities to connect with professionals who understand your challenges and experiences.

The list below is focused for my typical audience, but the idea is the same across other professions.

* LinkedIn Groups: Join communities like [GOATs](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14585275/) (Global Organization for Analysts' Transformation) to exchange ideas, share insights, and grow together. Introduce yourself and participate actively. Engagement builds visibility.
* Specialized Forums: Reddit communities like r/DataAnalyst or r/Analytics are great for learning and collaboration. Find others in my [Comprehensive Analyst's Guide to Career Resources](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comprehensive-analysts-guide-career-resources-2025-zack-martin-iq7wc).
* Professional Associations: Organizations like IIBA or ADASCI can open doors to new mentors and peers. What organizations exist in your profession?

Remember, networking is a two-way street. Contribute value by answering questions, sharing resources, and supporting others.

# 4. Adopt a Growth Mindset

As your career evolves, so should your network. Embrace [curiosity and courage](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curiosity-courage-core-competencies-analysts-zack-martin-krltc/). Seek out new perspectives and be open to learning from others’ experiences.

Each person you connect with adds a unique layer to your network. With every conversation, you gain insight that expands your understanding and possibilities.

# 5. Don’t Be Afraid to be Uncomfortable

Networking can feel intimidating, especially when reaching out to someone influential. But growth happens when you take risks.

Start small:

* Send a LinkedIn connection request with a personalized note.
* Ask someone for a virtual coffee chat.
* Join discussions in an online forum. Be supportive and authentic, and you'll usually be met with the same energy!

Remember, every step out of your comfort zone strengthens your network and your confidence.

# What's Next?

Building a network that grows with you takes time and intention. Start by reaching out to one person today. It may be a mentor you admire, a peer in your field, or someone you’d like to learn from.

Your future self will thank you for the effort, and doing just a little bit every day will make an enormous difference in a week, a month, and a year from now.

Attempting to make a big decision and buy a coffee table this week! Please read and help me pick!

Option 1 (pictures 3 + 4): I would likely replace the existing feet with hairpin legs to it to elevate it a little further off the ground. Only concern about this one is the lip…I think it might be uncomfortable for resting our heels!

Option 2 (pictures 5 + 6): new round table option that gives a little more air/space to the room. Perfect height but my only hesitation is the break down the middle of the table. Do we hate that or not mind it? Do we prefer this thinner look?

Thanks for your guidance!",1,1738177306.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I (26F) have ADHD and ASD and know that I can be hard to be in a relationship with. My boyfriend (23M) - let's call him Jack - is neurotypical but does have anxiety. We live together with my cat and have for over a year. 

Jack & I often end up in arguments that are over silly things because I don't feel like I can question something without him immediately getting defensive. He can't feel like he can raise issues without me getting upset/annoyed and see previous point for how I end up feeling. OR he won't bring up the issue until I have something that bothered me but then the conversation turns to what bothered him and finishes in his mind once he has his peace. I have almost no emotional regulation and struggle to control when I'm upset etc.

Our last argument was over me getting up early and having morning coffee on the couch around 8am on Sunday. I'd been awake since 6.30 and when Jack woke up, he was scrolling on his phone. In my mind, he didn't want morning cuddles and I was free to get up and do what I wanted. As U was getting up, he put his phone down and asked me to come back for a cuddle but I had in my head that I wanted coffee on the couch. I struggle to change my mind once it ks made up especiallt when someone suddenly decided they want something else. I followed my plan but he got upset and told me that he thought I was having coffee on the couch to punish him. 

I don't like how his mind thinks I could be that type of person because I always talk about my issues when I have them even if they end up in arguments. If he thinks I am the type of person to punish someone for something like that... then he can't know who I am. He later admitted saying his cos he was upset and didn't care if it would hurt me. 

It got to the point where Jack said 'I don't know why it always has to get like this, I just wanted to have a nice morning.' This always comes across as shurking any fault in the situation and bugs me. I felt like I shouldn't have to wait just in case he wants a cuddle sometime during the morning hours. He then got annoyed because he felt like he wasn't allowed to scroll on his phone anymore and have a slow morning. 

I'm going to be clear - I had no problems with him scrolling on his phone. Sometimes that's exactly how I want to start my morning too! But I had an issue with me starting my day, and Jack insisting I change what I wanted to do because he was now 'ready' to give me cuddles. 

Sorry this is longer than I thought...

Anyway, after a blow up, we tried to talk about how we feel. He told me sometimes he thinks about being with someone else when the arguments get bad & about how it would be easier. This upset me and now I can't stop thinking about it. I'm questioning my feelings, if this relationship is worth it in my head & if I am staying for the right reasons...

I need someone who is willing to be patient throughout my emotion irregularities because I cannot control them & am on a list for ADHD meds but IDK when I'll get them. I need someone who doesn't get annoyed when I voice how I feel. I need someone who can talk about emotions and not deflect onto their hurt in order to avoid mine. He tells me he can learn these things but it's been 2 years... 

Sometimes I feel like he is immature and lazy in his thinking - why ask me a question when if you take 5 seconds, you'll find you already know the answer. I'm 26 and I want a future with kids- but i want it with someone mature, stable and someone I can count on when things get tough. If this is what we are like without kids...

Quick note: i hate words when they aren't true - and my love languages are quality time and acts of service. When I'm upset, he only gives me words and shuts down emotion and asks 'well what do you want me to do?' When I've told him many times what I need. 

I guess what im asking is... how do I figure out if I still love my boyfriend? And how do I do it in a way that won't hurt him or waste his time if Im not...? ",0,1738177237.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

TLDR:The pics linked are messages between my wife and a guy (ex coworker of hers that live across country) that she says is just a friend. These are the messages I have the biggest issue with that happened in the last year. 

Am I correct in thinking that these messages are unacceptable? 

[The text pics](https://imgur.com/a/is-this-acceptable-conversation-when-married-UKR464L)

Edit 1. Had the wrong link (and apparently it jacked the order of the messages)




**LONG VERSION CONTEXT ECT**
First My apologies to those of you that choose to read this trash fire. And my thanks to those of you that have genuine constructive comments. 

I am loosing my shit, and am a mental mess. Im at the point I think only divorce is the available option. I found out a few years ago I'm autistic and have ADHD. And so I know I don't look at things the same way as most people, but I am really struggling trying to accept that these messages are acceptable behavior when you're married and in a committed relationship. 

my wife said yesterday that she doesn't see anything wrong with the messages she sent. When I asked her point blank if she thought they were inappropriate.

I tried to get the photos chronologically but had some issues. Apologies there. 

If there is enough interest I can share relationship back story and the other shit that has put me to this point that I'm asking for advice from the mob... Because right now I feel like I'm drowning, I'm a mess, shaking, hot and cold, feel like my heart is exploding like the first time I drank a BFC monster and 30oz of coffee 20 years ago... 

**Background**
I was raised heavy Christian, no sex before marriage, 1 person only, divorce isn't an option. (Example when I moved out and said I was moving on with my gf and my dad asked if we had slept together, when I said yes... His reply was ""you don't fuck pussy and not marry it"")
had 2 gf before her. Only made out with 1, hand holding the other. Never had sex before getting with my wife. 

She was raised with pretty much wait until you're 18 to have sex. She had 3 partners before we got together. 


**Situation background**

We have been rebuilding the relationship after I found out in 18 that she cheated on me back in 2013 with a coworker (different guy) when I moved out of state for work and was finding us a place to move into. (There's more here but not really pertinent to current events besides my emotional state)

The guy from the texts she started seeing a lot after he quit where they worked, sometime around 2015ish... she would go see him after work and bring him dinner kind of shit without telling me she wasn't coming home, or id come home and she was gone. I lost my cool at her behavior and said it was too similar to behavior back in 12 when she cheated. 

This guy moved out of state and my problem removed itself, when he pretty much ghosted her during his moving. She got really upset by that and when he reached back out after a year or so she was so happy. 

I told her I'm uncomfortable with their relationship, that in my mind he is a stand in for the guy from 2012, and I'm not going to tell her to stop talking to him. I don't want to be a controlling asshole and give her her space. but said I'm uncomfortable with the relationship and I'm not cool with conversations if it turns sexual. (sexting specifically her and him texts) 
For example:
You want to ask did you get laid on your date, cool. 
What do you like in the bedroom... I'm uncomfortable with, but okay. 
I want to do that with you in the bedroom. Not okay. 
I asked that if the conversations get sexual or she wants them to get sexual that we talk about it. She said she didn't want to give up the friendship but she agreed to communicate any changes in feelings and desires. 

(After trying to fix shit with therapy on my end since since 2020 we have been toe in the pool with nonmonogamy. We had a 3sum, I've been with 2 other women. Things have been getting really good in the bedroom and around each other with our communication. Therapy and real conversations have been holy shit balls I wish this is what we had 2 decads prior.)

**Drama situation context**

In 2022 she helped a friend move cross country, road trip. She wanted to stop in and see his place maybe grab dinner. I said I'm uncomfortable with her seeing him, but since she was with her friend I was like okay. all I ask is that when you get into town and stop at the hotel for the night, before you go see him, text or call me. 

She didn't. And afterwards was all apologizes while I was loosing my mind...
 The worst part her friend was tired with a headache and stayed at the hotel... And she got caught up in getting into the hotel that she forgot to call or text me and she went and saw him alone. 

I lost my shit. And the last 2 years we have been again fixing shit. More therapy on my end. Better communication, I'm feeling heard, validated ect... Again getting even more epic. 

**DRAMA**

Here in October we were having a conversation and I can't remember how we got on the subject but she said something along the lines of ""when I cuddled with him"" ... Slam on breaks WTF? You what? She claims she told me. Yah no, I would have lost my shit then. She says nothing else happened, they were reading a book. (Honestly, that is likely. we are all avid readers, I know the guy from when they worked together, we used to geek books a lot before he bailed out of state)

Anyways, this has been chewing in the back of my head for 2 months and Dec Friday the 13th happens... We were talking Thursday night the 12th and something she said (us talking about past behaviors and trying to fix the issues that have got us to the broken parts. Why she thinks she cheated on 12) stuck with me over night as I'm staring at the ceiling.

Friday morning I grab her phone and start to go through texts. Other dudes co workers ECT, all good. Nothing weird at all. And then I pull up their conversation... 
(part of the fixing shit back in 2020 was that she doesn't lock her phone and I can see any messages with anyone if I choose. Same on my end. I think I looked once back then in 2020ish and nothing was weird so no issues. Didn't look again until last month)

(His name in her phone is Hedon, short for hedonistic...)

And the first message I see is ""yes daddy""

I lost my fucking mind. Hole in my stocmach, wanting to throw up, and started going back further. Got to the end of 2024 and had to set the phone down. I exploded... 

(Context there because I feel it's important as to why Im loosing it so much. In our 21 years she's said she doesn't want to call me Daddy because she has a step dad, and never wants to think of him that way. Totally makes sense to me. But after years that restriction finally fell away maybe in the last year or 2 in our bedroom roleplaying.)

And since then she has deleted the conversation thread saying it is so she can avoid seeing his name and wanting to reach out. 


This has been boiling inside for the last month... And our conversation yesterday has got me loosing my shit again... 


**Context to some of the things in the chat**

1. she was avoiding her final papers. 
2. Apparently road head is what they refer to calls on the way to or from work. 
3. Yes that is a pic of dildo measurements...Her claim, it's a medical conversation not sexual... That shes shared that info with the girls she works with too... 
4. I think I've gotten flowers maybe 2x in 21 years... (Yes I think flowers are dumb and a waste of time and money) But I still get them for her occasionally. Maybe 1-2x a year. Even though, I'd still  appreciate feeling thought about. 
5. He got a vasectomy and she sent him like a gift basket of stuff. I remember that, we talked about it when it happened, I was cool with it. I got snipped as well and an icepack is definitely nice. 
6. Her betting an orgasm is one of my biggest wtfs. That's something that we have been doing for years on ""who's that actor"" type bets when we can't remember someones face. And we cash in those bets. So her betting that with another dude has me up the wall. And she still doesn't see anything wrong with it. Her reasoning is that she doesn't see him so it's not an issue...

FADE IN:   

EXT. THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC - DAWN - ESTABLISHING  

*A fleet of ‘scientific research vessels’ can be seen bobbing up and down in the cold ocean waves. Sailors in waterproofed coats scurry across the ships’ narrow decks, stacking ugly metal canisters next to launch rails mounted on the aft end of each vessel. These objects are periodically rolled off the ships’ sterns by their crews, plunging into the depths before detonating in thunderous underwater explosions that shower the sailors in salt spray. The ship closest to the foreground rocks violently in the swells, but we can still see the name ‘[SVEND FOYN](https://nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svend_Foyn)’ stencilled across its bow in bold, capital letters.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** Adaptability in the face of adversity remains a prized virtue throughout the UNSC, and nowhere is this more evident than in the [Kingdom of Norway’s storied fleet of scientific whalers](https://uk.whales.org/our-goals/stop-whaling/whaling-in-norway/). Following the [total collapse of cetacean populations](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/u6r2pr/alert_the_peace_and_the_panic_goodbye_to_the/), these brave men and women scientists were forced to abandon their traditional livelihoods, pivoting towards far more dangerous game.   

*A thickly-bearded man with a magnificent mustache stands just outside the Bridge of the Svend Foyn, wearing a thickly-woven Norwegian wool sweater. The Captain’s hands, sheathed in huge leather work gloves, rest casually on the grip of a massive harpoon gun. The ugly weapon is tipped with a heavy explosive charge.*  

CHYRON: “Karl Magdahl - Professional Kraken ~~Hunter~~ Biologist”  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** The [‘Kraken Hunt’](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/u6wlkt/event_tough_to_swallow/) has since expanded into a celebrated annual event, drawing teams of marine biologists who compete for the honor of catching the largest giant squid specimens in advance of the *Kjempeblekksprut Festival*, feeding the Confederation’s insatiable hunger for scientific knowledge and the world’s largest calamari rings.  

**KARL:** Put your backs into it, you damn Researchers! I need more Charges in the water ASAP!  

*Aye-ayes can be heard from the ship’s drenched crewmen, who send another improvised explosive overboard with gusto. After the next detonation rips apart the water, a voice can be heard crackling over the vessel’s radio.*    

**VINLAND:** Svend Foyn, this is the HMS *Vinland*, how do you read?  

*The Captain curses as his thick-gloved hands fumble with the marine radio transponder. Eventually he manages to successfully depress the microphone’s transmit button.*  

**KARL:** Loud and clear, *Vinland*. About time you got here! Party’s been underway for a while now.   

**VINLAND:** Any signs of the Entity?  

*The Captain is about to answer when one of the nearby ‘research vessels’ abruptly capsizes, overturned by what appears to be a massive serrated tail emerging from the depths. He seizes the harpoon gun, spinning it around to face the Creature, then fires.*  

**KARL:** All ships, lay into that *Drittsekk!*   

*The Svend Foyn’s harpoon is joined by a barrage of projectiles, each impacting the Entity with explosive force. The cable attached to the end of the weapon snaps taut, spooling rapidly out of its housing as the Creature seizures violently. Magdahl seizes the radio attachment microphone and screams into the microphone.*  

**KARL:** We’re engaging the bastard now! Requesting immediate backup!     

INT. HMS VINLAND - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - GENERAL QUARTERS  

*The Vinland’s CIC is hive of activity, adjutants hammering keyboards and making haptic gestures across tactile screens. Observing the chaos from his command throne, King George VII leans forwards in his seat, his chin propped against the back of a white-gloved hand. The Monarch’s eyes are focused on the various elements simulated on the 2.5D pinscreen tabletop at the center of the room. At one end of the table, high-fidelity models of the ‘scientific research’ fleet can be seen engaging what appears to be a thrashing crustacean-like beast with a flurry of criss-crossing web of harpoons. Symbology corresponding to the HMS Vinland and her escorts is displayed on the opposite end of the countertop, the display slowly zooming into the scene as the carrier battlegroup steams towards the civilian ‘research’ fleet and its wounded prey.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** As an unusual holdover of its origin as an [Alliance practicing Armed Neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/poy96j/diplomacy_the_north_remembers/), the UNSC continues to employ elements of its seagoing civilian population as [maritime militia](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/april/one-nations-fishing-fleet-another-nations-pirates-countering). These irregular forces are tasked with unconventionally and asymmetrically extending the reach of the Confederation’s sovereignty in peacetime, and possess several unique skillsets that would be leveraged in an auxiliary capacity during crisis or conflict.  

CHYRON: “His Majesty George VII, King of the Bri’Rish Fennoscandian Federation, STOICS Allied Maritime Command Rank Admiral”  

**GEORGE:** An ETA on Dullahan Flight, if you would be so kind?  

*Sandy Woodward stands to the immediate right of the Command Throne, his eyes appearing glazed over as he processes the torrent of battlespace information piped through the SAINTS network into his supercomputing brain. He slowly raises one hand with the air of a maestro, and the holographic representations of multiple combat aircraft of various makes speeding across the center of the display are highlighted with pulsing blue rings. Dashed vector lines emerge, drawn between the planes and the thrashing monstrosity.*    

NARRATOR (ISMAIL): And while their days [accompanying the Japanese whaling fleets](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/ouae1x/conflict_asahi_its_hard_work_the_refrain/h717q95/) are long behind them, the Confederation’s maritime scientific community continues to produce adept sailors, particularly against more… unconventional threats.    

CHYRON: “Sir John Forster ‘Sandy’ Woodward, HMS *Vinland* Key Administrative Management Intelligence, Sapient A.I. Simulacra”   

**SANDY:** Dullahan One reports they will have the Entity in radiofrequency track range in just under three minutes, Your Highness.   

**GEORGE:** Relay to Wing Commander Hammer that I’m authorizing the use of their maritime strike packages, provided they can avoid any collateral damage on the Marine Biologists.  

*Woodward gestures with his opposite hand, and the pulsing transparent sphere marked “DULLAHAN SQUADRON” expands suddenly. Symbols corresponding to each of the combat planes in the formation hover on the perimeter of the orb, flanked by the visual icons of assorted weapons inside their payload bays.*  

**SANDY:** In anticipation of His Majesty's orders, I’ve ordered extremely-comprehensive mission packages loaded aboard Dullahan’s accompanying Fjalar-M flights. The same goes for the follow-up squadrons from O’Malley’s Hunter-Killer Group, though those have been equipped with larger standoff systems.  

**GEORGE:** Are the SVALINN boys keeping a respectful distance?  

**SANDY:** His Majesty’s personal appeal to Allied Aerospace Command appears to have been well-received. Overmind and its escorts will continue to provide us with long-range overwatch, with Hræsvelgrs and Wyverns are QRA-ready on the tarmac at Joint Bases Keflavik and Ciudad Real. They’ll only launch on your go-ahead.    

*In spite of the thick atmospheric tension permeating the CIC, King George smiles.*  

**GEORGE:** Ah, so glad they’re allowing us to take the lead on this one.   

**SANDY:** A golden opportunity to demonstrate the Navy’s competencies, yes. Speaking of which, I have all the fleet's coilguns on standby, though I'd prefer to have Dullahan guide those in as well.   

**GEORGE:** No point chancing them picking out the wrong targets.  

**SANDY:** None. I do value our excellent relationship with the Confederation’s civilian partners.  

**GEORGE:** Dare I ask if ‘the Donation’ is also on the way?  

**SANDY:** I’ve already relayed to our patrols that it must be allowed past the picket lines unmolested. It’s making best speed to the zone, but it’s not exactly what I would consider quick by any stretch of the word. 

**GEORGE:** Very good, Sir Sandy. Until then, let battle be joined.   

EXT. SLEDGE’S WINTER TEMPEST - AERIAL - DAWN  


*The soft glow of dawn bathes the Air Superiority fighter in orange and yellow hues, the rising sun illuminating the [**headless Dullahan emblem**](https://i.imgur.com/QlRyNQG.jpeg) on the aircraft’s fuselage. The dull cacophony of multiple jet engines can be heard over whistling, bitter winds.*   

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** While certainly a capable sixth-generation airframe, the Winter Tempest C that forms the backbone of the UNSC’s naval aviation combat forces remains a purely air-to-air platform, owing to the Confederation’s strong air superiority emphasis carrying over into Allied Maritime Command’s fleet defence doctrine.    

*The camera pulls back to show the Winter Tempest at the tip of a very large arrowhead formation. While accompanied by his usual unmanned Víðópnir wingman, Sledge’s air group includes a quartett of OUR F-35C Lightning IIs and a dozen thick-bellied Fjalar-M multirole drones, bristling with weapons mounted to their external hardpoints.  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** Thus, the Fleet Air Arm’s maritime strike and sea control missions have historically fallen to lighter multirole aircraft and a host of unmanned, subsentient UAVs.   

CHYRON: “Idris ‘Sledge’ Hammer, STOICS Allied Maritime Command Wing Commander”  

**SLEDGE:** Overmind actual, Dullahan One. Declaring a solid radar track on the Entity.   

**OVERMIND:** Roger that, Dullahan One. Vinland confirms status as weapons tight, but you are free to engage.  

**SLEDGE:** Copy, Overmind. Relaying targeting instructions to Dullahan Squadron now. Standby for standoff launch.     

*There is the tell-tale hiss of radio static indicating a frequency changeover, and Sledge addresses the remainder of his squadron.*  

**SLEDGE:** You heard the Big Brains at the top; we are cleared to engage the Entity. There are civvies in close proximity so I’ll need you to sight for your Instruments, make this a clean engagement. No blue-on-greens, understand?   

*The Wing Commander’s transmission is greeted by a rolling series of affirmatives from the various manned F-35Cs.*  

**SLEDGE:** Launch! Launch!    
 
*Remotely cued from stations aboard the manned fighters, a spread of missiles visibly separates from the escorting Fjalar-Ms. Some of these weapons fall towards the ocean, expandable wings locking into place as their sea-skimming turbofans ignite. Others streak into the higher atmosphere, seeking the thinner air craved by their hypersonic scramjets. One by one the UAVs bank away, their weapons stores spent, leaving only the lone Víðópnir and four F-35s still in formation with Sledge.*    

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** But regardless of platform, STOICS Allied Maritime Command is a firm practitioner of Captain Wayne's Hughes’ famous Maxim: *“Fire effectively first.”*    

**SLEDGE:** Kraken! Kraken! Bruisers away! Repeat, bruisers are away!  

EXT. SVEND FOYN - DECK - DAWN  

**KARL:** You WHAT!?!  

*The Captain of the ‘research’ ship stands at the bridge, the ugly criss-crossing web of explosive harpoons visible in the background behind him. The sea surges as the coiling leviathan shudders, attempting to throw off its captors. Periodically, a cable snaps with an audible whip-crack, but is quickly replaced by another harpoon fired by a neighbouring ‘scientific’ vessel.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** As part of the cost of doing business with active military forces, UNSC irregular units are routinely exposed to various occupational hazards.    


**VINLAND:** Extreme danger close. You have strike packages inbound on your positions from two-niner-niner. ETA two minutes.  

**KARL:** *Faen* take you! That wasn’t the original plan!   

**VINLAND:** Just hold it steady long enough for them to get there.   

*The Captain unleashes a string of curses too vile to translate, punching a flurry of commands into his vessel’s radio as he grabs hold of his vessel’s wheel and throws it into a hard spin.*  

**KARL:** All research vessels, the UNSC Navy has decided to fire shipwreckers at our general positions! *Esbensen, Larsen, Sørlle*, they’re vectoring in towards you, so clear the damn way!   

*Several of the ‘scientific research vessels’ execute abrupt turns, rigging lines straining and snapping as they pivot away from the incoming threat axis. The ships’ engines churn the sea into froth as the formation shifts, the surviving restraints taut as they drag the beast along with them.*     

**KARL:** All hands, brace for impact!  

*The world erupts into a thundering cacophony of explosions as the various anti-ship missiles connect with the creature’s carapace. The rolling detonations dislodge multiple harpoons, severing cables left and right, generating a vast cloud of smoke and steam that obscures the Entity from view. The Captain rushes to the railing of his ship, peering through the opaque grey morass.*  

**KARL:** Did the bastards do it? Is it over?     

*The Captain’s query is immediately followed by an audible scream from the monstrosity, generating a visible shockwave which shatters portholes and blows out sensitive electronics throughout the civilian fleet. He falls to the deck, covering the sides of his head with gloved hands in an effort to staunch the flow of blood leaking from burst eardrums.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** While dangers are naturally to be expected, the nature of the armed conflict dictates not all risks can be fully accounted for by either STOICS or its armed auxiliaries.    

*Behind the Captain's prone form, the Entity slowly emerges from the gloom, uncoiling to its full height and towering over its would-be trappers. While still obscured by fog, the Creature is obviously biomechanical in nature, displaying terrible crustacean-like appendages and faceted crimson eyes that betray an alien, otherworldly intelligence. Dark craters with radiating cracks can be seen scattered at random intervals across its armored shell, marking the locations of successful missile impacts.*  

*The Captain raises himself up on his haunches, inadvertently locking eyes with the monstrosity's glowing orbs. He moans loudly, his voice quaking with fear.*  

**KARL:** *H-herregud…*  

*The wounded Entity seems to glare at the Kraken Hunter, insectile mandibles clicking together in an expression of rage and irritation. As if to punctuate the point, the Creature seizes a research ship still attached to its back with a serrated claw, ripping its harpoons free. As sailors spill from the ruined deck into the boiling ocean, the monstrosity casually tosses the vessel into air, where it tumbles for a few moments before raising a giant cloud of salt spray.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** After all, “no plan survives first contact with the enemy”.   

*As the surviving Research vessels pull away, the Leviathan appears to momentarily lose interest in the terrified, screaming auxiliaries, multiple carmine irises rotating and clicking as they focus on something in the far-off distance. The Captain rolls over and seizes the swinging microphone before screaming into his ship’s radio.*   

**KARL:** Vinland, that *thing* lived through your little light show!  

**VINLAND:** Roger that, [garbled] support is inbound on bearing [garbled].    

*The Captain drags himself off the deck and onto the ship's wheel, then notices the hairs on his forearms standing on end. He glances back to where the Entity has raised itself further out of the water, the surrounding air crackling with electricity as arcane energies gather into its animalistic maw.*   

**KARL:** It’s going to fire! *Hva i helvete-*     

*A jagged energy bolt lances out of the Leviathan’s beak, carving a sizzling channel skyward.The beam penetrates the haze of smoke, dispersing the overcast cloud cover as it punches through the upper atmosphere.*  

EXT. DULLAHAN SQUADRON FORMATION - AERIAL - DAWN    

**CAILLEACH:** [distressed electronic scream]    

**SLEDGE:** Hard evasive! Break! Break!  

*The formation scatters, but two of the F-35Cs are unable to escape the blast. The 5th-generation fighters are struck directly by the sizzling beam, appearing to rapidly disintegrate. This destruction is oddly-systematic, with the planes first being disassembled into their component parts before shattering into increasingly-tiny particles until all traces of them are carried away by the crackling energy stream.*  

**SLEDGE:** Overmind actual, we’ve been fired upon!     

**OVERMIND:** Confirm you've been shot at, over. 

**SLEDGE:** Roger, we’ve lost Dullahan Four and Six! Requesting permission to abort- 

**OVERMIND:** Negative, Dullahan Squadron, Vinland wants you to maintain target fix. 

**SLEDGE:** We’ve already lost the RF track! The bastard jammed us right before the energy levels spiked!  

 **OVERMIND:** Dullahan One, your orders are non-negotiable. Rapid tempo, move to secure VID. Elements of the Scientific Research Fleet are still on site and will assist with eyeballing the target.  

*There are a few moments of awkward silence as the Wing Commander processes his new orders.*   

 **OVERMIND:** Dullahan One, how do you read?  

**SLEDGE:** Loud and clear, Overmind. Dullahan will comply.  

**CAILLEACH:** [troubled code blurt]  

**SLEDGE:** You heard the Big Brains, ‘Cally’. They’re going to need a visual of the Entity.   

*The Wing Commander issues an audible sigh.*  

**SLEDGE:** So we're gonna need a volunteer. Think you can handle it?  

**CAILLEACH:** [determined code blurt]    

**SLEDGE:** I knew I could count on you, Number Two. 

*The Víðópnir waggles its assent and surges away, its fuselage turning see-through as the UAV’s active cloaking system engages.*  

**SLEDGE:** Dullahan Three, Dullahan Five, on me. I want ducks in the air by the time ‘Cally’ reaches the A-O.  

EXT. SVEND FOYN - DECK - DAWN  

*The ‘Scientific’ Fleet is in utter disarray. Several vessels have turned tail, fleeing in multiple directions as the Creature rampages through the remaining ships. The Svend Foyn lurches as the Leviathan drags its bulk over a cresting wave, deckhands spilling over its side as it slams into the swells.*  

**KARL:** Our position is compromised! Where the *føkk* are you!?!  

**VINLAND:** We are preparing an indirect fire response, standby.    

*The Leviathan pauses the disassembly of a ‘Research’ vessel between its claws, looking skyward in the vague direction of Dullahan Squadron’s approach. Unlike before, however, no energy beam manifests. Instead, the monstrosity’s exterior shimmers, initially turning translucent, then transparent. Wherever the Entity has been wounded, the illusion of invisibility appears flawed, like hairline cracks spider-webbing through broken crystal.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** It remains a carefully-guarded secret that the UNSC’s cloaking technology relies heavily on [garbled], which in turn has been reverse-engineered from [garbled].   

**KARL:** Something’s changed, Vinland! The *Jævel* just went invisible!  

INT. SLEDGE’S COCKPIT - AERIAL - DAWN  

*The Wing Commander can be seen visibly sweating inside his soft exosuit, his hands dancing over the tactile displays that fill his glass-free cockpit. A myriad of moving symbols flit across the augmented reality displays as he organizes his remote forces. The soundscape is thick with radio chatter and crackling static.*  

**SLEDGE:** Target has faded, Dullahan Two has lost visual EO track. 

**OVERMIND:** Can you re-establish?  

**SLEDGE:** Negative, negative. Hostile appears to be using active camo. Can’t get a fix on multiple spectra.  

**OVERMIND:** Copy that. Eyeballs have already confirmed use of [garbled]. Dullahan Two is ordered to manually lase the target's last known location.  

**CAILLEACH:** [affirmative code blurt]  

**OVERMIND:** Thanks for playing, Two. 

EXT. HMS WILLIAM OF ORANGE - DECK - DAWN  

*All across the deck of the Stadtholder-class Heavy Cruiser, massive hexagonal lids hinge open, their gaping maws exposing a forest of vertically-oriented electromagnetic weapons. As men and Morlocks urgently perform last-minute preparations, a holographic projection of Rear-Admiral Pederson manifests in their midst.*   

CHYRON: “Sofia Pedersen, STOICS Allied Maritime Command Rear-Admiral and UNSCCVBG 1 Tactical Air Defense Commander”  

**SOFIA:** Make ready the cannon, Mister Smith.  

*The towering leader of the Press Gangers takes a few precious moments to flex his enormous muscles at Pederson’s representation.*   

CHYRON: “Hercules Smith, Esq., Chief Gunnery Officer”  

**HERCULES:** [affirmative grunt]
 
**SOFIA:** Very good, Mister Smith. You may fire when ready.  

*The Morlock officer strikes a final, prominent pose, and the hypervelocity coilguns erupt like a calliope, belching projectiles streaming superheated plasma into the clear sky. Off in the distance, additional electromagnetic rounds can be seen launched by the deck guns of the flotilla’s escort vessels, augmenting the naval bombardment initiated by the William of Orange. Hercules continues to hold his bodybuilder stance, veins visibly popping as he basks in the glow of the colossal barrage.*    

**HERCULES:** [triumphant grunt]  


EXT. SVEND FOYN - DECK - DAWN  

*The semi-transparent Creature towers over the ‘Scientific Research’ Vessel, emitting a series of ominous clicks. The fractured imperfections on the Leviathan’s carapace cast prismatic, scintillating hues across the debris-strewn deck. The Captain has abandoned the wheelhouse of his ship and has since joined the surviving crew as they launch volleys of explosive harpoons into the beast. He takes a moment to unholster his sidearm, pointing the revolver at the shimmering Beast.*  

**KARL:** Back to hell with you!  If I'm going to die, I'm taking you with me!  

*The Captain fires, and suddenly the Entity is wreathed in fire. A staccato of hypervelocity blows strike the Creature from behind, knocking it off balance. The Beast’s active camouflage wavers, flickering as the Leviathan’s outline visibly staggers under the continued barrage. As the hail of projectiles continues, huge plates of what appear to be some sort of organic armor slip from the Monster’s backside and crash into the sea, exposing a lattice of crystalline sapphire veins that leak blue fluid. Where the alien blood makes contact with the water, it hisses angrily, bubbling and frothing.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** Unlike traditional naval guns, the UNSC's maritime electromagnetic artillery is precise to a fault, propelling shock-hardened munitions over incredible distances with pinpoint precision. These guided hypervelocity rounds are therefore well-suited for long range fire support against enemy armor, delivering massive amounts of kinetic energy against their selected targets.  

*The battered Creature screams again, generating another visible shockwave that flicks off the remaining harpoons and knocks the surviving Research Vessels askew. Still under constant bombardment, the Leviathan lurches forwards, gathering momentum as it tears through the surf.*    

**KARL:** The Bastard's on the move! It's trying to escape!  

INT. HMS VINLAND - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - GENERAL QUARTERS    

*King George VII is leaning forward in his command Throne, his eyes closely following the augmented holographic pinscreen display on the strategic table. The King turns to the projection of the ship's KAMI.*  

**GEORGE:** He’s wrong.  

**SANDY:** Would His Majesty like to clarify?  

**GEORGE:** The Whaler is wrong. We’ve damaged the Entity enough that escape isn't possible.   

**SANDY:** Intel does confirm we have badly blooded the Beast.  

**GEORGE:** Yes, so it can't dive, not in this state. The water pressure alone would finish it off. So this isn't an attempt to escape… it's something else. Pull everyone back, but order O'Malley to screen the formation with a lone Junker.  

 
**SANDY:** I'll inform the good URIENS that we'll want the HMS *Mads* as a sacrificial picket. In the interim, shall I also ask that Rear-Admiral Pederson make ready?  

*The King grins, his grip on the Throne’s armrests tightening.*  

**GEORGE:** An excellent precaution, Sir Sandy. Also, I think it's about time we primed ‘the Donation’.  

**SANDY:** As you wish.  


INT. SLEDGE’S COCKPIT - AERIAL - DAWN   

*The augmented reality panels that simulate the Winter Tempest's canopy are layered with smaller tactical displays. The most prominent of these features a zoomed-in live feed of the Creature's still-steaming backside as it charges through the ocean swells. Another includes Dullahan Squadron symbology, with two F-35 icons grayed out and marked ‘KIA' in bold, crimson letters. A third indicates the relative positions of Sledge’s formation, the Vinland CVBG, and the wounded Entity.*  

**SLEDGE:** Overmind actual, target is on the move. High likelihood inbound on the Vinland, Danger: Extreme. Please advise.  

**OVERMIND:** Copy, Dullahan One. Shift to discrete reconnaissance.   

**SLEDGE:** With all due respect, that *thing* is picking up speed-   

**OVERMIND:** Continue monitoring but do not engage.   

**SLEDGE:** Roger. Pulling back to the radar horizon.   
**CAILLEACH:** [confused code blurt]  

*Sledge makes a few motion gestures over one of the tactical displays. The view zooms into a lone vessel speeding ahead of the rest of the flotilla, the holographic label ‘HMS Mads’ blinking above it. The Junker-class Patrol boat surges ahead at flank speed, putting it on a collision course with the Entity.*   

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** The grim reality of modern naval combat dictates that an attempt to protect every vessel in a given formation is done at the expense of the mission's success. If overwhelming superiority cannot be guaranteed, then losses are inevitable. It is no wonder that such a punishing environment has given birth to a tactic affectionately known as [‘the missile sponge’](https://breakingdefense.com/2017/08/lcs-lives-they-still-count-in-age-of-frigates/).  

**SLEDGE:** Looks like they're pushing a Junker ahead of the pack.   

**CAILLEACH:** [discerning code blurt]  

*Fire belches from the launchers on the unmanned surface vessel's deck, a quartet of tube-launched missiles streaking into the sky as the vessel surges onwards.*  

**SLEDGE:** THUNDERground volley away. Great call, Number Two.   

*The tactical ballistic missiles slam into the Entity’s backside, generating a muffled underwater scream that sends an expanding ring of dark water racing away from the Creature. The angered Beast lists, turning to face its attacker.*  

**SLEDGE:** Overmind, reading good hits from the scuds. It’s taken the bait. 

**OVERMIND:** Copy that, Dullahan, Marulvs report YEETing pigs. All forces stand clear.  

*The Leviathan erupts from the ocean surface, seizing the Junker-class USV in its pincers. As the Creature lifts the patrol boat out of the steaming surf, the view on the tactical display rapidly zooms out, refocusing instead on a large formation of massive glide bombs barreling towards the Entity. The perspective then switches to the underwing camera of one of the munitions, ‘FARMOR’ stencilled onto the weapon’s fuselage. As the weapon and its companion close, the bulk of the Beast begins to fill the screen.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** And to crack open the most stubborn of targets, STOICS maintains a healthy, world-class inventory of advanced bunker-buster munitions.   

 *The feed cuts at the moment of impact, initially replaced by static and the message ‘SIGNAL LOST’ in glaring red letters. The display autocycles between several viewpoints, the perspective eventually shifting back to the telescopic view provided by the Winter Tempest’s electro-optical suite. From the fighter’s long-range vantage point, enormous gaping wounds can be seen scattered throughout the Entity’s carapace, exposing a network of pulsing crystalline innards that drip steaming blue ichor. The Creature cranks open its maw, blue lifeblood gushing from the open cavity. There is a low rumbling growl, and the area around the Beast sizzles with electricity as the Leviathan prepares to loose another energy bolt.*    

**SLEDGE:** Overmind, target remains active. Inform Marulv flight it’s readying another shot. Extreme caution.   

 **OVERMIND:** Marulvs have blown through and are already breaking away-   

*The gathering fog of St. Elmo’s fire coalesces into a cohesive beam, but unlike the Creature’s previous strike, the energy lance skims the water’s surface, carving a shallow channel as it arcs towards the surface flotilla.*  

**CAILLEACH:** [horrified digital screech]  

 **SLEDGE:** It’s targeting the Vinland! Danger close!   

INT. HMS WILLIAM OF ORANGE - BRIDGE - DAWN  

*The HMS William of Orange can be seen visibly listing as the vessel executes a hard turn to port. Unsecured and loose equipment clatters off desks and tabletops, rolling along the inclined deck as the Heavy Cruiser tilts several degrees. Rear-Admiral Sofia Pederson is cocooned within her Captain’s chair, leaning into the turn. She glances at the ship’s KAMI, who appears wholly unaffected by the sloping bridge.*   

**SOFIA:** Not if we can help it! On my mark, Lieutenant-admiral general!   

*The Dutch Golden Age sailor raises his gilded cane, his lips pressed into a firm line. He barks a response.*   

CHYRON: “Michiel de Ruyter, HMS William of Orange Key Administrative Management Intelligence, Sapient A.I. Simulacra”   

**MICHIEL:** Maneuvers complete! All barriers ready!  

**SOFIA:** Mark!  

*The KAMI slams his cane into the deck, and a holographic pulse seems to radiate outwards from the point of contact. From the bridge windows, the effect can be seen continuing beyond the ship itself, filling the space in front of the vessel with what appear to be multiple overlapping walls of light. The layered energy barriers shimmer as the surrounding air superheats into a tangible plasma.*  

**MICHIEL:** All hands, brace for impact.  

*The encroaching energy beam violently intersects with the plasma barriers erected by the William of Orange, generating a catastrophic discharge that blankets the entire ship in light.*  

INT. SLEDGE’S COCKPIT - AERIAL - DAWN   

*The Winter Tempest's cockpit panels automatically dim, eliminating the worst of the blinding brilliance produced by the collision of the competing energies. Behind his helmet's visor, the Wing Commander squints, rapidly gesturing across his tactile screens.*  

**SLEDGE:** Dullahan One requesting status update.       

*The glare dies away, and the various tactical displays wink back online in sequence. The icons representing the various vessels of the Vinland's flotilla are all layered with question marks. We hear the hiss of static filling Sledge's cockpit giving way to friendly radio chatter from the various surviving pilots reporting in.*  

**CAILLEACH:** [positive code blurt]  

**OVERMIND:** Dullahan One, glad to hear from you. Updating your tactical picture now. 

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** Unsatisfied with simply maintaining the traditional missile-based defensive paradigm utilized by many of the world's navies, STOICS engineers have labored feverishly to incorporate Western Russian-sourced hard light technologies into the carrier battlegroup's defensive schema.   

*The various ship icons skip as their positions are updated, question marks disappearing one by one as information is streamed from the Electrowarden. Sledge nods approvingly.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** On this occasion, such foresight has paid healthy dividends. 

**SLEDGE:** Appreciated.   

**OVERMIND:** Dullahan is ordered to perform a flyby of the Vinland. Put eyeballs on the fleet.   

**SLEDGE:** Standby for visual.  

*The camera pulls back, seamlessly translating through the digital panelling as the view exits the Winter Tempest’s cockpit. The air superiority fighter is quickly joined by the Víðópnir and the pair of surviving F-35s, the camera sweeping around to follow the four-plane formation as it banks towards the ocean.*

**SLEDGE:** Uh… do be advised, Overmind. She’s on the move again.   

*The planes soar high over the wounded Creature, which has resumed its warpath towards the flotilla. Leaking steaming gore from multiple crystalline orifices, the Entity looks worse for wear, the ocean churning around it and raising streaming clouds of steam. The forward elements of the Vinland flotilla are within visual range now, opening up with various electromagnetic and electrothermal-chemical guns, deck-launched anti-ship missiles, and dual purpose SAMs. Smoke and fire stream off the sides of the Beast, spattering the sea with gore. These violent impacts do not appear to slow the Leviathan, which continues to charge towards the center of the formation.*  

**CAILLEACH:** [anxious code blurt]  

**SLEDGE:** She's making a run for the carrier!  

INT. HMS VINLAND - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - GENERAL QUARTERS   

*The real-time view of the outside world projected onto the CIC's wraparound screens is dominated by the massive bulk of the wounded Entity as it closes on the Hypercarrier. The energy of the war room is frantic, panicked adjustants rushing to secure themselves to their seats. As the Leviathan bears down on the Vinland, the King remains seated on his Throne, his expression strangely calm. A single bead of sweat forms on his brow.*  

**GEORGE:** Steady as she goes.  

*The Vinland's KAMI nods, his expression solemn as he retrieves his pipe. The Beast now fills the majority of the forward-facing digital viewport.*  

**SANDY:** Steady as steady does, Your Highness.  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** But where standard tactics may fail to fulfill Allied Maritime Command’s desired strategic outcomes…  

*Ignoring the many escorts’ futile attempts to distract it from its chosen prey, the Entity raises itself out of the water, faceted biomechanical eyes cycling as it sizes up its target. The Leviathan clicks its mandibles against its beak, preparing to bring a serrated claw crashing down.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** … its constituent Navies are not above using asymmetric means to achieve total sea control.  

*Before the blow can land, a massive ship collides with the Leviathan. The colossal Hibernia-class vessel rams into the wounded Entity with titanic force, pile-driving it off course. The unstoppable bulk, significantly longer than the Vinland, surges past the Hypercarrier, its sky-blue livery proudly declaring 'MAERSK LINE’ in bold capital letters. The King grins, baring his teeth as the immense convoy leader continues to force the Creature further away with the sheer power of its nuclear Rolls-Royce engines.*   

**GEORGE:** Fire for effect!     

*As the pinned Leviathan rages, the cargo vessel's deck-mounted containers hinge open, exposing massive cylinders concealed within. The canisters elevate, hatches spilling open to expose thousands of multi-packed missiles.*  

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** After all, one of the most enduring naval truisms exchanged by STOICS mariners remains *“Steer clear of UNSC merchantmen, lest they decide to liven up their day by ramming you.”*  

*The tubes discharge their contents in waves of flames and smoke. Some of the weapons strike the Beast head on at near-point blank ranges; others are catapulted skyward, drawing lazy arcs in the morning sky before plunging into the Creature's backside. The kinetic energy munitions riddle the Leviathan from all directions, transforming its carapace into a perforated pincushion.*  

**GEORGE:** The Merchant Marine are impeccably-timed, as always. Have Buckingham Palace send my commendations to the Consortium, along with a dozen blue roses.  

**SANDY:** At once, Your Highness.  

*The camera pulls through the CIC's display panels, transitioning to an exterior visual of the scene captured by a UAS camera. From this viewpoint, the Entity can be seen shuddering, alien blood splashing onto the freighter’s deck as it collapses with a heavy thud. The Creature twitches in place several times as it dies, the cratered bulk spasming and raising steam around its final resting place. Various rotary-wing aircraft approach the cargo ship, Marines rappelling from their bellies to secure the deck and the Leviathan entombed there.*   

**NARRATOR (ISMAIL):** And no matter its origin, no force on Heaven or Earth can deny the fundamental maxim of Newton's Third Law.   

FADE TO BLACK   


  

 ----  

  
Bjorn Persson stood at the base of the mountainous carcass, his blackened Cerecloth Shroud flapping gently in the ocean breeze.   

The deck of the MV *Maersk Clementine* was thick with STOICS soldiery, navy blue uniforms of the BFF's royal marine detachments clashing with the bone-white exoarmor of Cadaver Corps *Luftlandsättning Amfibiebrigad* detachments. The Chaplain was unmoved by the various activities of the security teams swarming atop the nuclear convoy leader, staring intently at the gaping holes perforating the massive biomechanical hulk. The flow of alien blood had been reduced to a trickle, crystallizing into an angry crust around the Creature’s many wounds.   

“Too much excitement this early in the morning,” a voice behind the Soldier-Priest yawned.  

Bjorn never took his steely-grey eyes off the Beast. “I wondered when you'd finally lug your gear over here, Ismail,” he murmured.   

Ismail Komodromos rubbed his weary eyes and grinned. “Needed to wait for coffee before I popped on over. The *Vinland’s* galley had to make a fresh pot, after all.”   

The *Soldatpräst* simply nodded, his gaze unwavering. The correspondent blinked, then glanced towards where this companion was staring. He froze.  

“Is that what I think it is?” the Cypriot whispered, raising his camera to his face.  

Bjorn didn't reply.   

For deep within the bowels of the carcass, obscured by layers of deep blue crystal, there was a human face.

1id0zwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ossiarchbonereapers/comments/1id0zwk/battle_report_firstever_21_at_an_rtt_with_obr/,[Battle Report] First-ever 2-1 at an RTT with OBR (January 2025),"Hi all,

As promised in [**my question thread last week**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ossiarchbonereapers/comments/1i7g2s2/what_do_you_think_are_obrs_bestworst_matchups/), I'm back with a batrep from the event! This was a 28-player RTT put together by an excellent local TO group. It's my second time going to one of their events, and I'll definitely be back for more.

Quick background: I've been into Warhammer since 2017 or so. First 40K, then AOS. Not the heaviest competitor. I've most often played doubles 40K, but I'm trying to get more into AOS with 4th Edition, because the ruleset is a blast and the local community are absolute gems.

This was my first solo RTT of AOS 4th Edition. Prior to beginning testing for this event, I'd played less than ten games of AOS 4E total, about half of which were doubles.

>**THE LIST**

Without further ado:

    CEREBRAL APPROACH
    2000/2000 pts
    Ossiarch Bonereapers | Mortek Ballistari
    Drops: 3
    Spell Lore - Lore of Ossian Sorcery
    Manifestation Lore - Krondspine Incarnate
    
    General's Regiment 
    Katakros, Mortarch of the Necropolis (520) 
     - [General]
    Mortek Crawler (260)
    Mortek Crawler (260)
    
    Regiment 1
    Mortisan Ossifector (110)
    Morghast Archai (270)
    Morghast Archai (270)
    Teratic Cohort (150)
    
    Regiment 2
    Mortisan Soulmason (160)
     - Mighty Archaeossian 
     - Lode of Saturation

Most of this tracks with current meta choices. You've got Katakros, Archai, Crawlers, and a Teratic Cohort for some delicious secondary scoring.

Noteworthy differences include ***A.)*** lack of cavalry, ***B.)*** high number of drops, ***C.)*** what the hell my Soulmason, and ***D.)*** Krondspine over our faction manifestations.

Regarding lack of cavalry -- ahead of the event, I was already looking to test Katakros + Necropolis Stalkers, because I really miss mixing it up with our big, scary, four-faced friends. Plus, the recent points changes for KDR were real. So instead of cavalry, what if I just yeet Katakros + Stalkers at them?

Only part of this plan ended up working out, as we'll see.

After testing, it was clear that Stalkers still couldn't carry their weight. Following an extremely helpful post-game chat with my opponent *(thanks friend!)*, I doubled down on Mortek Ballistari instead. Out came the Stalkers. In went a second Mortek Crawler and Ossifector. The Archai split into units of 2x2 rather than 1x4 *(another helpful tip from my testing opponent)*. And a Mortisan Soulmason rounded out the points beautifully for an even 2,000. Lastly, the Bone-tithe Nexus came out, because a 50/50 chance of inflicting some minor annoyance wasn't worth letting people slingshot around my backfield with it like the Mortal Realms' most macabre merry-go-round.

The high number of drops was intended to take advantage of the winter 2024 updates to Honour Guard. With the Crawlers in Katakros' regiment as an attempt to minimize opposing Honour Guard bonuses, having more drops potentially lets me put one of those tasty Anti-\[X\] (+1 Rend) buffs on a unit of Archai in a second regiment. This would really save my ass in Game 3, but I still wonder if it would have been better to just have the Archai in Katakros' regiment and call it a day.

Why so much defensive stuff on the Soulmason? So that if/when my backfield collapsed, he could high-five whatever I needed him to without dying instantly. Wise? No. Efficient? No. Hilarious? We'll find out!

Finally, the Krondspine was chosen to be a massive Distraction Carnifex in the midfield. Without ranks of Mortek Guard to screen my Crawlers, I felt like my next-best choice was to plonk down Free Angry Dragon Skeleton in annoying positions. And then do it over and over and over again, as often as I could.

*(Look, I play Custodes in 40K. I'm* constantly starving *for board presence. You can't give me a free base the size of a salad dish and tell me not to use it!)*

On with the show!

>***GAME 1***  
***JAWS OF GALLET***  
***OPPONENT: BEASTS OF CHAOS***

In the finest of Warhammer traditions, I got up at 3 AM to try and finish painting the morning of the event. This proved to be unwise, because I was still somewhat scattered six hours later when it was time to roll dice and know things. I was just not the kind of opponent I like to be in terms of being On Top Of It™.

I apologized profusely at the time, but I still feel bad about this. Luckily, my opponent was extremely gracious and really helped me shake off the cobwebs. Hats off to him.

T1 and T2. We start things off cagey, with my Death Star hiding at the crux of my L-shaped territory, and a couple of big blocks of friendly minotaur men having some pleasant conversation in the trees way over there.

As they approach -- no doubt looking to pay several years of back-taxes, perhaps with their backbones -- I Redeploy Katakros aggressively towards them and send my Archai out across the field to try and take the more distant objectives. The Krondspine is MIA. The Soulmason takes the midfield objective, hoping to drop the Krondspine in a good spot on a future turn. The Crawlers hang back, hoping to whittle down the BoC with some shooting and Strike-lasts, with absolutely nothing to screen them except a nerdy Ossifector calculating various 90kg/300m trajectories.

""Relentless Discipline""? Never heard of 'em. Are they on Spotify?

My opponent smartly allows me to overextend Turns 1 and 2, then capitalizes Turn 3 with a number of skillful, well-executed ambushes and flanking maneuvers. I was functionally off the table by the end of T3, down to just my Teratic Cohort.

Let me tell you -- Beasts of Chaos might be on their way out, but their path to Legends went right through my precious internal organs, and I appreciate what they taught me along the way. I'm glad I got to go up against them before they left for the Old World.

The end result of my methodless madness was a scoresheet that is far more flattering to me than I deserve. Again, full credit to my opponent for not only taking the opportunity I presented with speed and skill, but also being patient, gracious, and a pleasure to play against the whole time. Final result 24-48 and several well-earned lessons.

>***GAME 2***  
***SHIFTING OBJECTIVES***  
***OPPONENT: IRONJAWZ (with a Mega-Gargant friend)***

Thankfully, ""don't yeet Katakros"" was not one of those lessons.

T1. I'm going first, choosing Seize the Centre for my battle tactic. Off the top, Relentless Discipline, +2 Move. Command point to auto-run Katakros. Backed up by several large angels of Death (not the 40K kind), he marches 12 intimidating inches straight into the midfield.

The neat thing about running Katakros up the middle like an idiot is that his 18"" Relentless Discipline bubble now covers an extremely large chunk of the board. Counting his base, it's almost 40 inches total in diameter. Makes it real easy to drop 5+++ Ward saves on anything that needs it. Or to hit himself and both Archai units with his Save buffs in the Hero phase, pushing them down to a 2+. Or both. In fact, it ended up being both, several times. The osseous legions of the Mortarch of the Necropolis are here, and they put on the *dummy-thicc* bones today.

The Krondspine doesn't clock in T1, but the Crawlers do. All that work from the Ossifector last game pays off as ~~90kg~~ <1g payloads of screaming skull-shaped tax rebates fly ~~300m~~ 24 inches across the table, slamming into the Ironjawz ranks.

My opponent is a very chill gentleman I've chatted with several times at our local game store. His Ironjawz, appropriately for Ironjawz, are much less chill. Incensed, they march forward, claiming the T1 primary objective to my right and turning the midfield into a mighty melee -- exactly where the mission wants us to be. God, I'm loving AOS.

T2 features a lot of Reality off the hop. My opponent takes the double and goes first now. Primary remains on objective 1, which he still controls. The Mega-Gargant stomps into my backfield and makes himself a problem. The Ironjawz hordes clash with various Archai and Kronds-spine and Katakroseseses in the midfield, with nobody gaining much purchase. Off to my left, the Mortek Crawlers remain largely unmolested, with the Ossifector basically coffee-badging in the forest between them. Good for him. Remote work is the future.

I decided it was time for even more stupid decisions. Because, honestly -- what are we doing if we're not going for it?

The Soulmason marches towards the Mega-Gargant because he heard about this dude named David and figures he can do better. *(Also, I'm worried that the Mega-Gargant is going to chew through my Archai, so I want to high-five him with a nerd and bog him down for a bit.)* Meanwhile, Katakros is duking it out with even more Ironjawz infantry and the Crawlers end up gawping across the field at a pair of Ironjawz heroes like they're celebrities in Central Park just trying to walk their dogs.

T3. The Thrilla In Ma'-Ulna continues. I'm pulling ahead on scoring, but the same thing happened last game, and I'm not going to take things for granted -- unlike my Teratic Cohort, which I completely forget to bring in, inadvertently consigning many precious former pets to the dustbins of Shyish. Ghat dammit.

The Ironjawz hack away, but luckily those 2+/5+++ dummy-thicc bones I'm packing are the thickest and dummiest they've ever been. The Mega-Gargant stomps and throws tantrums like he wants to Debate Me about something, but my Archai have him pinned away from the objective for now. Meanwhile, celebrity time is over and my Crawlers finally pick off those open heroes in the shooting phase. No more influencing for them. Maybe they'll post about it on TeefTok. I heard Sigmar just unbanned it again. Check your local app-othecary today.

In the middle of all of this, my Soulmason finally reaches the Mega-Gargant and says hello.

I would later learn that my gentlemanly opponent was in fact borrowing the Mega-Gargant from another friend for the day. He'd studied up on the relevant warscroll, of course, but he honestly never thought he'd get to use the rule where a Mega-Gargant in combat can roll 3D6 and potentially just PICK THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN A BAG TO EAT LATER.

Who wins: a Mortisan of the highest order, master hierophant of the arts arcane, a true scion of beautiful sterile Necrotopia -- or one (1) baggy boi?

3D6 hit the table. My poor brave Soulmason goes into the bag, destined to become bone-marrow soup for the children of Behemat. My opponent, still behind on scoring, nevertheless gets a victory that I cannot possibly *(nor would ever)* take away.

The rest of the game proceeds according to the momentum on the scoresheet, if not our hearts. I'm able to pin the Mega-Gargant with a Mortek Crawler *(too big to put in a bag!)*. Eventually, I pick him up thanks to some stacked damage from the Archai. Meanwhile, Katakros is putting his wealth of attacks to good use and slowly mopping up Ironjawz infantry. He ends up marching all the way over to the rightmost objective, perhaps the furthest he's ever gone in a single game for me. Final score 40-10 for me *(though my opponent gets the full 50 in my heart)*.

>***GAME 3***  
***BORDER WAR***  
***OPPONENT: SONS OF BEHEMAT***

Holy shit. Look at those things. It took everything I had to deal with ONE Mega-Gargant. Now I have to fight FOUR?

Everybody except the Teratic Cohort gets deployed in a tight bubble around Katakros. We're staying close, in case they go first and have more tricks like the bag thing. On the other side of the table, the giants pair off into King Brodd + Balaclava Boy and Two Other Friends, all lumbering around in the distance like mountains against the setting sun.

T1. I'm going first. And in a fearsome fit of fecklessness, my battle tactic of choice is... Marked for Death, which I've literally never scored before, and am now choosing to use against the thickest models in the room. Because that's smart.

Here's where I'm at -- in the last game, once I started really laying into my opponent's Mega-Gargant with the Archai, they were able to rack up the damage pretty quick. If I can stack all those famous OBR buffs into one hell of an alpha strike, I might actually be able to rack up 35 damage in one turn and pick up one of the smaller ones. And it lets me save the easy tactics for later in the game if I need to.

Here we go.

The Archai have Anti-MONSTER (+1 Rend) baked in. Plus, I've already given them another instance of Anti-MONSTER (+1 Rend) on charge turns with the Honour Guard ability. The Ossifector buffs the Archai unit in the lead with his warscroll ability, giving them yet another point of Rend. I whiff on Empower Nadirite Weapons *(IIRC)*, but that's okay.

All told, if I can get stuck in and drop All-out Attack, the lead Archai unit will be swinging in with 6 attacks, hitting on 2s, wounding on 2s, Rend 5 (!!), Damage 3, 6s explode.

Relentless Discipline. +2 Move. Halfway there. Relentless Discipline. +1 to Charge rolls. We get stuck in. Relentless Discipline. +1 to Wound rolls *(which is only relevant for Katakros, but hey)*. The mountains are very close now.

The Mega-Gargant I've targeted immediately picks up Katakros and slams him back down on the other side of the combat, on their home objective. Savage. Brutal. But not yet rekt -- Katakros only just brackets. We're okay. We're okay. The Archai are untouched.

It takes every single roll from all four Morghast Archai and Katakros himself, but the first Son falls to the wrestling Behe-mat, takes a 3-count, and we've scored our first Battle Tactic.

Bottom T1. My opponent, a very chill TO whose events I try to attend as often as I can, marches all three Largest Friends across the table. King Brodd + Balaclava Boy go towards the closest NML objective -- and, not coincidentally, what remains of my original death-star. My Soulmason cowers in the shadow of a house nearby, fearing another trip to The Bag. Luckily, the Krondspine is convinced to make an appearance at this particular soirée, which I hope will give my extremely large and incredibly close new friends something to think about.

Turns 2 and 3 are the Brawl to End It All. The Morghast Archai fly back south to try and collect some truly gigantic bones. Katakros secures the enemy home objective and follows. The Teratic Cohort saunter into the backfield for some much-needed secondary scoring. The Mortek Crawlers, their shooting somewhat neutered against these thickest of targets except for inflicting Strike-last, try to move-block and mostly get Hulk-slammed for their troubles. The Krondspine is a deeply savage annoyance, as intended.

*(My opponent would later tell me in the postgame that he made a key mistake in these turns, allowing his Mega-Gargants to leave their bubble of 6+++ Ward rolls one by one while I was still in a position to capitalize with the Archai and Katakros. I think his priorities were on point given the situation presented, but will defer to him.)*

The scoring remains close. I have an idea about what to do next, and carefully pull back my Teratic Cohort a turn earlier than my opponent expects.

Turn 4. Showdown in the midfield. Crawlers down. Wizards down. Everyone else is balled up behind Katakros as he stares down King Brodd -- except the Teratic Cohort, who are already backing away slowly, hands in front of them.

If this were an MCU movie, it would be the last thirty minutes of Infinity War. You would watch Katakros, two wounds remaining, march up to King Brodd, challenge him to a duel, and die for his troubles. Meanwhile, the Morghast Archai and Teratic Cohort scatter to the four winds, to regroup next movie. The heroes lose. Roll credits.

Luckily this is AOS, and battle tactics exist.

For my T4 tactic, I choose the Death-exclusive Inevitable Demise. Most armies have more than four models, so this almost never works. But here, it gets its moment in the setting sun. As Katakros finally falls to King Brodd, a single Morghast retreats just far enough to be outside 9"", while my Teratic Cohort bolts for the closest short edge. On the other side of the combat, my other Archai unit retreats to a NML objective nearby, allowing me to pull ahead on scoring even while I'm running like a damn coward.

Brodd howls in frustration. His player doesn't, that would be weird. But Brodd does.

T5. Seize the Flanks. What flanks, you ask, when a King stands alone on the battlefield? A question for historians.

The Teratic Cohort reaches one short edge. A pair of Morghast Archai reach the other. Heavy is the head that wears the crown in the middle.

Final score 44-30, 8th out of 28 players, and my first-ever 2-1 finish at a non-doubles RTT. Thanks again to my opponent for a truly excellent game!

>***FINAL THOUGHTS***

First off, get some proper sleep and eat some proper food. I painted through the lunch hour and ended up pulling all that off on Mars bars, beer, and hope -- then promptly spent the next 36 hours in the fetal position recovering. Learn from my mistake. Preserve your bones for the Necrotopia by properly resting and fueling their protective meat-mech.

Also, thanks again to everyone in my question thread last week. While I didn't end up facing LRL or Slaves, hearing what was good about them helped me quite a bit with my strategies on the day *(in Games 2-3, at least!)*.

Outside of that, here's what I'm thinking. If you've skipped ahead from the list and just want the TL;DR, this is your stop.

The list as a whole did quite well. The four Morghast and Katakros were the MVPs, the Crawlers were as fierce as advertised, and the Teratic Cohort are extremely worth it.

Using the Krondspine as a midfield screen worked quite well for this particular list, but in lists with proper screening units, OBR manifestations are probably still better. Especially the one that gives -1 to Ward saves, which are more prevalent than I remember.

I used my wizards like an idiot. High-fiving people does not seem to be as valuable in AOS as I think it is -- the only time it worked was when I used Mortek Crawlers to pin instead. I'll probably keep the Ossifector because he plays nicely with the Crawlers, and rethink what I'm doing with the Soulmason. It's not like I need a ton of casts when I'm running the Krondspine anyway.

I also need to rethink my regiments. The +1 Rend bonus on the Archai was tasty, but I have no idea what I actually denied my opponents by making the Crawlers his honour guard. It might be better just to bump them up to Katakros' regiment instead.

*Dessert place* (almost 8 months), had to quit bc it wasn’t flexible with starting uni and the place shut down anyways 2 months after I left and the manager was toxic and awful at ever paying me on time and the correct amount. 

*Admin assistant & receptionist* - at a salon and hairdressing/beauty academy started off full time then slowly to only Saturdays, job requires me to book clients in and out, cancel appointments, sell retail, make marketing content, design and write up manuals/instruction booklets for beauty/hair students, make social media content and promote both salon and academy, do inventory and stock, file invoices, bookkeeping. (This place is literally less than a minute from my house) started in march 2023

*Trainee biomedical scientist* - as part of my degree I took a 1 year placement contract in NHS laboratory being trained to become a BMS after I graduate, completed my IBMS portfolio so I’ll be HCPC registered after I graduate. This was Mon-Fri 9-5 (+2hr commute) and on Saturdays id do the admin job at the salon/academy. In the beginning I told my boss id be leaving the admin job but then times got tough and I had to move out and needed extra money so she kindly put me back in on Saturdays as that’s all I could manage while doing placement. The lab offered me NHS-P so I could do bank shifts but I didn’t take it because it was too far away and I hated a lot of people on my team so they left a sour taste for me in that lab. 

Research Assistant - so in between these jobs sometimes there are short contract summer placements for students to help their professors with research and collecting data and organising studies - I’ve done 3 of these equalling 3 weeks in total in physiology department with stroke patients, microbiology in antibacterial/antimicrobial studies and also respiratory patients in cardio department. I know 1 week in each department is not much but they were paying 13 pound an hour and I’ll take any experience related to my field there’s nothing to lose 🤷🏽‍♀️

*Barista* - owner of the salon/academy opened a neighbouring coffee shop so im working there 3-4 days a week and admin 1 day a week while I do my last and final year of uni. Working there currently I quite like it. Just opened shop and started only 3 weeks ago. (Literally less than a minutes walk away from work) 

I’ve noticed some of my family and friends don’t seem too happy for me about the barista job because they think im ‘meant for more’ but I know plenty of students working shitty jobs and mine could be a lot worse, surely they all know this isn’t what I plan on doing full time for the rest of my life im in university for fucks sake im in STEM !! I want to do way more . But for now while im studying is it SO wrong to be content with a small barista and admin job on the side for now ? I couldn’t even get a full time job in my field if I wanted to because im STILL STUDYING. Jfc someone tell me im not crazy. ",0,1738175792.0,youngadults,8,0.5,False

But unfortunately, my profession of being a filmmaker has been a hindrance in getting a woman through the traditional AM route, be it the apps or through known sources. So I got into dating apps a couple of years ago. I get matches and I meet women often for coffee or walks. And I've seriously dated two of them in the last two years which ended after a few weeks due to certain reasons.
Women have told me I'm a sweet guy and mature guy, and that I'm handsome as well. But I guess it's the nature of the apps that makes everyone go look for other options. I have done that as well when the person I met liked me but I found them incompatible. Sometimes conversations just go and go on the apps cos they aren't from the place I live in... and it eventually fades out or mostly they uninstall the app one day after intimating me. 
I do have a profile on the AM apps as well. I keep going back there cos I just want to find someone and settle down. But I get rejected left, right, centre on these AM apps. 😅

## The Essential Features of a Top-Tier Travel Umbrella

A truly extraordinary portable wind resistant umbrella needs to be more than just a shield against rain; it must be convenient, durable, and reliable. Before we delve into brand-specific features, let's outline the core attributes that define a best compact travel umbrella:

**1. Compact and Lightweight Design:** The hallmark of any effective travel umbrella is its ability to be easily packed and carried. A **small folding umbrella** or **mini travel umbrella** that tucks neatly into a briefcase, backpack, or handbag is a non-negotiable for frequent travelers and those on the go. Look for options that don't add unnecessary bulk or weight to your luggage.

**2. Windproof Construction:** A flimsy umbrella is more frustrating than no umbrella at all, especially on a windy day. A **strong windproof umbrella**, often featuring a **reinforced frame umbrella,** is crucial. These frames are typically constructed from materials like fiberglass or aluminium, offering the necessary adaptability and sturdiness to resist strong gusts of wind without inverting or breaking.

**3. Automatic Open and Close Functionality:** The convenience of a **automatic open close umbrella** cannot be overstated. Imagine stepping off a plane and needing immediate rain protection, or hurrying from one meeting to the next. A **one hand operation umbrella** allows for swift deployment and closure, freeing up your other hand for luggage, coffee, or a phone call.

**4. Durability and Longevity:** A travel umbrella should be an investment that lasts for trips to come. Look for options crafted from high-quality, durable materials like reinforced steel or aircraft grade aluminum along with a robust canopy using quality water-repellent fabrics. A **durable compact umbrella** should be able to withstand the rigors of frequent use and varied weather conditions.

**5. Water Repellency and Quick-Drying Capabilities:** No one wants to pack away a dripping wet umbrella. A canopy made of highly water-repellent fabric, coupled with **quick dry travel umbrella** features, ensures efficient and hassle-free use, even in heavy downpours. This also prevents the umbrella from becoming a damp weight in your bag after use.

**6. UV Protection:** while not always a primary focus,a **UV protection travel umbrella** can offer added benefits,especially in sun-drenched locations. The sun's harmful rays can be particularly intense at higher altitudes or near reflective surfaces like water or snow.

My student loans were applied to my school account about 2 weeks in and were refunded to me a little over a month after the start of the term per my schools policy (the first semester it gets refunded after a month, subsequent semesters it gets refunded faster)  This semester I was given a refund date of 1/30 (tomorrow) but I've been watching my student account and the loans showed up as being disbursed mid last week and I only got an email today saying they were disbursed and applied to my account  and may be refunded by my refund date (tomorrow) but the email also says if the refund date has already passed it'll be 7-10 busines days. I'm a bit concerned as I have some unexpected expenses that this money needs to help with but every time I email or call the financial aid office they act like I'm disrupting their coffee break so I figured i'd ask if it's at all likely that i'll still get the refund tomorrow or if it'll be delayed since they were only just disbursed today and while the refund date is tomorrow it's so close I wasn't sure if it would still process that fast.

There was a bright side, though. I’d be freshly twenty one years old, employed, with a house paid for by the government.

Outside the clinical white room, I heard screams and thudding footsteps. “I don't want to do it!” a boy cried. “Let me go!”

“Okay, Mattie, count down from ten,” my nurse smiled, pulling on white gloves. 

I knew exactly what the cut was, and knew, as soon as I was out, those gloves would be dripping red. It was supposed to be a reset, a way to *cleanse* teenage minds, guaranteeing a perfect adult work force severed of their teenage memories. 

There was a *flash.* 

I blinked once. 

*Twice*. 

*Three  times*, and I was inside a large  office, looking out over New York City. 

I was twenty-one years old. 

My new boss shook my hand. “It’s great to have you,” he gushed. “Matilda, it is an honor!”

Apparently, my cut self had made it to the top, and I had a sparkling new office job.

On my first day, I got a standing ovation. 

Everyone loved me! 

Well, they loved *her*. 

“Be honest,” one of my older colleagues hissed. “How much *do* you remember?”

Something slimy trickled up my throat. Her words were wrong, visceral, sending me stumbling to the bathroom. 

But I didn’t puke. I went to grab coffee, only to slam into Ben, a new colleague. 

Just like me, he had awakened from his “cut” self.

“Hi.” He mumbled through a mouthful of *something*.

“Ben, wait.” Pulling him back, he choked up a single slab of raw chicken. 

The smell was suffocating. 

Ben felt… familiar. My body worked ahead of my brain, grasping his hand. I… knew it. 

I was half aware of my coffee slipping from my fingers.

But I wasn't in the office anymore.

*Surrounded by trees, sky above me, my hands slick with blood, my mouth stretched into a grin.*

*The girl crept through brush, barefoot, a knife strapped to her thigh.* 

*I lunged, hitting water, throwing myself onto her. Cheers thundered. A crowd behind glass screamed my name.*

*Slicing her throat easily, I severed her head, giggling, her blood filling my mouth.*

*“Simpson has done it again!” a voice screamed. “If she beats our King, you have yourself a Queen!”*

*Meat.*

*I stripped her flesh, fashioning her skull into my crown.*

*Meat.*

*Stuffing her entrails into my mouth, I faced the cameras,  choking up pieces of brain.*

*A boy jumped from the trees, and I impaled him straight through the heart.* 

*He dropped to the ground, and I advanced–*

“Matilda?”

I blinked, back in the office. 

“Are you okay?” my boss asked, wide-eyed.

“Yeah.” I'd... cut myself. 

Sticking my bloody finger in my mouth, pleasure exploded in my throat, a feral, otherworldly hunger slamming into me. 

Ben’s eyes were vacant. 

He pulled a stringy piece of chicken from his teeth, dangling it teasingly, his smile growing.

But what about the blended coffees? Are sugar free blended coffees still good? I realize it probably won’t be 100% as a regular non sugar free would be but are they still good?

\-Magnesium Citrate (300mg before bed), Triphala (every other day before bed), NOW Foods Digestive Enzymes with every meal, morning coffee, decent fiber intake (chia seeds, pears, apples)

Symptoms I still struggle with:

I have been curating a personal guide to Kansas City and have decided it's ready for public use.

----

**LINK: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aSN4WIir-Kcse02eVm8-zcDT24NOYXVCh_CxB6MU-so/edit?usp=sharing** 

* Links to a Google Sheets worksheet. There are multiple tabs at the bottom of the sheet with entries related to the tab's name (e.g. Food, Coffee, etc.).

* I highly encourage you to click on ""File"" and ""Make a Copy"" and create a local copy that you can edit/refine for your purposes. There are **Visited?** and **Rating** columns if you wish to use them. They are hidden by default but can be unhidden by clicking the arrow button between columns B and E. The public file will remain a streamlined template. 

* Clicking on a ""smart chip"" in the **Map** column should give you a clickable directions-link to the establishment you've selected.

* The **Notes** column contains additional information, such as a highly recommended dish at the location (based on years of reading this subreddit).

----

## Considerations:

1. This is a Kansas City-focused guide. While I include some notable establishments outside the ""standard metro"", they are rare. I will not expand this document to include Lawrence, Wichita, etc. They have their subreddits and someone else can do that there.

1. It is likely that I have mislabeled the cuisine type of various restaurants. Given how most people decide on what to eat, I aimed for broad categorization rather than granular detail. If you see an egregious error, please feel free to comment next to the appropriate cell and I will correct it if warranted. This is especially true if you're an owner of an establishment and my categorization completely misses the mark for you.

1. Everyone can view and comment on the document. Anyone trolling or abusing their commenting privilege will have their access removed. For now, I am the sole editor. If I encounter helpful commenters who regularly aid me with keeping this list updated, I will also grant them editor permissions.

1. If you see any establishments that have gone out of business, please let me know. I will remove them from the list. I intend to keep this list as current as possible.

1. If you see any erroneous links associated with an establishment, please let me know. I will make the correction if warranted.

1. If you see any incorrect directions, please let me know. I will fix them. Please note that for establishments that have multiple locations, I have prioritized the entry in the sheet as follows: The ""premier"" location > proximity to KCMO proper > other considerations.

1. Please ensure that the comments in the worksheet are for corrections, removals, additions, and fixes. Other comments, such as positive feedback, requests, etc. are best left to this thread or in a direct message to me. Please don't initiate a Reddit Chat with me. I don't use it.

1. If you're a journalist/writer and want to use or link to the guide in your publications, please do! I'd appreciate credit.

1. I would appreciate it if /r/kansascity moderators create a link to this document in the sidebar, and/or pin it, and/or insert it into the recurring weekend thread.

1id0ibh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1id0ibh/second_shot_always_pulls_incredibly_fast_on_e24/,Second shot ALWAYS pulls incredibly fast on e24.,"This has now happened every single time. I honed in on the perfect recipe for my coffee... grind size 9, 18g, 2:1 ratio in 28 seconds.

My first shot of the day always pulls perfectly in 28 seconds, not sour, not bitter, lots of flavor, perfect everything.

I then wait 5 (sometimes 10-15 minutes) meticulously recreating every step (I don't do milk until after both shots), and the second shot comes out in 15 seconds! It has now happened like 10 times I know I am not messing anything up...


My process in detail:

1. Add water to machine
2. Turn it on and purge for 5 seconds or so
3. Dry the head
4. Attach portafilter
5. Wait 15ish minutes
6. Clean inside of grinder and Purge my grinder with a few beans
7. grind 18g of coffee
8. remove porta+basket, dry everything meticulously
8. put grinds on basket, wdt evenly with a cheap tool i have, tamp with even and careful pressure
9. load puck on to coffee machine, attach scale and cup, let er rip
10. smooth, controlled coffee comes out, hits agout 36g of liquid in 28s
11. tastes nice and balanced
12. remove and clean basket/portafilter
13. purge machine by letting water run 5 secs or so
14. dry everything, attach portafilter, wait 10ish minutes
15. Clean inside of grinder and Purge my grinder with a few beans
16. grind 18g of coffee
17. remove porta+basket, dry everything meticulously
18. put grinds on basket, wdt evenly with a cheap tool i have, tamp with even and careful pressure
19. load puck on to coffee machine, attach scale and cup, let er rip
20. Coffee takes a few seconds to come out, then comes out super fast, hit about 36g of liquid in 15s
21. tastes sour and depressing
22. do the milk (which i also suck at)

The first was turned off before Dave found himself in another dream, this time at a buffet, piling his plate full. He was on the way to his first bite before discovering himself, once again, in bed, squinting and fumbling with a noisy screen.

Who remembers how to turn these things off?

He swipes, and swipes again, and it just keeps going. He taps. The screen falls to his face. Sitting up now, still struggling, then finally, silence. Monday morning apparently. 6:18.

Whatever was on that plate at the buffet a moment ago will never be seen again. He wonders to himself if he should quit. 6:20.

Alright, fine.

He sits up and over on the edge of his bed, wiping at his eyes before stretching. Then bathroom duties. Closet duties. Kitchen,  breakfast, coffee, now the train. 

Are all these people going through the same symphony of Monday Morning Misery? Well, perhaps. Their faces don't show it if so. Someone smiles at a screen. Another, bewildered, before nodding to agree with theirs.

On Dave's screen is a playlist. He skips to the next song, waiting for the coffee to match an energizing beat. He taps his foot as thoughts reflect again on the buffet, and quitting, then vacation. That's it. He'll take time off and try Vegas. Then as the train eases into the next station, he sees her, and she sees him too.

Suddenly Monday isn't so bad after all.

Whatever this Symphony is, Dave is okay with it, because he isn't alone. He wasn't alone before. Happy, actually, as well as anyone can be.

Now though, he isn't alone in the way one feels when meeting the abrupt chaos of the ordinary, waking up from a dream. Here's someone else, her smiling eyes, a moment of a glance and familiar comfort to affirm: me too.

She disappears into the shuffling dance of passengers.

I call animal control and no one picks up. Ofcourse. I then see some random guy trying to coerce it into his truck. Probably the owner who knows. But it really upset me seeing this super large pit running free in the streets right next to my house. Then we head to a coffee shop. In walks this scumbag with his pitbull and what does he proceed to do? He flings the leash away and lets his pitbull roam around the coffee shop free. Another guy with a little dog is about to walk in. The pitbull sees this guy and his little dog and he runs right towards it. The man quickly shuts the door and stays outside. The owner of the pit walks over to grab it and proceeds to press down on the pitbull with his foot to try to get it to sit and then walks away again. No one at the coffee shop said anything. we got up and left because we didn't feel safe at all. I was so upset because this is now two unleashed pit bulls in one day roaming free. No one was injured or hurt but it infuriates me that this guy let his pit roam free in a coffee shop and no one said a word and that the owner of the other pitbull is so irresponsible that his stupid dog was roaming around my neighborhood. Anyways after that day my husband and I decided we have to become responsible law abiding gun owners because we are not taking any chances now that we have a baby. Pits kill babies all of the time and it seems everywhere we go these days there's a pit bull and the owners always seem to unleash them. No where is safe anymore. I wish these animals would be banned. I can't stand them. ,3,1738174315.0,BanPitBulls,1,1.0,False
