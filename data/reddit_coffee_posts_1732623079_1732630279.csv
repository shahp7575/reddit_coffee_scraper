1h0cpi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1h0cpi8/21_days_itinerary_first_time_10th_anniversary/,"21 Days Itinerary (First Time, 10th anniversary trip, travelling with Autism all during Golden week)","\* disclaimer I made a similar post in JapanTravel with more detail but this will be more regarding general ideas for the trip so I can better adjust my itinerary and then re-plan the details!

Hi Everyone, 

Sharing my trip itinerary with you in hopes for insights! 

This would be my first time in Japan and I really want to make the most out of it without really overdoing it. We really wanted to visit Japan for a long time now and we are finally doing it for our 10th anniversary but first a few things to take into account so you can better understand my thinking, planning and maybe be able to give better advice based on this!

*We really wanted to do Okinawa + the southern part of Japan but we decided to cut this out of this trip and leave for a future trip if we get the opportunity.*

I am **Autistic,** and even though I am on the low support needs end of it, I do tend to get overwhelmed with crowds, noise, and too much on my schedule; I know most of my limits and I am doing the mental preparation that I will be attending Japan in one of the busiest times of the year (Late April - Early May). But you'll see, our itinerary even though quite full, still gives space and time for me to not be moving around SO much (and have more nights in the same hotel or so I think). I would really appreciate **advice** and **insight** from people who have travelled before during this time of the year to some of this places, to know if it is definitely too crowded, or better to avoid certain things. 

We value food, a good coffee, outdoors and experiences I am more than open to suggestions that you think are enjoyable or are worth not missing out!

To start of:

**Day 1 (21 April 2025)**.  **Osaka** by the evening 

**Day 2 (22 April)**. Day trip to **Hiroshima** 

**Day 3 (23 April)**. Day trip to **Himeji** and **Kobe**

**Day 4 (24 April)**. Travel to **Koyasan** 

**Day 5 (25 April)**. Travel to **Hakone** (if it wasnt for our anniversary I would schedule this later in the trip but we want to spend the day of our anniversary in an Onzen in Hakone)

**Day 6 (26 April)**. 10th anniversary in **Hakone**

**Day 7 (27 April)**. Travel to **Kyoto.** 

**Day 8 (28 April)**. Morning trip to **Nara**

**Day 9 (29 April)**. Travelling to **Amanohashidate** and/or **Ine**. 

**Day 10 (30 April)**. Returning to **Kyoto**

**Day 11 (1 May)**. Travel to **Kanazawa** 

**Day 12 (2 May)**. Day trip to **Shirakawa-go**. 

**Day 13 (3 May)**. Travel to **Narai-juku**.

**Day 14 (4 May)**. Travel to **Tokyo** 

**Day 15-20 (5-11 May)** would be spent in Tokyo like follow:

* **Day 15 (5 May)** Day trip to **Ashikaga Flower Park**, 
* **Day 16 ( 6 May)** Explore **Tokyo**. 
* **Day 17 ( 7 May)** Day trip to **Nikko** 
* **Day 18 ( 8 May)** Explore **Tokyo**. 
* **Day 19 (9 May)** Day trip to **Chichibu**. If its possible would stop at the **Kawagoe** area to explore around 
* **Day 20 (10 May)** last day in **Tokyo**.

**Day 21 (11 May)** Leave hotel and travel back home

All in all the only places we are spending just a one night in a hotel are Koyasan (intentional), the area of Ine, and Narai-juku. This was intentional to avoid as much different hotels + transfers as possible. I am aware Hakone could be done later in the trip but as previously stated, we wanted to spend our anniversary there plus it will be a nice relax after a few day trips and arriving in Japan. 

I've read that for this time of the year we need **to book the Shinkansen one month in advance**, is this really true for **ALL** the trips we would need to take it during this trip or is it for specific trips that tend to be more frequented or crowded? Do you know about general ""crowdiness"" of the transports during the time and areas I will be visiting?

**I am a photographer as well so anything regarding photography is deeply appreciated as well.**  
We planned on doing Arcades + Gashapons + shopping during the evenings to get the most of our daylight.

As Golden week is from April 29 to May 5, do you think I should reschedule/ reorganize some of the activities for these days? Is Amanohashidate, Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Narai-juku going to be packed? 

Which of these places will be less packed during the 5th of May? Chichibu, Nikko or Ashikaga Flower Park? 

If you read everything thank you very much for your time and insights! I really need to plan everything good in order to avoid any meltdowns/shutdowns and just feeling unwell in general.

I did not initiate anything and she snuck out at like two in the morning. We went on a coffee and hit it off well. She has a similar mindset to mine, we both value our time and are hard workers. We have been texting and getting to know each other for two weeks now. The thing is, I am not good at this stuff. How long should this stage of the relationship last? Should I escalate at some point?

1h0cofq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1h0cofq/f_playing_a4a_dark_romance_thriller_stories_and/,"[F playing A4A] Dark romance, thriller stories and more! ","Hello everyone! Thanks for reading my post. My name is Vale and I'm a 23 female roleplayer searching for other 18+ roleplayers willing to lose themselves in a journey full of drama, angst, betrayals and controversial themes.  
I must confess, I'm particularly interested in very dark roleplays at the moment, so give me dramatic, gritty and angsty stories please! For this reason, if you're not comfortable with playing/playing against really morally grey characters (to the point of them being assassins, serial killers and so on), I'm probably not the partner for you.  
I have a couple of plots in mind, and they will be listed down below!  


\***About me and my preferences:***

\- I'm 23, so I won't roleplay with minors. Please do not interact if you're one. Said this, your age doesn't matter to me as long as you are 18+. The main characters must be 18+ as well, although I can accept side characters that break the rule (if they make sense to the story and are not involved in anything sexual, of course).
  
\- I write in 3rd person, past tense. No first person, please. It makes me uncomfortable.- I'm female, but play both female and male characters. My favourite pairings are M×M or M×F, and I unfortunately don't play F×F couples. Your gender in real life or your sexual preferences don't matter to me: all members of the LGBTQ+ community are safe and welcome. I will respect your pronouns and your identity if you're willing to share it on the Internet. If not, that's not an issue either. However, for this roleplay, I would prefer for you to play a cis woman or a cis man.  

\- I consider myself to be advanced literate, and, although English is not my first language, I believe I have a good grasp of its grammar, spelling and punctuation. I'm not searching for one-liners or low effort roleplays, but I cannot handle novella roleplays (600+ words) either, at the moment. I did them in the past, and they become a bit of a chore after a while; I typically write 3/4 paragraphs (around 2000/3000 characters, within the Discord limit, but not scared to break it if the situation calls for it) and would like my partner to match my length. Length that could obviously be adjusted, depending on what's happening in the story or our inspiration.  

\- I'm pretty busy at the moment, so I aim to give my partners a reply every week, but it happens that I need a couple of extra days to organise my ideas and write them down. I really don't care about how long it takes for someone to type out a response, and I hope to find someone who's just as understanding.  

\- For me, roleplaying means collaborative writing. I love brainstorming ideas, discussing plot twists or just talking about our characters. About who they are, why they do what they do, who they could become and how. A bit like writing a book, but with another person. If you have a song that reminds you of our story, fanarts, drawings, reels or whatever, send them to me! I enjoy chatting OOC about what we are writing. This isn't in any way required, though: what I care about is having an enthusiastic partner, who doesn't force me to take the lead every time. Bring your ideas to the table, please! I promise I don't bite.  

\- I love stories that are filled with plot twists, drama, fights. I want our characters to shape who they are through the roleplay, make choices and mistakes, learning from them or not learning at all and doing them all over again. I'm not interested in good, perfect characters. Give me the aggressive, indipendent woman who doesn't give a damn about anyone but herself. Or the grumpy middle aged workaholic who's too hurt to love again. Give me a man who never does bad things—unless someone is not watching. A shy, boring woman who's tired to work infinite hours at the police station, until a serial killer tries to get her attention. I'll say no to characters that need to be pushed around all the time.  

\- NSFW content: YES, but not if that's the point of the story. The focus of this roleplay will be the relationship between our characters, and how events have the power and the ability to change it. It's about their feelings, and how those feelings challenge their beliefs or personality. I'm not here to get anyone off: while I enjoy NSFW themes and believe they give further informations on who the character is, that's not the focus of the story. I should also warn everyone that I absolutely love slow burn romance, and I'm a sucker for building tension over and over again, before getting to the point of releasing it. We will discuss boundaries, triggers and limits in DMs, and I will respect every single one my partner might have, asking them to do the same.  

\- Side characters: BIG YES! I love to create a world around our characters, see them interacting with other people, knowing them through them. I think they add so much to the story, if played well. I will play the necessary side characters, and I would like to have a partner who does the same.  

\***Possible plots:***  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Clues to my heart""***
\A new serial killers is terrorising Muse A's city, targeting a specific type of victims. Muse A is a troubled detective who recently came back to work after a traumatic experience, at the stritch condition of attending therapy and getting more rest.   
Muse B is a young, clever therapist who's slowly gaining Muse A's trust during their weekly sessions, while dealing his own traumatic, unsolved past. The relationship between the two steadily develops both professionally and personally, until boundaries and professional detachment become two confusing concepts: somehow, Muse B seems to casually be in the same places Muse A normally frequents, he acts like a friend more than a therapist, often moves the conversation towards prohibited themes.   
But Muse A is too busy thinking about the cases they have to solve to realise what is happening. Despite what his boss reminds them every day, they cannot rest until the serial killer is behind bars: because they left clues, clues that prove he knows something Muse A wants to keep hidden. Because the killer seems to be flirting with Muse A through their crime scenes in a very familiar way, lightly twisting the knife into wounds only Muse B knows about.   

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Something's wrong with the new neighbour""***
\A man (Muse B) and a cheerful, bubbly five years old girl just moved in the house next to the one Muse A's shares with their husband. They recently lost the third member of their family, the girl's mother and Muse B's wife, and decided to change their surroundings to heal away from the big city.   
Muse A conquers the little girl's heart immediately, while slowly making their way into Muse B's one as well. But Muse A's husband is not happy with this new ""friendship"" and, in few weeks, new bruises appear on the body parts Muse A is not able to cover with clothes and makeup.   
Then, the shocking news: Muse A's husband body is found in the nearest lake, with no clues on who might be the responsible for the tragedy.   
While Muse A tries to adjust to the unreal situation, secrets and confusing informations about Muse B's past quickly become the favourite topic of discussion in the small city: his wife went missing months prior, and yet he insists on saying that she is dead. Someone swears to have seen Muse B talking with Muse A just the night of his death. He acts strangely whenever his wife is mentioned.   
(Bonus point if we make this a M/M story, and Muse B has internalised homophobia/isn't comfortable with his attraction for men at first.)  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Deadly tachycardia""*** 
\Two strangers decide to sign up on an online dating app to meet the love of their life. Perhaps out of boredom. A friend's advice. Just because it's easier than having to flirt with someone in a bar, even. Truth to be told, one of them has a very specific reason to be on the app. Muse A never talks about his job, but they were paid to make excellent jokes and appear as charming as possible. To find their way into their date's wounds and stab their heart— quite literally. They are eager to meet Muse B, who, on the other hand, finds every excuse to delay the first meeting.   
One night, surrounded by Muse B's bodyguards, Muse A finally gets to understand why the new mission is going to be so much harder than his previous ones: Muse B is far from being a Miss/Mr Nobody (who they are it's up to us!).  
While they try to conquer Muse B's trust and heart, Muse A will have to deal with his own feelings for someone who hides a dark secret of their own (they hired Muse B themselves? They are trying to destroy Muse B's business? Up for discussion!)  
(Bonus point if Muse B has some kind of cronich illness physical disability because I think it could add a layer of complexity to this particular story!)
  
\***[M×M and M×F, requires you to play two characters!\] ""The Royal swap""***
\Muse A is a princess, second in line for the throne after her twin brother, Muse C. The reign is involved in a bloody, terrifying war with the North, and Muse B's father, the kind of the North, is not willing to let go. With the excuse of creating an alliance between the two kingdoms, Muse A's father, the king of the South, decides to arrange a marriage between her and Muse B (first in line for the throne in the North), despite the girl's protests.   
Here comes Muse C. Knowing his sister is interested in sitting on the throne more than what he'll ever be, he decides to make a plan to follow their father's orders without having to sacrifice anyone's happiness. He cuts Muse A's hair, making very difficult for people to tell the two twins apart, then leaves the country to face the upcoming wedding.   
Muse C will have to face a cruel Prince with a hidden soft heart, who's slowly discovering his own sexuality after years of repression. Meanwhile, Muse B has to train like a man, dress like a man, act like a man, while hiding her feelings for the only person who can tell the difference between her and her brother— Muse D.   
What will happen when Muse A will receive the order to kill his spouse? For how long Muse B and D will manage to keep their true identity and relationship secret?   

\***[M×M o M×F\] Sick person/caretaker (heavily inspired by me before you) ""Let me in""***
\Muse A doesn't tolerate any type of help.   
That's the phrase her mother says, whenever she welcomes a new nurse, doctor, or maid in their ridiculously large house. Something happened in Muse A's past, a terrible accident that left them unable to care for themselves properly (the kind of injury can be discussed, as well as Muse A's abilities/disabilities. She might have a chronic illness, she might be paralysed, or whatever else comes to mind).   
Muse B doesn't really know why he accepted the job to begin with. Truth to be told, their financial situation is not the best (to be kind), and the family promised a large amount of money and regular payment. More importantly, a place to stay when Muse B couldn't even afford rent. They are there to keep Muse A company and help them with daily tasks, they are told, but it's not as easy as it seems: Muse A is rude, mostly annoyed by anything Muse B does or say, to the point of insulting them or ignoring them altogether.   
And yet, one night, something changes.   
But nothing is never how it appears.   
Could Muse B be responsible for the accident that destroyed Muse A's life? Or is Muse A not really sick, after all? 

\***Other dynamics i'd like to explore although I don't have anything specific in mind:*** 

- INMATE X COP/INMATE 

- PRIEST X PROSTITUTE/NUN-PRIEST/ANYONE

* **Writing sample:**

Sitting in the underground, waiting for her stop, Rose thinks New York never looked so boring. It's one of those days, she fears: when the rain makes going anywhere, or talk to anyone, an incredibly tedious task. A homeless man is laying on the bench in front of her own, taking three seats instead of one. He's shivering and sweating at the same time, and it's safe to assume he's struggling with one of those harsh virus she exposes herself to whenever she doesn't feel like driving to work. The man is clinging to the paper cup in his right hand, although there are just few dollars in it. Rose can't stop thinking how a few thousands dollars donation could literally change his life, allowing him to buy medicines and perhaps make himself presentable for a decent job. 2000 dollars would be enough, she considers, with no real intention to actually help the person desperately trying to survive. It's a ridiculous sum of money for someone like her - one she could throw away and not miss in the slightest. And yet, she feels no empathy or pity for his tragedy. 

The doors open. 
A well dressed man limps in holding an heavy suitcase in one hand and his IPhone in the other. He sees the homeless man, and taps his pockets in search of money. Rose sees the wedding ring on his finger before anything else. 
He giggles as he puts a fifty in the paper cup: he's speaking with someone he calls *love* and *darling*, and other pet names the woman on the other line certainly doesn't deserve. His voice is deep. Warm. Like hot tea and honey under the duvet. 
And it happens just like that. Rose is on the other side of that phone now, being called *love*, and *darling*, and whatever else. She likes it. She likes *him*. 

Her prey doesn't see the danger until it's too late. Rose's standing behind him, and takes advantage of the train's rough stop to lose her balance and bump into him. The coffee she's holding *accidentally* falls on his blue shirt, and then falls on the ground. 
""Oh, my God! Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" She says quickly, putting on the best shocked-embarassed face she can master. ""I'm so - God, I'm so clumsy."" 
The gentleman, *her* gentleman, is too nice to appear bothered or angry. ""Hey, hey, don't worry. It happens. It's nothing. I hated this shirt anyway."" There is a hint of humour in his voice, which Rose doesn't miss. 
She replaces her mask with an apologetic, innocent one. ""Well, that's - ugh."" She rubs her face like the whole thing it's just the last straw after a very long week. ""I can get it cleaned. If you give it to me - I mean, not now, but you could give me your number, and send the shirt, and I'll fix it."" 
He smiles. *An incredibly charming smile.* ""There is no need. Really. You're kind, but we're even. Don't worry."" 
""I insist."" Now she sounds too desperate. She sighs. ""Please. It would make me feel better. Like I did something good this week."" Acting like a victim is not her favourite flirting method, but it works too well on Mr. Gentleman. 
She leaves the metro with his number and a new mission. ",1,1732630025.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Most phrasing of my searches turns up this useful article - https://alittlecrispy.com/2016/12/hot-pack-fillings/ - with a pretty inclusive test range.

The two things I want to check before filling my bags and giving them out:

1. For putting salt in the bags with the rice - that looks fine, would also help control moisture during storage. I have a large amount of ground pink salt that has a bit too much mineral taste for most cooking. Recipes including salt that I saw were for Epsom salt or rock salt. If my bags are made from a standard cotton calico, would the salt affect the end product or microwaving?

2. For scent, I really wanted to also put un-brewed coffee grounds into the bags. I can't find anything on this, and it does seem more risky for burning on heating.

I'll be putting use instructions with them when I give them out, so feedback and experience are all appreciated!",1,1732629568.0,crafting,0,1.0,False

It's a nice space with lots of room and natural lighting. Bedroom is spacious, there is a storage closet, a work room, and large living room and kitchen. Washer and dryer on premises. Street parking.

Location is difficult to beat; 200 feet from Sennot park, 1 block from lamplighter, 5 minute walk to central square (and red line) and 5 minutes to Inman square. Easy bike ride of 5 minutes or 15 minute walk to MIT or Harvard. 

Loads of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops, along with a Whole Foods (3-4 min walk) in short distance. 

A little about me: I'm a 34 yo gay male who works as a nurse (I work day shift, 3x12hr shifts but sometimes more). I'm pretty chill and easy-going. I’m social outside the home but sometimes can keep to myself when home. I respect everyone’s personal space! I enjoy traveling, breweries, biking a bit, going out to eat, photography, and just hanging with friends.

Respectful of common spaces. Have no real pre-specified preferences for a roommate other than also taking care of common spaces and please be clean! Naturally, would love to meet to see if we would be a good fit. 

Place is not pet friendly but could always double check with landlord!

Also, place is mostly furnished except for your room. There is a couch left by the previous tenant but it’s a little run down, but I’m too lazy to find something new haha. There is no TV as well since I do not watch much of it.

New here and just learning. I have a long history of allergies (environmental), eczema (contact, atopic, and dyshodrotic), and now along with other symptoms I’m wondering is a histamine intolerance could be the cause. I’ll list all of this below. 

My primary question is about blood tests. I have an appointment with my PCP today who is usually very amenable to ordering tests I want. So, what should I ask for? Just a basic serum histamine? Allergy markers? I’ll be ordering a GI map test too and have a SIBO test, and am doing upper endo/colonoscopy two-fer next month. I should also note that there’s a fair bit of autoimmune stuff in my immediate and extended family. I have Raynaud’s. Dad is T1 diabetic, sister has RA. A cousin has Lupus and my aunt has some autoimmune disease I can’t recall. 

Symptoms - first long standing then newer since perimenopause 
- asthma
- environmental allergies causing hay fever symptoms
- allergies to fragrance/dyes causing contact dermatitis 
- oral allergy syndrome (melons, avocado, carrots etc usually if underripe causing throat and mouth itchiness)
- on/off GI symptoms dominated by excessive, foul gas. Negative for celiac, negative for SIBO several years ago. Went away on its own. 
- occasional idiopathic hives/rash on upper body (torso, limbs, face)

Newer (last few years, likely aligns to earliest perimenopausal changes in hormones)
- non-allergic rhinitis (exercise induced. I’m confident this is non-allergic because the setting doesn’t matter. Indoor, outdoor, pool. It happens when I do long, hard enduro workouts. Sneeze and seriously faucet-like nose for days, antihistamines don’t help. 
- GI foul gas, daily pudding-like diarrhea for about 2 years
- cognitive impairments (recently diagnosed with ADHD due to family history but suspect other mechanisms for the memory, brain fog and focus issues)
- POTS, intense light headedness, dizziness, darkening vision when changing physical position from sitting/laying/squatting to standing 
- Tinnitus (most of adult life but getting worse) 
- alcohol intolerance (flushing, tight chest, elevated heart rate). I don’t drink anymore (~6mo off it) but I went through an era of heavier drinking. 
- intensely itchy skin on chest, neck, face. Sometimes with rash, sometimes not. Itching isn’t due to dryness. I’m moisturized. 
- GERD, though much improved since switching from coffee to green tea.
- thinning hair in widows peaks. Idk if related. Probably just peri.

I live with my in-laws. The parents are great, loving and super supportive. My husband has four siblings - 1 brother and 2 sisters. The youngest sister lives in a different country so we don’t see her most of the time. The other two are also married and we all live under the same roof. The eldest sister has 3 kids. 

They were all pretty close with my husband’s ex girlfriend since they’re in the same circle and would still comment on each other’s IG to this day.

Before we got married: 
1. My MIL wanted us to get engaged earlier but his brother said “I’ve only known her as your girlfriend and I’m not ready for her to be in this family” so we postponed it until the brother got married. He also said that my personality was too “girly and loud” since the family is pretty posh. 
2. After our engagement, I was invited then uninvited to the youngest sister’s birthday because they wanted to be exclusively for the family. 
3. I’m an extrovert and naturally I’m pretty good with listening and talking to other people, but I never got along with all of his siblings and the in laws. But you know, maybe it was just cause we weren’t officially married yet? At least that’s what I thought. 

After we got married: 
1. The eldest sister and the brother’s wife are pretty close, they would talk endlessly and would usually exclude me in conversations or I’ll just let myself be a wallflower. They would also go out for coffees together and wouldn’t even invite me. I ended up being okay with that as long as I still get to be a part of the conversation once in a while. 
2. The brother…. That’s the highest boss fight for me. The only thing we’d say to each other is “hi” and “bye” or when I try to talk to him, he’d just answer me coldly. There were several times when he’d scold me for doing things slightly differently in the house (I was only a few months into the marriage). 
3. His wife will always try to win in the “best in law” award, which was a competition I stopped taking part of - I just wanted to be a family member in this household. 
4. The sibs would always comment on each other’s IG postings, even on my husband’s ex but never on mine - not even a like. 
5. The siblings would never include me in any birthday discussions or plannings. 
6. My husband is an introvert and doesn’t really bond well with the siblings after dinner, but I’d usually stay down a bit later after he went up to our bedroom so that I could spend an extra time with the siblings, but it would usually feel cold and unwelcoming. 

We’ve only been married for a year, dated for 2 years. Perhaps it’s still early, my husband said time will heal. But we live together and see each other everyday and yet it still feels the same.

[GME Trading Day 11\/25 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/qn3o832t983e1.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e660dcd38a052a1fd7501b5d4854c0ee476589b)

You love to see that bull run into the close! Obviously yesterday was an exciting day - green always is. Traders came out guns blazing on the day keeping our price above the $28 large Call Gamma position for the entirety of the trading day save a small dip below the hedging support level that was quickly reversed into an uptrend on the day. After poking our head up above the large Call Gamma position at $29, the price played off and above this level before settling down into a gamma pin around $29 with a solid frequency of bullish scalps off our VWAP line into what was shaping up to be a bit of boring close. This was until a large volume of bullish options flow flooded in during the closing minutes of the day, closing with a substantial bullish premium imbalance.

https://preview.redd.it/o399ycoab83e1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=35312e1bbdf0a29e48d6b94cda775efe5be01533

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[OI Changes 11\/25-11\/26](https://preview.redd.it/disqt2vfm83e1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a191deb61809739f044170c0e018c67029549c)

As expected, we witnessed some sizable new OI positions open across up and own our chain for 11/29 expiry. Activity on both sides of the chain is notably drifting higher as our price continues to ratchet up into a tighter and tighter bracket to the downside of our $30 Call Wall, which had even more Call OI piled on top of it yesterday to the tune of over 4000 new contracts just this week. $29 OI Changes reflect the status this strike held for much of the day yesterday, namely our ATM strike for most of the day's VWAP scalping. Most of the day's Put volume (>50%) at the strike, however, came through in  the last few minutes of the day on a substantial MID order, perhaps a long trade to capture an opening downside reversal off of our bull-run into the close.

For our near-term Bullish prospects, the Call OI expansions at $31 and $32 are promising, as provide some hedging texture to the area above $30 that does not signal immediate reversal. The size of our total Charm at $30 (delta loss over time) still presents a significant challenge to breakout potential into this area without uncommonly high bullish volume. You can see this visualized here:

https://preview.redd.it/jvuy2n45p83e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7270363f661e23d31a6413e24d8cf032c6a98b15

 So basically what this says: Options Dealers (ideally) will sell 1.5mil+ shares of delta hedges per day that the $30 strike is not ITM up until Friday when it will get super dynamic. This effect is part of what makes large OTM Call Positions difficult to overcome via normal options flows. 

Nonetheless, options traders are zeroing in on the $30 price level through higher and higher purchasing brackets on both the Call and Put side. This is what is responsible for the Max Pain march-up we've been seeing, and yesterday's trading was no different in terms of its effect:

https://preview.redd.it/lxsk9oufb83e1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5b81605727be2810fdef431234abe7f72832ea3

ChartExchange is now reporting Max Pain at $25 for this week in accordance with Maximum-Pain's reported value yesterday. Our entire month of December expiries feature a Max Pain of $24 or higher, which as a whole continues to support trading at least at our current price ranges from a Market Maker standpoint.   


**Gamma Exposure**

As we look to today's Gamma Exposure, we continue to see signs projecting a continuation of our stable, bullish trading environment

https://preview.redd.it/uam1biqdl83e1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=86933de0f6684e13581760e93c69d24919182fb5

Our Put-to-Call GEX ratio is once again squarely in the 1:5 range mirroring the conditions seen just prior to each of last two options expiries (11/15 and 11/22). 

https://preview.redd.it/yxv77251m83e1.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=7120a2cebf39617a61adc81e96a92d0b036476dc

As we take a look at our daily gamma hedging landscape we are still projecting to trade within the $28-$30 bracket with the $30 Call Wall as a hard resistance level overhead. Both $29-$30 and $29-$28 serve as attractive intraday trading brackets that offer volatility-suppressant 'hang-ups' on intraday approaches via normal options flow. We can see $31, $32, and $33 beginning to offer a bit of meaningful Call Gamma accumulation to 'catch' the price should it breach $30. However, we still don't have a truly substantial Call Gamma position above $30 like we saw form up at $26 on November 8 after our $25 Call Wall breach at that time to suggest a breach-and-hold scenario is imminent, specifically that traders are presently confident enough in substantial numbers to open and hold short-term positions above $30 - but we're getting there! There is still no visible risk of major downside reversal in our gamma exposure data.

**Technicals**

We can see our 50-4hr SMA guiderail flattening out a bit as we shed candle values from the second periodization after our initial Cat Day CATalyst pop (the week of 11/15 OPEX), though it is still rising and will continue to rise as $28 and $29 values replace values around $25.50 and $26. RSI is still in position to support a potential test of $30 with some breakthrough into the $30.50-$31 area, but this will send an RSI oversold signal (RSI >70) should we see it pop up today or tomorrow. From the look of our chart here, our predominating technical paradigm still projects stable trading throughout the week. From our chart here, I would still project a $30 test, but likely rejection to be followed by a weekly close around $28 once again.

[Weekly Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/5n18qy1nf83e1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c7af5e9cdddd6f3792ccf83f044cf0b2666dd10)

As we look at our larger timeframe charts, it is worth paying some heed to our weekly timeframe once again. We are in the midst of recording a fifth green weekly candle in a row and have extended above the 200-week moving average from the current floor of our weekly candle at around $28. If we are attempting to look for some evidence which might convey confidence in our continued bullish uptrend not only on the timescale of a few weeks, but several months or even quarters, we can look to our 50-week and 200-week Simple Moving Averages. The last time the 50-week SMA crossed above the 200-week SMA was the week of the Sneeze in 2021 after touching during the week prior. If we remain trading above the 200-week SMA as we are now officially as of this week, these two SMAs should cross as they did in 2021 in a period of 15-20 weeks with an average weekly trading price in the $30-$35 range. Even if we remain trading in our $25-$30 range, the gap between these two SMAs will still continue to narrow.  
  
Independent of this particular context, there are only two instances in the past five years when we encountered five green weeks in a row, both instances just prior to the week of quarterly earnings report. 

[5-Week Green Streak into Q2 Earnings Report Sept 2020](https://preview.redd.it/6sr3l1zyg83e1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=30caa1f1594c248e2534ba70174c34a65004c420)

[5-Week Green Streak into Q1 Earnings Report Jun 2023](https://preview.redd.it/0qe0y724h83e1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=abcd11893619b14ca2dba127bf3b47c106a44d4e)

Both instances were followed by a mildly red week for the week of earnings itself, but were then subsequently followed by at least one week with a weekly high that exceed the highest high of the preceding 5-week streak. It is interesting to note at the same time that Wall Street is 'estimating' the Q3 2024 earnings report to come out sometime next week (even though we still have no word from the company officially). We don't have a lot of data on this and I am not attempting to argue for '12/13 BULLISH' based on these two historical instances alone. This, however, did stand out to me as worth taking into account given the rarity of our current technical situation with respect to our Stonk.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/7i5l17vky83e1.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=48acc4202d08380fcdeea21433e0f6a18b01c388)

Onward and upward we march on the IV front! We still have no official date confirmed for our earnings report from the company. Thus, we have to assume that, should the 2-Week IV appreciation effect pre-earnings keep with our trend over the past 7 quarters, we still have yet to see it work into our current IV values outside of the pure price action appreciation we have been seeing recently since Cat Day. I'll just point out that it's possible we don't see this IV ""thumper"" effect again this quarter given the ""worm"" pattern that is emerging. RK may have been hinting at something to this effect through his Dune memes, but I won't speculate further on this for now.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

I project we have about an equal likelihood of bullish open -> $30 test -> Reversal to the $28-$29 bracket as a bearish open -> slower, but sooner reversal to the $28-$29. Some combination of these scenarios is in play today and into our trading during this short week. However, I am neither expecting a $30 breach-and-hold to materialized (for now), nor a significant downside reversal based on our current technical and options data.   
  
We will have to stay vigilant and observe how our data change over time as always as we continue to await an actual company announcement on when we can expect our Q3 earnings report. Every day I come into our charts and data with the express objecting of finding some reason to expect our run to dry up. So far, I am still not seeing reason to expect this inside our undisturbed price action model/system. Always remember that the unexpected can occur, that all knowledge is probabilistic, and that no forecast can ever be 100% certain.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!



PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. This week's coffee and newsletter is brought to you by the generosity of '**FrequentPoem**.' Be sure to thank Frequent this week in the comments for supporting our efforts here! Cheers, my friend :)

I've had a lot of generous coffee donors over the past few days and weeks to whom I have had the pleasure of giving shoutouts - I'll be sure to revisit everyone who was generous enough to donate as I drink your coffees! Thank you friends :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here. @ MichaelTLoPiano if Reddit is down for some reason like last week.

[Dreams are Messages from the Deep.](https://preview.redd.it/jlxdwojs883e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5691f355c38c63ae11de8c69f5d338ba805ca012)

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Asking as a former hater turned early-morning listener.,"So, here’s the thing. Back in the mid-2000s, when I was in high school, my music taste was *refined.* My friends and I were all about Killswitch Engage, Architects, Elysia, Stick to Your Guns, Evergreen Terrace—and when we really wanted to throw down, we’d crank up some Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, or Beneath the Massacre. You know, the good *angry* stuff.

Then came *City of Evil*. Avenged Sevenfold dropped the screaming, went full melodic, and we collectively decided they were for posers. That was it. Done. Dusted. Never gave them another thought… until recently.

Fast-forward to now: I’m 33, caffeinated, and somehow stumbled into *Life Is But a Dream...*. I know this album was polarizing for fans (thank you, Wikipedia rabbit holes), but here I am, starting my mornings with *Cosmic*. And let me tell you, it’s giving serious Carl Sagan *Cosmos* vibes—like, I’m staring into the abyss of existence while making more coffee. It’s weirdly profound.

So I gotta ask: what’s the consensus on A7X in 2024? Are they still huge in the States? (In Canada, they’re not exactly dominating the airwaves.) Have other former “too-cool-for-City-of-Evil” folks had a similar change of heart? Or am I just getting soft with age?

Anyway, I need to finish my coffee. Let me know your thoughts.",2,1732628299.0,MetalForTheMasses,6,0.67,False

A US-centric brief guide/intro to tariffs and stocking up","Disclaimer: I'm new here myself so please correct or redirect me as needed. I thought a brief intro to the main things to stock up on would be helpful to other newcomers.

TARIFFS: tl;dr is price increases are coming. Goods and materials from Canada, Mexico, and China will go up in price. These are some of our major trading partners - ex. see what we import from Canada [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/imports/canada). What to prioritize to prepare for this?

DEBTS: Pay these off. Try to buy what you can to prepare too, but the debt should be prioritized since we don't know what else is coming down the pipeline, how the dollar will be impacted, etc.

On this note, don't go crazy buying things right now in a way that'll put you in a poor economic position. What else will be posted below all presumes you're purchasing according to your personal purchasing power and situation.

OTHER FINANCES: Cut out subscriptions. Set a budget to limit impulse spends (including on prep items - don't go overboard on the New Hotness out of panic).

FOOD: Everyone has to eat. Try to stock up on food now, as this will be impacted both by tariffs and possible deportations (not to mention other stuff like climate impacts, H5N1...). You don't need to go nuts all in one day, just increase your shopping trips and buy more non/low-perishables when you go out.

* Only buy stuff you'll actually eat! And try to buy stuff on sale.
* Canned foods are great but take up space.
* Dry foods take up less space per food-mass but can be prone to infestation. Freeze them for 48 hours to kill insect eggs before chucking them in a hard-walled container (ex. plastic tote or metal garbage bins) to keep mice out.
* Don't forget spices/flavorings too, as well as other small imported personal luxeries like chocolate and coffee - the spice of life.
* Store in cool, dark, dry areas.
* Dessicants and oxygen removers are your friend for preserving and food quality. Get a few and chuck them in closed food containers to keep things fresh longer.
* If you have one, a vacuum sealer can help preserve food and save space. If you don't, consider if that's an investment you're really willing to swing.
* The pre-made prepper buckets are not worth the money.
* Note, this also applies to pet food. Stock up for your pets! Dry kibbles can also be infested by pests so consider giving them the freeze treatment too.

MEDICINE: Definite priority for personal meds but possibly difficult to stockpile. /r/preppersales is again a good resource. A lot of OTC meds have longer shelf lives than listed - focus on shelf-stable options (e.g. pills are better than liquids). Store in cool, dry, shaded places (NOT in the bathroom - warm and humid!) If needing hormones, check out /r/TransDIY.

BIRTH CONTROL: Definitely good to have on hand if you or a loved one(s) can get pregnant. Possibly difficult to stockpile, depending on exact medication/outlet. Costco sells Plan B for fairly cheap. Long-term birth control options like IUDs can be helpful for ""set and forget"". If seeking something even more permanent, /r/childfree has good resources for sterilization (I recommend bilateral salpingectomy over tubal ligation). High priority.

MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS: Consider using reusables and buying them now as a one-time cost. Cloth pads, cups, discs, are all good options. If you must use disposables, stock up now since a lot are made overseas.

OTHER HEALTH: Whatever you might need health-wise, whether it's masks, eyeglasses/contacts, or CPAP machine parts, try to get. At minimum it's handy to have some disposable gloves, N95 masks, and eye protection (goggles or glasses). Adjust this based on personal priority, but I would consider this high priority given potential declines in the healthcare system.

ELECTRONICS: Expected to be hit pretty hard by tariffs. I don't game so I don't know how important systems are to people, but if it's a major hobby maybe get the platforms ASAP, there's probably some good holiday deals. If uncertain about upgrading a middle-aged electronic, consider buying a new one and keeping the old to resell later.

HOUSEHOLD GOODS: Dish detergent, laundry detergent, toilet paper, etc. If possible, consider replacing disposables with reusable items such as washcloths or a bidet, especially if you consume a lot (e.g. large families). This will cut down both on costs and on storage, as a lot of these items can be bulky. Also consider switching to powdered laundry detergent instead of pods or liquid - more bang for your buck, less space/weight.

MISCELLANEOUS MATERIALS: Wood, metals, and many other raw materials will become more expensive. Tools, car parts, lumber, cloth. Too varied to cover in a basic intro, but if it's something that's definitely needed, ex. you're building a house, get that done ASAP. Companies are rushing to buy extra material stock before prices rise - you should too.

GROWING YOUR OWN FOOD: If possible, but not an immediate priority. There's a lot of options for this, so it'll depend on whether you like gardening as a hobby or can do it in your living situation. We're not currently in a growing season in the USA so it might be hard to find deals, but check out second-hand sales to see if anyone's offloading stuff.And, of course, /r/preppersales

ENERGY: Good to consider but not necessarily something to prioritize as a prep newbie. Depends a lot on your living situation, ex. you can't really run a generator in an apartment. There are some deals for generators, battery packs, etc. in /r/preppersales. You can also look into higher-efficiency items that reduce energy consumption.

WATER: Again, good to consider but not necessarily something to prioritize as a prep newbie. Depends a lot on your living situation. Look for filters, etc. in /r/preppersales 

BOOKS: If you want, but they're not going to vaporize as soon as 2025 hits and there's plenty of ebook and second-hand markets. Not a high priority, but good to keep in mind as knowledge is power.

GUNS: If you have one, get some extra ammo maybe. If you don't and you're not sure about it, make yourself comfortable first before you get one - go to a range and get some 1-on-1 teaching. Not an immediate priority.

FITNESS: Not really a thing to buy unless you want to get some equipment, but something to keep in mind. Having a fitness routine improves your physical and mental health. At minimum, have some good walking/running shoes (for those who can walk/run) and a decent water bottle. Try to do something for at least 30 minutes a day. Joining a gym isn't necessary (and can be expensive) unless you want to use the machines.

FUN: High priority. A lot of places and opportunities will likely decline or shutter entirely in the future as they find themselves unable to stay open with increased material/labor prices. Enjoy them while you can.

Remember, we're trying to prepare, but that doesn't mean we have to be miserable!",9,1732627737.0,TwoXPreppers,2,1.0,False
1h0bt77,https://i.redd.it/gx14gon9z83e1.jpeg,Zarfs for Freedom: An Ode to the Boat Mug,"The coffee cups on a submarine are more than just cups, they’re companions. Thick, heavy, and almost indestructible, they’re built for life on the most lethal warship man has ever created, where everything serves multiple purposes. These cups don’t just hold coffee; they hold sanity, camaraderie, and, when necessary, serve as a weapon against both enemies and loneliness.

Fresh out of the sanitizing hot wash, the cup radiates warmth, like a reassuring squeeze from Mama San herself. You wrap your hands around it, feeling that comforting heat seep into your finger bones, pushing back the cold air of the boat. It doesn’t matter if it’s your favorite chipped mug or one you grabbed in a rush, once it’s in your hands, it’s yours, ready to be filled with happiness.

Because sometimes, that coffee cup is all that stands between you and madness. In the still, silent moments of the mid-watch, when the hum of the boat becomes a lullaby, it’s that warm, white mug filled with coffee, maybe hot, maybe just warm enough, that reminds you you’re not alone. It’s a lifeline, a tether to reality when the world outside is cold, black and crushing pressure.

And if things ever got ugly, let’s just say these cups are hefty enough to deliver a message.

On a submarine, nothing is wasted, not even the comfort of a coffee cup. It’s warmth, companionship, and a quiet strength that helps you get through the day, or the night, and maybe even the enemy, if it comes to that.

Once a submariner hears that thwarp topside, they can’t help but smile. It’s a sound that belongs to the moment, a little mischief echoing off the hull. Chiefs might feel differently, but it’s not about them. They’ve had their time. This one’s for the crew, a fleeting moment of freedom and a small gift to Poseidon.

That’s why there are probably more coffee mugs in the harbor right now than actually in the galley. Some mugs even carry legends, like the infamous 2 Nubs, 1 Cup story. 

But here’s the real question: what did you do with your mug? I still have mine. Do you?

1h0bspt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1h0bspt/a_long_dream_of_an_island_i_made_my_own/,A long Dream of an island I made my own,"**\[Part 1 - House\]** 

I open my eyes and awaken in the spare bedroom at my grandparents in the countryside. The sun glows warmly across my naked frame and I stretch like a cat, enjoying the moment of peace before dressing and walking down the corridor to the kitchen. At the table sits my dad, drinking a coffee and reading a paper. He sees me and closes the paper, folding it onto the table, before asking me whether or not I've decided to come to the cinema with him and my sister? I decline because my phone has no charge, so he gives me his and a charger and tells me to stay in touch.  

I return to the spare room and plug his phone in, sad to discover it's morphed from a smart phone into an old Nokia. I throw myself backwards onto the bed and consider my plan for the day. My dad’s phone rings and I ignore it because I don't want it to wake me, then again, and again. I sigh and roll onto my side seeing that the call is from my stepmum. I answer and explain to her that, no, my dad isn't there as I've got his phone. She says that's fine and we talk for a little while about some mundane things that have now escaped my memory.  

After the call I stand up and walk to the large bay window at the end of the room.  The view is out into the well-maintained grounds of my grandparent's house as normal, but beyond that is the tree line of a great forest.  I smile, raise a hand of magic to the window and step though, it gives about the same resistance as water as I pass through. 

**\[Part 2 - Island\]** 

Instead of the grounds and forest, I find myself on an island, the terrain here is wet and muddy, almost flat for as far as I can see. I kneel and release a handful of seeds that fall to the ground and plant themselves. I stand, knowing that one day this island will be beautiful again, then I sit cross-legged on the ground and place my palms before me, focusing on the soil and drawing in as much magic as I can. From the earth I draw up orbs of soil and magic and the begin shaping them into vaguely humanoid forms. My advisor, a strange robed and hooded man whose arms reach down to his ankles, tells me in a smooth, warming voice, that the first batch will be ready within the year. I smile again and close my eyes, continuing to push magic into the soil, ensuring that the humanoids will continue to grow.  

While I meditate on magic and new humans, the camera of my dream pulls back and I start placing buildings onto the land, housing, taverns, workshops and farms. I place a harbor on the shoreline and mines in the mountains, as if I'm suddenly playing a town building game. My advisor speaks again and informs me that the first batch is ready. 

Now the dream skips ahead for the first time, instead of the island being brown and desolate, it's become a verdant and grassy, the town is large and filled with people going about their jobs and children run through the fields, laughing and chasing what turns out to be small dragons. I join the chase, laughing at the thrill of chasing dragons that run and fly around us. Overhead, much larger dragons fly with riders on their backs, ensuring that no harm comes to their young.  

The dream skips ahead again, now I stand atop a tower looking out over the city at the center of the island. the city spreads out from the towner and castle below it, hundreds upon hundreds of white stone buildings and then a tall outer wall. Outside the walls, farmland spreads out as far as the eye can see. I step off the tower, dropping down to the streets below but ending up in a green grassy field again. I walk slowly towards a small dragon and pick it up, it nuzzles me and I stroke the top of its head, thinking about my next move.  

Strangely, my brother-in-law starts talking beside me and we walk to what seems to be an art gallery or exhibition center, before we reach it, we stop to chuckle about a rather scummy woman I know from my son's school (IRL). She stands in the field with a dog lead in her hand, furiously trying to get her dog/dragon to return to her. we laugh about a dragon not being a fucking pet and leave her to it, advancing through the luminescent doors of the gallery 

**\[Part 3 - Gallery\]** 

Inside the gallery the walls are made of glass and stretch up high above use into a dome that twists the light into strange fractured rainbows. The gallery is huge and the filled with strange statures and plants, some of which reach the dome above. We walk around admiring the exhibits. Some are obviously magic in nature while others are works of art. we walk to a side room, where a film is playing on a projector against a wall. The few people in this room have blurred faces painted with black and white runes and shapes. I look away instead of meeting their eyes, knowing that if I stare too long i will wake up form this dream. I say so to my brother-in-law and he tells me to stop trying to focus and let the dream take me instead. he places a hand on my shoulder and we leave the projector room, passing into a corridor with doors every few feet. The first door I open leads to a busy modern city, he shakes his head and pulls me away before I can step though. The second leads back to my fields, we step through and the dragon I've been holding all this time flies out of my arms and away.  

**\[Part 4 – The Hammer and the Tavern\]** 

From here I drift in and out of the edge of dreaming, trying desperately not to wake up. In response the world becomes vaguer and more blurred, as if the land is becoming liquid. I fall to my knees and begin to crawl, cursing the sky and refusing to wake up. The sky above cracks and roars in response, pulling me towards to peak of a hill. I shout at the sky begging it to give me the power to stay, in response a Nordic hammer falls before me and I pick it up. Immediately the world around me solidifies and I’m again in a verdant green field. Ahead of me is a small town, I muse that it’s possibly the one from earlier and I’ve returned to earlier in time. I shrug and sweep the hammer along the grass, pleased at its weight in my hand and how it seems to anchor me into the dream 

 Everything I touch with the tip of hammer's handle turns to gold, including the bracer of the assassin that tries to kill me as I enter the local tavern. I chuckle at the audacity and tell her she works for me now, right? She admires the gold bracer and agrees. I walk into the tavern, which is much more inside like a modern club and...  

My phone rings loudly, waking me, or at least it does in my dream. When I wake the first time, I can see myself lying on myside, in my own bed at home. “You look different” I say aloud to myself and chuckle. The eyes of the sleeper snap open, revealing them to be fully black, he lunges towards me and I finally awaken in a breathless, sweaty panic.

---

**Why Does Songwriting Feel Like Magic Sometimes (And Like Fighting a Dinosaur Other Times)?**

Let’s talk about songwriting—the mind-blowing, brain-breaking process of turning ideas, feelings, or even your groceries list into music people can *feel*. Some days, it flows like melted butter on a stack of pancakes, and on others? It’s like someone handed you a rubber pen and asked you to write War and Peace. So… why? What’s going on when the muse ghost-texts us back with nothing but the word ""typing""?

Here’s a thought that hit me at 2AM last night:  

Songwriting is less about making something perfect and more about *surrendering*. But surrender to what? That’s up to you:  
- A vibe, 
- A random hook rattling around in your brain,
- Or (let’s be real) that awkward overshare you made at a party because, hey, dramatic moments = songwriting gold.   

But here’s the kicker—it’s not just about you. Songs tap into things *people*—those beautiful, weird, emotional creatures called humans—just inherently GET. Ever write a line, look at it, and go, “Wait… do I actually know what I mean here?” Surprise—your subconscious probably does. Our job as songwriters is to dig around until that line gives us chills.  

### Practical Tips? Sure, I Got You:
1. **The Playground Principle**: Stop trying to ""write a hit"" or *whatever*. Just go play. Write a dumb song about your cat or an overly dramatic breakup song inspired by finishing the last pack of Oreos. Having fun keeps creativity alive.  
   
2. **Collaborate, Even if it’s with Future-You**: Past-you probably scribbled down that one juicy half-line in your notes app, right? Go hunt it down. Now combine it with a melody or project you’ve got. Boom: accidental song collab with yourself.  

3. **Turn ‘Writer’s Block’ into Writer’s Antenna**: Writer’s block isn’t failure—it’s your brain waving neon signs saying, *“Look at something else right now!”* Watch a random movie, read poetry, doodle weird shapes… the indirect route always fuels songwriting.  

4. **Drafts are Supposed to Suck**: No one wakes up and writes “Bohemian Rhapsody” from front to back (…probably). Give yourself permission to drop garbage ideas on paper because, shocker, *sometimes diamonds come from the trash bin*.  

### Emotions = Instrumentation  

Ever notice how sometimes the instruments carry half the ""heaviness"" of the song? Lyrics are crucial, yes, but seriously, don't underestimate how much vulnerability is packed into that one lone piano chord, that gritty guitar riff, or even the silence (don’t @ me, silence works wonders).  

Try this experiment: hum your melody against three *wildly different* chord progressions. You’ll find emotions you didn’t even think belonged to the vibe you were going for—happy accidents galore.  

### But Here’s the Deep Stuff I Keep Coming Back To:  

At its core, songwriting is about telling *truths*. YOUR truths, someone else’s, or even a made-up one that inexplicably feels real. It’s ironic, isn’t it? How something so personal can suddenly belong to everyone listening. Your song—the one you wrote in sweatpants eating Taco Bell at midnight—ends up stitched into someone else’s memories. It might catch them driving in their car alone, sipping a coffee, or bawling in their bedroom post-breakup.  

And for me? That’s what reminds me it’s worth the struggle. Every frustrated scribble, every punch-your-keyboard moment, every “Ugh, I hate every note of this” feeling leads into the weird, wordless human connection that music creates.   

### TL;DR:  

- Don’t try to force it. Write for fun.  
- Be messy. Surrender to the process.  
- Chase emotion through lyrics and sound equally.  
- Know that someone out there will hear your song and think, ""*How did they just write my entire life in 3 minutes?*""  

Alright, your turn. What’s your songwriting process like? Are you the notebook-hoarder needing caffeine to function, or do you sit at your instrument and channel the universe without warning? Or maybe... you’re somewhere in between like the rest of us. Let me know below! 🎶

1h0bp05,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1h0bp05/gauging_interest_mashups_madness/,Gauging interest: Mashups Madness,"Hi everyone!

It’s totally fine that the next stop is the last one of the tour, and I’m fine with it.

https://i.redd.it/x5kycs7kh83e1.gif

Just in case you’re equally as fine: a modest proposal.

For the Aftertimes.

This is a post to gauge interest and solicit some information from you (in the event of interest) about conducting a **March Madness-style “What is the gayest Eras Tour mashup?” bracket tournament** in the new year (i.e. after tour finishes and we have a complete list of mashups, and after the holiday season).

[A 3-minute explainer video for anyone unfamiliar with NCAA March Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLDb8sK95PE&ab_channel=MarchMadness)

[they're not about to get me for logo infringement](https://preview.redd.it/e18nsvloh83e1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae5ce6e5fb82f4b8a66058a76cc00a63ebc968ab)

This would be a **13-day** **vote-based tournament**. (I am what I am 'cause you trained me.)

I thought it might be a fun group activity for us as we'll sadly be losing our extremely fun show threads. Which, again—I am fine with.

https://i.redd.it/f03bl1bqh83e1.gif

We'd have a **Google Sheets master bracket** to track the winners. That sheet would be viewable, but not be editable by others. I'd set up a dedicated reddit account to run the tournament.

I am also envisioning creating a version of the Google Sheet you can save to **fill in your own bracket** before the competition starts. Just like March Madness.

(I've started working on the spreadsheets, designing for ease-of-use and prettiness, but if you are a Google Sheets whiz who knows any fancy bells and/or whistles to make the user experience better or more accessible, please let me know!)

**YOU TOO can be one of those people who goes on incessantly about Their Bracket:**

https://preview.redd.it/8hbbu28sh83e1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=35969fc2ba6b8337ab49f9fb8e89d32088b126ec

[this could be us](https://preview.redd.it/876lnstth83e1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73e556ba87375ee0f32ed88cec71982b955b433)

It is, famously, all but impossible to pick a perfect NCAA March Madness bracket. According to statisticians, the odds are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. The odds of picking a perfect March Madness bracket are lower than the odds of being struck by four bolts of lightning at once. So, about the same odds that we'll ever get *evermore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions*.

But what about the odds of picking a perfect ""Taylor Swift gay songs"" bracket?

The prizes?

https://i.redd.it/rl7qlevwh83e1.gif

https://i.redd.it/2q7uy2lyh83e1.gif

Seriously tho, the goal is just to see what we as a community think is the gayest mashup, for funsies. I accept no liability for bracket-buster dark-horse mashups that turn out to be gayer than we thought, according to the voting public.

# Tournament Structure

The tournament would start at **128 mashups, seeded by most to least apparent gayness, spread across 8 “Conferences.”**

Like a lightly-MacGyvered March Madness, the winning songs would progress through their Conference’s Sweet 16 round to Conference Quarterfinals, Conference Semifinals, and Conference Finals. The winner of each conference would emerge victorious to meet each other in the Playoffs (Elite 8; Final 4; Championship Match)

The 128-song limit would mean a few of the least evidently gay (and any duplicates) of Taylor’s \~138 total mashups will need to be dropped from the competition—but it’s just not practical to start with more than 128.

I’ve considered several options, and I think the simplest/clearest way to conduct the voting would be to keep it within reddit, and have **a voting thread for each day of the tournament.** I'd post and set up the comments so you can vote in each match-up. I think it would also be fun to have a **Mashups Madness megathread** for overall discussion over the duration of the contest.

These details need ironing out but: If the mods are agreeable, I believe they can set the daily voting threads to **“contest mode”** so that upvotes are hidden, and you won’t be able to see which songs are winning when you cast your votes. Ideally—but I would need to check if this is possible—the voting threads would also be locked so that no new comments could be added and everything would remain easy to see, but voting could still take place. 

The winner of each match-up would be the song with the most upvotes. (I'd ask people to only upvote each song they are voting for, and not downvote the other ones.)

This would obviously mean a new thread every day for about two weeks’ time (plus the discussion thread), but I'm hoping that would not be too-too intrusive for the folks who are not interested in participating, if we decide to go ahead?

Voting would be based on, obviously, your opinion and personal interpretation of each mashup, using whatever criteria you choose to apply to the question: **Which is gayer?**

[Maroon when it's inevitably part of the winning mashup?](https://i.redd.it/fyswg1x7e83e1.gif)

[It's Nice to Have Dorothea might have something to say about that. And will there be any upsets?](https://i.redd.it/cjhwxh6am83e1.gif)

For the first six days (Conference Sweet 16 and Conference Quarterfinals), you’d be asked to vote on **16 match-ups a day**, and then the number would get fewer as we progress through the competition. There is an option to design a longer tournament (17 or 21 days) with fewer match-ups per day after the very first rounds, but I know as a sub member you can get fatigue around daily threads like this if they drag on. Please say if you feel strongly that longer would be better, though.

The voting threads would be up for approximately **24 hours each**, perhaps subtracting the short amount of time I would need to get a coffee from the cafe downstairs and compile the winners into the next day’s thread.

And that's it—democracy in action. 

At the end, we may (nay, we WILL) be faced with a difficult choice between two very, extremely gay songs, but your vote is your voice. And when has that ever gone wrong?

https://preview.redd.it/9cvvprq2e83e1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=06023fe109ece14e62b041c95082aaf7b821c6b9

# Questions...? (for you)

So, my questions and thoughts for you folks are:

* Are you interested in something like this?
* If so, when would you prefer it to happen? (I was going to format this as a poll, but the poll-post type has some text limitations that won't work)
   * **JANUARY**: We live in a world of instant gratification and existential dread and tomorrow isn't promised—also I'm gonna need a distraction that month
   * **MARCH**: 'tis the damn season, innit 🏀 Plus 2-year anniversary of Eras kickoff 

**Seeding** a contest like this is always a fraught process. The very gayest and very least gay mashups might be quite evident and consistent across most of us, but the ones right in the middle will shift positions depending on who you ask. Knowing this community and its kindness, I’m hoping and assuming that I won’t get raked over the coals about (hopefully small) discrepancies that you might have with my exact seeding, however I know that a bit of discussion and bantz about it is an essential part of the March Madness experience. (And I don’t think it’s practical to do the entire seeding by popular vote.)

[I have anxiety](https://preview.redd.it/38mcv4rye83e1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=a38d36d306c85e1fe386a2da6c165677d8b1852b)

* Taking all that into account, in the interest of soliciting your expertise and opinions now: In the comments, let me know what you think the gayest mashups have been so far, after the ones that are the most obvious.

The types of songs that I reckon would be clear 1-seeds are like, It's Nice to Have Dorothea, Cornelia Street x Maroon, Hits Different x DBATC, TIWYCF x gold rush, Hits Different x Welcome to NY, Maroon x cowboy like me, mirrorball x Guilty as Sin?, this is me trying x Daylight, ivy x Call It What You Want... (See, there are actually too many of these types of songs, even just from a first glance, so some will become 2-seeds, and from there my seeding process will play out).

What songs would come after that batch, for you, as the next most gay we've seen... *so far?*

[Taycouver just lurking in the background like](https://preview.redd.it/cr4fiweas83e1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ce47cb22347bb686540944f5385d5d29d0cd39d)

My Google Sheet brackets will contain a full list of all the mashups/seedings, but if you want to refer to a list now while you're thinking, u/hereslookinatyoukid shared [the most amazing archive of mashups, transcripts, and YouTube links](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gwr0c2/mashup_transcripts/)

Pull out iPad.

New Step Mom called concerned about an earthquake last night. A large lower class family died and she wants to make sure we get a deposit in on their one bedroom apartment.

You don’t get an opportunity like this every day.

Take macbook out of backpack and go on Facebook. Find that girl from the bus…

Dammit. Blocked again.

Lyft home because I hear Uber isn’t woke these days.

No wait that’s my other roommate. Guess he called out sick too.

Due to autoimmune issues I can't handle aspartame well (or acesulfame k, which often goes with it), I tried going for months on diet soda's with various amounts which gave me 80% of the same inflammation issues I had before on regular soda (extreme brain fog, mood issues, energy issues,etc.), then just water and caffeine pills which completely cleared out all the issues in a few weeks with the same diet and then after a few months I reintroduced diet soda and the issues returned in those few weeks, but once again went away when I eliminated aspartame. I consume some electrolyte and vitamine supplements with other sweeteners like sucralose, but I don't seem to be affected by them at all.

Unfortunately diet soda's almost always contain aspartame, maybe I could try and find some with stevia or something, but I doubt I'd find them in smaller towns when traveling. 

Currently my go-to is basic caffeine pills with water, but I don't want to deal with border controls and they are also not something you can buy at any small local store in most places. I guess that leaves those premade coffee's or tea's?",1,1732626311.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False

My regular knows this but as soon as he sees there isn’t a line (or sometimes even when there is a customer or two), he’s like “here read this, I just wrote it”. Like bruh I’m busy!!! Also, I’m not a fan of poetry to begin with, but I try to be kind and read it and give him feedback, but how do I let him know that I don’t really want to read his poetry every time?

Side note: what also makes it hard is that he’s so generous, he regularly gifts the baristas gift cards to the bookstore, so I feel almost obligated to return the generosity by spending 2 minutes reading his work, ya know?

Anyway, please be kind with the responses, he probably doesn’t mean anything by it, and I’m not trying to be mean about him, but it can be frustrating because I feel like a lot of people don’t think we have ACTUAL shit to do “oh you just make coffee, can’t be that much work” kind of attitude.

Discover in-depth Java Burn reviews exploring its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential benefits for weight loss and overall health.

[weight management](https://preview.redd.it/4gcbe8ifu63e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc753aa35b954a1fc8f77f5b2568859e77994018)

# Introduction:

The quest for a weight-loss solution that feels effortless is a common one. Java Burn, a coffee additive promising metabolism-boosting and fat-burning properties, has piqued the interest of many looking to shed pounds.  

But does Java Burn truly live up to its claims? This comprehensive review dives deep into the product, analyzing its ingredients, potential benefits, and what actual users have to say about their experience.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powdered dietary supplement designed to be mixed into your daily cup of coffee. It claims to enhance your existing coffee ritual by amplifying its metabolism-boosting effects and promoting weight loss.  

# Key Features of Java Burn:

* Easy to incorporate - Simply add a packet to your morning coffee.  
* Natural ingredients - Formulated with plant-based extracts and essential nutrients.  
* Convenient - No need for additional pills or supplements.  
* Promotes healthy weight management - Supports weight loss and metabolism optimization.  

# Ingredients Breakdown:

* **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid plays a crucial role in transporting fatty acids to your body's energy production centers, potentially promoting fat burning.
* **L-Theanine:** Found in green tea, this amino acid is known for its relaxing properties, which can be beneficial for managing stress-related weight gain.  
* **Chromium:** This mineral helps regulate blood sugar levels, potentially curbing cravings and promoting satiety.  
* **Green Tea Extract:** A potent source of antioxidants and catechins, green tea extract has been linked to enhanced metabolism and increased fat burning.  
* **Chlorogenic Acid:** Found in coffee beans, this antioxidant may help slow down the absorption of sugar in the gut, contributing to weight management.

# How Does Java Burn Work?

Java Burn's supposed benefits stem from its blend of metabolism-supporting ingredients. Let's delve deeper into its potential modes of action:  

* **Increased Metabolic Rate:** Java Burn might promote thermogenesis, the process by which your body burns calories to generate heat. An elevated metabolic rate translates to more calories being burned throughout the day, even at rest.  
* **Improved Blood Sugar Control:** Chromium in Java Burn may regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, leading to fewer calorie intakes.  
* **Enhanced Fat Burning:** L-Carnitine in Java Burn could facilitate the transfer of fatty acids into your cells' energy-producing mitochondria, potentially promoting fat utilization as fuel.  
* **Stress Reduction:** L-Theanine in Java Burn may help combat stress hormones like cortisol, which can contribute to weight gain. By reducing stress, Java Burn might indirectly support weight management goals.  

# Potential Benefits of Java Burn:

* **Weight Loss:** Java Burn's primary focus is weight management. By potentially boosting metabolism and fat burning, it could support healthy weight loss efforts.  
* **Increased Energy Levels:** Improved metabolic efficiency could translate to higher energy levels throughout the day.  
* **Appetite Suppression:** By regulating blood sugar and promoting satiety, Java Burn might lead to reduced cravings and snacking.  
* **Improved Focus:** Theanine, an ingredient in Java Burn, is associated with enhanced cognitive function and focus.  

# Clinical Studies and Scientific Backing

While Java Burn's official website mentions ongoing research on its ingredients, the product itself hasn't been subjected to independent clinical trials to definitively prove its effectiveness for weight loss.

This lack of dedicated clinical research is a crucial point to consider, as it limits the ability to definitively confirm Java Burn's weight-management claims.

# What Do the Java Burn Reviews Say?

User experiences paint a somewhat mixed picture with Java Burn reviews. Here's a breakdown of some common themes:

# Positive Reviews:

Many users report experiencing increased energy levels and a feeling of overall well-being after incorporating Java Burn into their coffee routine. Some reviews even mention noticeable weight loss after consistent use.  

# Negative Reviews:

A recurring critique in some reviews highlights the lack of a significant taste difference when added to coffee. While the product claims to be tasteless, some users report a slight alteration in their coffee's flavor.

Additionally, some reviewers expressed frustration with the absence of guaranteed weight loss results. As with any dietary supplement, individual results can vary, and Java Burn is no exception.

# Independent Reviewers Weigh In:

Independent reviewers often emphasize the importance of a healthy diet and exercise for sustainable weight loss. While Java Burn might offer potential benefits, it's not a magic bullet solution.

It includes spray samples of: Coffee Tabac, Mint Cocoa, Christmas Wine, Gingerbread and Glühwein.

Coffee Tabac: on the sample strip this basically had no scent at all. On my skin though the scent definitely popped: coffee, tobacco, warm leather and old wood. It smells like getting a cup of coffee to go with your paper at a Victorian gentleman's club. For anyone who wants to smell like an aristocratic gentleman from a period drama.

Mint Cocoa: I had already received a sample of this one so already new I liked it. The cocoa really stands out in this one tempered by the scents of wood and smoke and a little bit of spice. It smells like eating chocolate cookies next to the wood stove in the warm kitchen of a little cottage on a snowy day. 

Christmas Wine: This was the sample I was most excited to try. On the sample strip and when I first applied it to my skin it smelled exactly like what I wanted it too: warm spices and rich dark fruit with just enough smokiness to make the other notes stand out. Exactly like drinking a glass of hot spiced wine in front of the fire. However after an hour or so it dries down to a very generic ""woodsy"" scent without any of the spices or fruit notes at all. If it had kept smelling like it did when it was first applied this would have been my go to Holiday scent. 

Gingerbread: I am not a gormound fan so I wasn't expecting much from this scent. On the testing strip it smelled like pure vanilla and not much else. On my skin though it was a completely different story. All the warm Christmas spices mixed with old wood, smoke, fresh for trees and just a hint of sweet vanilla. Like drinking a big cup of the most delicious spiced tea and watching the snow fall outside while your snuggled up and warm in our little woodland cottage. This was also the longest lasting scent enrobing me in spicy goodness the entire day.

Glühwein: on the test strip this smelled like cloyingly sweet cherries. On my skin it also smelled like cherries and not much else. This was my least favorite of the set. ",1,1732626026.0,indieperfume,0,1.0,False

Half a year ago, he went to a country 6 hours away by flight to where I lived at the time, and we initially played with the idea that I come to visit him. However, I did not have the money. I am a student and was on an unpaid internship at the time, which demanded that I be at work during his holiday. I understand that he was excited to finally meet and thus really disappointed when it did not work out, but I tried to make it work. In truth, I was also afraid that if we met, I might not be what he expected, which is stupid as he knows how I look like ans still I really tried to make it work. When I broke the news, he said,"" Maybe it's not meant to be this time."" That really struck me, and I almost feel that that was the point at which he made a decision. After that, we didn't talk for a bit, which is not uncommon, but when we do, it's all back to normal. We have also been in relatively frequent contact, he even gave me a cute summary of his trip every day. Up until one or two months ago everythign was fine, when he stopped responding. I called him the last couple of days and have not heard back; after not answering me for some time, he planned a call for today. However, I felt he did not enjoy it, and if it was more of a chore, he had to tick it off. It was a really awkward phone call, and it felt like we didn't know what to do or talk about.

 Our lifestyles are very different over the years, especially since we were both adults. He likes to party and date a lot; I am, also due to my degree, always busy working and tend to go to dinner or coffee with my friends. We were incredibly close for most of the time since we have known each other, but now it seems that I am the one mostly starting the conversations and that it is a burden for him.  I really like him, and I am so grateful to have him as a friend. I don't want to lose him. 

I want a second opinion; maybe I am making stuff up in my head; it's finals, and I have not slept in a while, so that could also influence my thoughts. After my graduation, I initially planned to visit him if he wanted and set money aside, but maybe he wants something else, and I am dwelling in the past.

Snacks ng mga colleagues nya, ramen, kahit iharap harapan namin sya sabihan di pa rin sya natitinag. To the point na pagbabayarin ka nya ng pagkain nya (fishcake), di na lang makakatanggi yung nagbayad eh. Akala ata biro pa ang lahat.

Heto ang worst. 

One time nanlibre sya bday treat kasama buong batch namin. Like kalahati ng bill sya nagbayad.
Then here is a scenario na nagaya ng ramen isa nya colleague. Inooblige nya ilibre sya para daw sumama sya. Haha eto pa that time kakapasok lang ng increase sa sahod so lahat may pera talaga. So clear as ice. Nag-no ung colleague nya. Tumawad pa haha kalahati na lamg daw bayaran nya. Samakatwid di natuloy ramen. So simpleng dinner na lang. Dalawa sila natuloy sa chowking tapos biglang may sumunod kasama nya si Mr. Buraot. Nagpaorder sila sa chowking. So  kasama ni Mr.B nagbayad ng kinain nya. So akala ng ni ate girl na nagpaluwal eh paluwal lang. Ganun naman diba. Tapos nagpick up coffee pa sila. Ganun ulit. Nagpaorder tapos bigla CR sya. Pinaluwalan ulit. Kinabukasan natuloy ang ramenan. Ganun ulit siste sa orderan bigla magCCR. This time wala nagpaluwal sa knya. Di sya umorder ng ramen binili nya shawarma. Ung dalawa colleague nya hati sa ramen at volcano maki since un lagi kinakain nila. Ayun nakiburaot. Ang ending tatlo silang naghati sa ramen at volcano maki. Mas marami pa nga sya nakain haha. Kahit pinagsasabihan n naman sya sa kakapalan ng mukha nya di pa din sya natitinag.

So si ate girl na nagpaluwal sa mga kinain nya na at the very beginning clear na walang librehan, nagmessage sa messenger reminding sa chowking at pick up coffee. Ang sagot ni Mr.B, di nya daw nababasa box box lang daw nakikita. So kinabukasan inulit ni ate girl ung nakain nya. Ganun ulit sagot box box daw. Meaning ata box for gift. Kapal talaga. Then si ate girl naglista ng may sukli sya may utang sa knya at utang nya sa group. So nilista nya kinain ni Mr.B. Hulaan nyo sagot.

Sa kapal nya. Sagot nya.

Bayaran din daw ni ate girl ung pinagbday treat nya. May margin pa sinisingil. Kapalmuks talaga. So si ate girl binratatat sya. Hanggang sa ending si Mr.B ang pavictim na binabackstab sya at kung kanikanino daw knwento haha. Malamang, minessage na sya personal siningil at nilista sa grup, pinned message. Ano gagawin ni ate girl haha inask nya opinion ng kabatch nila. 

Haha ang ending sya na victim binakstab daw sya. Sira daw image nya. Lol sabi pa daw eh lumabas daw character ni ate girl dahil sa away. Atleast lumabas din pagkaburaot at laging palibre nya. Kapalmuks ma buraot. Mukhang palibre. Naniningil ng bday treat nya haha

I know this is going to make me look and sound like a total piece of shit, but I am going to share it anyway because I can’t really tell anybody in my friend circle because they all know each other, so its just something I have kept inside for the past 12 years. 

About 12 years ago, I started a new job. I had already worked for the company for about 7 years, and the job was the same, but it was in a different location due to a quality-of-life move I had recently made. I joined the technical support team as a mid-high tier mentor, so I had to quickly develop relationships with my team members because I often had to help them learn and grow. 

Everyone on the team I was able to connect and get along with, except for one person named Isabel. While she wasn’t particularly rude to me, she never shared personal details about her life with me. Instead, she always asked direct questions about work, how she could improve, or if she needed help, but whenever I tried to be friendly, she avoided the conversation or gave me a sharp “no thanks.” Her responses were always one-sided and didn’t leave room for further interaction. I kept my distance because I didn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable or create conflict. As a result, all our conversations remained professional, and I tried to put it all behind me. 

About three months into my new job, I began getting closer to one of the leaders in the business. One day, he casually mentioned Isabel. I told him that she and I had no relationship and that I had tried to reach out to her, but I had struggled to get through. He shared that she was a single mother going through a divorce with a military husband who had cheated on her shortly after they got married. He described her husband as verbally abusive, constantly criticizing her appearance and generally destroying her self-esteem during their relationship. I am really not sure where he got this information, and while I thought it was inappropriate for him to she very personal details of her life with me, I thought maybe this just meant I knew how to more delicately cultivate our relationship. 

She was clearly dealing with an abusive relationship, and at work, she was just trying to get through her days. I genuinely sympathized with her because I had experienced a similar situation when I was growing up. My father would regularly skip coming home after work to avoid spending time with our family. My mother had to raise her children alone and eventually divorced him because of his passive and uninvolved nature. Watching a woman and her son go through virtually the same thing that I experienced growing up, I felt a deep connection to her. 

I took a different approach at work. I made an effort to give positive recognition whenever possible. I could listen to her interactions with clients and offered constructive feedback to help her grow in her role. I noticed her quality of work started to improve; she was performing far beyond her peers. It wasn’t my decision to promote her, but she was learning faster than any of the other technicians on the team and had a much better work ethic. It wasn’t until a few weeks of this that she started opening up to me. Eventually, she shared everything because she trusted me and felt that I would offer support when she needed it. We quickly became friends after this.

As time went along, I saw her bloom and show more promise in the work place, she showed interest in my role and had a desire to take on more work load and responsibility, and while I had no say in making decisions around who got promoted, I also had the best numbers on the team and was considered a mentor in my role, so when management would come to me and say “how do you feel about X on your team” it basically meant “hey man, your input matters here.”  

Isabela went from “struggling to make quota” to “rockstar in her role” in a 6 month period of time, so when I needed another person on my team, I pointed my finger at her and said “I think she’s performing far above and beyond any other team member and should be promoted before anybody else.” 

Isabela joined my team shortly after this.

Life was only getting better as time went along, I loved coming into work because the team I was cultivating was performing where we were breaking records quarterly, I loved the people I worked with, my job was going very well, I was making new friends at work and most notably I had a new colleague and friend at work that I really could connect with. 

Work was going well for me, and the opportunity came up to get into a “grow into yours” type of leadership position, the long and short of this was that you worked in the role that you wanted and were recognized in that role for a short period of time (usually around 6 months), at the end of 6 months your performance was assessed and they decided whether or not you would get promoted or continue in your old role. This opportunity was offered to me, which I accepted, and started getting trained in it. 

Isabela, who was also being groomed for this opportunity, discovered that our supervisor had ulterior motives beyond her work performance.

Shortly after her boss started making advances, Isabela was offered a job at a competitor that offered higher pay, better benefits, and less sexual harassment. Honestly, I was devastated after this happened. I genuinely enjoyed working with her, her positive energy, and her efforts to make work more enjoyable, but I completely understand why she would have left given what her supervisor was trying to pull. 

About four weeks after Isabela quit, she reached out and asked to meet with me so we could catch up. We had lunch at a small dinner in Detroit, and she shared some very heavy things with me. Notably, she revealed that she was grappling with severe depression when we first met due to her failed marriage. Her father’s son refused to acknowledge her son’s existence, and her father had essentially disowned her because her mentally unstable mother considered Isabela a disappointment for having a child out of wedlock. 

We had known each other for about eight years by then. It turned out that we lived quite close to each other, literally within walking distance. I would often walk my dog past her home, and she would do the same past mine. Our relationship gradually evolved from professional to more personal. I also discovered that she had been disowned by her entire family for her entire life. It seemed that the more she achieved in life, the more unhappy her mother became of her, regardless of her success. Eventually, she decided to cut her family out of her life and had no one to turn to during holidays.

This is where things start to get complicated. 

Throughout my career, I’ve been in a long-term relationship with a woman I believed I loved. However, as I grew older, I realized that my understanding of love had evolved, leading me to redefine what I considered a loving partner.

From my early adulthood until my late 30s, I was in a relationship with the same woman. I adored and deeply cared for her. However, I didn’t perceive any significant issues in our relationship until we were about 10 years into it. The underlying problem was emotional abuse from her father during her childhood. This abuse significantly hindered her development from adolescence to adulthood, and I didn’t realize the extent of it until after we had both moved in together and started building our own careers. 

She began experiencing mental health issues primarily affecting her relationship with her father, which also strained our relationship. She started treating me like her father because I was an “older male figure” (only about 5 years older).

Sex became very infrequent. She started attending therapy more often and began working through childhood issues and unresolved wounds. I am very proud of her during this time. However, the lack of sex as a mid-30s male started to severely diminish my self-confidence. Women didn’t hit on me anywhere I went, and I wasn’t getting any positive reinforcement at home. Pornography never fulfilled my needs either, so I began to feel depressed. I no longer felt attractive, and I couldn’t guilt my spouse into sex. Clearly, it was something she had no interest in, given the emotional trauma she was processing with her therapist.

Because I had a lot of free time, and Isabela occasionally texted me to check on my family, we began grabbing coffee or lunch together since our work schedules allowed it. At least we had some quality time together again. I could vent about work-related and personal issues I was facing with her, and she was incredibly supportive of everything I was struggling with. Then, something else started to happen…

I started having sexual dreams about Isabela. 

I have absolutely no idea what triggered it. Maybe it was when she leaned in to whisper a secret close to my ear and brushed her breast against my chest. Or perhaps it was when she held my hand and looked into my eyes, expressing her distress about something her son’s father had done. In both instances, I felt a surge of anger and a desire to confront the man and throw a rock at his face.

This strange behavior began about five years ago. Now, I have dreams about her every single night. Some dreams involve us spending time together on my property at a small private lake, having campfires and sharing stories. Other times, they are deeply intimate moments that I wake up from and find myself unable to fall back asleep because of their vividness.

I am fully aware that my feelings for her are undeniable. I have had dreams about spending my life with her for years now. However, the woman I am currently with is not capable of supporting herself. She has been dealt a difficult hand by her complacent parents, whom she did not deserve. Therefore, I feel obligated to continue my relationship with her because I have already committed to her. Leaving her would mean making her homeless, and I still love her. I cannot bring myself to be selfish enough to sever this relationship with a woman I care about, just so I can experience what it feels like to be with the woman I truly love.

Isabela and I remain friends, and I am certain she has completely moved on from any possibility of a romantic relationship. I know she absolutely will not do anything to compromise  the relationship I am in, and I have made no advances at her to suggest my deep burning love for her, at least we get to be friends, and at least I get to know her for the rest of my life.",1,1732625259.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The first date, he was super sweet! He brought me flowers, opened the door for me, took me to a nice dinner. I genuinely enjoyed him and we’ve been going back and fourth- taking turns for date night since.

Last night I had him over and he kinda just started insulting me and really irritating me. He wasn’t being sweet anymore, he’s just sucking down my weed and walking around my house while I cook for him. Saying things like he’s going to chase me and tickle me until I cry- even though I’ve asked him probably 5-6x not to. Have told him I don’t think it’s funny and I don’t want him touching me like that. He said my cats don’t love me and he’s going to steal them. They are my children and my girl cat was only freaked out because he’s so loud. He kept screaming while I was trying to do training with them then, made fun of me when they wouldn’t listen. Not cute. There were a few other jabs made/ I felt like I spent the whole night asking him, “please, don’t do that. Please, don’t say that again.” Repeatedly and he wouldn’t stop.

Then he gets really close like he’s expecting sex and I’m irritated so defs don’t want it. He pouted and kept me up for hours on a work night, trying to convince me to. He also has to wake up at 5am. I wake up at 7:30. This morning, he just flipped all the lights on and started the coffee grinder even though I pre made him coffee so he wouldn’t wake me up. Also, not cute. I just spent hours cooking and cleaning for you, I have to sleep for work. 

I feel that he’s changed his attitude towards me and I’m not sure why. Not sure if I’m being overly dramatic/sensitive but I just don’t feel like I should have to say “no” repeatedly. He’s becoming a drain instead of a well.

1h0ao32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h0ao32/aitah_for_switching_shifts_to_avoid_my_coworker/,AITAH for switching shifts to avoid my coworker,"So as the title says I (20F) am switching from day shift to night shift to avoid not one but two or my coworkers. I work in a dish room for reference. When I first started up until about a week ago I was working with one coworker and we were the only two back there. She was very pushy but I didn’t take it to heart. She just liked things done her way. Whatever. I could live with it. I did what I could and worked around her pushing through me to do it herself despite the fact that I was doing it the exact same way she was trying to do it. 

Until she started tracking my bathroom breaks. I don’t get bathroom breaks for the second half of my 8 hour shift so I basically chug all of the coffee and water I would normally drink in a day within the first 4 hours of my shift. So I would go to the bathroom maybe once every hour.

I caught her with a stop watch up on her phone a list of times from me being in the bathroom. Which is creepy. She then started tracking the number of times I would go and the exact time it was. She also was tracking how much fluid I was drinking and then complaining about it to my boss. Now to me that’s creepy. She was constantly asking me about it to the point it was borderline harassment. I only used the restroom 4 times a day on average. And that was even with my medical issues that have made it more frequent lately.

I talked to my boss about it and she said it was out of line for her to track me and moved her to another station to work. She put my new coworker in the dish room that same day, about a week ago. She was new and hadn’t been in this position before so I had her start on the easier task because we divide our job into positions then help each other when we get the chance. 

This is where me potentially being an asshole comes in. I come in a half hour before she does. I start working on my position for the day, starting the dishwasher, and cleaning up after the night crew who doesn’t clean up after themselves. This all takes about the full half hour. My coworker comes in and immediately has an attitude about the dishes piled up at her station. I brush it off because she’s new. that’s how it always is. It’s a dish room there’s gonna be dishes.

She spends most of the morning walking off and disappearing for 10-15 minutes at a time. So I assume she’s fine if she was stressed she wouldn’t be leaving to go talk to her coworkers. I help her as much as I can and at one point do an entire cart of her dishes. Fast forward to her break time I’m sorting silverware when one of the salad bar employees tells me I have a “pile” of plates on the conveyor belt. I let her know I’m keeping an eye on it and there are only 4 plates. I thought they were moved out of view but I need to finish silverware before I need to change my gloves again as I’m running out of gloves. This isn’t exact word for word but I wasn’t in any sense rude.

This employee then goes and tells my new coworker that I had an attitude with her. I don’t know any of this is happening I am unaware and just trying sort silverware. My supervisor then comes and tells me she’s had complaints about me all day. I’m confused as to why but she tells me I did nothing all day, my coworker had to come in and finish a stack of dishes while I sat on my phone, and that I told my coworker it’s “not my job” to help her.

Now today I have to go talk to my boss about bullshit I never started. Never once did I say it isn’t my job to help her. I was doing things all morning that she doesn’t even know how to do. And not only that but if she was so stressed out why was she walking away to go text people and talk to coworkers? ATAH? I basically just walked yall through my day so let me know. t this point im fed up enough to quit. Im just trying to do my job and this type of shit is driving me crazy.",9,1732623989.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

I ordered in through Iherb as I'm in Germany and it was 13 euros per 300g pack which was fine. Now Iherb stopped selling it in Germany because of high taxes and transport cost and the prices on amazon for it is 35 euros for 300g pack which is ridiculus.

Any suggestions what to replace it with which is available for buying in Europe/Germany?

#Chapter10

The three of us got out of Sam's car and headed towards the front door. When Natalie opened the door, the base of the music hit us full force.

The ground was shaking with the thumping of the bass and I could literally see a few pieces of furniture vibrating on their spots on the ground, but I don't think anyone minded going deaf at such a young age because everyone was already dancing like crazy.

Bodies were grinding against each other. Red cups were littered everywhere. Zombie-like people were lying on the couches and floor, passed out from intoxication, and it was not even 10 o'clock.

Samantha grabbed my hand and started leading me towards the kitchen. How she knew where the kitchen was, I had absolutely no clue! As we walked, I could sense several pairs of eyes following us and checking us out. Some even wolf whistled at us. I blushed at the attention.

When we made it to the kitchen, Natalie handed me a beer bottle and we downed our first drinks of the night.

My eyes roamed the entire place for a certain person who invited me to this party but he was nowhere to be found. Slightly disappointed, I grabbed another drink and finished it in a few seconds.

Natalie grabbed our hands and led us to the makeshift dance floor. She was the wildest and the spontaneous person of our group.
I didn't have the heart to tell her that I really wanted to roam the place and check out where Harper was.

Hiding my disappointment at not meeting Harper yet, I tried to at least enjoy the party. I moved my hips to the rhythm of the music. Swedish House Mafia was on and the crowd went wild and started jumping and dancing with more vigor.

I was having so much fun that I almost forgot about Harper. Almost.

After about an hour of dancing, I yelled in Natalie's ear that I was going to the kitchen to get another drink. She just nodded and went back to her seductive dancing.

I made my way towards the kitchen with much more difficulty than I had experienced earlier. It looked like more people joined the party and even more of them were passed out, as if this was their own house. There was barely any space to move.

The kitchen was relatively quieter and the music was muffled.

I grabbed a beer and drank a few sips. I found myself alone in the kitchen with empty beer bottles and a lot of trash and I was thankful for some silence because I could finally hear my own thoughts.

Just then, Aiden Knight entered the kitchen. Aiden Knight was Harper's best friend. He was insanely good looking and was a player too.
 
Why are good looking guys all players? So damn unfair. With sandy blonde hair and brown eyes, girls fell to his feet and worshipped him but he wasn't exactly like Harper. He at least treated girls with respect and had the decency to offer them a cup of coffee after he kicked them out after a one night stand. But nonetheless, he too, used girls to get whatever he wanted which were mostly sexual favors. As far as I know, he too never had a girlfriend, just some casual flings.

Now, as I think about it, I have always been in the same school with the same people for so many years and have never once talked to them.
Aiden smirked and winked at me.

""So, Zara, right?""

He knew my name was Zara, which was new. I was like a wallflower. I had absolutely no intention of coming in the spotlight and being the topic of everyone's interest. He was just trying to make conversation, I reminded myself. Let's see, do I help him or act like a bitch?

I just nodded.

He leaned against the counter, at a respectable distance, his whole body facing me. ""So, are you enjoying the party?""
I smiled. ""Yeah"" and held my red cup upwards in the universal sign of ""cheers"".

He abruptly stood up and covered the distance between us in two short strides. Somehow, I just knew that he didn't want anything to do with me. Anything romantic or sexual, I mean. I didn't get turned on by our proximity at all. Unlike with Harper.

He just leaned forward and whispered softly, ""If you're looking for Harper, he is on the first floor. On the balcony. The last door on the left side.""

He leaned back, winked at me and then left me speechless.

That was random. I have a doubt it was random at all!

Great, now I am going crazy too!
How could he have known I was looking for Harper? It was not like I have looked for him at other parties before! Or maybe, he just thought I was another one of his hookups who cling to him for a relationship and would be satisfied with a quickie instead. I scoffed at the thought.

I finished my beer and placed the empty bottle on the counter and headed towards the staircase. I followed Aiden's directions and reached the first floor.

I turned left and kept walking straight till I felt the soft breeze of the wind which could only come from the open doors of a balcony.

The sliding glass doors of the balcony were open. The curtains that covered the doors were fluttering in the breeze.

I reached the glass doors, grabbed the curtains and moved them to look out onto the balcony and there he was. Harper.

The only problem was, he wasn't alone.
In his arms, there was a girl. I couldn't figure out who she was, though. But that detail was irrelevant. What matters was, that they were both making out, quite passionately so.

I was just rooted to my spot. I didn't know what to do, because out of all the scenarios I prepared myself for, I didn't think about this one. My heart plummeted to the ground and I felt sick.

I was looking for *anything* that would keep me from eating instant noodles straight from the packet when my actual stove decided to ghost me. And honestly? This little burner has been a surprising MVP.

# The Good Stuff:

1. **Heat Distribution That’s Actually Decent:** I made scrambled eggs on the smaller burner (hey, I was feeling fancy), and they cooked evenly. No weird half-raw, half-burnt monstrosity that makes you question your life choices.
2. **Compact but Mighty:** It’s not winning any beauty contests, but this thing is sturdy. I live in a tiny apartment, so space is a hot commodity. This burner fits perfectly on my counter, right next to my questionable coffee maker.
3. **Perfect for My Experimental Cooking Adventures:** You know those TikTok recipes that make you think, *“Why not? I could totally make that.”* Well, I tried making caramel on the larger burner, and while I slightly overdid it (note to self: do NOT multitask with caramel), the burner powered through like a champ.

# The Not-So-Good Stuff:

1. **The Burner's Patience is Not Infinite:** If you crank it to high, it gets HOT. Like, ""will-singe-your-soul-if-you-touch-it"" hot. My roommate learned that the hard way when she accidentally brushed her hand against it. (She's fine, but now she approaches it like it's a feral raccoon.)
2. **Takes a Bit to Cool Down:** This thing holds heat like it’s saving it for winter. After I turned it off, it stayed warm for longer than I expected. Great for keeping food warm, not so great for my counter.

# Real-Life Test Drive:

Here’s where the humor comes in: one night, I decided to make grilled cheese. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. I miscalculated the heat (again, do not crank it to max unless you’re prepared for *war*), and my sandwich went from golden brown to “is this charcoal?” in about 0.2 seconds. Lesson learned: this burner doesn’t mess around. But hey, at least it’s fast!

# Verdict:

If you’re in the market for the **best electric stove** (or at least a temporary replacement), the Elite Gourmet Countertop Double Cast Iron Burner is a solid contender. It’s not perfect, but it’s reliable, affordable, and pretty tough for its size. Just… maybe keep a fire extinguisher nearby if you’re prone to kitchen chaos like me.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Would I trust myself to make caramel on it again? Probably not. But that’s a *me* problem. 😅Okay, let’s get one thing straight: I wasn’t looking for “the best electric stove” when I bought the Elite Gourmet Countertop Double Cast Iron Burner.

1h0aid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1h0aid1/review_buckwheat_pillows_the_best/,[Review] Buckwheat Pillows The BEST,"Okay, so let me start by saying I was *skeptical* about buckwheat pillows. Like, **seriously, buckwheat?** Aren’t those the weird grains in some gluten-free pancakes? But after dealing with neck pain and sleep that felt more like a wrestling match, I caved and bought the [Beans72 Organic Buckwheat Pillow](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh)**.** Here’s the scoop:

# First Impressions:

When it arrived, the box was heavier than expected. For a moment, I thought Amazon accidentally sent me a sack of rice. The pillow itself? Not exactly a ""fluffy cloud"" vibe. It’s firm and kind of… crinkly. But I like to give things a fair shot (plus, I already spent the money), so I swapped out my old pillow that night.

# The First Night:

It was WEIRD. The pillow makes this slight rustling sound when you move it, but it’s not annoying—it’s kind of like white noise for minimalists. It also doesn’t sink like a traditional pillow. Instead, you can smoosh the buckwheat hulls around to create the exact shape you want. My neck felt *oddly supported*, like I had a personal chiropractor chilling under my head.

**BTW I Got Mine For REALLLYYY Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh)

# Real-Life Example:

Fast forward to a week later: I’m on a Zoom call with my coworker, who *never* notices anything, and he says, ""You look really well-rested. Did you go on vacation?"" Nope, pal, just found the pillow equivalent of a supportive life coach.

Also, here’s the kicker—I accidentally spilled coffee on it (because I have the coordination of a baby giraffe), and since the buckwheat hulls are in a zippered case, I just removed them, washed the cover, and we were back in business. Try doing that with memory foam!

# What I Loved:

* **Customizable comfort**: You can remove or add buckwheat hulls to get the firmness just right.
* **Natural cooling**: No more flipping the pillow 500 times to find the ""cool side."" It’s always cool, like James Dean in pillow form.
* **Relief from neck pain**: Legit, my neck hasn't felt this good since before I started binge-watching Netflix in awkward positions.

# What Might Not Be for Everyone:

* The weight. It’s not a big deal for sleeping, but if you’re someone who tosses their pillow around, prepare to get a mini arm workout.
* The rustling sound. I find it soothing, but if you’re sensitive to sounds, it might take some getting used to.
* It’s not *soft-soft.* If you’re into squishy marshmallow vibes, this isn’t for you.

# Final Thoughts:

I’m officially a buckwheat pillow convert. The [Beans72 Organic Buckwheat Pillow](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh) has made me sleep better, stopped my neck pain, and even earned me unsolicited compliments on my appearance. Who knew buckwheat could do all that?

Now, I just need to resist the urge to tell *everyone* about my pillow like I’ve joined some weird buckwheat cult. Highly recommend giving it a try!",1,1732623434.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False

Among other examples, Tesla's private 5G implementation on the shop floor
of its Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg plant has helped in overcoming up to
90 percent of the overcycle issues in the factory's GA (General Assembly)
shop; aluminum die-castings supplier IKD has replaced 6 miles of cables
connecting 600 pieces of machinery with a private 5G network; the EWG
(East-West Gate) Intermodal Terminal's private 5G network has increased
productivity from 23-25 containers per hour to 32-35 per hour and reduced
the facility's personnel-related operating expenses by 40 percent; NEC
Corporation has improved production efficiency by 30 percent through the
introduction of a local 5G-enabled autonomous transport system for
intralogistics at its Kakegawa factory; and JD Logistics has reduced the
likelihood of connection timeouts by an impressive 70 percent since
migrating AGV communications from unlicensed Wi-Fi systems to private 5G
networks at its logistics parks.

Some of the most technically advanced features of 5G Advanced – 5G's next
evolutionarily phase – are also being trialed over private wireless
installations. For example, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor is using an
indoor 5G Advanced network for time-critical industrial control within a
car roof production line as part of an effort to prevent wire abrasion in
mobile application scenarios, which results in production interruptions
with an average downtime of 60 hours a year.

To capitalize on the long-term potential of private 5G, a number of new
alternative suppliers have also developed 5G infrastructure offerings
tailored to the specific needs of industrial applications. For example,
satellite communications company Globalstar has launched a 3GPP Release
16-compliant multipoint terrestrial RAN system that is optimized for dense
private wireless deployments in Industry 4.0 automation environments while
German engineering conglomerate Siemens has developed an in-house private
5G network solution for use at its own plants as well as those of
industrial customers.

SNS Telecom & IT estimates that annual investments in private 5G networks
for vertical industries will grow at a CAGR of approximately 42% between
2024 and 2027, eventually accounting for nearly $3.5 Billion by the end of
2027. Although much of this growth will be driven by highly localized 5G
networks covering geographically limited areas for Industry 4.0
applications in manufacturing and process industries, sub-1 GHz wide area
critical communications networks for public safety, utilities and railway
communications are also anticipated to begin their transition from LTE,
GSM-R and other legacy narrowband technologies to 5G towards the latter
half of the forecast period, as 5G Advanced becomes a commercial reality.
Among other features for mission-critical networks, 3GPP Release 18 – which
defines the first set of 5G Advanced specifications – adds support for 5G
NR equipment operating in dedicated spectrum with less than 5 MHz of
bandwidth, paving the way for private 5G networks operating in sub-500 MHz,
700 MHz, 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands for public safety broadband, smart grid
modernization and FRMCS (Future Railway Mobile Communication System).

The “[2]Private 5G Networks: 2024 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges,
Strategies & Forecasts” report presents an in-depth assessment of the
private 5G network ecosystem, including the value chain, market drivers,
barriers to uptake, enabling technologies, operational and business models,
vertical industries, application scenarios, key trends, future roadmap,
standardization, spectrum availability and allocation, regulatory
landscape, case studies, ecosystem player profiles and strategies. The
report also presents global and regional market size forecasts from 2024 to
2030. The forecasts cover three infrastructure submarkets, two technology
generations, 16 vertical industries and five regional markets.

The report comes with an associated Excel datasheet suite covering
quantitative data from all numeric forecasts presented in the report, as
well as a database of over 7,300 global private cellular engagements –
including more than 2,700 private 5G installations – as of Q4’2024.

","I've recently called an internet man out to fix my internet, it's buggered and he solved it. he had a van and he parked on my driveway even thought there was enough space on the road. 

i don't mind it as long as they can park correctly. 

how would you feel if they parked on your driveway 

EDIT: the parking thing was a joke like 'oh i hope you can park haha) i don't mind. IT WAS JUST A QUESTION i don't have any issues so delete your nasty comments 

EDIT 2: i would just like to say ill happily offer tea, coffee, food anything they might need, i saw a local post on fb about someone complaining about this topic and wanted your opinion ",0,1732623281.0,AskUK,54,0.04,False
