1kjuaek,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kjuaek/sometimes_i_wake_up_and_forget_for_a_few_seconds/,Sometimes I wake up and forget for a few seconds that I'm not walking anymore.,"There are mornings when I wake up and, for a couple of seconds, my brain still hasn't clicked. I feel the sheets tangled, I hear the birds outside or the noise of the neighbor turning on the coffee maker, and my body thinks it can get up. It's automatic. Like when you go to scratch a leg that you no longer feel. Or like when someone who died still appears in your dreams.

And then I remember. And it doesn't hurt physically, that's not it. It's deeper. It's like a dull, viscous sadness that sticks to your soul before you can fully wake up. Sometimes I stay there, still, looking at the ceiling, feeling like a kind of echo of myself.

I miss things I never thought I would miss: standing in the shower, running up a flight of stairs because I'm late, putting on socks without it being a ridiculous effort. I miss having the option.

And I don't write this to be told I'm strong. I'm tired of being strong. I just wanted to get it off my chest.",1,1746944087.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

First, I'd like to personally say a big thank you to u/cxsmo_king – Cosmo – for starting the initiative of bringing the idea of a 40k giveaway to the table and organising so much. He's one of the admins here and does a lot to help the team behind the scenes. I've personally been busy/unwell recently, and therefore haven't had much time for planning large things. Despite me being the one to write the post, the giveaway itself would not have been possible without him. Again, thank you so much, Cosmo.

As you might recall on our [40k Member Celebration Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMeRBX/comments/1k8sifu/ᯓ_୨_radoptmerbx_has_hit_40000_members_୧_ᯓ/), we brought up the idea of hosting a giveaway from the team to you all – and here it is! We highly appreciate your patience despite how long this has taken us. Thank you all so much for 40k once again, we, the mod team, truly appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts.

You've made the community enjoyable to participate in and moderate for despite all the (often harsh) difficulties we face because of our job, but we appreciate those who keep this community the awesome and welcoming community that it should be. Thank you for reminding us why we continue to moderate, our passion, and our goal. 🫶

Watching the community grow from 26k to \[number\] has been an incredible personal experience, and it's where I've found home and comfort. Though enough of the sap, let's get onto the giveaway details, which I'm sure you're here for :)

Please make sure you read through this post carefully!

*• ───────────────────────────────────────── •*

— ・ ✦୨ **Giveaway Info & Requirements** ୧✦ ・—

This giveaway will be hosted from \[date of post\] to \[2 weeks from date of post\] NZST time, giving you all approximately 14 days to join. This post will be locked once it is the \[end date\] to prevent further comments.

The winners will be picked via *RedditRaffler*, to ensure that it is fair. The results will also be viewable on their website if you'd like to verify the results for yourself once they are out!

Once the winners have been picked, a seperate post will be made announcing the winners. They will all be tagged, and will be expected to DM me ( u/spooky-the-insomniac ) to claim their prize. There will be no time limit to claim them.

However, if a user has not DM'd myself or even another moderator in a reasonable period of time (2+ weeks), then all prizes will be returned to the moderator who donated them. As long as a user has DM'd me to claim their prize, they will receive it, even if there are complications and ends up taking over 2 weeks.

If you're able to comment on this post, then you're allowed to join the giveaway, regardless of karma or account age. This is to make our giveaway as accessible to as many members in the community. However, this excludes users who are permanently banned or are banned at \[end date\] – please try not to get banned before then. Your username will be excluded from the raffle.

Additionally, if you are found to have harassed (a) member(s) recently (3 months or earlier), then you will not be permitted to enter the giveaway. Be mindful of Rule 11 when you interact with r/AdoptMeRBX, thanks :)

Regardless, our moderators have the right to deny you entry at our discretion, and we are not required to tell you why. All excluded users will be seen in the recording of the raffle.

Please make sure to thank the giveaway's contributors, who will be listed below, along with what they donated. This is a requirement (though more so basic etiquette), and if you fail to meet it, you will not be entered. Myself or another moderator will kindly remind you to edit your original comment if you fail to do so, but if it is not done by the giveaway's end date, then you will be excluded from the raffle.

Also, make sure to do the following in your entry:

* Include your main Roblox username
* Include your Reddit username (with the u/)

Again, failure to do so will result in you being excluded from the raffle.

If you meet our requirements and follow the above instructions, you're automatically entered! Neither I  nor another mod will be replying to the entries with 'entered' to save our sanity.

I'll also use this opportunity to plug r/AdoptMeTrading and r/AdoptMeRBX's Official Discord Server: Please join using the provided link if you're interested! – [https://discord.gg/cPsC92ux2b](https://discord.gg/cPsC92ux2b)

1kju8jg,https://i.redd.it/fmwvgr84g30f1.jpeg,Part 10 Decoration: Evolution of my workspace | story,"For overall coziness, a bit of decoration is, of course, essential. I deliberately focused on natural elements—mainly plants are at the center of my setup. In recent years, this was a somewhat neglected aspect, but now I am surrounded by eight green roommates who not only improve the room climate but also need regular and loving care. To showcase the plants nicely, I installed a solid wood shelf in walnut look, dedicated solely to them. For the pots, I was inspired by my black coffee mug—this creates a nice visual unity and completes the overall look in a stylish way.

I also parted ways with my old trash can. Instead, I ordered a new one made of walnut wood from AliExpress. Similar items were simply not available in Germany—at least not in the appearance and price range I had in mind. A small detail, but it also contributes to the cohesive overall image.

Then, there was the decision about the wall color—and honestly, I didn’t make it easy for myself. A friend kindly rendered several options for me, so I could get different impressions. In the end, I chose the color “Vulkan” by Little Greene. It turned out to be a bit darker than I expected—but: it looks better than I thought. I know, it’s probably not everyone’s taste, but it fits perfectly with my setup and looks very harmonious in combination with wood, black, and plants.

Finally, I gave the lighting a little upgrade: the BenQ ScreenBar Halo. You don’t have to have it—but if you’re going to do it, then do it right. To ensure the ScreenBar sits perfectly on the LG C2, I even had a custom adapter printed to perfect the alignment. A small detail with a big impact—both functionally and visually.",1,1746943884.0,Workspaces,1,1.0,False

1kju89j,https://i.redd.it/92v3ob8de30f1.jpeg,Part 06 Desk mat: Evolution of my workspace | story,"An entire section just for a desk pad? That might seem a bit over the top at first glance – but even here, I didn’t just go for a standard off-the-shelf product. In fact, it was quite a journey until I found a solution I liked so much that I even had it recessed directly into the tabletop, as mentioned earlier.

It all started in the usual way – probably like for many others – with a large fabric mat that allowed the mouse to glide smoothly. I was content with that for a long time, until I came across photos of stylish desk setups that made me stop and take notice. Felt! It looked incredibly classy and matched my aesthetic perfectly. I ordered an inexpensive model from eBay to give felt a try – just as a test. Visually, I was instantly impressed, but the feel, glide performance, and non-slip properties weren’t ideal yet. So the search continued – this time in the higher-quality segment. Eventually, I found myself at *Good Wilhelm* and ordered their felt mat “ALWIN,” which has a dark and a light side. Definitely an upgrade from the eBay mat!

Still, the mouse glide on felt was naturally limited. So I kept browsing Good Wilhelm’s store and came across a real leather mousepad and a coaster in a beautiful cognac tone. That was a clear step up in terms of mouse handling, and I was genuinely satisfied for several weeks. But as it often goes – something started to bother me again. Probably the fact that the leather pad wasn’t fixed to the felt and would occasionally slip out of place. So the journey continued – and this time, I came across *Monofaktur*, a company offering custom felt products. Bingo!

Out came the measuring tape, and I started designing my own layout. On their website, I found a version with a sewn-in leather mousepad – it looked really promising. But what about my coffee mug? A short email exchange later, that problem was solved too: they added a circular leather pad as a coaster, sewn in to match. Exactly what I had envisioned.

A few weeks later, it finally arrived: the package – and it was precisely what I had hoped for. 5 mm thick felt with a non-slip rubber underside so the mat stays put like it’s glued to the desk. Plus the two integrated pads – functional and stylish. To be fair: the leather’s glide properties aren’t ideal – at least not for fast, precise mouse handling. For office work, it’s absolutely fine, and ever since I started using the MX Ergo trackball, it’s no longer an issue for me anyway. Still, I think it’s worth mentioning. And by the way: the original mats and leather items from Good Wilhelm haven’t disappeared from my workspace – they still accompany me, for example when I’m on the go or working at other desks.",1,1746943851.0,Workspaces,1,1.0,False

1kju7xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/National_Pet_Adoption/comments/1kju7xt/sharing_my_thoughts_because_its_too_heavy_to/,Sharing my thoughts because it's too heavy to carry alone,"I grew up in a family where everyone had asthma—except me.
Later in life, I entered a relationship, only to discover I would never be able to have children. In despair and under the influence of liquor, a stray dog came and comforted me. That moment, back in 2015, changed everything.

Where I live, it’s a local tradition to eat dog meat, some restaurants have this on their menu, graduations, birthdays, and even elections. I began rescuing dogs from different types of situations. Now, I care for 24 rescues—each with a unique story. I’ve faced criticism, hardship, and even legal trouble defending them. Today, I’m struggling because many of them are sick with distemper.

And yet, I don’t know how to stop.

Just last week, I was excited to buy food for my rescues. A kind-hearted person, Ms. C, had offered help for their medication and food. On my way, I came across a dog who had been hit by a vehicle. He was crying in pain, and I learned he had been lying there overnight while people passed by. I couldn’t walk away.

I used the money meant for my rescues’ food to bring him to the vet. Despite our efforts, he couldn't be saved. Even if they amputated his legs, he would’ve suffered. In the end, he was put to sleep. I even asked Ms. C if I was still doing the right thing.

Then, just days ago, a student posted online asking for help with a dog that had survived for years living beside garbage. She was nearby, so I tried to catch her for two days. I did what I could. Her case is TVT.

I’m not wealthy. I work as a call center agent and pay is not that good here in the Philippines. I don’t know where I find the strength to keep opening my home. But today, I feel so emotionally drained. I can’t even post this on my Facebook wall because most of my relatives don’t understand what I do.

At work, people judge me because I only drink coffee during lunch while they order meals. They don’t know that I’m choosing my rescues over comfort.

I don’t regret what I’ve done. But it hurts to see my rescues sick, and I question whether I’m still doing the right thing. I know I can’t take in any more—but somehow, I still do.

Am I crazy? I welcome honest advice—even criticism.

I still have faith that God will provide.

I’m the more functional child and he lazes around doing nothing and both my parents are enablers. All he does is games all night and sleeps all day. He tried to complete a degree twice, failed all courses and now he is on his third attempt. We’ve always fought especially with things of mine I left in shared spaces be it food/drinks, my gadgets, my mother even lets him use my car knowing full well he’ll never return in time for when I want to use it to get to work.

Last Thursday I made tiramisu for a friend’s birthday before she moves to another country. I finished making it at midnight at 7am opened the fridge to collect it and I saw half was mauled and all of the bready lady fingers part was mashed. Fuming, I went over to his ‘game room’ and asked him if he’d eaten it and he got all arrogant and said “I asked dad if I could eat it and I did, tf is it to you?”. Not my best moment, I grabbed is standing speaker thing, smashed his keyboard with it causing a tall flask with water spilling on his PC. This 32 year old boy stomped up to my parents room and down came my father shutting off the coffee maker I bought and smashing it to the floor.

Things obviously haven’t been good since at home. I never moved out because my mother was bedridden for a long time and I took care of her. Now that she’s well enough, I’ve just been approved for a rental and moving out soonish around 10 days. Since I’ve never felt secured in the shared spaces in this house, I made it a point to throw out any of his things laying around the house and the food that he bought and stored in the fridge as well. I’ve thrown out his AirPods so far (I know, bad. But he ruined my uni degree that was sent in a brown envelope with my uni logo and used it as a coaster for his orange juice and spilled all over it, left it like that until I came home 4 hours later). Mother’s Day was today and usually I’m the one reminding people and buying gifts and putting all of their names on the card and gift that I bought. Today our mom did not get anything. They left for a 5-day trip which I was supposed to go with, but for obvious reasons did not go.

I live at home with my mom and I have a boyfriend of 1 and a half years. My sister no longer lives at home and my dad lives about 25 minutes away with my step mom. My dad is currently going through cancer and I try to see him as often as I can. A lot of nights during the week I am working, and my boyfriend, mom, and sister all work during the day throughout the week, leaving only weekends for me to see them. I also have a very limited social life, as I do not love going out that much and I do not have that many friends.

I also have a big problem with time management, leaving people in my life to feel unappreciated and undervalued even though that is not my intention.

I am starting a new full time job next week which will be from 9-5, on top of my current part time job a few evenings during the week. Most of the time when I am not working in the evening I will spend time with my mom at home. My boyfriend works all day and most evenings, so the only times I really get to see him now are Friday/Saturday/Sunday.

My new job is right near my dad’s house, so I will be able to go see him more often. My sister typically is in the area once or twice a week and we talk on the phone a lot.

I feel like I messed up this weekend. Friday, I had to get a bunch of papers signed and filled out for my new job starting Monday. I had to get a paper notarized, an employment physical, and fingerprints. I also had an unrelated therapy appointment that same day. It was a really long day. 

I finished up around 8pm and I was planning to stay at my boyfriend’s house that night. When I got to his house, it was around 10pm, and he was asleep. He works early so I didn’t blame him for being asleep. I got comfy next to him and fell asleep shortly after. In the morning (Saturday), I was supposed to meet my friend at her house around 11am so we could catch up and hang out. She and I have known each other since middle school but we had a bit of a falling out in high school and are just now starting to hang out again. 

I told my boyfriend about this the week before so he knew about it, but I ended up pushing the hang out to 3pm instead of 11am so I could have a bit more time with my boyfriend. We watched an episode of our show and had coffee and breakfast. He told me he’s not planning on doing anything for the rest of the day, so if I wanted to come back over after seeing my friend I could. I told him I would let him know. 

A few hours later, I went to my friends house. My friend still lives with her parents, and I got to see them too. It was really nice to see her and her parents, and I also saw her cats that I hadn’t seen in about 7 years. It got to around 7pm and I texted my boyfriend saying I didn’t think I would be able to come back over because it was getting late. He seemed upset and then I started to feel bad, but I also was having such a nice time catching up with my friend and her family and it felt unnatural to leave right then.

I ended up getting home around 11pm, and Sunday is Mother’s Day, so obviously I am going to spend time with my mom.

I just don’t know how to properly split my time up between all of my family and friends. I feel like I need to prioritize my family first but also my boyfriend, and I also want to be able to see friends every once in a while too. But it seems like the only time I have is the weekend and I don’t know how to split everything up. I also don’t know how to manage my time and it seems like time slips away from me so quickly.

I just feel guilty every time I am with someone because I feel bad that I’m not spending time with someone else if that even makes any sense. I just don’t know how to balance everything and I need help.

I think another big thing is that I don’t get to see my boyfriend at all during the week, so we only get to see each other on the weekends, but that’s also the only time I get to see my family and friends too so I start to feel disconnected from my boyfriend and my family and then everything feels all weird. Whatever I do, I feel guilty.

I matched with this guy on an app, seemed pretty normal... you know, one of those 'has a job' kind of dudes. We decide to meet up at this cozy little coffee shop for our first date. Well, everything's going smoothly until he suddenly starts offloading his entire life's drama onto me. 🥲 

Now, don't get me wrong—I can be a good listener, but we were barely 30 mins into the date (halfway through my caramel macchiato) when he started discussing his existential crisis about whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza. And just when I thought it couldn't get more bizarre, he shifts into talking about how his mom's cat doesn't approve of his lifestyle choices... 🐈‍⬛

At this point, I'm nodding along, trying not to laugh, because I realize I'm basically his impromptu therapist. Part of me wanted to suggest legitimate therapy, but hey, maybe the guy just needed someone to chat with over coffee. 

I guess the upside is I got a pretty entertaining story out of it. 😅 Anyone else get caught in unexpected therapy sessions on a date?",1,1746943175.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

I've followed this sub for a long time. I just moved into a 587 sq ft 1-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and I’m trying to turn it into something truly special. I’m a 34-year-old single guy and I want the space to feel modern, soulful, and effortlessly cool — like a boutique hotel meets Architectural Digest.

**Key goals:**

* Needs to feel open, bright, and inviting — lots of light, layered textures, and flexible lighting
* Must be functional: I work from home sometimes, host friends/dates occasionally, and my parents visit for 2–3 months every year.
* I want modular furniture, things that evolve with time and can multitask (e.g., convertible coffee/dining table, sleeper sofa, hidden storage, etc.)
* I’ve got a budget of around $5-8k to start, so I’m not looking for high-end designer stuff, but I want it to *feel* high-end

**Layout details:**

* Bedroom is 8 ft x 6 ft (tiny!)
* Living/dining space is 13 ft x 11 ft with an extra 2 ft seating area on each long side
* Kitchen is part of the main space
* Walk-in closet + standard bathroom

Here’s the floor plan.

1kju0du,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1kju0du/is_this_stranger_legit_trying_to_help_me_or/,Is this Stranger legit trying to help me OR trying to curse/put a spell on me?,"I need help from advanced “spiritualists”, I was working today helping a customer through Google Translate. The conversation was going normal until he told me that he could sense that I had a negative spirit/energy around me. There is a link at the bottom that shows screenshots of our conversation. 

He told me he is Cuban and his grandmother taught him. He asked me if I had trouble sleeping, had unexplained bruises, heard my name when no one was calling me, etc. I shared that the day before, I woke up with my boyfriend and I had a very sore back, worse on the right side. I had to massage it all throughout the day for pain relief. He continued asking me questions, and said he would be open to helping. We exchanged contact information because I had to help another customer. 

He’s been texting me and honestly, he’s said some things that make me question how the fuck he knows?? Please keep in mind communication is through google translate so sometimes we might not get across what we want to correctly. 

He asked me to send him four pictures of myself, two of those in the mirror, and said I must be wearing red. He told me to not wear black, so I took off my black socks as well. The only red clothing I could find that covered everything was a red onesie, about a size larger. I sent two pictures from the front and he said he sensed something was off and asked if I was wearing anything else black, like black underwear. I look down and had forgot I was wearing black underwear. He told me to wear white or red underwear and take the photos again. My onesie was in no way form fitting, how the fuck did he know?? I would understand process of elimination because I wasn’t wearing any socks and only wearing a onesie, but he didn’t even ask about a bra? how do you get that info from vibes?? 

After that, the conversation continued. I decided to text my friend to see about her being at my place when this guy potentially comes over to “cleanse” and “protect” my home. While I was explaining the situation, he texted me asking if I like the beach. That stood out to me because my friend mentioned wanting to go to the beach and I agreed, enthusing about it. But he had also asked me about my dreams, and while I was thinking about my dreams, I was thinking of one in particular where I had sex with my ex and I didn’t enjoy it. My ex works on a “beach”, as he calls it, it’s on a river with sand fronts. When I told him I do enjoy the beach, and I do have strange dreams like being at work, he said he already knew about the beach and that “dreams like that they possess you and make love to you” - then I told him about my ex and dream with him. 

He asked me questions about my ex and current partner, before saying that the Saints told him I had also been deceived. I asked him to elaborate and he said, “So the men you’ve had have been unfaithful to you,” I have only had two “serious/real” boyfriends, with my ex absolutely cheating on me, but I didn’t think my partner was capable of cheating, and I am still unsure. I asked him if it was both partners and he said he would elaborate in person. He said the “only thing he could tell me is that neither of them will be the love of my life, as in the one I grow old with.” 

I told him I could still meet him for coffee tomorrow, and he asked what I was going to do because we can’t talk, because my boyfriend is coming over tomorrow. Little does he maybe know, my boyfriend *was* considering coming over tomorrow. I had told the stranger in person that I only saw my boyfriend 1-3 days a week, and he only stays the night maybe 2 nights a week, but I hadn’t elaborated beyond that. Just a lucky guess? Then he said to let him know if BF doesn’t come by, and he would come by to talk and/or have coffee. 

I’ve been talking to my best friend about it and we are torn between him being legit and wanting to help, or potentially trying to put a love spell or something on me because I am a conventionally attractive 19y/o girl. 

anyways here are the screenshots of our conversation, and at the bottom you will find two pictures of what he said to me during our in-person meeting. reddit, should i be concerned about this guy?? https://imgur.com/a/CJFIrDO",0,1746942979.0,spirituality,1,0.5,False

Oh. Well, that explains why he suddenly remembers coffee, spreadsheets, and why OSHA violations are a terrible idea. Instead of following the traditional dungeon route—traps, monsters, and being yet another EXP farm for adventurers—Ethan has a better idea. Industrialization.

Why summon goblins when you can build an automated ore refinery? Why rely on bats and slimes when you can engineer a self-sustaining magical factory? Who needs gold when you can mass-produce enchanted goods and sell them to the surface world?

Unfortunately, the local adventurers aren’t thrilled about a dungeon that doesn’t want to be looted, the kingdom isn’t sure what to make of a dungeon that pays taxes, and rival dungeons? They just want to eat him.

Armed with a questionable system, an army of quirky golems, and the sheer stubbornness of an overworked engineer, Ethan is about to prove that progress isn’t just for the surface world.

If dungeons are supposed to be deadly, then why not make death an industry?

**Dan – POV**

As I launched from the *Revanessa*, we were being swarmed.

""Get out of the way!"" I shouted, blasting through four enemy units in quick succession. I didn’t have time for this. I needed to move—fast.

I scanned the area, but Drazzin was nowhere to be found in this chaos.

And worse—if I didn’t reach the ship before it sank too deep into the gas giant, I’d be stuck out here until it resurfaced… if it resurfaced.

I carved through another fighter. My IFF pinged a friendly nearby the *Retriever*. I turned and spotted her: Callie, out here too, making sure the last few armor dolls had enough ammo and power.

That’s when I flashed back to the last time I faced Drazzin.

Sword fighting with a specialist… I’d nearly lost more than just the match.

“Callie,” I commed as I veered toward her, “I need a loadout change.”

“A what?” she replied.

Right. Guess I’d have to walk her through it.

“I need to swap *Blitzfire’s* setup.”

As I approached, I saw just how bad things had gotten. Only the newer model armor doll, plus three of the older designs. We’d been whittled down hard, and we still had half the enemy force left out here.

Those weren’t good odds.

“You okay?” I asked as I pulled up alongside the *Retriever*. The hull was scorched and battered from near hits.

“Yeah,” she replied. “They’re mostly focused on the *Revanessa*. A few stragglers are drifting our way, but the datacloke Zen built is keeping us mostly hidden.”

“Good. Opening for dock now.”

As I docked into the loadout bay, the platform beneath *Blitzfire* shifted. The side panel of the *Retriever* peeled open, exposing the rearm station. Callie brought the arm online.

“Okay,” she said. “Walk me through it.”

Thinking back to the fight, I made the call.

“We’re switching to the Rannock build. High-speed, full-auto shotgun rig. My current Atrya loadout’s too balanced—good for adapting, bad for ending things fast. I need something made for one job: getting in and breaking him.”

“Right. Uploading specs now.”

My right arm was still gone from earlier damage, but we’d manage. The automated rig kicked into motion, pulling away the scorched black-and-red Atrya armor and replacing it with black-and-orange Rannock gear.

The chest armor was swapped for lightweight vented plating, built to withstand extreme heat—perfect for running *Blitzfire* on full burn without dumping heat every ten seconds.

I was ditching reliability for a close-range, high-speed glass cannon.

The Rannock gear was faster. Built for impact. For rushing in and dismantling targets before they could react.

But it couldn’t take a hit.

And it chewed through power like a black hole.

Just like Loon's *Zeroend*. And he always wondered why he kept running out of fuel or crashing.

Hope I can handle it better.

As I stepped out of the bay, the comms flared.

“I’ve got him,” Callie said. “Drazzin’s in the back of the swarm.”



“Got it,” I said. “Stay out of sight—and close. When I’m done with him, you’ll need to bring Drazzin back to the *Revanessa* as fast as you can.”

“What? Why?” Callie asked. “Shouldn’t we just get rid of him?”

I didn’t want to explain. I didn’t.

But I had to.

“He has the only thing that can save Zen’s life.”

Her voice cracked. “Zen’s… hurt?”

I nodded once, jaw tight. “Yeah. And if we don’t get back what he stole from her… she might not make it.”

Silence.

Then, over the comms, I heard it.

That rising anger in her tone.

“Got it. When someone hurts a member of the pack…” she growled, “the pack tears them apart.”

She paused.

“Zen is part of our pack. I’ll be close. Just tell me how to help.”



Thanks,"" I said as I headed out with the new setup.

I had to adapt fast—it was like riding a wild bronco into battle. The new loadout was powerful, but twitchy. I had to adjust the controls on the fly just to keep from overclocking or frying the systems.

A glance back at the *Revanessa*—Ren was outside again, fending off whatever she could, shielding the ship as best she could. I hated it. I couldn’t be in multiple places at once, no matter how much I wanted to be.

All I could do was hope they could hold the line without me.

I had about fifteen minutes to make it back before the ship dipped too far into the gas giant. I couldn’t miss that window.

I tore through the swarm, cutting my way forward.

“Got you,” I muttered as I locked onto Drazzin. He was hanging in the back of the chaos.

I veered off to the side, trying to flank him, but he saw me coming.

He opened fire.





I had to dodge hard, plasma streaks slicing past as I twisted out of their path.

And there he was.

Drazzin.

Hovering near the edge of the formation, everything around him was chaotic, but he was calm. Controlled. His mech wasn’t even firing anymore.

Just waiting.

Watching.

The swarm didn’t protect him—they *orbited* him, like satellites around a black sun. They didn’t dare get too close. His mech had changed, too. No longer the pristine paladin armor I remembered. Now it was scarred, reconfigured, patched with strange plating that didn’t match—leaner, more vicious. Like him.

With the Rannock armor, I didn’t need to ditch plating to use full burn mode. Blitzfire was glowing red from heat—venting pressure in bursts—but I had maybe *three hundred seconds* of full operation time, even with a full-charge power pack.

The G-force slammed into me as I surged forward—my organs crushed against my spine for a second too long. I gritted my teeth through it.

This wasn’t going to be a duel.

It was going to be a sprint through hell. His sword was not ceremonial anymore.

It was meant to kill.

Even through the distance, I felt it.

That pressure.

Like he was already inside my cockpit, already predicting my next move.

“This ends now,” I muttered.

I boosted forward—hard burn—maneuvering fast. If I was going to hit him, I had to break that control. Disrupt his rhythm before he settled in and dictated the fight.

Because if he did?

I wouldn't stand a chance.



As I engaged, I could tell—he was moving differently than last time.

Faster. Sharper.

Like Zen.

No… not like her, *exactly* like her.

Did he use what he stole to copy her movements? To try and outmaneuver me?

He came in fast, sword flashing—a wide arc meant to cleave me in half. I ducked under it, fired my shotgun point-blank, but he twisted out of the way and came back with another strike. Faster.

Too fast.

I needed to move quicker. Anticipate, not just react.

It felt like two grandmasters playing chess at hyper-speed—reading and countering each other move for move.

Shot—counter—dodge—again and again.

We left the swarm behind. They couldn’t keep up with us. This was something else. This was personal.

“Come on!” I roared into the comms. “I’ve only got one arm—*is that the best you can do?!*”



***warning 240 seconds of power***



I was closing in when something strange pinged on my system. A signal—embedded deep in the data he stole from Zen.

Something she left behind.

As I got closer, Drazzin opened comms.

His voice came through with that same smug arrogance I remembered. “Well, well… looks like the little pest came crawling back.”

I didn’t let him finish.

“Zen,” I said aloud, “as your Willholder, I order you—play Nonstop Track 13.”

A half-second later, the comm feed from Drazzin’s mech lit up, and his expression twisted in horror.

“What is *that*—that *horrible noise?!”* he shouted, visibly shaking inside his cockpit.

I grinned. “Yeah. When you tore into Zen, she made sure you got two things in return: her override key…”

I leaned into the throttle.

“…and her *worst* playlist.”

The song blared louder—off-key vocals, grating synth, discordant instruments.

She admitted it herself: the worst tracks she ever made.

I couldn’t control him with it—but I *could* torture him a little.

And for what he did?

That felt just right.



Now the data he’d stolen from Zen—it was hurting him.

But as much as I hate to admit it, he *adapted fast.*

He probably just cut off the part of his systems where the music was playing.

Still, his rhythm was off now.

Just enough.

As I closed in for another engagement, he called out,

“Nasty trick, huh? But it won’t save you.”

He sneered. “You’re just a nosy pest. But still… a pest.”

We clashed—blades and boosters, sparks and fury. Somehow, we slammed down onto one of the gas giant’s moons—a frozen wasteland of cracked ice and geysers.



***warning 180 seconds of power***



The chase didn’t stop.

It just changed terrain.

Now I had to dodge not only his blade, but every sudden geyser erupting like death from the ice.

Whatever that sword’s made of, I was right not to try blocking it. I don’t think even the Warden Supreme’s armor—the heavy stuff with the reinforced energy shield—could stop his slashes. That thing cut through rock and ice like it was paper, never slowing down.

I unloaded a full shotgun salvo at him. He either deflected or dodged every shot.

Yeah—he’s on a whole other level than the last two Captains I fought.

Blitzfire was burning hot now—red-glowing, steaming like a sun. Every movement vented heat in great clouds, hissing across the frozen moon’s surface as I slid and shifted over the ice, trying to stay one step ahead.



We stared each other down, steam rising between us off the ice.

“Sorry, Drazzin,” I said, shifting my stance. “But you lose.”

“What?” he snapped, clearly confused.

He didn’t know. Didn’t see it yet.



That’s when the four Dolls from earlier landed surrounding him.

Now it was five on one, you know it's kind of nice being the one with the number advantages.

“Sorry,” I said again, my voice cold. “But your Seekers are too busy trying to tear apart the *Revanessa*. You’re cut off.”

Drazzin spun, his posture shifting fast, but it was too late.

“Doll squad,” I barked. “Target: Captain. Objective: Capture.”

Their eyes flared as they locked in, AI simple but efficient.

And then, five of us hit him at once.



He turned to me, eyes burning. “You planned this… You coward.”

“Yeah, yeah,” I said, circling. “If I wanted to destroy you, I could’ve done it five times already.



But taking you alive is the only way I get back what you stole from Zen.”

Earlier, I’d told Callie to position the retriever in orbit over this moon. I guided Drazzin here on purpose—for this trap.

She was up there now, waiting. Watching.

The battle wasn’t easy, though. He wasn’t going down without a fight. Every time he targeted one Doll, the others opened fire from new angles. And he still had me to deal with, too.

His armor had to be made of the same stuff as that damn sword—shots glanced off like it was nothing—but he was *taking* damage now. Slowing.

You honorless cur,” he spat through the comms.

“Yeah, well—honor and two bucks might get me a coffee,” I shot back.



He started to run.

Not retreating—regrouping. Buying space. Looking for a weakness to exploit.

I saw it the second his thrusters lit up, his mech kicking off a frozen ridge in a blur of gold and green. He was fast. Faster than before. Whatever stolen data Zen left in him, it was making him *better.*

Too bad for him, I’d planned for that.

I grinned through the sweat and heat bleeding through my cockpit.

He veered between geysers, trying to lose me in the chaos.

“I gave you your chance,” I growled, locking onto his heat signature through the mist and static. “But when the chained dog bites down—”

I kicked in the burners.

“—I never let go.”

My thrusters screamed as Blitzfire roared forward, tearing across the cracked moon like a meteor unleashed. Ice shattered in my wake, red-hot vents leaving molten trails behind me. I chased him hard, pushing Blitzfire past safe limits, warning lights flaring across my HUD.

We wove between frost pillars and rupturing geysers, the landscape a minefield of chaos—but I didn’t care. I wasn’t here to play it safe.

I was here to win.

And Drazzin?

He was finally starting to realize he wasn’t the one in control anymore.





Plasma fire lit up the sky as we weaved across the cracked ice, our mechs moving like monsters in a storm. Each blast of my shotgun exploded the ground around us, geysers of steam and shattered frost erupting in all directions. Drazzin's blade cleaved through it like a reaper’s scythe—clean, brutal, and unstoppable.



***warning 120 seconds of power***



He came in too fast. I barely blocked the blow, shotgun barrel deflecting his sword wide as it grazed off my shoulder plating.

“I learned a lot from that puppet of yours,” Drazzin sneered over the channel. “Zen, was it? She was always just a tool. And you—”

He lashed out again, striking my left flank hard enough to spin me off balance.

“You’re just a little worm playing at soldier. No discipline.”

Another strike.

“No honor.”

I blocked this one, skidding backward from the force.

“And no devotion!” he howled, following up with a vertical slash.

I gritted my teeth and parried with a full-thrust knee to his midsection, forcing space between us. Ice cracked beneath our boots.

“You’re right about one thing,” I growled, locking eyes through our displays as I shoved him off with my shoulder. “I’m not a soldier.”

Drazzin steadied himself, blade rising, smug grin forming again.

“I’m a gamer.”

He blinked.

“And we always find a way to win.”



**Warning: 60 seconds of power remaining.**

Less than a minute left.

I had to end this—**now.**

The Dolls landed around him, seismic thuds echoing across the frozen surface like war drums as they caught up with us. All four—armored, relentless—closing in from every angle. Wolves around a cornered beast.

Drazzin turned, snarling. He raised his blade to strike—

—But the newer model moved first.

A cable snapped forward, coiling around his arm mid-swing. Then another. And another. In seconds, they fired in unison, snaring his limbs, locking him down like a mechanical spider syncing with my command inputs.

He writhed, trying to power through it.

“You planned this,” he spat, venom sharp. “Coward.”

I stepped forward, barrel raised, locked on center mass.

“Could’ve destroyed you five times already,” I said coldly. “But I need what you stole.”

My sights lined up on the exposed joint just beneath his shoulder.

“I need Zen back.”

**BOOM.**

The shotgun roared. Metal split.

His arm was gone—ripped clean by the blast, yanked away by the Doll’s cable in a burst of sparks and hydraulic fluid.

The arm was severed clean.

“Now we match,” I growled.



As the Doll yanked his severed arm away with its cable, I surged forward, spinning into a full-force kick straight to Drazzin’s chest.

He staggered back.

I stepped in, shotgun raised, barrel pressed right into the center of his chestplate, where his armor was weakest.

He was still thrashing, struggling like the reality hadn’t sunk in yet. That he’d lost.

Piece by piece, we tore him down. I tore off the outer levels of his mech, leaving just the torso and one remaining hand exposed, barely mobile.



I popped the cockpit hatch and stepped out, my boots crunching against the cracked ice. I needed to see him—not through a screen, not from inside Blitzfire.

With my own eyes.

The wind howled across the frozen moon, sharp as knives. My strata suit kept the cold at bay, but nothing dulled the heat burning in my chest.

There he was—Drazzin. Beaten. Dismantled. The once-proud commander is now reduced to a ruin of scorched plating and shattered pride. His mech barely held shape—just a torso and a flickering HUD behind a cracked visor.

He looked up at me, his voice rasped through the comms.

“…You think this is over?”

I didn’t answer.

“You’re just a dog chasing scraps,” he spat. “A half-broken mutt who got lucky.”

I crouched beside him, eye-level now.

“You’re alive,” I said, steady and cold, “because you still have something we need.”

He laughed—short, bitter. “You don’t have the strength to finish it. That’s why you need your pack. Your *dolls*.”

I stood.

“No,” I said. “I just don’t waste ammo on garbage.”

He snarled, trying to lurch forward, but the cables held. Sparks hissed from his ruined shoulder joint.

I stepped back as the Retriever descended, landing gear crunching ice beside us.

“Dolls—load him up!” I barked. The Dolls moved in on cue. “Callie, we’ve got him. Let’s move.”

As they hoisted Drazzin into the containment pod, he managed one last glare.

“This isn’t the end,” he growled.

I leaned in close.

“No,” I said quietly. “But *you’re* done talking.”

I looked up at the Revanessa’s position on my HUD—drifting closer to the edge of the gas giant’s gravity swell.

“Seven minutes to rendezvous,” I called out. “Go time!”

Drazzin was secured.

We had our prize.

Now all we had to do was get out alive.

As the Dolls sealed the pod, I stood there for just a moment longer.

The cold wind howled across the surface of the frozen moon, kicking frost over my boots. Above, the stars shimmered, distant and uncaring. The same stars we all bled under.

I looked down at Drazzin one last time—locked inside, silent now.

This wasn’t a triumph. Not really. It wasn’t vengeance either.

It was something colder.

Necessary.

He wasn’t just a prisoner. He was a key one that might unlock a way to save Zen. And if he didn’t…?

I’d come back. And next time, I wouldn’t be loading him onto a ship.

I turned and climbed back into Blitzfire’s cockpit. Systems buzzed, sputtering with heat strain and power drain.

Forty-eight seconds left on the reactor. We were burning fumes.

I sealed the hatch.

“Callie, we’re good,” I said, locking into the comms. “Get us the hell out of here.”



As the Retriever banked hard and accelerated toward the Revanessa, I stayed locked into my seat, eyes still on the containment pod where Drazzin thrashed weakly inside. He was still conscious—barely—but the fight was gone from him.

Good.

Let him stew in it. Let him realize this wasn’t over because of some fancy trick or lucky shot. We *beat* him. Outgunned him. Outplayed him.

And now? We were going to take back everything he stole.

The Revanessa loomed larger in the viewport now—scarred, scorched, but still standing.

We were almost there.

Through the static on comms, I caught a glimpse of Ren—battered, code flickering, her avatar flickering inside the *Zephyr Shot*. Even bruised and barely stable, she was still holding the outer swarm back, buying us these last precious minutes. She was still fighting.



“Ren,” I called, breath ragged. “Get back inside the ship. We’re too close to the planet now—it’s not safe out there.”

There was a long pause.

“I can still—”

“That’s an order.”

Another pause. Then—

“…Roger,” she answered.

I watched as the Zephyr began its descent down the lift on the flight deck.

“Callie, “tell Kale to prep containment.”

“I already did,” she replied. “He’s prepping now—said to tell you he’ll be ready the second we land.”

I gave a tired nod and leaned back in my seat.

The Retriever shuddered as we hit atmosphere. Heat flared across the hull. I could already feel the magnetic clamps reaching for us, pulling us home.

And with that, we crossed the threshold.

We made it.

But the fight?

That was just the beginning.

She drew ari and ryan (from ryan's toy review) and her bully and my mom said dont do that to my sister.

she asked, ""Why not? and i said we did it to Ariana and she's so nice from all i've heard. Why not her bully?

My dad says “How do you even know Ariana’s a good person? Just because you like her music, it doesn't mean she's nice.” I get the point but it wasn’t through ari's music. I didn’t even know she was  a singer then on The Voice 2021. I found her to be so nice. Like when she accidentally spilled coffee backstage cleaned it herself even when someone offered she denied kindly. I found that very touching. And then after finding out she was mega famous (I didn’t know Kelly was mega-famous either) I was impressed.

And then I told him about Manchester. my dad cut me off and said: all celebs do that

I told him to listen and said she went back to the very place and arranged a full benefit concert and 100% went to the victims. 

And my mom goes: Why didn't she pay with HER money?"" And my dad said “If she didn't do that, no one's gonna buy her new album. She's just doing that all for money. Her career is over if she didn't do that.”

And I explained that she was just starting out with her career, and she donated lots of her money to that event. She sold tickets for 40 Euro. She visited the victims in hospital... and she raised that money and gave it ALL to Manchester. it is IRRATIONAL of you to expect to pay all her money she had like under 100mil back then she was just starting out. How is she supposed to pay for her survival then… and how about her house?

No PR Team tells their celebrity person to go back to that place the tragedy happened (when the celeb themself has severe PTSD). An apology could have done it, she didn't need to arrange all this!

My “dad said :Yeah.. but they are her fans, right? So why can't she give up her house?"" (yes, he did actually say that)...  I said : ""Are you even hearing yourself???? She needs a house! Basic common sense! And she did all she can, now leave her alone!"" (I didn't raise my voice. Just all normal tone)

my dad said: ""I'm not saying she's bad. I'm just saying that's just how marketing works. If she didn't take action, her career would be over.""

And I told my dad  thats true but she can do an apology and get it over with. Career will continue. She didnt have to do all that she did.

my mom said she did it for sympathy 🙄 i told her This is NOTHING to do with sympathy... then why else did she donate Christmas presents to the hospital EVERY YEAR??

There was no reply. My dad nor my mom replied. They ignored it.

My mom I later talked to and said how Ariana inspires people and most firsthand people say that she is sooo very genuinly sweet and tabloids love to make shit up about female celebrities in particular. My mom seemed to listen to it and I don't know if she agreed, but she at least listened instead of ignoring me.

1kjtdb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kjtdb9/im_in_love_with_my_best_friends_ex_who_is_also_my/,I'm in Love with my Best Friends Ex (Who is also my Best Friend). Help.,"Hi everyone. To get started this is a burner account for obvious reasons. But the one detail I will spare is my age which is 21 (As well as everyone else I'm going to mention). I think an outside pair of eyes might help. Thing is, this might be a bit long but I'll try my best to shorten it without missing important details. 

I'll cut to the chase, my best mate who I shall call Scott, is one of my closest friends for many many years. He's the closest thing I have to a brother and he means the world to me. He dated this girl that I shall call Claire when we're around 17-18. I only met Claire twice when they were dating and we didn't speak at all when we first met. They dated for about 6-8 months if not shorter and there is a lot of drama to condense but I'll try my best and only tell the important bits. To summarise they were each other's firsts for sex and the relationship fundamentally didn't work. Stupid shit was done which is what happens when you're 17/18 and they both went their own ways. 

Basically there were the rumours which were spread in school which were not at all true (I know this because I've heard it from both sides). People started saying Scott had done this and done that to Claire. The one rumour  that caught my ear was that Scott had got Claire pregnant. I later found out this rumour was spread by my ex (which really pissed me off). But this, and the random people calling Scott a cunt in the street, was the final straw for him, and he organised a meet with Claire. They both had a chat at a coffee street and Claire cleared up she didn't spread the rumours (people she didn't even know was doing it, because people i guess) and she was not in fact pregnant. It served as a final closure on that chapter and they both parted ways. 

Now here's where I come in. It was genuinely so random, but as mentioned previously I had met Claire at this point, but never had a proper convo with her. But so randomly we started chatting on insta and then through an 8 ball pool (honestly was such a vibe). Turns out we are two peas in a pod, and we got on so well and we became really good friends (funnily enough Scott said to Claire when she was first meeting me that he thought I wouldn't get on with her because I'm ""picky"" and ""untrusting"", well tbf he's not wrong but I've got food friends because of that) 

Scott was aware that us 2 were friends because I told him as I'm not one for bullshit and I want to be upfront with my friends. I think he was sceptical at first, and did find it weird which is fair enough, but later on he was fine with it, but I never made a habit of bringing up the subject too much. Claire is great, every conversation is a roller coaster and I love it and we get on so great, because I'm brash and she has no filter. We can literally talk about anything without a fear of being uncomfortable or embarrassed. It's very freeing. 

Right, here is how it gets complicated. I've tried my very hardest not to catch feelings and ruin the friendship, mostly because that is what happened with me and my ex - we were really good friends - dated - split and don't talk anymore. Also Claire is very well experienced compared to me in the body count department and the common theme with the looks of these men are clear and I'm nothing like that (typically tall, dark hair, massive swinger). I won't lie to you I'm not the best looking of guys to put it lightly. I'm a large sized and I don't think my face is all that great, and downstairs it's nothing to shout about. In ways for a while it made it easier to go ""yeah she would never go for me"" and on top of that I feel that if we did go out I would be betraying Scott, and that would crush me, not only because he's my best mate, but also the complicated history and sour note that chapter left with him. 

Recently, I’ve noticed more intense romantic feelings towards her. It felt like one minute I was cool and composed, the next I just completely fell down the romantic feeling tree and hit every branch. Me and my friends (Including Scott) met up before I had to go back to uni and i Invited Claire. It was awkward at first because this was the first time Scott and Claire had seen each other since the coffee meeting. Btw Claire gets on great with all my other friends and they like having her around, but the awkwardness passed and we all had a great time that night. Walking home with one of my friends we were talking about romance and I found it hard to deny I had feelings for her, but I told myself and him it couldnt work for the sake of Scott. He told me that he and Scott had spoken about it and Scotts fine with us being friends but if we dated it would be awkward. 

I because I'm very open and also to gauge the room told Claire about what Scott said (not that I had feelings for her) about it being awkward if we dated, and she said quote “I don't think we’re not stupid enough to do that” and it would be reasonable for Scott to be weirded out by that. This plus some cryptic insta story music (yes i might be reading into it too much) has just made me think did she ever like me??? And this all hurts so much because her history of romances have been so shocking and I just wanna be the guy to treat her right (cliche much) as well as some other friends saying just go for it.

I genuinely don't know what to do with these feelings. Scott is my best mate and i dont wanna hurt him, and i dont wanna ruin my friendship with Claire, but fuck, im really in love with her, and I have no idea if she even or ever has seen me in a romantic way. If you made it all the way to the end, you're a champion, and if you have any advice it would be much appreciated.

The party returns to Purgatory. Kadoc asks if Mashu is able to survive without a Master nearby, and you affirm that she can basically fight on her own if need be. Kadoc recaps the situation off, and asks what they need to do to file an appeal.

>May I tell you something as a mage.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Sure.



**Kadoc:**

>Forget about Mashu for now. I know it’s impossible, but just do it.

>Take a deep breath, and do what needs to be done bit by bit. Better yet, just go to sleep first. Close your eyes.

>There’s nothing we can do. But if she comes back alive…

>If you worry about Mashu too much, you’ll get sick, and this isn’t a joke, it’ll actually hurt her.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>…Got it!



You tell Kadoc to keep watch for a bit which he gladly does. In the meantime, Kadoc thinks that this is for the best. He starts thinking about King Ashoka’s words like how “while in hell” and “wandering in hell” have different nuances to them. He wonders if this is a metaphor entailing some kind of bad ending.



**Kadoc:**

>(Why can’t we win without Mashu?)

>(...Maybe…)

>(Is Mashu Kyrielight…)

>(---the core of this Singularity?)

# Metatron Conversation



If you chose Metatron Jeanne, she comes into your room doing the same thing as Kadoc with the futon. Instead, Metatron Jeanne grabs another futon to sleep in your room as well. You both sleep in the same room. However, you cannot sleep so you pass the time with Metatron by imagining some moves Mashu would do like “Secret Technique: Kyrielight Uppercut”, “Demonic Fist: Kyrielight Counter”, “Mashu Drop”, “Mashu Deadly Kick”, and the like. Metatron Jeanne says that it’s natural to bear the burden of being anxious, guilty, despair and sadness in light of this separation.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>…Originally. You would watch over them if you were worried, and stand up for them if the worst happened.

>As a Servant, that is the **right** thing to do.

>But I love wrong answers as much as the right ones.

>Be a \[Sloth\]. If the worst happens, you’ll live your life crying for them.

>If you’re worried, you go save them. …What will you do?



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Right now…I’ll wait for Mashu.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>—-Yes.

>I wonder how much determination it took for you to squeeze those words out.

>The greater the bond, the greater the fear of losing them.

>If he could eliminate that fear, he’d be happy to do it.

>But he chose to not eliminate that fear. He accepted it and is now waiting to see the results as time passes.

>…It would’ve been \[Sloth\] had he acted without thinking it through.

>He wasn’t going to choose that path.

>And there is nothing I can do for him. The best I can do is to hold his hand tightly like this.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>…Ah, I should’ve learned some lullabies.



>His eyes are closed and his face is filled with anxiety. Even when I hold his hand, it does not go away.

>Even though we’re this close and I can do anything, I can’t even calm down the person in front of me.

>…Not even I who is God’s scribe and possesses the powers of an archangel.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>I’ll try even without you telling me. Master, you…



>“Don’t try”, “Let’s quietly sleep”.

>That is what my heart hopes for. But, well—

>It’s probably this Master’s nature to reject that.

>However…Mashu Kyrielight’s situation is critical. Not because she has been left behind in Hell.

>But because she is the core of this Singularity.



# Lilith Conversation



If you choose Lilith, she comes in impressed that you were able to guess that it was her. She notices your strange expression on your face. She throws you into your futon knowing that you’re tired from that journey.



She wants to ask you something, but she begins saying that she knows that Mashu is your first Servant. She is worried why you look pale and the like. Lilith tries to think if you’ve seen a nightmare, but this nightmare must’ve been from somewhere.



**Lilith:**

>….

>Reality? Not reality…a Singularity? Oh, speaking of which…

>The Avenger Class’ Saint Graphs have become in a shadow state. It’s possible for them to fight, but nothing outside of that.

>So did something happen there?



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Why….are you going this far…?



Lilith understands if what she predicted with you and the Avengers came true. You ask why she hates Mashu so much. Lilith mistakenly teases you out of habit which is more like provocation at that point. But she’s prepared to either kill or be killed by Mashu, and won’t have any regrets about the outcome. Lilith knows that if she killed off Mashu, she’d immediately become an enemy of Chaldea out of retribution. 



Lilith moves on from that subject to better things like the Human Order Restoration and the Lostbelts. Lilith asks if you’ve had fun and/or painful experiences, to which you respond that you’ve both. They eventually talk about Babylonia, specifically its King and its people. After a while, she heads out of the room.



# END OF CHOICES

At the end of each person’s conversation, you get woken up by them. Kadoc says that you should have some breakfast after not having dinner. Metatron Jeanne tells you that dreams are dreams, and that you’re not going to have this painful experience every time you sleep.

You head to the kitchen area to eat some cereal with the others. Dante skips breakfast which makes Metatron Jeanne mad at how he’s going to pass up this good breakfast meal. Moriarty comes in to have his breakfast so that he can immediately start the debate.

**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Yep (Lazy Response).



**Amakusa Shiro:**

>Yes. I think I can help out with the debate if need be.



**Moriarty:**

>I see, thank you. Now then, let’s start…

**Dante:**

>…Don’t worry, Kadoc.

>…As long as I, a literary scholar and lawyer, am here, we will not fall behind Moriarty.



**Kadoc:**

>(I feel like we're gonna lose.)

**Moriarty:**

>Let’s start with something minor as the first topic.

>Let’s see…for now, tea or coffee will do.

>The next topic is the treatment of the sinners. We’ll follow up with the difficult laws.

>I want the two of you to think about “why are they guilty” and “why are they not guilty”, and give some opinions.

>The final topic is obvious. Can Chaldea’s guilt be overturned?

>…Well, there’s no way we’d get there today. So we’ll just end it there.

>So let’s practice debating, everyone!



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Then I’ll be the starter. Ready, set, go!

>Phew. Nice work, me….I’m going to go take a break….



**Amakusa Shiro:**

>Hahaha, you look like you’ve completed your job.



**Moriarty:**

>My god, I'll just start, this is killing my motivation!

From Old Appalachian Recipes FB Page member John Middleswarth:



“My great Aunt Prudie made a breakfast (anytime treat) called “Rival Pie” … went well with a glass of cold milk or a hot cup of coffee … She gave my mother the recipe and before my mother passed she gave her handwritten recipe to me. My aunt Prudie never married and took care of my grandfather’s (her brother) place … they never had running water … just a pitcher pump on one side of the sink. “Pap” had an outhouse. This breakfast treat was from the early half of the last century. I’m 71 and remember those homemade breakfasts as a small child. Dad grew up on the farm in the mountains of PA. A Dutchman. I love sharing this family recipe … I am the only one who makes them. It’ll die with me if I don’t share with others.”



4 Cups Flour

2 Cups Brown Sugar

1 tsp baking soda

1 tsp salt

½ cup Crisco shortening

2/3 Cups Milk

 Grease and flour tins

350F for 35 minutes.



In some comments he mentioned sifting dry ingredients together first, mixing in the milk, then cutting in the shortening with a pastry cutter. It should be crumbly, which is where the word Rival (rivel) in the name came from. He mentioned his mother making larger quantities of these on holidays and using a large mixer instead.

1kjt3wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1kjt3wl/escitalopram_oxalate/,escitalopram oxalate,"Hello! I've been using this medication for about 5 months now to treat anxiety and depression. Been using 10mg of escitalopram + 50mg lisdexanfetamine. Prior to that, I've used sertraline 100mg, which was helpful, but not too much. After changing my medication, I've felt a significant change. I've been a lot less anxious in social settings that usually freak me out, I've started to feel more comfortable with myself and I noticed I've been able to control my anxiety when it hits. Before switching medications, I was having a quite high number of panic attacks and me, around 3 or 4 per week, that were really bad, often lasting multiple hours, losing total control of my body, self spanking, complete unability to speak, etc. After I've started taking this medication, I've not had any panic attacks or meltdowns. Paranoid symptoms have dissapeared completely, which I've not found an answer about why or how this has happened.

However, it has not been only sunshine and rainbows. I've noticed that I've been really apathic lately which is very frustraring. Everything seems to be less intense and truthful. I've been feeling disconnected to people and unmotivated. Doesn't matter how hard I try, I just can't give a fuck, and this has bothered me a lot. It is completely impossible for me to do simple tasks, like washing dishes, swiping the floor, organizing, sittinh my arse down and study, personal hygene and even doing stuff I like, like playing my instruments and listening to the music I like. I've been really dependend on instantaneous dopamine discharges, which is probably related to my ADHD, but the use of this medication has impossibilitized me to fight it, so I've been catching myself doomscrolling too often, and certainly more often, and most of times I just continue. My dad suggested me to put reminders for me and note everything, which I think will work, but I've have not yet found motivation to do it. I often mod and repair my instruments, but there are currently three unfinished projects, but I can't find evergy to finish them. My productive levels are getting pretty low.
I've also been extremely sleepy, even with the vyvanse. It is incredibly difficult to stay awake during lectures. Actually, it has been difficult to stay awake at all. I've never felt the need to be under so much stimulants to function ever. I could count on my hands how many cups of coffee I've drank between january and march 2025, but I've been craving coffee 24/7 and drinking coffee all the times it is available to me. I'm even thinking of bringing a coffee bottle along with a water bottle to everywhere I go. Cigarettes have also never been so delightful. Even tho I only smoke every once in a while while thinking about stuff and listening to the sounds of the environment, I've been craving cigarettes a lot. I've catched myself holding a pan to my mouth as if it was a cigarette, fidgeting with it as if i was beating ashes and being hypnotized about the smell of cigarettes. The craving has not been about the nicotine itself only, it is also (maybe more of) the ritual of smoking.

Overall, it has been positive and negative at the same time, but better than my previous route, so I might be on the right path, but there are a number of rocks on my way. my next appointment with my psychiatrist is in about 3 weeks, I believe. I'll discuss with him about these topics and what to do. Of course, even tho I am quite informed, I won't make any interventions on my treatment without supervision or approval of my professional. I think I might lower the dose with his approval, and maybe be off antidepressants after two years of use of some type of antidepressant.",1,1746939390.0,antidepressants,1,1.0,False

When I was managing a retail team I had a call from one of my team while I was in an early meeting with the company owner. I answered it and put it on speaker (just habit).


Me: ""Hi Danny, what's up?""


Danny: ""Hey boss. Not feeling well so won't make it in today."" Now Danny sounds as chipper as can be. No croakiness or fatigue in his voice.


Me: ""No worries. Thanks for the notice. Rest up. If you don't think you'll make it in tomorrow make sure you get a sick note clearing you for work if you can. You're clear on the policy right?""


Danny: ""Will do. Hopefully see you tomorrow. Bye.""


Hang up phone and go to resume meeting and boss starts grilling me. He didn't sound sick. What's even wrong with him. Your team mustn't respect you. Blah blah blah . Now while Danny wasn't our best worker he was up there and the team and customers loved him. And him calling in sick was rare. And honestly my feelings were a bit hurt by him telling me they didn't respect me. I wasn't long in that position but I worked my way up there and they all knew that.


Proceed to a debate that my team's stats were brilliant per what we were meeting about, that I disagree about them not respecting me because he didn't feel the need to put on a voice. And the reality was what was the matter was irrelevant. He's calling in sick, he's sick. He'd never given me a reason not to trust him. I thought that was the end of it. Not quite.


Next day Danny comes in and the boss immediately calls him and I into his office. He starts giving Danny ""the talk"". Commitment to the company, sick days are for when you're sick and unable to work, and how he didn't sound sick. Danny start grinning and just pulls up his sleeve showing a very recently bandaged arm. ""I'm not sure how I should sound to convey this over the phone. Should've I coughed? How many stitches does it take to give me a croaky voice?""


I burst out laughing. Boss to his credit took it in stride (he was usually a pretty good guy). Danny obviously told the team about it too. Now whenever any of the team happened to call in sick when they knew I had a meeting with the owner it went like this:

Becky calls. Coughing and spluttering. ""Sorry boss *coughs again* won't make it in today. *Another fit of coughing* Child has gastro so need to take the day off to take care of him *coughing continues*.

Mitch calls. Very croaky voice ""Can't make it in. Twisted my ankle and need to stay off it for a few days""

Belle calls. Coughing, spluttering, fatigued voice. ""Not sure I'll make it in today. Car won't start. Can I take TOIL to arrange repairs today?""


Queue the next staff all hands (usually beers and a bbq in the carpark and talking upcoming changes for the next quarter) where as part of that owner gives out a best acting award and also asked them to cut it out.


I'm worked there for quite a few years. I knew the owner personally before I started working there. While the owner and I didn't always see eye to eye he was usually a good guy, just had some bad staff and managers in the past and definitely needed more coffee that morning.",285,1746938728.0,MaliciousCompliance,20,0.99,False

The point is that I never had a bag from an industrial producer where I wasn't keenly aware that I was drinking industrial (and not artisinal) roast, this is a first.

I'm probably within 35 miles of Big Sur. It might as well be a 1000.

Mothers day.

Thinking about my Mom.

Her courage. Her acceptance of me on path. I wonder what she would say about this one.

....

Actually. I already know.

....

My Mom and Dad, like most parents, have a few go to stories about my childhood that they would retell from time to time. Enough to make the greatest hits list on their stories about me.

Right now I'm picturing my Mom smiling with her eyes lit up as she told the oddest story about me. 

According to my Mom, I didn't want to learn to read. We were stationed at Myrtle Beach. AfB and my best friend was Dwayney.

I guess my plan was to let Dwauney read for me.

(That's a tell, but it gets better.)

So my Mom started asking me questions about my future. Specifically. If I couldn't read, what would I do for work?

Garbage man.

That's right. I fucking called it. From 22 to 36 that was my profession when I wasn't laying up in some girls house, jacking off, playing video games while she worked.

That's a pattern (letting g others do for me; I'm cool with that).

When my Mom objected, I said cab driver.

Her response was rge same.

Cabbies can read. And they have to. Just like garbage men.

I had a solution.

Beach bum.

...

Folks.

I have actually driven a cab. 6 months total, if that.

Here I sit.

I hope my Mom's eyes are beaming like they used to.

I made it Mom!

I'm actually bumming on the beach.

Not a care in the world, except that I lost every one I care about.

....

Here's a secret. I think she's looking out for me. She knows me. What I need. But she also cares about others.

I'm great at casual acquaintances.

Not good at sticking around.

This weekend has been full of them.

The clown with the kick down (actually had clown makeup on).

Robert. Stage 3 cancer.  Met him on the bus. We drank coffee. Hung out last night. He invited me fishing.

I passed. I always do.

But I saw him tonight. He caught a sand shark early this morning. That's his first fish in the year he's been here.

....

So here I sit twisted in knots.

I tried not smoking today. Nausea when I tried to eat. 

That's not the knot I'm referring to.

My brain is literally at war with what's actually working.

I can't say anything more.

It's scary though.

What of it keeps working.

That's what I'm not used to.

1kjsuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DigAgitated5231/comments/1kjsuru/ready_for_fire_36m_in_central_europe/,Ready for FIRE (36m in Central Europe),"Hi,

I am 36 male living in Central Europe (2 small kids). I have been interested in the concept of FIRE for the last 6 years or so when I realized I have a quite good chance to do so.

My current net worth is approximately \~1M€, split between

* 400k€ in ETFs after the recent downturns
* 50k€ in bonds (which I inherited and have some tax advantages)
* 60k€ Cash in high-interested savings account
* A rented out flat in a capital city worth approx. 500k€, rented out for about 1100€/month (after expenses before tax). I know that the return on investment for this is low, but for legal reasons I cannot sell the flat for its market value until 2030. From a current perspective I plan to sell as soon as I can (when the market is right) and convert it an ETF.
* I do not own my house where I live but my wife does (inherited), so I do not pay anything besides power/heating/etc.

I also own some shares in a startup, but I value them at 0, not sure if they will ever realize. I do not have any debt/mortgage. I will probably inherit another 300k€ or so but I do not count this.

Regarding income I have several income streams which I really value as it gives a peace of mind compared to just receiving a normal salary.

* Approx 2200 € (net) for 25h of working (fully remote since COVID). This job is low-stress, low hours (probably less than officially), I have nice colleagues, and I do not have to commute, which is great with the family. The job is fine, but I am not very passionate about it.
* I rent out my flat which I own for 1100, so after tax approx. 700 €
* I am also self-employed for some small projects which pays another 700-800 € net or so. I do not advertise anything or search for work, probably could scale this if I wanted.
* I also receive a kind of salary being part of the local city council, approx. 450 € net. I am quite passionate about local politics, so receiving money for something I would consider as a fun hobby is nice.

I do not count the dividends or the interest as income here as all gets reinvested.

From the income I save approximately 2300-2500 € a month, so I earn much more than I need. I do not expect expenses in the future to grow a lot, maybe when the children are older. Let’s say I have 2000 € expenses per month which would lead to a SWR of 2,5% which is already enough.

Moneywise I rarely think about spending, if I want something I can just buy it, but I am not interested in anything status-oriented like watches or cars. I mostly spend my discretionary income on DIY tools which is great because I rarely need any professional for house or car maintenance, saves quite some money and I really like doing that.

My wife is working for approx. 3000 € net a month and does not want to stop.

So just by looking at the numbers I am all set and could stop working. But honestly, I am quite hesitant. As said, my work is low in hours and stress. For like 90% of the time I control my own schedule (apart from all family related things). If I want to go to the city and drink coffee with somebody on Thursday 10am – I can do that. I regularly drive one child to afternoon activities at 2pm (where I am always to only man 😊).  Having family, I cannot just travel around the world or something like that.

 Overall, I have the feeling that not working anymore would not give me a lot of benefits. Some other thoughts I have are that I feel continuing like this will bore me at some point. I have some friends and family who are in high-earning, high-status positions (either employed or self-employed) and sometimes I think I should also be more ambitious in terms of career opportunities. It’s less that I would need more money but more FOMO as I am in my prime years for that.

I also sometimes consider trying to scale my small freelance business but again not needing the money my desire doing that is low. Having small children already occupies a lot of my time so all these thoughts are currently just theoretical, but they will grow up and I like to have a plan what to do then.

I would be curious about your opinions. Am I ready for FIRE? Should I stop working? What would you do?

Today Kendu reached 18'000 holders, and broke a huge 1y trend. With ETH/BTC at an all-time low, now is the time to find a small-cap project with an active community. Speaking of communities, Kendu has a truly unique one. Kendu is emerging as the first **brand** coin and will be the first mover of this kind. Holders are sharing their skills to create a wide range of things, all of which have currently been created :

\- Kendu board game

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs

\- Kendu beers

\- Kendu energy drinks

\- Kendu events company in India

\- Kendu events presence USA

\- Kendu sports brand

\- Kendu eSports team 

\- Kendu coffee brand

And there is much more in the works. The moto is ""Kendu is a movement that empowers you to turn your life goals into reality. Take initiative and the community will fuel your journey. What is your dream?""

We've added more than 14k holders since ATH and we have 5.5k\~ in our Reddit sub. And nearly 20k holders which are organic. Not sure about dust balances but yeah, the numbers add up.

I highly recommend that you take your time to study Kendu, as it won't take you long to realise the opportunity you have in front of you. Unmatched on a lot of metrics.

Thanks for reading !

1kjsoas,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualitySeek/comments/1kjsoas/what_are_the_musthave_items_for_moving_into_your/,What Are the Must-Have Items for Moving Into Your First Apartment Alone?,"  
Taking the leap into your first solo apartment is a huge and exciting milestone — and naturally, many people in this situation begin to wonder: *What should I absolutely invest in? What are the essentials that I’ll truly need and appreciate for years to come?* This is a very common question, especially for those aiming to combine long-term value with day-to-day practicality.

When you’re setting up a new space from scratch, it’s tempting to focus on aesthetics or trendy items, but your real priority should be durable, high-quality pieces that serve essential functions. Start with **bedroom basics**: a comfortable, well-built mattress (like those from Saatva or Casper), quality sheets, and blackout curtains. Your sleep will thank you every night.

In the **kitchen**, invest in a sharp, full-tang chef’s knife (Wüsthof or Victorinox are excellent), a reliable non-stick or cast iron skillet, a heavy-duty cutting board, and a set of sturdy stainless steel pots and pans. Brands like All-Clad or Cuisinart often stand the test of time. You’ll also want a powerful blender or food processor if you cook often, and a good coffee maker if caffeine is part of your routine.

As for **living and utility items**, a solid vacuum (like a Shark or Dyson), a versatile tool kit, and multi-functional furniture (like a sleeper sofa or a storage ottoman) can make a huge difference. Don’t forget a fire extinguisher, surge protectors, and proper lighting — things you might not think of immediately but will be grateful for later.

Many people have been where you are, asking how to strike the balance between cozy and practical, temporary and long-term. The answer lies in thoughtful investment: get fewer items, but choose ones that are made to last. In the end, your first apartment will reflect your lifestyle — and with the right foundational pieces, it’ll feel like home in no time.",1,1746937760.0,QualitySeek,0,1.0,False
