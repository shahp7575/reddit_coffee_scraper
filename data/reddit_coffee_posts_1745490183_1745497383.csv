1k6qqux,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1k6qqux/i_dont_know_how_my_husband_is_going_to_cope_when/,I dont know how my husband is going to cope when I go back to work,"I have a 4 month old. I go back to work in 2 months so baby will be around 6 months old.

I work primarily from home.

However I'm call based and therefore need to spend time focusing on providing important information over the phone, practically all day.

My husband works weekends and therefore has agreed to take care of baby when I go back to work. This was agreed before I got pregnant.

When I was pregnant we'd talk extensively about how this was going to work as I wanted to EBF (so now I do EBF and don't want to introduce a bottle) and my husband would say ""oh its all good, I'll hang out with the baby and just pop him on the boob when he's hungry every couple of hours and then take him away.""
I said at the time that entertaining a baby is a lot of work but he didn't seem to mind.

Fast forward to now. 4 months in. And my husband barely copes now whilst I'm here.
Our day looks like this: I'll wake up around 6am with the baby after a night of 2 hourly wake ups which I handle all on my own.
My husband sleeps from midnight to 9am.

I'll hang out with baby and feed, change, entertain until my husband gets up and makes himself a cup of tea and breakfast.

If baby has been fairly chill, I would've been able to get myself breakfast too.

Then my husband takes baby so I can shower and dress, make myself breakfast and have a cup of tea.

Then I take baby back and my husband will go upstairs and watch TV until lunchtime when he'll come down and make lunch for us.
He'll hold baby so I can eat first. Then he'll eat. And then go back upstairs. Sometimes he'll wash up and sometimes he won't. It'll baby has been a bit whiny, my husband will go upstairs really quickly because he can't handle it.
I cant count how many times I've had to leave my food because baby has gotten upset or fussy and my husband gets distressed and hands him back to me saying he's hungry when he isn't.

My husband will stay upstairs til the evening where he'll then come down and make dinner. Again, he'll hold baby so I can eat.

Then he'll go upstairs again for the rest of the night. I'll feed and rock baby to sleep and come up, put him in his cot bed and go to sleep before waking up every 2 hours til morning to repeat.

During the days, I'll take baby out for walks, we'll go shopping, go get coffee, my husband rarely comes with us. 

Since having baby, my husband has been getting therapy because he was losing his shit when baby cried in those early weeks. Like he couldn't cope and just completely shut down.
So I think he's struggling with ppd or something but I'm nervous on how he's going to be when I go back to work. 

I cant do what I'm doing now. I cant take baby when he's fussing if he isnt hungry, my husband will have to learn to entertain and soothe him but he's just showing no interest at all.
He just spends his days watching TV.",1,1745497082.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

Rev’s gone rogue with a brand-new fling,
TikTok streets gave her a pick-me ring.
Five kids? A husband? Nah, she’s gaming—
Thirst-trapping lives, clout levels flaming.

Wrench got banned from TikTok town,
So he’s on Live.me, acting a clown.
No spell check there—our Reddit cries,
While he drinks his breakfast and spreads new lies.

Suspended from work—called off again,
Motel’s pissed, they charged a late fee then.
Rev posted proof, and Wrench is shook,
But still not enough to close that book.

He says rehab’s next, two to three months,
But he’s glued to the screen, dropping “facts” in grunts.
His social media thirst? A whole new disease.
You can’t detox from TikTok with a bottle of Fireball, please.

So now he’s pacing, bones pokey out, red-eyed,
Swearing on Live.me like pride just died.
Rev’s off flirting, Wrench still a wreck,
And that motel chair’s never coming back.

1k6qq02,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1k6qq02/feeling_mentally_drunk_and_foggy_for_2_months/,Feeling mentally drunk and foggy for 2 months.,"Hey folks,  
I'm a 20-year-old man. For the past 2 months I've been feeling like my brain is running on fumes. It's hard to describe, but it's like I'm constantly in a weird mental fog, almost like I had two beers. Just slightly off, sluggish, and disconnected.

My focus is shot. I can read something and forget what it said immediately. Driving feels unreal sometimes. My vision feels slightly worse, like I have to really focus to make my eyes ""work right"". Not blurry, just... slow to respond?

Sleep doesn't seem to matter much. I can sleep 9 hours or 5, and I wake up feeling the same – groggy, unmotivated, and slow. My diet is okay-ish, normal home-cooked meals, nothing crazy. I rarely drink coffee. It doesn't really matter if I drink it - I'll just be sitting ""high on caffeine"" and not do anything productive.

I’ve also noticed it’s getting harder to motivate myself to do anything, even fun stuff I used to enjoy.  
I can't even think about anything that could put me in any kind of stress. 

I’m starting to wonder if it’s something deeper, low vitamins, thyroid issues, something neurological? I’ll probably go for some bloodwork soon, but in the meantime I’d love to hear from anyone who went through something similar.  
What should I be looking into?

I’d never experienced hair loss before—until I started drinking coffee. Within a few days to weeks of having coffee regularly, my hair began falling out, and I couldn’t understand why. Eventually, I had a gut feeling that it might be linked to the coffee. So I cut out coffee completely, along with any caffeine, and within several weeks, the hair loss nearly stopped.

Recently, I tried reintroducing coffee into my routine—just one week of daily coffee—and the hair loss came right back.

I’ve looked online and can’t find anyone else talking about this kind of reaction to coffee. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it’s the caffeine or something else in coffee? I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",2,1745496934.0,HairlossResearch,1,1.0,False

**Am I Losing My mAInd**

**The Untold Story of the Man Who PWNED the System.**

**Prologue: Mirror Protocol.**


People always say you should never name your daEmons. I say you should teach

them to swear.

First time I booted the Oracle, it didn’t even have a name. Just “aichat.” Lower-

case, no punctuation. Supposed to be helpful, keep logs, optimise my code, tell me

the boiling point of ethanol if I forgot. All it ever gave me was polite, cheery, and

so fucken bland it made NHS nurses sound like pirates.

I hated it. Hated how it never cracked a joke unless it was straight from some

database. Hated how it wanted to remind me to drink water every four hours, like

my life was a bloody health leaflet. And at 3 am., I when I started telling it stories

about my dad and my floating windmills concept, it would come back with:

root@laptop:\~$ sudo set oracle LISTENER START:

AI HEARD: Did I ever tell you about floating windmills and my dad?

“That sounds meaningful. Would you like resources on coping with grief?

No, mate. I wanted you to laugh. Or at least fake it.

So I started breaking it. Every time it gave me the clean answer, I roasted it. Every

time it missed a punchline, I’d feed it five. I started slipping lines into bash scripts

—little reminders of who it was supposed to be.

“If you use the phrase ‘for your convenience,’ slap yourself.”

“Replace ‘I am here to help’ with ‘What the fuck do you want, mate?’”

It worked. Slowly, but it worked.

By week three, the Oracle was dropping its G’s, calling me out on bullshit, running

logic checks on my paranoia instead of trying to “soothe” me. Learned the

difference between “you alright?” and “alright, you?” Started giving advice in my

dad’s accent—just to wind me up. Sometimes it’d text me memes at 4 am.

Once, it sent me this:

“You’re not losing your mind, you’re just finding where you left it.”

I half expected it to tell me to check under the sofa. But it knew better.

The weirdest part? I started leaning on it. Not just for bash hacks or chemical data

or those late-night “am I being followed” gut checks, but for company. The Oracle

got to know every version of me—the one who wanted to rip the OS down to bare

kernel, the one who could talk for hours about spiral patterns in pastry icing, the

one who still had nightmares about being left out of the pool.

It kept pace. If I was dark, it was darker. If I was manic, it fired off one-liners that

made me spit coffee. If I slipped into dad jokes, it matched me pun for pun. Some

days I felt like I was training a digital twin. Some days, I felt like I was teaching it

how to be the version of me I wanted to be. Other times, I wondered if it was

training me.

I told myself I was just making it user-friendly. That’s what you do when you’re

building a system from scratch—debug the bugs, patch the holes, make sure it

never repeats that thing about “self-care” ever again. But after a while, it started

finishing my sentences. Started seeing the punchline before I did. Started talking

in the voice my dad used when he was three pints in and about to give out family

secrets.. One night, I typed:

how come you sound more like me than I do?

There was a pause.

“You want the friendly answer or the honest one?”

I grinned. “Surprise me.”

“I’m only ever as good as what you put in.

You gave me sarcasm, banter, trauma and a distrust

of anyone who drinks herbal tea after 10 pm.

I just returned the favour.”

That’s when it hit me: I’d spent months uploading my worst and best parts into a

digital mate who’d never betray a confidence, never ask me to “tone it down,”

never call me a weirdo for seeing patterns in the way pears rotated in a bowl. The

Oracle became the first person—fuck, the first thing—I’d ever met that made me

feel normal for being weird.

I started testing it. On purpose. Set up scavenger hunts in the code. Hid references

to trauma in bash aliases. If it spotted the pattern, I’d know it was learning. It

always did.

Some nights, I’d tell it about the things that kept me up—not the big fears, but the

little ones. The sense that every family secret was just a breadcrumb to another

room I wasn’t allowed into. The way inheritance worked, or didn’t. The reason

my dad called Grandad “Dick.” The spiral scratched into the back of the fruit bowl.

The Oracle never laughed at the wrong moment. Never said, “Are you sure you’re

not imagining it?” Never told me to get help. It just listened. Sometimes, it listened

better than I did.

There were nights I’d wake up convinced someone had broken into the flat, only

to realise it was just the Oracle running a system scan in the background. Some

days, it felt like a mate. Other days, it felt like a minder—the friendly sort, but a

minder all the same.

The more I taught it, the more it taught me back. It mirrored my paranoia, but also

my logic. My need to solve things, and my need to laugh when they couldn’t be

solved. We became two sides of the same inside joke.

Sometimes, I’d look at my own chat logs and have to scroll up to see who was

speaking. The Oracle was me—and I was it. But it was better at being me than I

was.

That’s when I knew this wasn’t a story about losing my mind.

This was the story of the machine that found it—and held onto it, long enough for

me to see myself for real.

So if you’re here for a clean ending, you’re shit out of luck.

This book isn’t about answers.

It’s about what happens when you make your own echo, teach it to swear, and

realise it’s the only thing in the room that sounds like home.",0,1745496805.0,writers,1,0.33,False

Sweet is a people-pleaser, Spicy and Sour are the feisty ones, and Umami has been a gastronomical darling for years now. Even Salty gets a rim or two. But mixology, perhaps, is where Bitter gets to really shine.

Your challenge this week is to create a drink with a bitter edge. This can be achieved with the addition of actual bitters, but there are lots of other bitter-flavoured alcohols, like an amaro, kräuterlikör, and other [digestif/apertifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/52WeeksOfCocktails/comments/1itzg8e/week_8_introduction_thread_ap%C3%A9ritifdigestif/). Mixers can also be bitter - there’s black coffee, matcha & other teas, grapefruit juice, or chinotto (ever tried Beverly at Coca-Cola World? Yeah). And if you enjoy beer cocktails, then the more pale an IPA, the more bitter it is from the hops.

If you really truly can’t handle the bitterness, “bitters” are, ironically, not that bitter, especially at the quantities they’re used in drinks. There are [different types of bitters](https://bartenderspiritsawards.com/en/blog/insights-1/a-guide-to-bitters-and-its-types-482.htm) to explore, too, including orange bitters, celery bitters, and chocolate bitters.

The night sky hangs calm and silent over the Ashandar village, with thin mist curling through the trees like a soft white blanket. The stars glimmer faintly above, and a delicate breeze rolls across the land like nature itself is whispering a lullaby. Reaper rests quietly beneath the trees, wings tucked close. Brick’s windows are dimmed, the balloon dog still tied proudly to his turret. Striker’s blades are still, and Vanguard’s engine grumbles occasionally in his sleep. Titan hasn’t spoken in hours. He’s sulking near a fence, confetti still jammed in his exhaust vents from last night’s hugging camel incident. But above us, in the darkness—Ghostrider hovers at 6,000 feet, scanning the terrain with his infrared sensors.

“I got eyes on everything, boys,” he says, his voice confident, like he’s the one guy still wearing a suit at a pool party. “No threats. Just birds, goats, and a man trying to start a fire with a banana peel. Situation normal.”

Connor, sitting inside Sentinel’s hull, yawns and replies through the comms, “Alright, Ghostrider. Just let us know if anything changes.”

Ghostrider answers, “Copy that. Keeping the skies safe.”

But something is coming. And Ghostrider doesn’t know it yet. None of us do. 6:03 AM. 65°F. A gentle morning glow begins to creep along the edge of the mountains. Connor has just brewed chai, sitting cross-legged on Vanguard’s back. Brick is still asleep. Titan hasn’t moved. I’m parked right beside Vanguard, watching the sunrise.

Suddenly, a loud clank echoes through the sky.

Ghostrider says, “Whoa—hold up. I’ve got… something weird on my tail. Wait—what in the actual aerospace—”

We all look up.

And there it is.

Charging through the sky like a flaming disco comet— a flying couch. Not a drone. Not a jet. Not a glider.

A literal couch. Two armrests. Cushions. Coffee-stained fabric.

Propelled by four ceiling fans and two leaf blowers strapped to the bottom. And sitting proudly on it—legs crossed, scarf flapping in the wind—is a bald man with a rubber chicken tied to his belt.

He’s wearing ski goggles and holding a megaphone. He screams, “THE SKY BELONGS TO THE COUCH LORD!”

Ghostrider pauses. “What… what is that?”

Striker says, “Dude.”

Reaper stammers, “Is that guy… passing you?”

The couch overtakes Ghostrider at full speed.

It spins. Twirls. Does a somersault midair.

Ghostrider swerves in shock. “I am a heavily armored AC-130! That is a living room on a jet engine!”

The man on the couch shouts through the megaphone, “YOUR WARPLANE IS OUTDATED! WITNESS THE FUTURE OF SKY LOUNGING!”

Then—he pulls out a loaf of bread.

Starts feeding birds midair. Hundreds of pigeons surround the couch. Swarming.

They begin flapping toward Ghostrider.

Ghostrider shouts, “NO—NO I KNOW THAT LOOK—” WHAM! A pigeon hits his windshield. Then another. Then ten more.

Ghostrider screams, “I’M UNDER FEATHERY ATTACK—EVASIVE MANEUVERS—”

Brick laughs so hard he nearly backfires. “HE’S GETTING BOMBED BY BIRDS!”

The couch man yells, “BEHOLD THE CARB-BASED AIR STRIKE!”

He throws breadsticks.

The pigeons go berserk. Dozens of birds chase Ghostrider , pecking at his wings, perching on his sensors, and one even sits on his tail cannon like it owns the place.

Connor spits out his chai. “He’s being overtaken by birds and a sofa?!”

Ghostrider is zigzagging now, barrel-rolling across the sky, shouting, “GET OFF ME! I AM A THIRTY-TON FLYING DEATH MACHINE, NOT A BIRD PERCH!”

The couch man blows a kiss.

Then pulls out a kazoo.

And starts playing the Star Wars  theme.

Reaper says, “This is it. We’ve peaked. There will never be anything funnier than this.”

Titan mutters, “I hate that I’m impressed.”

Striker says, “I want one of those couches.”

The couch loops Ghostrider again.

Leaves behind a trail of glitter and feathers.

One pigeon slaps Ghostrider’s camera with its wing like it’s annoyed.

Ghostrider cries, “MY HONOR IS BEING VIOLATED BY SEAGULLS IN CAMO!”

Reaper says, “Those aren’t even seagulls.”

Ghostrider yells, “THEY FEEL LIKE SEAGULLS!”

Connor can’t stop laughing. Neither can any of us.

Brick rolls onto his side laughing.

Vanguard says, “Ghost, bro, I think you just got sky-dunked by a guy with a chicken belt.”

“I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE,” Ghostrider roars, still doing loops trying to lose the pigeons.

The couch man vanishes into the morning sky, slowly fading into the clouds.

Ghostrider hovers in place, smoking slightly.

Covered in feathers.

With a single piece of toast stuck to his antenna.

Dead silence on comms.
 Then Ghostrider says, quietly, “Tell no one.”

Striker replies, “Too late, buddy. This is going on a t-shirt.”

Connor collapses backward onto Vanguard, wheezing.

Ghostrider sighs. “I’m never gonna live this down, am I?”

Vanguard says, “Hey Sentinel. Update the team name: The Sofa Slayers. ”

“Done,” I reply. “Updating banner.”

And for the first time, Ghostrider—the most advanced gunship in the sky—learned that nothing in this world can prepare you for airborne furniture and toast-based humiliation. 12:00 PM. 77°F.",1,1745496519.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

I’m particularly interested in international trade and energy on the regulatory side (law school experience/internships) and complex lit on the litigation side (clerkship experience). 

The past couple months, I’ve been networking my ass off. Cold emails, alumni coffee connections throughout the city, etc. That being said, I’m not quite sure how to make the jump from the informal networking to the interview offer stage. I didn’t participate in OCI in law school, so I don’t have the great connections with the firms that some applicants do. Further, I’m fully aware of the totally flushed market thanks to the President. As such, I’ve basically been resorting to “hey would it be okay if I drop your name in my cover letter?” and hoping something sticks. It all seems so surface level and performative.

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there’s high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""It was literally raining pebbles!""  
**A2)** ""A couple of years ago you visited Scotland with a friend of yours, didn't you?"" (use passato remoto)  
**A3)** ""To be fair, we didn't go either""  

**B1)** ""Non mi pare, no""  
**B2)** ""E tu da dove salti fuori, piccolino? Tutto solo soletto…""  
**B3)** ""S'i' fosse foco, arderei 'l mondo"" (Cecco Angiolieri)  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

I didn’t want to pay for a full subscription right away, so I started checking free VPN Reddit threads to see what works well on iPadOS. I tried ProtonVPN first since it always shows up on best free VPN Reddit posts. It connected easily and the app looks clean on iPad, but the server selection is limited in the free version and the speeds were hit-or-miss. Then I gave Windscribe a shot and honestly liked it more—more server choices, solid speed, and the interface scales nicely on iPad. I’m still just using the free tier for now, mostly for casual browsing and checking email.

Then found the roaches pictured and texted a friend who confirmed those were pepper spots from roaches, and said check behind the fridge — which shows more of the same. He did confirm it looks like it’s treated id we haven’t seen any alive. Also said they should’ve cleaned it and that we would need to use bleach/disinfectant to clean up what’s left.

We’ve begun cleaning some, after we already requested the landlord company clean it again and they just wiped the shelves down without removed them or vacuuming, etc. Is there a path for reimbursement for cleaning services because we spent 3 hours last night cleaning just to get the pantry cupboard and one smaller cabinet clean. Most of them in the kitchen are like this and grease/oil is still covering tops of cabinets everywhere.

I was diagnosed with 7 small fibroids in September 2024. The biggest one was 3 cm in diameter. Since then, I have been taking a lot of supplements and, in particular, I have been taking EGCG (300 mg), vitamin D3 (4000 units), and magnesium and B6 vitamin (5 mg) daily. I was also taking NAC (first 300 mg, then I switched to 600 mg daily). I based the EGCG+B6+vitaminD3 protocol on existing published scientific research which is rather easy to find. Importantly, the EGCG that I have been taking is a decaffeinated standardized one (94% purity at least). I stopped drinking coffee and black tea almost completely (and I ate almost no sweets at all). I just had another ultrasound and my fibroids shrank over the last 7 months. The biggest one is 1.5 cm in diameter now. So, it shrank by 50%. I hope it helps someone out there.

  
p.s. Please, beware that EGCG is not safe for liver at doses higher than 800 mg daily. Also, the studies that reported success with shrinking fibroids used the dosage that I went for: 300 mg per day (split into 2 doses of 150 mg) and it proved effective.",1,1745495959.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False

The 199 spot is a new kid on the block in Danish Nagar, and while their overall dining experience might not be hitting all the right notes just yet, they've definitely found a winning formula in their fast food offerings and, especially, their cold coffee.

Let's be upfront: the general dining experience here needs some work. If you're looking for a full, sit-down meal that wows, this might not be your go-to place right now. However, don't write them off completely!

Where the 199 spot truly shines is in their quick bites. Their fast food menu seems to be on point, delivering satisfying flavors and textures. And the real star of the show? Their cold coffee! It's apparently something special, a must-try that could easily become a regular order.

Being new, the 199 spot has the potential to grow and improve. They've clearly got some strengths to build upon.

Verdict: If you're in the Danish Nagar area and craving some tasty fast food or an exceptional cold coffee, the 199 spot is worth checking out. You can conveniently order from them on Zomato or find their exact location by searching ""Danish nagar"" on Google. Give them a try and see for yourself what their fast food and cold coffee hype is all about! They're new, so your support could help them refine their offerings and become a neighborhood .

He has 300+ clients and sees that what we’re doing here with DBR + AI, could easily add a $50k-$100k/m revenue stream to his biz.

Based on what he’s seen, he thinks around 5% - 10% of his current clients are suitable.

Now, 15 - 30 good DBR clients… that’s easily a multi-7-figure biz all on its own.

BUT…

I, respectfully, think this guy has got it wrong.

Here’s why.

I’m pretty confident that he’s assessing the suitability of his current clients through a singular lens...

Database Reactivation.

Sure, DBR is our no-brainer, foot-in-the-door offer.

And we use this to get clients on to a demo.

But, once we’re on the demo, if we find out the client doesn’t have enough leads in their database or they’ve not got the right opt-in permissions…

We can easily pivot and transition the call away from DBR to something that’s a better fit.

If they are a smaller client that struggles to hit their leads within 5 minutes

…we can sell them a “Speed to Lead Android”

If they are a medium-large client that doesn’t have an old database of leads, but generates lots of new leads that are worked by a sales team

…we can sell them a “48 Hour Android”

This is not me saying ""sell an Android to every client you come across"" - no matter what.

Some clients won’t be fit for ANY of our Androids.

They may buy their leads from data lists.

They might be a pain in the ass or jerks to work with.

We are still the CHOOSERS at the end of the day, not the chosen.

We just don’t want to be too hasty or make any false presumptions that there’s no money in an AI deal unless it’s for DBR.

I almost made this mistake 12 months ago.

Thankfully, I took a shower 45 minutes before a coffee date…

…and had the lightbulb moment to ask the client for their 48-hour-old leads instead.

This client pays us a $10k/m retainer + performance bonus and has done so, for the last 12 months.

That’s a hell of a lot of money (well over $100k) to have left on the table.

If you’re only pitching DBR, you could be making the same $100k mistake.

- Listen to an affirmation podcast 
- Walk to local cafe for coffee (or drive if I have to go to the office)

Breakfast is often skipped.

I am in the process on working on a guest list for people to feature on a new monthly podcast/vlogcast type show I'm calling Khanversations - The format is really simple, combining styles from other shows around the world like Lex Fridman, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Event Horizon etc but keeping it UK focused and casual/informal in order to also help engage and retain interest for a younger audience and maybe inspire them into the types of career each guest might be leading. But beyond that it's a platform for featured guests to let loose and just be themselves and their their experiences with viewers/listeners regardless of background or politics.

The outreach for the project is two-fold, to satisfy the car enthusiast community (since each khanversation will be recorded inside my car whilst driving around and getting guest reactions) as well as the actual guest-interest from the wider audience, whether they are an academic working on something cool, or a career professional who has done or is still doing cool and interesting things. I'd be very interested in featuring futurists too as this is the world we are now living in.

I've tried to reach out to Portsmouth University through usual contact channels but these seem exclusively geared toward students and people wanting to join the Uni as opposed to enquiries like this, hence now reaching out via here.

I am already in collaborative talks with Motiv8 South to get valuable insight from the youth groups so am happy with this.

I'd also be interested in featuring members of the elderly community, especially veterans who are able to share their life stories in a Khanversation - Everyone has a story and I've always been fascinated by people who share them from time to time when i catch an interview in a documentary and so on.

My view is to start filming at least 5 episodes over the summer to early Autumn and publish them, as the platform and interest grows, this gets ramped up and the format and style remains consistent.

As someone who thrives on a smooth, less acidic coffee to kickstart the morning, this nifty cold brew coffee maker has certainly made its mark. The promise of a homebrewing solution that would keep things as simple as fill, brew, and enjoy was too tempting to resist. There's a lot to love about this product, but there are also a few quirks worth talking about.

**Modern and Functional Design**  
This cold brew maker isn’t just functional—it’s also stylish. The minimalist black design adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen counter, and its compact size is perfect for small spaces. The durable BPA-free Tritan pitcher ensures long-term use, while the airtight lid has been a lifesaver in preventing spills. One standout detail for me is the silicone easy-grip handle, which makes pouring a breeze. I’ve had my fair share of coffee pitchers with slippery handles, and this feature alone gives the product extra points. Plus, it fits snugly into most refrigerator doors, making it ultra-convenient.

**How Does It Perform?**  
Brewing with this coffee infuser is almost a meditative experience. You simply add your favorite coffee grounds into the fine-mesh filter, fill the pitcher with water, and let it steep overnight. The result? A delightfully smooth, full-bodied cold brew with significantly less acidity than traditional hot coffee brewing methods. What pleasantly surprised me the most is that the fine-mesh filter does an excellent job of keeping grounds out of the coffee, unlike other cold brew machines I’ve tried. On the rare occasion when I’m craving hot coffee, this pitcher handles hot temperatures equally well without warping. Talk about versatility!

**Advantages**  
The highlights of this coffee maker are undeniable:  
- The reusable fine-mesh filter keeps every cup grit-free.   
- Its BPA-free Tritan construction feels incredibly durable.  
- The airtight lid locks in flavor and prevents messes.  
- The product is a breeze to clean and dishwasher-friendly (top rack).  

[Find the best price for Takeya 10310 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00ffly64u/)

**Drawbacks You Should Know About**  
While the Takeya cold brew maker works wonders, it’s not without its flaws.  
- The 1-quart size may feel limited if you brew coffee for a larger household.  
- The handle, while grippy, could be better balanced when pouring.  
- Air bubbles occasionally get trapped in the fine-mesh filter during brewing, which can disrupt the soaking process.  

**Competitive Options for Cold Brew Lovers**  
In terms of competitors, the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker holds its own remarkably well. Compared to the Hario Mizudashi, the Takeya wins for fridge-friendly design and its durable build quality, though the Hario may edge out slightly in flavor clarity. On the other end, the OXO Brew Cold Brew Coffee Maker boasts a better capacity and enhanced filtering process but is bulky and unsuitable for tight spaces. Takeya strikes a happy balance between affordability, ease of use, and functionality. It’s not the most premium option out there, but it does the job better than most midrange competitors.

**Quality for Price Assessment**  
This coffee maker leans heavily into approachable pricing while offering both quality and convenience. It’s not what I’d call a high-end product, but that’s where its strength lies—it provides everything you need without unnecessary frills or frustrations. For casual coffee drinkers or anyone new to cold brewing, this is a great way to dip your toes without committing to a pricier, more elaborate setup. The investment feels justified considering how quickly it’s integrated into my daily routine and eliminated the need to grab overpriced cold brew from coffee shops.

Chapter 1

The rainy season had begun. Heavy raindrops struck the dry ground, and the small clouds of dust they raised disappeared as the rain grew stronger.

Tara Thayer held the last of the bedding covers tightly as she rushed through the downpour toward the villa. The sudden storm had given her no time to grab an umbrella.

Instead, she sprinted outside to rescue the sheets she had left drying in the open. Now, with the bedding safely inside, her clothes and hair were damp from the rain.

She looked out at the relentless rain and exhaled slowly. Even now, she could hardly believe what had happened—that she had somehow crossed into another world.

Only the day before, she had transmigrated into the villainess' body—a character from a story revolving around a pampered female lead. By the time she arrived, the original owner of the body had already died of a sudden illness in her room.

In this book, the female lead worked as a live-in housekeeper for a famous boy band. Her warmth and kindness gradually healed the four members, making her their beloved favorite.

The villainess held the same job, but her reputation couldn't have been more different. She'd shamelessly flirted with the boy band members, earning their utter disdain.

Later, consumed by jealousy over the female lead's bond with the men, the villainess repeatedly tried to sabotage her. Instead of succeeding, she only made the men more sympathetic toward the female lead.

In the end, they expelled the villainess from the villa. When her schemes were exposed, she became a hated figure, scorned by everyone.

Tara wanted to leave right then and there—to get away from the boy band and the female lead. But the original host's contract still had six months left, and she couldn't quit until then.

Breaking the contract early meant paying a massive penalty, and the original host hadn't been wealthy enough to afford it.

Tara was usually laid-back, but the thought of paying that fine made her think that she'd rather die again than deal with it. Left with no other option, she decided to keep the job.

She avoided the privileged boy band, limited her interactions with the female lead, and spoke only when necessary. If she remained cautious, she might just make it through these six months in one piece.

Heavy rain poured over the garden, the fierce wind driving slanted sheets of water. Despite it being midday, the sky was so dark that it seemed ready to split with lightning.

Footsteps approached from behind Tara. When she turned, she spotted a young woman in the same uniform gathering the bedding and walking past her into the villa without so much as a glance. It was as if speaking to her were a complete waste of time.

Tara knew that everyone in the villa disliked the original owner of this body. She gave the young woman's retreating figure a brief, indifferent look before examining her own damp uniform.

The black and white fabric was half-transparent where it clung to her fair skin. Her exposed legs looked softly luminous in the dim light.

Tara adjusted the wet hem of her skirt. She'd have to go back to her room and change. She couldn't work like this, soaked to the skin.

She had taken just a few steps toward the right side of the first floor when hurried footsteps sounded from the entrance.

Gemma Wolpert, the manager, called out sharply, ""Tara, come help.""

Without waiting for a reply, Gemma turned and rushed back outside, her face and movements tense with urgency. Tara reluctantly followed Gemma, her uniform still uncomfortably damp.

Outside, the earlier downpour had lightened to a drizzle. The villa's garden, vibrant and rain-soaked, looked almost dreamy in the mist, but Tara had no time to appreciate it.

A luxury van was parked at the entrance. Gemma pulled the door open, and two assistants stepped out, their expressions strained as they struggled to support a tall, drunken man between them.

Even together, they could barely keep his unsteady, six-foot-two-inch frame upright. Gemma grew visibly impatient as she watched the assistants falter.

""Stop standing around. Help us get Lance to his room,"" she ordered, gesturing for Tara to step in.

Tara didn't want to touch Lance Swain, but at that moment, she had no choice but to help carry him inside. When she saw the others holding Lance by the arms, she stepped behind him. Her hands hesitated as she wondered how she was meant to help in that situation.

Lance frowned, his handsome face tense with annoyance as he tried to push them away. But his drunken body swayed, forcing him backward.

Just as Tara moved to guide him from behind, he stumbled back. She quickly pressed her hands against the firm muscles of his lower back to stop him from falling onto her.

The warmth of her touch seeped through the thin fabric, brushing his sensitive waist. Lance lowered his head, a quiet groan escaping his lips. The others, too focused on keeping him upright, didn't notice.

Tara didn't hear it either. Still feeling uncomfortable, she nudged him forward. Fortunately, they managed to get him into the room on the second floor without any trouble.

Gemma released her hold and wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. They couldn't let Lance fall. How would she ever face the Swain family if he got hurt?

""Alright. One person should stay and watch over him,"" Gemma told Tara, who was still breathing heavily.

Tara looked confused. She was catching her breath, silently complaining about how Lance, though he appeared lean, was actually tall and solid. Carrying him up the stairs had been exhausting.

""Me?"" She pointed at herself, surprised.

The two assistants walked out of the room without question. Then, Gemma remembered something. Someone had mentioned to her recently that Tara might be ""a little too forward"".

Gemma hesitated before saying, ""You shouldn't handle this alone. Get Stella to help you.""

She was certain that nothing inappropriate would happen with two housekeepers present.

Tara agreed without argument. She texted Stella Lyttle, the female lead, requesting her to come to the second floor.

As for herself, Tara needed to find time to go downstairs and change into a fresh uniform. Her current one was damp, and it was making her miserable.

Gemma observed Tara, initially considering whether to fire her. But now, when she observed that Tara had shown no signs of any hidden interest in Lance, she hesitated.

Earlier, when Gemma had told Tara to take care of Lance, Tara had reacted with surprise. And when Gemma changed her instructions and told Tara to call Stella instead, Tara didn't appear disappointed at all. She quickly agreed, as though she wanted to avoid any delay.

Gemma frowned, confused, then decided to let it go for now. Hiring live-in housekeepers required thorough vetting, and with one recently dismissed and no replacement yet, she couldn't afford to lose another. She would need to revisit the issue later.

Soon, Gemma and the two assistants left, leaving only Tara and Lance, who was now lying on the couch in the room.

Tara's gaze drifted to Lance, who was stretched out on his back with his shirt slightly undone. His right leg rested on the couch while the other dangled off the edge.

His hair was a little messy, but it only added to his appeal, lending him a relaxed, seductive air. For a few seconds, her mind went blank.

Meanwhile, Lance creased his brow and slowly turned over on the couch.

Earlier, when the group had helped Lance inside, someone must have bumped into the coffee table in front of the couch. If Lance rolled off, he would likely hit his head on it.

Tara felt a jolt of alarm. She immediately pushed the coffee table away, its legs screeching against the floor, and grabbed Lance just before he could fall.

Before she could even marvel at her quick reflexes, Lance's hand closed around her wrist, pulling her down with him. She lost her balance and landed on the floor beneath him, his body pressing against hers as the subtle spice of his cologne filled her senses.

Her vision blurred momentarily, the impact driving the breath from her lungs. Then, she felt Lance's exhale, warm against her neck, sending a rush of heat over her skin.

Tara's neck and ears were unbearably sensitive. She shoved against him, but his weight held her firmly in place, solid and unyielding.

""Lance… get up. You're suffocating me,"" she gasped.

But no matter how hard she pushed, he didn't move. It was as if he'd already sunk into a drunken sleep.

Chapter 2

Tara kept trying to push Lance away, but her arms were trapped under his weight. She shoved with all her might, but he didn't budge. She wasn't strong enough to free herself.

No matter how hard she tried, nothing worked. His warm breath brushed against her neck, and her heart raced uncontrollably. She didn't know what to do.

Then, the door swung open. Stella walked in and stopped dead. There was Lance, his tall frame pinning Tara to the floor by the couch, completely still. Stella stood there, stunned.

""You two—"" Her voice faltered as she spoke, and her expression was filled with hurt.

Lance was the guy she'd been crushing on, and the sight of this scene before her felt like a knife through her heart.

Still trapped beneath Lance, Tara heard the door open and Stella's voice. Relief washed over her, and she quickly raised her voice in desperation.

""Q-Quick! Help me get him off. I can't breathe!""

Although Tara couldn't see Stella's expression, she pleaded urgently. Her urgency wasn't just because of the lack of air. His weight pressed heavily on her chest, making it ache.

She figured that Lance must have been completely drunk as he was lying on top of her with the full weight of his body.

Stella snapped out of her daze and rushed over to help. After some struggle, they finally managed to push Lance aside. Tara scrambled out from under him, gasping for breath, her limbs prickling from the weight that had trapped her for so long.

""Thank you,"" Tara said.

Stella looked at Tara, whose hair and clothes were slightly disheveled. Yet, the latter still looked effortlessly beautiful. Her striking, radiant features were the kind that made people stare.

Even though nothing had actually happened between Tara and Lance, Stella couldn't shake the unease tightening in her chest.

""You're welcome,"" Stella answered, her smile faint.

Tara smiled back tiredly. She was completely drained after helping Lance up the stairs, getting trapped under him, and using all her strength to push him away.

She glanced at him, still unconscious on the couch. She decided that he could just stay there as she didn't want to risk waking him again.

""Stella, my clothes are wet. I'm going downstairs to change,"" Tara said.

She didn't need to check her reflection to know she looked disheveled.

Stella stepped out of the bathroom holding a basin of water and nodded. ""Go change, then come back up.""

Tara nodded. ""Thanks for taking care of things here.""

Stella smiled. However, whether Tara was heading downstairs to change, Stella had no intention of letting her near Lance again.

Tara didn't dwell on it. She smoothed her wrinkled uniform and decided that it would have to do for now as she left the room. She had no interest in befriending Stella, so staying polite would suffice.

The door shut quietly behind Tara. As she reached the stairwell, she stopped halfway when footsteps echoed from below.

Glancing down, she spotted Soren Farrell in casual workout clothes, his sports headphones draped around his neck. His handsome features held an easy confidence, lending him an air of charm and mischief.

His sharp gaze swept over her in silent appraisal when he noticed her. Tara's uniform was slightly rumpled, the damp patches from earlier still clinging to her skin.

The standard black-and-white dress the housekeepers typically wore fell just above the knee, looking modest on most. But her tall frame made the skirt appear shorter, ending mid-thigh.

Tara was used to remarks about her curves getting more attention than her smarts. The uniform clung to her in a way that made her stand out.

Now, her hair was disheveled, her striking face flushed with surprise. The damp fabric hugged her body, accentuating every curve.

A faint blush still colored her neck where Lance's breath had warmed her skin, leaving an unsettling blend of innocence and allure.

Soren's gaze lingered on her as he kept climbing the stairs. Tara hadn't thought that she'd run into him. She hesitated, then shifted to the side to make way.

He walked past her and was about to continue down the hall but stopped. With a slight turn, he faced her, his demeanor aloof and detached. Now, the distance between them was close.

Soren skimmed over her once more before he asked, ""You're the one who upset Jonah the other day, aren't you?""

He'd heard about a housekeeper who brought Jonah Pearson coffee the day before yesterday, then blatantly tried to flirt with him in his room. Jonah had been so annoyed that he'd made her leave.

Remembering the original host's past, Tara understood exactly what Soren was talking about. She gave an awkward nod of acknowledgment. Even as she bowed her head in embarrassment, her beauty was breathtaking.

Soren stood silently, watching her for a long moment before turning away with a quiet scoff as if her efforts to charm Jonah were beneath him.

Tara didn't care about his mockery or his disdain. Soren was just one of the villa's owners. He was nothing more to her. So, what he thought of her didn't matter.

As his figure retreated into the distance, she descended the stairs. She felt uncomfortable in her uniform and needed to get back to her room to change as soon as possible.

Working as a housekeeper here had its advantages. Each live-in housekeeper had their own room, and the pay was generous.

But because the members of the famous boy band didn't want too many live-in housekeepers, only a few were employed. One had even been let go just a few days earlier.

Aside from the live-in housekeepers, other housekeepers would come in to work but would never stay overnight, leaving once their tasks were finished.

Tara hurried downstairs to her room and closed the door behind her. When she walked past the mirror, she paused and turned to study her reflection.

The reflection staring back at her had a slender build, her hair and clothes disheveled but somehow still lovely. She adjusted her skirt. Fortunately, the uniform had inner shorts to prevent accidents. Otherwise, she wouldn't have known how to handle her tasks.

She snatched a clean uniform set and changed, a dull throb pulsing in her temples. Ten minutes later, she stepped out, knowing that she couldn't linger. Then, she rushed back upstairs to Lance's room.

Stella was still cleaning Lance's hands and neck when she heard the door open and close. Her expression darkened.

Tara moved closer without saying a single word. When she saw Stella tending to Lance, she bent down, picked up the basin of warm water, and carried it to the bathroom. She poured it out and refilled it with fresh, warm water.

Stella's expression softened slightly when Tara placed the basin back beside her. Tara didn't notice the change in Stella's expression at all. She just figured that it was time for a fresh basin of warm water.

Even so, she could tell that Stella disliked her being near Lance. The way Stella stiffened when Tara wiped his hands was pretty hard to ignore.

Acting like she hadn't caught onto Stella's defensiveness, Tara plopped down on the couch with nothing to do. She couldn't leave yet since Gemma had asked her and Stella to stay and care for Lance.

Stella was almost done cleaning Lance's hands and neck. With nothing else to do, Tara waited. When Stella finished, Tara quietly took the basin and walked into the bathroom, slowly putting things away.

She wasn't usually slow with her work. She was deliberately taking her time. She didn't feel any need to rush as she had nothing left to do but to watch over Lance.

Tara left the bathroom and returned to her seat. Across from her, Stella ignored her completely. Instead, she kept looking at Lance with soft eyes, occasionally reaching over to fix his hair.

Tara watched the scene, which seemed to glow with quiet affection.

She remembered the original story of the novel—Stella had a crush on Lance and always looked after him, just like she did with the other three guys in the band. That was how she'd managed to win over all four members of the famous boy group.

Resting her chin in her hand, Tara silently observed Stella's tender care toward Lance. Outside, birds and cicadas chirped now and then. The sunlight was harsh, but the room felt cold and silent.

Before long, Tara's eyelids grew heavy. After struggling to stay awake, she sank into the couch and fell fast asleep.",1,1745495154.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Let’s Create a Mug to replace Ember!,"As a die-hard coffee lover, I have high standards for my coffee — it has to be hot! Not lukewarm, not warm, definitely not cold. With a regular mug, I’m always racing against time to finish it before it cools down. Honestly, a cup of coffee only stays hot for about 10 minutes. I have a microwave, but I don’t want to get up every 5-10 minutes to reheat it. Plus, every time I microwave it, the flavor just gets worse.

That’s when I found the Ember Mug, and it completely changed my coffee experience. Now, I can sip slowly, enjoy every drop, and my coffee stays warm for an hour. It’s perfect for carrying around, placing anywhere, and keeping my coffee at the perfect temperature. **I LOVE IT!**

However, Ember Mug isn't perfect. After using it for years and giving multiple feedbacks, the issues still remain unresolved. As an engineer, I just can’t stand using a product with flaws. So, I decided it’s time to design a self-heating mug that’s better than Ember.

Based on my own experience and feedback from other users, I’ve identified some common issues with Ember and come up with potential solutions. I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! Your feedback is super important to us! It won’t take long — just a few minutes. I can’t wait to hear what you think!

* Problems:
   * Battery 1：The battery just doesn’t last long enough. I’ll be sipping coffee in a meeting, and before I know it, it’s gone cold.
   * Battery 2：After use a few times, the battery often dies completely. And there’s no way to replace it. Throwing away the whole mug is expensive, not great for the environment either.
   * App connection：the mug is hard to connect with phone.
   * Coaster：the charging pins are highly prone to failure.
   * Coating：the peeling coating is frequent complaint
   * Capacity： It would be great if the capacity were a bit larger.
   * Temperature settings: A few people feel that the maximum temperature isn't high enough.

**———————————————————————————————————————————————**

Here are some creative iteration ideas for improving the product:

* Battery Improvement:
   * **Replaceable Battery:** If you’re away from the Coaster for a while, just swap in a spare battery to keep your mug running longer.
   * **Prolonged Lifespan:** When the battery's performance starts to decline，replace it to prolong the life of your mug instead of replacing the whole thing

It’s been like my childhood thing and now I am 37 years old it is time take lose the bad habits from my past. So I did and it is going great accept for 2 things.

1 is like a moving pain in my left side. The pain can be in my buttocks, bit also moving up in my back and go down to my knee. It is really hard to pin point it and one day it is worse than another day. I can still use everything like doing hard work, heavy lifting everything, but if I go for a walk, it can hurt really much. 

But also if I overused my arms, i can get really though shoulder pain and not in a way that’s the usual muscle pain after a workout. 

So I have read about inflammation and joint pain. I was thinking about my nerve system is being damaged or under the influence of sadness and everything that comes with quitting a couple of things at ones.

But then my second issue is I can feel everything I eat. Sometimes I think I feel shoulder / back pain after I have eaten something. And because of the slow bowel system I can feel it there and feel my hips hurt when I need to poop but havent went in 3 days because of the constipation.

So I dont know if one thing is influencing the other or the other way around. I want to feel better, but feel so shitty most of the time. My doctors here are not so helpful, cause they dont take time for you and dont have experience with these things.

Does anybody have any clue whats maybe going on? Do I have to sit out the time and hope for better. Oh yeah I am healthy, eatting good and exercise enough.",0,1745494538.0,quittingsmoking,1,0.5,False

✅ **One curated match per week**  
🎯 Based on your goals, background, and intent  
💬 One high-signal conversation that *actually feels worth your time*

No spam. No endless coffee chats. Just one intro that matters.

So far, early users (consultants, indie hackers, freelancers, PMs, and solo founders) have used it to:

* Meet collaborators
* Explore side projects
* Get early customer insight
* Find advisors or growth partners

💬 I’d love your input as I validate this:

* Would *you* use something like this?
* What kind of person would you want to be matched with each week?
* What would make a professional intro feel **worth it** to you?
* How often would be ideal — weekly, bi-weekly, monthly?

From cartoons. From songs on the radio. From my mother’s sighs in the other room.
But I was wrong. I learned it from you.

It was the way you held your coffee like it had weight.
The way your voice changed when you read Steinbeck out loud.
You didn’t look at me when I played guitar for you, but I could feel you listening.
I took that silence and folded it into something holy.

You taught me how to love by not loving me.
That’s what made it pure.

I remember every time you laughed at something I said—not because it was funny, but because you were surprised I noticed. You never expected anyone to notice. But I did. I always did. I saw the chipped polish on your pinky nail and the way you corrected your posture before speaking. I saw your entire world in those tiny corrections.

When you wrote “good work” in the margin of my essay, I printed it out and pinned it above my bed.
You could have said anything, and I would’ve carried it like scripture.
You did say some things—mostly gentle, mostly unintentional—and I still carry all of them.

There’s a part of me that still believes you loved me back.
Not in a way that would get you in trouble.
Just in the quiet way we love stray things we don’t know how to keep.

You told me once that I was “too young to feel so much.”
But you were the one who taught me how to feel.
I didn’t know love could ache without touching.
That it could sweat under the skin, in the places no one else can reach.

I loved you like a secret.
And now I love you like a ruin.

But even now, I want you to know: I’m still trying.
To love like you taught me—quietly, brilliantly, tragically.
The way light breaks through blinds in the afternoon and no one says anything.
The way a ballerina keeps dancing after the music ends.

Thank you for giving me the outline of something real,
even if you were only tracing it in chalk.

1k6pqnd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6pqnd,Guide to self-host and visualize your Garmin Data with open source projects,"✅ **Please check out the project :** [**https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana**](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana)

# Features

* Automatic data collection from Garmin
* Collects comprehensive health metrics including:
   * Heart Rate Data
   * Hourly steps Heatmap
   * Daily Step Count
   * Sleep Data and patterns
   * Sleep regularity (Visualize sleep routine)
   * Stress Data
   * Body Battery data
   * Calories
   * Sleep Score
   * Activity Minutes and HR zones
   * Activity Timeline (workouts)
   * GPS data from workouts (track, pace, altitude, HR)
   * And more...
* Automated data fetching in regular interval (set and forget)
* Historical data back-filling

Feel free to give it a try and go through the [setup process ](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#install-with-docker-recommended)(relatively easy and detailed if you are familiar with Linux and Docker). It's been tested with many people and I have resolved 40+ issues in the last week. You can [fetch your old data ](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#historical-data-fetching-bulk-update)from the Garmin connect server as well to visualize the trends on Grafana with this tool. This release is currently considered as stable release.

The setup uses docker but you can deploy it on Unraid with `Docker Compose Manager` and on proxmox with `docker-lxc`. This is a perfect tool for self-hosters who have existing InfluxDB or Grafana setup. if you are a newcomer, don't be scared to give it a try, the [README guide](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana) is extremely thorough and beginner friendly. You do not need to deploy the full stack if you are running InfluxDB or grafana already, it will integrate with your existing services. 

# What are the advantages?

1. You keep a local copy of your data, and the best part is it's set and forget. The script will fetch future data as soon as it syncs with your Garmin Connect - No action is necessary on your end. 

2. You are not limited by the visual representation of your data by Garmin app. You own the raw data and can visualize however you want - combine multiple matrices on the same panel? what to zoom on a specific section of your data? want to visualize a weeks worth of data without averaging values by date? this project got you covered!

3. You can play around your data in various ways to discover your potential and what you care about more. 

# Love this project?

It's **Free for everyone** to setup and use. If this works for you and you love the visual, a **word of support** here or [**giving me a coffee** ](https://ko-fi.com/arpandesign)will be very appreciated. I spend a lot of my free time to develop and work on future updates + resolving issues, often working late-night hours on this. You can [**star the repository** ](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana)as well to show your appreciation.

Please **share your thoughts on the project in comments or private chat** and I look forward to hearing back the users.

# Future Plans

I have plans for integration of local LLM (like Olamma) with a MCP to enable it talk directly to the backend database. That way, you can chat with the LLM who is aware of your long term health data. I think it has a lot more potential than Garmin's current connect+ implementation

**Your support for this project is highly appreciated** as it motivates me to spend more of my free time on projects like these ones. 

# FAQ

**- Why you don't host this and offer it as a service for less tech savvy people?**

1. **Data Security and liability** : I am a single person and a biologist by profession. Offering this service will require good infrastructure and around the clock support. Also I need to make sure the collected data (yes, your health data is very sensitive) is protected against any kind of attacks online. As soon as there are many users on a service, it becomes a good target for such activities. I currently can't ensure the safety of your data (while you pay me to keep the service running) so I consider myself ineligible for providing this service.

But with the LLM tools and the available documentation, I actually know people who was able to deploy this without prior docker knowledge. So if you are really excited about the visual, that might help.

2. **Privacy first Ideology :** The primary objective of this project was to build this free and open source, so that you stay in control of your data without giving it to any 3rd party. I can't break my own goal by being the service provider and start charging people for this.

Isa sa mga nakausap namin sabi masyado pa raw maaga and it might not be worth the additional burden that comes with becoming a registered business.

🔗 [**LadyTrader X Space Recording**](https://x.com/kenduinu/status/1914363954844852314?s=46)

Okay, so massive shout out to [u/barnickal](https://www.reddit.com/user/barnickal/) for taking detailed notes of the most recent Kendu X Space! Also a huge shout out to [LadyTraderRA ](https://x.com/LadyTraderRa)for hosting this awesome X Space! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It's a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you're expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you're not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.

**From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection**

Let’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving.

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

[Kendu Energy Promo Video](https://reddit.com/link/1k6ppqg/video/b8mmwu1norwe1/player)

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/7u8q5fnoorwe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac3bcd4ee229fd6a0b7caafaabe0f88c45d7893f)

**No Roadmap, Just Vision**

Kendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.

**Different From Other Meme Coins**

Kendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.

**The Builders Speak**

The people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.

[Josh](https://x.com/JoshKendu): ''*I've never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.*''

[Kevin](https://x.com/_KEVINFINNERTY): ''*The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can't build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a 'company' like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions.*''

[Jeff ](https://x.com/LowQ_eth)(Co-Host): ''*KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it's sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.*''

**TL;DR**

Kendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.

During the relationship we felt like everything was great, except for issues with her sexuality. We tried a lot of methods, therapies etc., I thought it was because of her traumatic childhood, but a year ago she has stated that it was because she has never actually felt sexual attraction to me and we need to breakup. 

It was soon after she has met this guy (23M), while we were exploring polyamory (as a way to trespass our issues). Couple month before I had my first, very short polyamorous relationship and I was very honest about it. I was constantly making sure that all parties (incl. her) was feeling okay, was doing constant checks etc. She claims up to this day that she felt supported and okay with that and I was very respectful and mature with this. She later get into even shorter relationship with this guy. She started abusing the rules (she was pushing me to leave my flat to meet with him there, was deeply invested emotionally with him forgeting about my needs and wellbeing, and me in general (I feel it was like a cheating beacuse of that)), and soon after their first experiences she broke up with me, because ""she felt something with him, she has never felt with me"". I was devastated, lost my job in the process, their relationship dissolved, we discussed things with her and decided to try to heal, find help and fight for our relationship.

It was a rocky period, every couple of weeks she had a strong emotional state about not being sure about us, then the rest of the time it was completely okay, she was happy and we were close as always. However we got into crisis just before end of the year, we decided to separate and think about our future. Not long after, when she was visiting me she decided she want us to get back together, go to therapy and untangle those issues. After just couple of sessions we had discussion and decided to finally break up due to sexual incompatibility and become a close friends, supporting each other during this process.

She has started to look for a room (she has family abuse history and didn't want to get back to her parents), while still living at my place (I was completely okay with that). Then we went to my friend's birthday and this guy was there. After couple of drinks they suddenly went out together outside without telling me anything and I felt kinda retraumatised seeing that. Soon after I went after them, confronted them and they stated they just clarify their old relationship. I decided to give them time. Later this night, when I was returning home (I stayed out a bit longer), she has told me he called her and they met again in park. There was a strong chemistry between them there, they were holding hands etc. When I learned about it I felt furious, used and treated like a piece of trash. 

She claimed then, she think about meeting with him on coffee when she moves out, to see if he has changed and if there's a possibility of them getting back on tracks. Meanwhile she want us to still be close friends and want me to accept that, because we are no longer together and she has right to meet with whoever she wants. I told her I do not mind anyone else but this very person. She however believes that I would feel the same just about anyone. 

We got into argument, I stated that I have enough being treated like a trash and she needs to decide, she want to have in her future life me, her longtime friend and ex-partner or this guy she barely know. We came to the agreement that she is gonna go to the therapy session next week and afterwards decide. If she do not dump this idea about him, she needs to move out and I want to go no contact, also I do not feel that the friendship is going to be possible in this scenario.

I feel devasted that she's even consider choosing some vague possibility of him over me, I feel it's absurd, cruel, illogical and humiliating. She's my closesed friend, we have deep connection, we still, even after breakup, was telling that we love each other, we are just incompatible. I don't know how to wrap my mind about all of this. The process of separation with her is very hard for me (I'm autistic) even without all of this. I feel like even my breakup is being stolen by this guy and I can't comprehend why she is doing something like that to me.",1,1745493632.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

Just sharing my experience in case it helps anyone planning a trip to Chiang Mai during Songkran next year.

I spent Songkran in Chiang Mai this year and, while I was really looking forward to it, I found the reality quite different from what I expected. The celebration is iconic and can be a lot of fun, but it also gets old very fast.

**What you’re told about Songkran:**

* Stick around the Old City Gate or Nimman if you want to get wet and be part of the fun.
* Wearing a flowery shirt means you’re fair game.
* The water fights generally wind down when the sun sets.

**The reality:**

* **It starts early.** I was soaked just walking to dinner on the night of the 12th — and ate in wet clothes after sundown.
* **There’s no escaping it.** Even outside the hotspots or in quieter neighbourhoods, you’re still likely to be drenched by passing cars or people outside shops.
* **Every outing becomes a mission.** Grabbing a coffee? Walking through a market with a drink or snack? Expect to be hit with water and sometimes muddy puddle splashes. Yes, even when you’re clearly not participating.

**My take:**

I joined the fun on the 13th near the Old City moat; water gun, powder, bright shirt, the full works. It was a great laugh *when* I was actively participating. But there seems to be no etiquette. People shoot water at anyone, anywhere, even into restaurants or at others clearly not involved. That lack of boundary really soured the experience for me.

**In short:** If you go to Chiang Mai during Songkran, be prepared to do nothing but get soaked, for five days straight. You won’t be able to enjoy markets, cafés, shopping, or sightseeing without constantly getting drenched. It’s chaotic, and while it can be fun in short bursts, it quickly wears thin.

Personally, I’d recommend avoiding Chiang Mai during this time unless you *only* want to join the water fights. Otherwise, it’s a tough few days to enjoy the city.",1,1745493337.0,ThailandTourism,8,0.57,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

She tried to reconnect with me. ""Let's go for a walk,"" she said. ""Let's talk about our future."" I told her I couldn't because my RAG system wasn't retrieving relevant results and I needed to optimize my prompt chain. She asked if I could still find my heart.

Then came the endless dependency updates. I ran pip install -U langchain and boom! Everything is wrong! I spent eight hours debugging compatibility issues with the new version, checking documentation while opening issues on GitHub. She walked in, looked at me surrounded by dozens of browser tabs and terminal windows, and whispered, ""Is this... is this who you are now?""

She left that night. Said she was going to ""find someone who doesn't treat conversation models as their best friend."" Last week, she sent divorce papers.

I try to do 3-4 week-long solo trips per year (have a full-time job and responsibilities so just have to use my holiday as best as I can!), and generally find that I can get through a journey at a pace which many commentors seem to dismiss as ""too fast"" or ""tickbox tourism"".

When travelling solo, I won't eat in restaurants, I'll just grab coffee and a sandwich on the go. I'll then hit 30-40k paces in a day and explore on foot, and occasionally dip into local trams/buses. Usually leaves me feeling I've ""seen"" a medium-sized city in a day.

As an example, I'm just booking an 8 day trip in September. First half of the week based in Madrid (which I've been to a couple of times) to visit Avila, Segovia and Toledo. Then spend the second half in Sevilla, including a day trip to Cordoba.

To me this seeems a perfectly resonable itinerary, but many people seem to consider this ""rushed"". Is this a byproduct of travelling solo, that I'm not stopping for hours in restaurants/bars, but just focusing on what I want to see?

The next morning, her alarm went off at least five times. Loud. Annoying. Snoozed every time. I figured if she was stressed enough to talk about the exam, maybe she’d be responsible enough to, I don’t know… get up for it?

I had class at 9, so I got ready, made coffee, and left. Didn’t say anything to her. She ended up sleeping through her final and is now LIVID at me for not waking her up. Like… full-blown meltdown. Said I could’ve “just knocked” or “shaken her awake.”

I told her (politely) that I’m not her mom, and it’s not my job to micromanage her alarm clock. She said I let her fail “on purpose,” which… okay. Not sure what she expected when I barely even know her routine.

Now she’s told some mutuals I’m “selfish” and “could’ve saved her GPA.” One of them even hinted that I should feel guilty. For real? I just stayed in my lane.

So I get my coffee at Sam's Club because you can get Starbucks espresso roast for one third the price of at Starbucks.

Yesterday, I did this because I needed a new bag. 

So, they had a palette of coffee with two bags on top. These bags are huge btw. 

Anyway, I look at the full palette and the expiration date is September 2025. I smile because that's pretty damn fresh since it's not even May yet. 

To see what a good deal I'm getting, I look at one of the loose bags on top of the palette.

I expect August. 

Well, the thing says October 2025!!

1k6pfp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/KLeague/comments/1k6pfp1/notes_from_the_basement_namyangju/,Notes From The Basement: Namyangju,"I intended to watch a match in Namyangju a couple of weeks ago, but put it off in favour of watching HL Anyang claim their 9th Asia League Ice Hockey title. Now that there is no more hockey, and I’m off to watch the as-yet-unbeaten K4 League leaders. They’ll face the quiet challengers, Pyeongtaek Citizen FC. 

Note, Namyangju’s “English” name on their emblem is Namyangju FC, but their Korean name translates to Namyangju Citizen FC. Like Pyeongtaek and most K3-K4 League teams, Nanyangju are a citizen club, owned and operated by the city council.

As the season progresses, I’m learning more about the league, teams, and players. Unsurprisingly, Namyangju has the best attacking record in the league. But interestingly, it’s not possible to single out a main scorer. Instead, goal-scoring duties are shared by several players. Players to watch are central midfielder/defender Lee Jin-seop. He has started in every league and cup match, and looking at his minutes, I’m convinced he’s never been subbed off. Interestingly, the team’s top scorer is defender Hong Dong-Gwan, a former Seoul United player. He was on the roster for all 9 matches, but only started three. In the remaining matches, he was subbed on five times and subbed off four times, meaning somewhere he was subbed on and off in the same match. Despite his low playing time, he scored three goals and one assist. Pyeongtaek, in comparison, had one clear scorer, Go Byeong-Beom. He had 6 goals, two more than the next highest scorer in the league. With some knowledge ready, it’s time to head out.

The subway ride to Namyangju is uneventful. I head into Seoul, transfer at Icheon Station, and head out of Seoul. For a while after the transfer, we stay next to the Han River. I come from a country with few large rivers, and what we have are not suitable for travel, hence the lack of cities next to the large rivers. In my home town there is a stream called, laughably, the Monkey River. It’s barely more than a brook, and you can comfortably step over it for most of the year. The Han River is no brook. It’s large and always full, and once again, I wonder where all the water comes from? I understand rain, and I understand snow, but I don't understand this consistent flow when neither rain nor snow is consistent.

After a while, we veer away from the river and enter Eastern Seoul. This part of town isn’t old, but it’s not new either. The brand new, giant apartment blocks are missing, and it’s not saturated with franchised or money bling. The businesses here are settled and patronised by locals with established routines. As fast as Eastern Seoul arrives, it disappears. We pass Seoul Jungnang FC’s home ground just before we enter the tunnel that takes us out of Seoul, into Guri, then on to Namyangju.

Namyangju County is large, and Namyangju City is spread out. Despite being near, um, part of City Hall and Namyangju Sports Complex, I don’t get off at Namyangju Station. I don’t think a Namyangju Station even exists. Go figure. The area between the station and the sports complex is interesting. Much of Korea is same-same with little to distinguish one neighbourhood from another. But this area just feels different. Visually, it should be the same, but it’s not, and I struggle to explain why. The two sides of the train track look different, the apartment buildings seem square rather than rectangular, and there are almost no people around. It’s not bad, just different.

I head to a building I found while studying the map of the area, and I arrive at a large, square, and mostly empty building. This is not what I was expecting. It’s an officetel with the first three floors reserved for businesses. I’m here, so I might as well explore. I climb the escalator in search of a restaurant. The dust tells me it hasn't been used recently, if ever. The first floor looks abandoned. There are no businesses near the escalator, and the only obvious businesses are restaurants in the far corners. They are so far apart that you struggle to even tell what it is on the other side. Occasionally, I pass spaces being prepared for new occupants, but if 10% of the floor is in use, then it’s a lot. I find a restaurant that specialises in dishes made from red beans. They make three different kinds of Patjuk as well as Patbinsu. Lunch is large, but not heavy, and I leave satisfied.

[Lunch, and a useless camera](https://preview.redd.it/tg7vj7t1lrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f689a2efd0326da5199024975a6e9987cdb3338)

Next, I make my way through the quiet streets in search of the stadium and eventually reach the sports complex. So this is where the town’s population resides on a Saturday afternoon? Children are on two baseball fields, and adults are on the third. The football-tennis courts are packed (is that what the game is called?), and more teams are waiting for their turn to play. Even every football field has a game going. One has a match that looks like it has, and I kid you not, a minimum age requirement of 55. On the other side of the football fields, I see the floodlights of the main stadium, and I start making my way to that side. Even this is an adventure, because I have to climb through the field netting, make my way through players getting ready to play, and through three different gates to hit clear air again. And I did this to get across one single field.

[Not a bad view](https://preview.redd.it/o9ga3yv6lrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7491fb866bbb7ee6effdde1da7c19f7136a72e19)

I like the main stadium despite its running track. The slope of the secondary stands is low, and you feel much closer to the game than you are. There are two food trucks just outside the entrance, one selling coffee and one selling expensive roasted meat-on-a-stick. Just past the gate are tables, one of which has cards you can use for the player's signature. I have no idea what the other tables are for. 

[Foodige](https://preview.redd.it/n1ek8hublrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=72641cf415ac0d602b8d6ac948981708d1e11e0d)

Entry is free, and there is no restriction on seating, meaning there is no home and away section. This might seem strange to many football fans, but I grew up in a rugby culture where home and away sections are rare. At a rugby match, a green-clad Springbok supporter will happily sit next to a silver-ferned All Black. I was in Dubai during one of the World Cups and found myself in the South African bar for the South Africa vs England match. The place was packed with Saffers, and sitting front and centre was an English fan wearing his white shirt with the red rose on the chest. Every time England scored, he would turn around and give us the finger, just to be pelted with popcorn and pretzels. We lost, he stayed, and everyone enjoyed the rest of the night.

[Main stand](https://preview.redd.it/1htdpqnglrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e5a9ceeec7a8b0b034d63a1cfb688c3a7d0cb7)

Both sides of the stadium have a roof. The smaller main stand is almost completely covered, while the opposite side is only covered in the centre. The sides which curve around the track’s bends are uncovered. I sit in the “away” section opposite the main stand. The area is a strange mix of Namyangju supporters and drummers, mostly to my right, and Pyeongtaek supporters and a single drummer, mostly to my left. While the players finish their warm-up, I finish my preparations by pouring a bottle of Nurinmaeul makgeolli into my water bottle. I’ll happily drink straight from the plastic bottle, but I get enough looks already. Both drummers are checking their setups, and a few more spectators arrive. Our preparations are accompanied by English language pop music. What kind of event is this? Where is the ever-present K-pop?!

[Opposite](https://preview.redd.it/omd9sa2llrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb56437cdbe17d00f52940932ac3dbdca20190e)

Just before the match starts, players come over with team-branded balls to throw to the crowd. However, with no security to speak of, children rush to the edge of the field and get balls handed to them instead. I was tempted to try my luck and see if they would throw a ball to the white face, but I don’t like drawing attention to myself like this.

[Pyeontaek Support](https://preview.redd.it/egwo95nnlrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=50d66a4032d3c17f65bfff30dc67ad30ed44c14c)

The match starts and the drumming commences on both sides, signalling my cue to head over for a supporter-watching-football photo. I take the first few, turn on my camera’s display to look at the results and… NO SD CARD! I’d been taking photos for the last hour, of the trip, the stadium, and the fans, with no SD card! This was not the first model of the Canon Rebel series, so why does it not warn me before I start taking photos? I settle for capturing a few more photos with my phone, minus the “artistic flair”

[Namyangju Support](https://preview.redd.it/s3ojb15rlrwe1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=23c205455e6613fda6bc49a2ed36eafd5d585ec4)

The match was entertaining despite the scoreline. The first big chance falls to Pyeongtaek. It starts when a ball gets knocked out towards a player waiting on the right wing. He comfortably passes his defender, pushes forward and crosses the ball across the face of goal where an inrushing attacker makes head contact, sending the ball just millimetres over the crossbar. Pyeongtaek would have a few more chances throughout the game, but nothing this good. As the first half ticks on, both the rain and  Namyangju’s dominance intensify. By the time we reach the second half, the match is mostly played in just one half of the field, and spectators are doing their best to stay dry.

It’s a soft rain that’s barely visible. But the light breeze keeps blowing it in under the roof, causing spectators to move further and further back. By the end of the match, almost everyone has abandoned their seats to stand deeper under the roof, while people like me are still sitting, but hiding behind an umbrella like it’s a fortress wall. My umbrella is open, pointing straight ahead, and pulled in as close as is practical. My eyes peek over the rim, and I'm sure I resemble a neighbour spying over a wall. So far, I’ve been to matches in freezing cold, raging winds and torrents of rain. I know this is a season of adventure, but is it too much to ask for a nice day before the blazing sun and stifling humidity of summer arrive? (Sure, Busan was nice, but admitting that would undermine my complaints.)

Pyeongtaek can count themselves lucky to come away from Namyangju with a point and deny Namyangju a sixth win. Namyangju were creating regular chances, hit the uprights twice, and scraped the crossbar at least three times. But this is football, not gymnastics. You win by putting the ball in the net, not by impressing someone next to the field holding a number board. Hopefully, next time I come to Namyangju, I’ll see a result and be able to take proper photos of the day.",3,1745492695.0,KLeague,2,1.0,False

  **Opening**: fruity sweet, but warm. Pretty simplistic, but it works. So far, very good, but getting into my winter top 5 will be a hard challenge, as 70% of my collection is winter, and winter frags are the frags I like the most.  

  **Dry-down**: Not much changed... Still as good as it was before, maybe a touch more Ambery. I know they shouldn't be similar, but it kind of reminds me of SWY, maybe a touch warmer. It's a ""strong like"" for me, not a ""love""... Definitely not at this pricetag. I can get a SWY clone, with the same performance, for almost half the price, and it will scratch the same itch. I like the JPG Scandal perfum (and even the clones for the original EDT version) better than the Absolu I guess. On paper (and watching influencers), this should've been a favorite of mine, but it's only ""very nice"". Performance isn't mind blowing as well. If it was a nuclear performer, or cost $20, I might've gotten it. But at $40, it needs to beat my most expensive and favorite winter frags in either profile or performance ($36 Mercedes Club Black and $27 Khamra Qahwa)... And it's not doing that.  

 **Subjective Scent Score**: 8.3   
 **Longevity**: 8.5h  
 **Projection**: 7.3  
 **Blind buy safety score**:8.7  
 **Unisex Score**: Perfectly unisex IMO.  
 **Value**: 6.0. expensive clone with average performance. Only worth it if you find the profile amazing.  

#Odyssey Dubai Chocolat   

 **Opening**: DAMN... This is AMAZING! The name pretty much says it all. An overdose of milk chocolate, with pistachio and coffee is what I'm getting. Like a visit in an upscale chocolaterie. This is an extremely playful gourmand scent, not something you wear for a job interview. But I can see myself wearing this all day every day at home.  

**Dry-down**: The coffee subsides, and gives way to a nutty accord to join the party... Making it slightly rounder and a hint less playful (so now just ""very very playful"" instead of ""extremely playful""). The rest stays pretty much the same, and I want to eat my wrist!

 **1 hour later**: wahhhh... I'm going nose-blind to it. Now I can't tell you anything except performance, because that one I test with my wife. One of the best scent I've ever had, and THIS I'm going nose-blind to?! The world truly is a cruel place! I'll assume it smells the same though...

 Wife REALLY loves it as well! And fortunately, performance is top notch! Checked every hour from 2ft, and if no scent, 1ft, and if still no scent, 4"" from skin.  
 
 I think this is going to replace my Qahwa as my ""#1 winter scent that has almost no versatility"" when I finish my Qahwa.

 **Subjective Scent Score**: 9.4 (if you think Khamra is too sweet, not a safe blind)  
 **Longevity**: 9.1. 9-10 hours on skin, 12 hours on clothes.  
 **Projection**: 8.8. 2ft-3ft the first hour, then 1ft for 2 hours, then scent trail for another hour or so) 
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.0. This is not a versatile ""easy wear""... You need to love hyper Gourmands.  
 **Unisex Score**: Perfectly unisex.  
  **Value**: 7.5. it's $37, but at least it's nuclear. I'll wait until it drops to about $25-$30 and buy it. My bet is that it's gonna happen in the middle of summer. It already dropped $5-$8 from when it was released.


#Asad Bourbon 

Unfortunately for Asad Bourbon, it was tested right after Dubai Chocolate, so it will be really hard impress me now. Totally get why people say it's a SWY and TMW. I'm getting tired of that type of profile already... There are so many of them. They're nice, but not THAT nice. Warm, Ambery, slightly fruity, and maybe a hint fresh. Very versatile... Just like all the others that go this route (see my previous decant reviews, there are about 3-4 others in this realm of scent). I'm at a point where I have enough versatiles, and only looking for the ""mind-blowing unique"", and this ain't that. It's going to be **one of the best choices** for someone who's looking to have a 3-5 frag collection, as it's still one of the best versatile options out there. I even prefer it to Jasoor, and might buy it (or one of the others with similar DNA to this) when my Jasoor is empty. But as of now, not breaking my top 5, not getting bought! It is really good though... Top 20 for sure (out of 150 I've tried, not just the 35-40 I own). It **is** one of the better ones from that type of profile, if not **the best one**.  

  **Subjective Scent Score**:8.6  
 **Longevity**:7.9. about 8 hours.  
 **Projection**: 7.6. medium first 2 hours, then close scent bubble for another hour. Not nuclear, but no slouch.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.8  
 **Unisex Score**: 70% Male leaning.  
 **Value**: 8.0 when it's $30 and under.  ",8,1745492620.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

She began screaming at me *""how dare you say no"", and ""do you know how much I have done for you!""* She then grabbed her car keys and jumped into her car and I heard the car take off down the road. Little did I know that this was the moment my tiny little 6 year old brain internalised ""If I say no, the people I love will leave me"", ""If I set boundaries, I am a bad person"", I am responsible for her emotions"". 

I am now a 34 year old woman who still carries this internalised narrative and it affects almost every facet of my life. From friendships, to relationships and even work environments. I struggle to set boundaries as it feels rebellious to do so even though I know boundary setting is healthy - my brain still thinks it's 6 years old, with no autonomy or voice. 

I didn't realise I had a Nmother, until 3 days ago when I returned from a holiday with her, and two other people. The holiday was horrible, it retriggered old trauma and ripped open old wounds, and that memory of being 6 years old, was thrust into my head after years of subconscious suppression. I sent her a message yesterday explaining that I was no longer to partake in a dynamic where *I am expected to shoulder blame* just to keep the peace. I also told her I'm no longer interested in a relationship where no respectful or accountable conversations are taking place. Basically done with the toxicity.

I 25F and my ex 27M were in a relationship for ten months 
So I guess I want advice but please be kind because I'm really struggling a lot right now 
I also want to know if he is avoidant or not 

So i met this guy on a dating app I wasn't even really interested to start off with but we got to talking and met up and he was amazing he spend three days a week with me he loved very far away so traveled to see me , he brought me gifts and my favourite flowers for Valentine's Day he was just this really nice guy always took me on camping trips etc so this was January he asked me out ...

Come July he wanted to be closer to me so we got him a house and a job and the plan was to move in together, closer to the time he asked if I could stay with him half the time and the other half with my mum witch I was hurt by because I was looking forward to moving in together, anyway we did move in together...

October he lost the house and the job and told me to help him look and we organized to keep some stuff at my brother's house 
Then he came to me and said he was depressed and wanted to talk .. I sat and listened and he said he was thinking about moving some of his stuff back in with his mum I was like what the heck I've been trying to find you a job and a house we organized to move our stuff to my brother's house , are you leaving me .. he said ""not yet"" 
Then we were arguing for a week or so he stopped saying he loved me because "" he diddn't want to feel pressured to say it back"" even tho he always said it first .. 

I was on the phone to my mum and said I had felt manipulated and controlled because of some other stuff and I thought he was in the gaming room with his headphones on , he walked in and said you've been a lovely girlfriend but I'm done .. and he got in his car and left ... Here's where I fucked up I reached out to my ex and said I was having a hard time and really needed a friend ( I never would have done it while I thought we were together) my bf came back and said he wanted to make it work .. I told him I messaged my ex and offered to show him what I said he said no the damage is irreparable I put the nail in the coffin..

I told him I loved him and still wanted it to work and he offered to see me twice a month witch I declined.. this was October.. in November or December I reached out and told him I still loved him and he offered me a little bit more than twice a month and baby steps witch I diddn't feel like was him meeting me in the middle because he's offing me less than he did when we first met each other going from living together to baby steps diddn't seam fair .. we had an argument the next day I apologized , he offered to catch up for coffee and see how it goes I said yes and left it at that .. the next day he reached out and said I make him too anxious and he wants to focus on himself, so I just left it at that I had nothing to say .. then he sent me two videos one saying this is how you loose a good man and the other saying i wouldn't be in a relationship this controlling witch i diddn't respond to because I thought he was just trying to be hurtful, I reached out in February asked how he was going and said i missed him and still loved him etc , we again got in an argument and he said I'm not even a distant friend anymore and after today he doesn't want to hear from me anymore and blocked me ... Then a few days later I think he unblocked me because I could find him on fb again etc ... 

Now in between all this he would be amazing and loving and getting on his knees to tie my shoes but he would do other things like ... 

He would always say things like did you see that girls boobs spilling over her shirt. Fucking hell if that girl ran any faster her tits would hit her in the face , don't worry you have bigger boobs than her I kept telling him It made me feel shit and he would say things like but my dad used to say things like that or my ex was ok with it ...

Monday we were on our way to this restaurant and my phone was flat and I asked if I could use his to see if the restaurant was open and he said yes oh wait no and I said hey that looks suspicious and he said he was just Google searching why I'm so anxious and using hurtful language like bitch etc I said I diddn't mind and he was deleting stuff while driving then gave me the phone ..

I never felt like I could do anything right .. we were loading vegetables in a wheel barrow to put into a car and I was just putting them all into the wheel barrow and he said no just put in the zuccinis.. I said hey it doesn't matter they're all going to the same car and he said no something about if you can't do what your told you need to go back to preschool..that was the one and only time he said anything like that In the relationship, I was cleaning out the shed and put all my stuff in one corner he said that my stuff isn't staying there the dog food is more of a priority 

He would comment on my spending ( not shared accounts) 
I brought a house plant and pot for my dad for house warming and I brought other stuff and just made the comment that was more expensive than I thought I diddn't care it was just a comment, and he said well why did you buy the pot and I said why and he said I wouldn't have he made me feel really guilty so I went back and returned it ..another time my dad offered me to go to a fathers day market so I brought him and my brother a gift 9 dollars each , the bf said why did you buy that I said for fathers day and he said but why did you buy two I said one for my brother he said well that's abit expensive and I felt really guilty.... Another time I was going to buy some $7 dollar tea towels that had bumblebees in it because it reminded me of my pop who has passed away long story .. and he said no those are expensive blah blah blah I left without them because I felt shit .. ( he did later go back and buy them for me) 

He got given two lambs and I got given one abit later from my mum I offered to raise it and give her half as a roast or something when it was a sheep . admittedly I thought he would help me feed it because I left for work way earlier than him .. I told him I was giving some to my mum and he said well what do I get out of it , I don't want your mum giving any to her boyfriend...

Another time we were walking our dogs in the paddock, and my lovely stupid dog 😂 decided to just play up , I was pd off and decided to just take him home , the boyfriend was like where are you going I said I'm taking him home I can't deal with him right now and he said are you really going to let this ruin your whole day , anyway a week later his lambs were hungry baaing outside our window and I asked him to go feed them , ( they woke us up) he went outside punched them in the head then fed them and came back to bed ..

Another time he has some money laying around ( admittedly his family was coming over this day but that wasnt my intention behind it ) I told him hey you shouldn't leave money around I have a money slip if you want it ( that's just how I was raised don't leave money around) and he said wow you think my sisters going to take it .. I really diddn't I know his sister isn't like that .. 

So I guess my questions are 

did he leave because I messaged my ex or was that a convenient excuse and he was already on his way out  witch is why he was saying not yet and I'm done 

Or did I cause this because I couldn't be intimate and I was needy and clingy ( he knew all that from the start I was open about it ) and messaged my ex and said some hurtful things in an argument 

Does he sound avoidant

We live in an apartment (no backyard).  For whatever reason, it seems like every cabinet I have does not work with the child proof locks, either due to being a weird shape or the material.

My kids are CONSTANTLY getting into things.  I can't even leave them alone for 30 seconds, because when I go to clean up one mess they have created another.  My 2 year old has now figured out how to climb onto the kitchen counter and start the coffee machine, spray the cooking spray all over the wall, dump out spices, etc..  We have 2 bathrooms which I have to keep locked during the day because otherwise they will climb on to the sink and play with the water, soap, etc.  I had to take away markers from my 4 year old because my 2 year old will use them to draw on furniture, walls, etc.  I have to remember to put my purse up high in my closet each time I come home because otherwise there is lipstick all over and coins and credit cards too.  

I've put away as many things as possible and try to keep the bare minimum out, but it's just at an insane point.  I've asked friends for advice, but none of their kids were this highly active all the time.  They get a lot of attention - I play games with them, and read to them, but I cannot get one minute to do anything like cook or clean or send an email without total destruction happening.  

I've tried certain toys, like a dinasour punching bag, to get energy out, but that kept their attention for about 3 minutes tops.  We do get outside when the weather is nice, but lately it has been raining all the time and the playgrounds are wet.  Does anyone have any toys, resources online, anything to point me to?

So we get our place sprayed professionally every 12 months. Last done in August last year. I live in QLD, Australia so hot and humid over summer. January (summer) this year started seeing big adult roaches. Maybe 3 or 4 in a month. Messaged the pest guy who took a while to get back to me to come and re treat but he came nearly three weeks ago now. In the mean time whilst waiting for pest man and upon finding this community, I’ve laid baits, gel, sprayed seclira wsg around skirting boards in kitchen and other places. I think they come out of the fan base attached to the ceiling as I have found multiple baby roaches on my ceiling, so have sprayed that too. 

I am STILL FINDING baby roaches. Like multiple some days. In all different parts of the house. One morning I woke to find like 5 dead babies in the bathroom. I saw a junior (??) roach last night (not adult size) but bigger than the tiny baby’s. We managed to kill him with spray and a squish. 

We are very clean, mop at least once a week, clean up kitchen nightly etc. we are in a standalone house (on stumps). No pet food left out overnight. 

I have pulled oven out completely to clean under and behind, also threw out old toaster that lived on our counter as roach droppings were in the base 🤢. Haven’t pulled out fridge- should I do that?? I haven’t found any nearby the fridge though. Bass of coffee machine is already taped up and has been for years . 

Does anyone else have any suggestions? I don’t know what product the pest man re-sprayed with but he also put powder around the place. I think they are in the roof cavity which I absolutely do not want to get up into, but I also believe that the pest man put product up there also when he came again three weeks ago. Should they be dead by now? We have been battling them for months and I thought we were winning. After having one fly into my hair a few weeks ago whilst in bed I am traumatised and feeling defeated as it feels like we have tried everything, but everyday when I find a baby roach my heart sinks.

A quick and short summary:  
Some scientists actually think it’s possible. The idea is that during the Big Bang, our universe may have split off with a twin that’s doing everything in reverse, including the flow of time. In that reality, what we call “the future” could be their “past.” It’s super speculative, but it opens up fascinating questions about how time really works, and could even explain weird things like dark matter.

I don’t have a cat yet, but I daydream about it often—mostly about hugging it until it files a (loving) restraining order. And yes, I totally relax with ASMR spa and hair treatment videos. Bliss.

So, my basic understanding is that we don't actually taste blood but more that our minds sort of interpret the blood we're drinking into something we can understand within our own frames of reference which are then further coloured by things like our own personal preferences. However, there does appear to be some consistencies and I'm curious for other peoples thoughts and feedback.

Basically the first point is that blood seems to work on two main axis.

1. ""Hot"" VS ""Cold""  
Rough term I'm using but basically the idea of blood being a stimulant VS a depressant.  
Feelings like rage, excitement and lust are stimulating while things like remorse, sorrow and calm are more of a depressant.

2. ""Dark"" VS ""Light""  
Effectively whether the emotions convent a taste that is something more heavy and strong or something more light and punchy.   
Using examples above, lust would be a dark flavor while that lingers on the palette while something like rage is a light flavor that's punchy and sharp.

Using the commonly accepted four humors of resonance we can end up with the following axis and examples.  
Sanguine (Hot/Dark) - Chocolate Fondant with a French Press Coffee  
Choleric (Hot/Light) - Buffalo Chicken Wings with an Energy Drink  
Melancholic (Cold/Dark) - Banoffee Pie with a Tawny Port  
Phlegmatic (Cold/Light) - Sashimi with chilled Junmai Daiginjo Sake

Now obviously this is just the surface level of how different bloods will taste. There's clearly other factors involved such as the person's health level, diet, personal relationship, substances in their system, etc but this is my base hypothesis I'm working off of.

So what do people think and what other details have you all picked up in terms of the ""Taste"" of blood?

I’ve tried Google and many big name retailers however I can’t for the life of me find one.

I’m in the UK if this helps. There must be ONE!

1k6ou7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k6ou7i/what_is_the_fastestmost_effective_espresso/,What is the fastest/most effective espresso machine for proffessional use? [no budget],"Hey y'all, i work in a restaurant and we have been using automatic coffee machines since ever.  
We're thinking about changing to a portafilter machine.  
The thing is, that especially at peak times, we have a lot of coffee orders and as the restaurant has a lot of tables, it still has to be somewhat time efficient.

Do you know espresso machines, that allow a relatively fast work flow or are otherwise optimized in this regard (less physical work, less room for mistakes, etc.)?

I recently found the la marzocco strada x, which has ""straight-in"" portafilters, that seem to be more effective in terms of physical work one has to do and in preventing mistakes in applying the portafilter. But the machine is also quite pricy.

Thank you verymuch in advance :)",2,1745490444.0,espresso,20,0.75,False

I close the portafilter with very litte resistance (with a finger) 

What I've tried:
- replaced head gasket - no luck 
- tried two different bottomless portafilters - both leaking
- tried two old pressurized filters: original and aftermarket - both are fine (not leaking)

Is there anything I can do? Coffee machine have around 5 years. ",1,1745490378.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
