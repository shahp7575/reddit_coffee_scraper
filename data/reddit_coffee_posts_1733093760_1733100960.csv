1h4ikd1,https://i.redd.it/l36n55e02c4e1.jpeg,Patience Leads to This,"I was so frustrated with 2024 on launch day that I’ve completely ignored it and continued to fly in 2020.

Now, I’m en route to LAX enjoying one of the most beautiful simulated sunsets I’ve ever seen - with no visual modifications or filters.

Here’s my advice: Break up your introduction to 2024 into time blocks, and you’ll be rewarded. I think many of us were eager to get flying seamlessly, and the sim just clearly wasn’t ready for that.

1: Get Addon Linker setup. Use the same external ‘Addons’ folder you use for 2020. I have my addons for 2020 a separate 4TB D: drive, with 2020 installed on the C: drive. Open up Addon Linker 2024, select your *current* 2020 Addon folder, and check the boxes for sceneries only. 

1A. As of this post, the only *confirmed* 3rd-party airplane working mostly well is the Fenix. If you have the Fenix Airbuses as I do, the Fenix installer will handle everything.

2. Set aside about 45 minutes to an hour - yes, that long - to evaluate your bindings on keyboard, controllers, joysticks, rudder pedals, throttles etc. I did this separately with a cup of good coffee and with zero expectation of flying. Just spawn into an airport and start messing with/assigning your 2020 controls. Once you get use to the key binding system, it’s not so bad. The backspace key is your friend to unbind all the silly defaults Asobo chose. 

3. Set aside 1 hour to experiment with settings. I built a super rig for 2020 (i9 14900K, 4090, 80GB Ram @ 6000mt, 5TB SSD, installed process lasso etc.) - let me just say that with everything maxed out, there’s no contest - 2024 is buttery. I’ve got everything but road traffic turned off until FBW brings FSLTL/the injector over fully. 

For reference on performance, BM-AMSIM KPHX (it’s my home airport, otherwise I’d simply wait for Flightbeam) runs like junk on 2020 (45-55fps vs 80-90 at a Flightbeam or FlyTampa scenery) - as do most of their unoptimized, unfinished sceneries. On 2024 it’s silky smooth, and the texturing looks better, with no shimmering edges or shadow dancing (likely to do with the new ray tracing) - 88fps average on the ground. Whatever they’ve done with CPU optimization has very clearly worked. No matter your computing power, with appropriate settings, you’ll immediately notice the lack of stutters that have plagued every sim since FS2004.

Lastly - enjoy. It’s not perfect - but it has vastly improved and when it’s functioning as intended (which for me is 95% of the time now) it is a breathtaking sim with vastly improved flight and ground dynamics. ",2,1733100642.0,MicrosoftFlightSim,0,1.0,False

AITAH for going NC with my family and my husband's family because they had my baby shower without me? I'm posting because I'm curious what other people's reactions would be if they were in my situation. It also seems like I'm the odd one out since people think I'm crazy/rude/awful. Insert whatever bad name possible. 


This situation happened right at the height of Covid in August of 2020. I don't want to make this a long post, but I do think all the information listed below is relevant to the story. 

1. My husband worked in a hospital with active covid patients. 
2. ALL OF MY INLAWS WERE HIGH-RISK FOR CONTRACTING COVID.
3. At the time, pregnancy didn't make you high risk (we were still learning about the disease, now I believe it does? Not sure)
4. If I were to have a baby shower it would be towards the end of my pregnancy because that's when I would feel comfortable that the likelihood of a miscarriage is lower. 

Now on to the story...

Covid was pretty rough on all of us. At the time, I had a 3 year old and I was pregnant with really really bad nausea as well as aches and pains that seemed never ending. The nausea didn't even go away with medications. 

I did my best to stop it, and just continued life as normal as possible. Even though we were stuck inside and all of our activities were no longer happening. 

My husband, as I mentioned worked in a hospital, he dealt with covid patients. Because of this we were extremely careful. When he came home, he would remove his clothes and shoes in the garage. He would immediately put them in the washing machine. He would bathe in our downstairs bathroom, and then would come up to see us. We would sanitize and wear masks when necessary. Basically we followed protocols that were told to us at the time. My inlaws however had different plans. Which they are entitled to. 

They didn't quarantine, they didn't socially distance, they shared masks and had large gatherings at their houses. One of which was a wedding in their backyard. I didn't want to go, but my husband convinced me. We wore masks, social distanced and didn't go inside the house. I will admit, I was angry because I was told everyone would be wearing masks, except the bride and groom. But no one did. I maintained my distance and told myself, I'm not doing that again. It was very obvious that I was trying to stay safe (my husband included). 

It was very hard to keep a 3 year old away from the people he loved. And I sincerely was doing it for their benefit knowing that we were the ones who could contract it (since my husband worked in healthcare) and could give it to his family. 

One of my sils kept telling me that she would see us in a few weeks. I was confused at first, but didn't think much of it because I was too nauseous, and tired, and dealing with my toddler to try and decipher what that meant. 

When it came closer to the date, I had a feeling that she was throwing me a baby shower. However, I am not a baby shower type of girl. I don't mind if other people have them, I just don't like them for myself. I had one for my first kid and I told my mom and sil explicitly that I am ONLY doing this for you all and because it is the first grandchild on both sides. They knew this before my first baby shower, and they definitely knew this while planning this one. My husband has since told me that he told them I wouldn't like it. 

Because of this feeling, I texted my sister in law a few days before the date she told me. I asked if she was having a baby shower for me, and she said yes. I told her that I am not going to be able to attend, I have very bad nausea, (as I have been having, especially lately and I'm tired) and most importantly, it would be irresponsible of me or her to have something like this, given the circumstances. We were literally a town that had just become ""red"", which meant that numbers were going up pretty severely and they were warning us to remain 6 ft and whatever else advisory. I also told her that it's a really nice and thoughtful gesture, but I wouldn't be able to morally live with myself if we convened and someone got severely sick just because I wanted to party. (Which again, i didnt and would never, as I am extremely introverted). She said okay and I thought it was done. I get a call the next day from my friend saying that my sil called her to say I'm not coming to my baby shower and that I (my friend) probably don't want to go since I wouldnt be there. This friend was super super cautious (still is) and was only going to ""my baby shower"" to make me happy. She literally felt like she was risking her life. My sil told her safety precautions were going to be in place and that it would be outside. So she agreed. She called me surprised, because she thought it was a surprise for me. But then my sil called and told her that I knew and that I wasn't coming. So I told my friend yeah, I would never do this and especially during a time like this, especially knowing who my family is. Unfortunately, literally no one in my family is healthy. High blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, heart issues, asthma, severe allergies, fragile bones, arthritis, just to name a few. And this is just off the top of my head with the inlaws and my moms side of the family. 

My friend and I, hung up and I thought nothing of it. It's done. No harm, no foul, right? I literally thought she was making her calls to whoever she invited. Til this day, idk who, and it was over. 

Wrong. The next day, my older cousin texts me and tells me that since I didn't show up to the baby shower and I didn't want the homemade cupcakes, she would take them back home with her. I said what??? You were invited?? It's happening??? How??? I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they had ""my baby shower"" without me!! I felt terrible because she is another one who literally had not left her house since March. She worked from home, her kid was home from school, her wife also worked from home, she had groceries delivered. The works. Again, another person risking their lives to ""please me"" but it wasn't for me. Especially knowing that they had the whole event without me, didn't cancel anything and didn't follow any supposed protocols. I was immediately angry, immediately hurt, shocked, whatever feeling, I likely had it. Other than happiness. 

Til this day, I'm still confused as to how anyone would think it's okay to have a baby shower when the mother isn't present. Thankfully, I'm not angry/sad/hurt anymore. But it's definitely still insane to me. 

My husband immediately went into defending his family. My cousin told my mom and aunt that I was wasn't happy about what was going on. They both called and tried to defend themselves. My mom particularly said: ""I wanted to celebrate my grandchild, you can't stop me from doing that"". 

And she's right, I can't stop her from doing that ( even though I think its crazy) but do it at your own party, with your own friends. Why make me aware of it at all? As though it was for me. 

I see this as a major betrayal. My mom and I have had a very tumultuous relationship. She has been physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually abusive. My aunt has defended her. My other aunts and grandmother think she can do no wrong. She's the one who told my sil to still have the party because according to my mom, ""I would show up"". But my sil knew I wouldn't because 1) I told her 2) she told my friend I wasn't going to be there, meaning my sil also knew I wouldn't be there 3) I gave my reasoning about covid being bad at the moment plus my other ailments. None of those stipulations had changed from one day to the other. My ils were confused as to why I was angry. Like it was no big deal that the person who you are literally having the baby shower for isn't there. 

As though they didn't treat me like a surrogate before. Here is more evidence. I blocked all of my ils. I also blocked my mom and aunt. And haven't spoken to them since. I wrote an email to my sil explaining why, with a long laundry list of things that were pretty similar to this, in the sense that they don't respect me, my boundaries, my generosity and my willingness to always go above and beyond and basically this is the respect I get. I don't need thank-yous. I need you to respect me and consider my feelings. But nope it's just about what they want, and they wanted to party so party without me. 

My brother, who I still speak to, called me a week after the event to update me on his life. He went to the party, but he didn't know where he was going. My mom told him to jump in the car and told him she was going to a party. My brother didn't ask any questions (very typical of him). As they were driving, she told him that it was ""my baby shower"". And he was immediately surprised. He said that this ""wasn't for my sister, because if you knew her, you'd know that she wouldn't want this"". My mom told him that I knew about it. And nothing else. He decided to stay, because he was moving out of the country and this was his last time seeing all these people, at least for a long while. I still haven't seen him. So yeah. A long while. 

He said they wanted to take video to send to me and every time they would pivot to him, he would ""ruin it"" (according to them) by saying ""this isn't for insert my name"". 

Again, this fact only further proves that they were aware, and that they saw nothing wrong with what they were doing. 

After I blocked them, I have gotten many passive aggressive things done to me. For example, when my son was born, my husband and kid, and new baby all got ""gifts"" from one sil congratulating them. Not me. Just them. Another sil delivered donuts and coffee for my husband and toddler with a card saying ""for all your hard work"". As though they did anything. 

During the delivery, they constantly called to see if the baby was born, not to see how I was. So much so, that my husband wasn't ""present"" with me. And I can't help but think it was on purpose. 

After the baby was born, our doctor advised that no one see the baby for at least 3 months. So we complied. My husband would often FaceTime and I would constantly hear ""oh he has dimples, like me (meaning my sil) when I literally have 2. Any feature of mine, that was very clearly mine. They would try and attribute it to themselves or some long lost relative of theirs. Very weird, when BOTH my kids look exactly like me. Literally hair color, texture, dimples, face, smile. I've been told that we look like twins by others. But of course it's your uncles kids, kid. Sure. 

Now anytime anyone asks me why I'm not around I get the dirty looks, and comments. The really infuriating comments of ""but, they're you're family"" are the worst. But I just grin and bare it. 

Anyway, that's my story. AITAH? I don't think I am. Especially given context.

Questions before I'm asked:

1. The baby shower was in a home, no venue to cancel or deposit they lost out on. Everything to my knowledge was refundable or theirs already. 

2. My ils knew the rules as they were very on top of watching the news 24/7. 

3. My Mom and Aunt also work in another hospital and although it's not patient care, they had to be constantly tested and follow the same procedures as the doctors/nurses/medical staff. 
 
4. I did not block anyone/go no contact solely because of this issue. It was merely the straw that broke the camels back. It is like a light switch went off and I just realized the relationships no longer serve me. (If they ever did)

5. I've been in therapy for about 5 years, twice a week to get over my crappy childhood.

They said it couldn’t be done. They said I’d tried everything before. Keto, fasting, CrossFit, detox teas—if it promised to make me lean and energized, I was first in line. Yet, here I was: sluggish, stuck, and spinning my wheels in frustration. Sound familiar?

Let me tell you a story about transformation, not the kind you find in fairytales, but the kind that changes your mornings, your mood, and your mirror.

It started with skepticism. A friend had mentioned a natural formula that claimed to help people like me. It was inspired by the long, healthy lives of a small town in Japan. I brushed it off at first. Another ""magic solution""? Sure. But curiosity got the better of me. I ordered it.

The first few days, I noticed… nothing. Zip. Same routine. Same sluggishness. Then something shifted. I woke up one morning without hitting the snooze button. That’s when I realized my energy levels were creeping up. Not the jittery kind you get from too much coffee. This was smooth, clean energy that carried me through my day.

I began to notice my appetite was calmer, less driven by impulse. The snacks I couldn’t resist? They suddenly seemed... optional. It felt like I’d tapped into a part of myself that had been dormant—like my body had been screaming for balance, and it finally got the memo.

By week two, I stepped on the scale. The numbers didn’t lie. Four pounds down. I was ecstatic, but cautious. I’d been here before. The dreaded plateau was always waiting around the corner.

But the momentum didn’t stop. Over the next few weeks, my waistline shrank. I caught my reflection in the mirror and did a double take. That stubborn belly fat I’d been carrying for years was softening, disappearing. I dug out an old pair of jeans from the back of the closet—the ones I hadn’t dared to try on in years. They slid right on. No struggle. No shimmy. Just… fit.

And the changes weren’t just physical. My confidence skyrocketed. The way I carried myself was different. I didn’t dread social events or cringe at photos. Instead, I felt alive. Focused. In control.

So, what made this different? It wasn’t about starving myself or sweating buckets in a gym. It was about nourishing my body with ingredients it actually recognized—ones that worked together to reset my metabolism and support my natural fat-burning abilities.

If you’re sitting there wondering if it’s too late for you, let me tell you this: I was right where you are. Frustrated. Doubtful. But taking that chance? It flipped the script on everything I thought I knew about weight loss and energy.

The best part? I didn’t have to change my entire life to see results. No endless meal prepping. No insane workout regimens. Just a small daily ritual that finally gave my body the support it needed.

And now? Life feels different. Not perfect, but vibrant. I’ve kept the weight off, my energy stays steady, and I’m living proof that real, lasting change is possible. It’s not about perfection—it’s about progress. One choice. One step. And a whole lot of persistence.

This isn’t just a weight-loss journey. It’s a wake-up call to what’s possible when you finally find something that works. If I can do it, so can you. Don’t just take my word for it—experience it for yourself.

The secret behind this life-changing transformation lies in the unique, science-backed formulation that powers the tonic. This isn’t just another fad—this is the product of a meticulous understanding of how the human body works, combined with nature’s most potent ingredients. Let’s unpack the science that makes this blend so effective, shall we?

At its core, this tonic is designed to target the root causes of weight retention and low energy: metabolic slowdown and inflammation. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re the real culprits that sabotage your body’s natural ability to burn fat and stay energized. Here's how it works.

One of the standout ingredients in this formula is **EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate)**, a compound found in green tea. Backed by countless studies, EGCG is a powerhouse when it comes to enhancing thermogenesis—the process by which your body burns calories to produce heat. By boosting your metabolism, EGCG helps convert stored fat into usable energy, giving you that steady, clean vitality I’ve experienced firsthand.

Then there’s **Camu Camu**, a lesser-known but highly potent superfruit loaded with vitamin C. Why does this matter? Vitamin C plays a pivotal role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—two major obstacles in your journey toward a leaner, healthier body. With inflammation under control, your body can focus on repairing itself, balancing hormones, and activating fat-burning pathways.

**Mangosteen** is another star player in the lineup. This tropical fruit is rich in xanthones, a group of antioxidants known for their ability to support digestive health and improve insulin sensitivity. Insulin, as you may know, is a master hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. When it’s out of balance, your body stores more fat. By improving insulin function, Mangosteen helps keep your metabolism in check and prevents those frustrating spikes and crashes.

And let’s not forget **Panax Ginseng**, an adaptogen celebrated for centuries in traditional medicine. Modern research confirms its ability to reduce cortisol levels—your body’s stress hormone. High cortisol is notorious for triggering cravings and encouraging fat storage, especially around the belly. By managing stress at the hormonal level, this tonic helps you maintain control over your appetite and energy levels.

The synergy of these ingredients is what sets this formula apart. It doesn’t just address one aspect of weight loss or energy—it tackles the entire system, from hormone regulation to fat oxidation and gut health. The result? A holistic approach that doesn’t just help you shed pounds but keeps you feeling balanced, vibrant, and in control.

But here’s the kicker: it’s not just about what’s in the tonic—it’s about what’s not in it. No harmful additives. No synthetic fillers. Just pure, natural ingredients that work with your body, not against it. This is why it’s safe, effective, and sustainable for the long haul.

The science is clear. By addressing the foundational elements of health—metabolism, inflammation, and stress—this tonic gives your body the tools it needs to perform at its best. You’re not forcing your body to do anything unnatural. You’re simply giving it the support it’s been craving all along.

And the beauty of it? These benefits aren’t just limited to weight loss. With consistent use, you’ll notice clearer skin, better digestion, and an overall sense of well-being that carries into every aspect of your life. This isn’t just a tonic; it’s a lifestyle upgrade rooted in real, proven science.

So, if you’re tired of gimmicks and ready for a solution that’s grounded in both research and results, this is your moment. This is your science-backed pathway to the life you’ve always wanted—and it all starts with one simple step. Trust me, your future self will thank you.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Results can vary depending on your body type, lifestyle, and consistency. Most people, including myself, begin to notice increased energy and reduced cravings within the first week. Significant changes in weight and body composition often occur after 4-6 weeks of daily use. Consistency is key!

**2. Is it safe to use daily?**  
Absolutely. This formula is crafted with natural ingredients that are safe for long-term use. It contains no harmful additives, synthetic fillers, or stimulants. As always, if you have underlying medical conditions or are taking medications, consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.

**3. Can this help with stubborn belly fat?**  
Yes! One of the tonic’s primary benefits is its ability to target visceral fat—commonly stored around the belly. Ingredients like EGCG and Mangosteen work synergistically to enhance fat oxidation and reduce inflammation, which are critical for tackling stubborn fat.

**4. Do I need to follow a strict diet or exercise plan?**  
No strict regimen is required. That said, combining the tonic with a balanced diet and regular activity can amplify your results. The formula is designed to support your metabolism and energy levels, making it easier to stay active and make healthier food choices naturally.

**5. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
Every body is different, and results may vary. However, the tonic comes with a generous 180-day money-back guarantee. If you’re not satisfied, you can request a full refund—no questions asked. It’s truly a risk-free investment in your health.

**6. Are there any side effects?**  
Most users report no side effects, thanks to the natural and clean formulation. Some people may experience mild digestive adjustments during the first few days as their bodies adapt, but these typically subside quickly.

**7. Who is this tonic best for?**  
This tonic is ideal for anyone struggling with slow metabolism, stubborn fat, low energy, or high stress levels. It’s especially effective for adults over 30 who may experience age-related metabolic decline.

**8. Can vegetarians or vegans use this product?**  
Yes! The formula is 100% plant-based and free from animal-derived ingredients, making it suitable for vegetarians and vegans.

**9. How do I take it?**  
Taking the tonic is simple. Mix one scoop with water or your favorite beverage each morning. It’s fast-absorbing and tastes refreshing, making it a hassle-free addition to your daily routine.

**10. Where can I buy it?**  
To ensure you’re getting the authentic product, always purchase directly from the official website. This guarantees you receive the real formula, along with the money-back guarantee and any current promotions.

A sobering characteristic of hyperreal literacy is noticing how that sort of metaphysical sentiment – the last will be first, the first last – gives rise to the middle class plus a militant opposition to inverted forms of reflectivity. Mirrors create lateral symmetry – what sort of reflective surface makes the first last and last first? Whatever it is, the second coming, what have you, is in direct contradiction with the authority of the state, which finds great interest in making sure the first remains first, if not the last remaining last. I mean, I wouldn’t put it past any persons working in the state department or the Fortune 500 to scheme about a global apartheid reality on a daily basis, such that the rich can’t become unrich, by the laws of nature. I picture wealth like lichen.

All this wealth keeps rising through the crust of the earth, seemingly no matter how harsh the conditions, like wealth is a consequence of the geologic, just bubbles out of the ground, now and then erupts, mega-erupts, super colossal erupts – the planet shrouded in wealth, layers of wealth one day apparent in the geologic record. Ah, yes – here’s where the species attained its wealth – points to a golden line in the sedimentary layer. The god of sustainability, which is the only god left standing, by the very nature of nature – which implies a different relationship to entropy, to the laws of thermodynamics. Maxwell’s Demon can be a thing, and you’ve now just created perpetual motion by privileging the authority of infinity over the one of finite forms of value. I mean, I know Maxwell’s demon – we go way back. We’d made magic in the hinterlands.

The last will be first and the first will be last. Just imagine the service class mobilizing on certain days of the month, walking through wealthy parts of town chanting that slogan as one: The last will be first! And the first will be last! I remember the excitement I felt in primary school, in the month of May, late April maybe, when the teacher would write in chalk the number of days left in the school year up on the blackboard. Write the number 40, circle it, we’d all cheer. We had a sign-up list for kids in charge of updating the total at the end of each day, like we were doing time but the exuberance was real when we hit single digits. Learning freedom that way was a blessing. With but a chalkboard countdown, I came to associate public institutions, religion and various arbitrary forms of authority with resistance and escape. Those summers were amazing.

Those summers are treasures in my royal tomb. Say, could you watch my things while I use the washroom? Just a few things over here. I mean, I see you’re busy, too, so if you could just keep one eye on my stuff while I go and use the, uh, lavatory, which is what it was called back then, when freedom walked backward. The lavatory smelled of piss and mildew in a major way, such that when it didn’t, it was like an affirmation about love and civility. Say, could you watch just a few of my possessions? The book and notebook mainly, the backpack – the water bottle, don’t worry about. If someone comes along and grabs the water bottle, just let it go. Same with the coffee – if someone takes the coffee, I mean, at most, just clear your throat, give them a glance or a side-to-side speechless expressions, arms out, palms up – at most. I won’t be but a minute.

The inside of the bathroom is covered in pretty orderly graffiti, with lots of affirmations done in sharpy. You got this! goes one, and another says, You will get your dream job! I think over what my dream job would be, give it thirty, forty seconds of serious contemplation, before finishing a thought, then fishing a pen from my pocket and carefully writing: Don’t dream of jobs. Just to be clear, I’m not trying to deflate anyone’s dream, but if your dream is about a job, then either you were like me – behind a mountain of debt requirement repayment – or you were like me – unused to being free in the world. One of modernity’s tricks is to get us to dream of jobs, what an earlier age would have regarded as deranged and intolerable. Jobs? they would have said to you, uncertainly – you want me to dream of those? I didn’t write all this on the bathroom door. 

The last shall be first – those who make the cellphones – and the first shall be last – those who, I don’t know, invest in cellphones? Someone walks with their cellphone held flat and face-up in front of them, like the prow of a ship, like it’s leading them somewhere. My body isn’t used to the cold temperatures yet, but I’m aware of the people around me struggling. An old man with a big bundle under one arm, sits in a coffee place and coughs. Another guy with a sleeping bag, no two sleeping bags, plus a pack and a coat, walks slow and with a limp. People among us are in pain, face death on a nightly basis – this is what it means to enter the month of December in the Midwest – I send out a message about whether shelter exists for those at risk of dying from exposure. I don’t want to believe the rich feast on our suffering. Sometimes it’s hard to ignore.

Could you watch these things for me for a bit while I retire to the laboratory? The backpack, of course, and the book and notebook should be high priorities, but the water bottle, the coffee – more of each exist in the world, so don’t lose any sleep if you happen not to give quite as much attention to those as the others. The way life is, in a way – oh, you’re wondering what I plan to do in the laboratory? I’m not sure I have an agenda when I retire to the laboratory – more of an open-ended sort of a premise to see what bubbles up. Leaves still in the yards remind me of lava fields, globs of carbon spewed out of the trees, onto the ground – you should have seen it. I guess the trees all seem like they’re made of stone – that’s what I’m trying to say. Around the base, where the trunk meets the roots – the image of stoutness. Let’s just agree to call it stone.

The wood is just a granular stone, a student of stone, stone in the making, a form of digestion, by a different part of time set to a higher magnification. Where the leaves have been laying in the grass for weeks, you can see they’ve already lost their color, like the qualities of the leaf are dripping into the soil, one by one. The last will be first, and the first will be last – which part are we seeing at this time of autumn? Twigs unbranching are scattered across the grass – I think of the skeletal remains of wild animals, torn to pieces, but there are no skulls – just ribs and radii. I forgot the drama of all these trees, just burning off at the end like this, yards and streets thick with the stuff. The remaining leaves shrink to the size of fists, remind me of eyes, trees covered in eyes for the coming weeks. Winter has come early, and the sun is more square than sphere.",1,1733100330.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

***Tuesday***

Lucas had set his alarm for four forty-five in the morning, wanting to head to the gym for an early morning workout before heading to work. After days of waking up alone (with one exception, for which he’d been incredibly happy), he fully expected today to be no different. So when he heard the snuffled breath on the pillow beside him, he almost jumped out of his skin.

He turned his head to the left side of the bed, making out Boyd’s features in the moonlight coming through the window behind him. His fingers itched to stroke the beard that was starting to fill out, but for the first time in a long time, Boyd was actually asleep, and Lucas didn’t want to wake him. So he took his time, studying his fiancé’s soft features now that the pressures of the world had been lifted from his shoulders.

With the military buzz-cut that he’d always maintained until recently, it was impossible to see the hints of dark blue that were hidden in the strands, but now that it was growing, the moonlight caught it and coaxed it to the forefront. The growing beard kept his square jaw from view, making him less soldier and more the man Lucas wasn’t ashamed to admit he wanted to climb like a tree. Dark eyelashes created shadows over his cheekbones, but Lucas’ favourite feature was hidden behind those closed eyelids.

Boyd had the most gorgeous blue eyes that Lucas had ever seen, and the way they swam whenever they were focused on him had the MCS detective swooning like a character out of a historical romance.

Eight years they’d wasted, not seeing each other due to Robbie’s damned influence that made sure they didn’t do anything to change the status quo. Eight years where Lucas had been searching for Boyd out in the population, getting hurt time after time because they weren’t him.

His mind went to one troublesome boyfriend in particular who every so often got a little rougher than Lucas had liked. Sure, Colin hadn’t done it often, and he always apologised profusely and went to great lengths to make it up to him afterwards, but Lucas was a cop and should’ve recognised the red flag for what it was. Things reached critical mass between them the night he’d finished a long double shift that had involved a murder, and he’d forgotten to meet Colin and his friends at Colin’s favourite bar a few blocks away.

In a moment of exhaustion, Lucas had said he was through with the relationship and wished his now ex-boyfriend a happy life. Stupidly, he’d thought that would be the end of it.

With the speed at which Colin had hit the apartment, he must’ve sprinted all the way from the bar, but he still hadn’t burnt off his rage. Lucas had managed to keep him in the hallway outside, but the guy refused to leave even after he was told, yet again, that they were over.

Lucas’ huge mistake had been turning his back on him in the hopes that he would take the hint, and he’d received a sucker punch to the back of the head just as Boyd appeared at the top of the stairs.

His knight-in-shining-work boots had made mincemeat of Colin, bouncing him off every surface down the eight flights of stairs before throwing him down the stoop to the street.

Rather than thinking about the law, Lucas had crawled through the apartment and into his bed (still wearing his uniform), wanting the world to go away while he licked his wounds. Boyd hadn’t let him, dragging him bodily into the bathroom for a shower and checking the back of his head for any sign of swelling that might lead to a concussion. After he was satisfied, Boyd had then tucked Lucas back into bed. Lucas had tried so hard not to cry until Boyd left, yet the big guy turned off the light and came back, holding him in the dark for hours to make him feel safe.

*That was four freaking years ago.*

If he didn’t already know it was due to Robbie’s divine influence, he’d be handing in his detective’s badge and taking up something mindless like shelf stacking. Because if all of that hadn’t been a neon sign to what was going on inside Boyd’s head, he was— 

“You’re thinking awfully hard over there,” Boyd murmured without opening his eyes. “What’s wrong?”

Lucas leaned forward and kissed him lightly, morning breath be damned. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you. I’m going to the gym to do an early morning workout.”

Boyd stretched under the sheets and rolled to sit up on his side of the bed. “I’ll come with you,” he said, scratching his fingers through his hair and yawning. “You can drop me home afterwards.”

Lucas agreed, but as he moved towards the bathroom, Boyd grabbed his wrist and hauled him back to the bed, rolling on top of him. “In a minute,” he grinned.

Over forty minutes later, they finally made it out of the ensuite. “It’s going to be your own fault that I don’t have time to bring you home,” Lucas said, dodging Boyd’s outstretched hand with all the skill of a dancer while his fiancé was in the midst of trying to grab his bare ass. “Back off,” he warned jovially, slapping Boyd’s hand away. “I’m not cutting my workout short because of you. I mean it.”

“Fine,” Boyd griped, as if giving up was some massive hardship, and they hadn’t already been messing around in the shower and before it.

Lucas gave him a wary side-eye as he dressed for the gym, then hung his work clothes in a hanging bag.

Since he was going straight to work from the gym, Boyd grabbed a set of fresh clothes to take another shower after the workout. Boyd also commandeered the gym duffle since Lucas was carrying his work gear.

They both went down the hallway together, finding Larry in the living room with his feet on the coffee table, reading something on one of the numerous tablets scattered around the apartment. “Hey,” he said, dropping his feet to the floor as Boyd appeared behind Lucas.

“Morning,” Lucas greeted, surprised when Larry waved for them to wait a minute and went past them into the kitchen. “Robbie made this up for you both before he went to bed,” he said, going to Voila and pulling out two brown paper bags and Lucas’ lunch bag.

Boyd frowned as Larry handed them over, and then he opened his brown paper bag. The evil chortle of sheer delight as the smell of freshly toasted banana bread wafted from within spoke volumes. “You might have to leave me at the gym,” he said, pulling out a stacked toasted sandwich that was easily seven inches square by two-and-a-half inches deep. “I’m going to be working out until Doomsday to burn this bad boy off.” He took a massive bite and chewed happily.

“You're not eating that in my car,” Lucas warned, enjoying this playful side of his fiancé almost too much.

Boyd swallowed and licked his lips. “Then I’ve got till we get downstairs to finish it off,” he declared, lifting the sandwich to his awaiting mouth and tearing off a huge chunk.

“Don’t, you’ll be sick…” Larry chastised with a frown. 

“It’ll take us fifteen minutes to get to the gym,” Boyd argued, taking another bite. He chewed and swallowed just as quickly as he had the first. “I’ll be fine.”

Larry’s expression took on a pissed-off schoolteacher look, and having two parents that fitted that bill, Lucas knew what he was talking about. “Maybe slow down a little bit, love,” he said, placing his hand on Boyd’s forearm to prevent him from taking a third bite.

Boyd looked at them like they were both crazy. “I grew up in a Marine household,” he reminded them. “Dad gave us three minutes to eat. Two for the main course and one for dessert. Last one to leave the table got stuck with KP.”

“Is that how humans build up an iron stomach?” Larry asked, not impressed in the least.

As if to show him how it was done, a third mouthful was bitten off and disappeared. “I ate the most and was still one of the first to leave the table. My older sister wanted an x-ray of me growing up to see if I had secret Adamantium deposits to pulverise it for me or a hole in my stomach that opened up in another dimension somewhere.”

“I’m beginning to see where your love affair with sci-fi came from,” Larry smirked, shaking his head. As Boyd moved in for a fourth bite, Larry raised his hand and turned it into a solid flat piece of bone that kept the sandwich from reaching Boyd’s lips. “Seriously. Slow down, dipshit. I’m not dealing with you whining about an upset stomach all day.”

“I will bite that hand instead if you don’t get it out of my way.”

Larry scowled at him, then removed the bone barricade, returning it to his human hand a moment later.

“Thank you.” Boyd’s next bite was half as big again, stuffing his cheeks like a chipmunk and leaving only a sliver of sandwich to go.

“I oughta punch you in the guts and make you throw up,” Larry growled.

Literally, he *growled.* Like something feral. Boyd grinned and worked his way through the oversized mouthful, swallowing it in pieces until the last of it went down.

“We’ll get out of your hair,” Lucas placated, wondering why the hell Boyd wasn’t registering the waves of danger emanating from Larry. He put his hand behind Boyd’s back and shoved him forward, pushing himself between the two. “Tell Robbie thanks for breakfast.”

Larry was still glaring at Boyd as they grabbed their shoes from the alcove and headed out the door. “What the hell is wrong with you?” Lucas demanded, giving his fiancé another hard shove towards the main door outside.

“What?”

“Larry obviously cares about you, and you know he’s right about how fast you eat.”

Boyd’s face fell, but instead of saying anything, he folded the last part of the sandwich in half and finished it off first. “Larry needs to get the hell over himself,” he grumbled. “He’s not my mother, but sometimes he gets bug up his ass like that, and it annoys the shit out of me.”

As they walked through the main door and headed for the stairwell, Lucas paused. “Wait, is that what that was all about back there? You gorged yourself just to stick it to him?”

Boyd glanced over his shoulder at him, then silently headed down the stairs.

“I don’t fucking believe you right now!” Lucas whisper-shouted after him following behind. “That was a massive sandwich, and we’re about to go and do a full workout. You know you can’t have something that big filling—”

“Just drop it,” Boyd snapped. “It’s done now. I’ll be fine.”

Lucas’ fingers itched to wrap around Boyd’s throat and shake some sense into him. He might've just done that if his hands weren’t already full with his work gear and food, especially when Boyd’s throat was right in front of him because he was lower on the stairs. “I am going to run you until you puke,” he declared on the half-turn.

Lucas didn’t find Boyd’s snort of amusement very funny. “We’ll see.”

When they reached the ground floor, Lucas caught sight of a note on the basement door. “What the hell?” he asked, breaking away from Boyd to open the door and peer inside cautiously. “Babe, check this out,” he said as the light came on automatically. “Larry’s been busy.”

Boyd crowded him from behind, his height giving him a clear view over Lucas’ head. He whistled, moving in to touch the clear covering over the nearest set of bolts. “I can see why he put up that sign,” he said, tapping his fingernail against the hardened surface. “I don’t know of any polymer that sets like this in a few hours.”

“But what did he do it for? We have a laundry.”

“That only *we* can use. I guess either he got bored or he felt guilty about Eva Evans struggling down here to do her washing.”

It still blew Lucas’ mind that the golden era superstar was old Mrs Evans from 1F. “You think if anyone would have their own laundry, it’d be her.”

“I’ll bet you drinks on Friday night that Larry plans to fix that, too, just as soon as she lets him. You saw him drooling yesterday morning at breakfast.”

“Yeah, it was pretty adorable.”

Boyd gave a mocking shudder, and Lucas shoved him towards the front door. “Ass.”

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

Sam leaned back in his chair, staring at the old-fashioned clock on the wall of his modest study. It wasn’t antique by any stretch of the imagination, just an analog replica he had bought at a flea market years ago. Its frame was a simple bronze finish, the glass slightly smudged from countless cleanings. But it had something no digital clock or smartphone ever did: character.

It was the sweeping motion of the second hand, the slow crawl of the minute hand, and the stately progression of the hour hand that captivated him. Digital clocks reduced time to sterile numbers, cold and precise. They ticked away as though to remind him of all the things he hadn’t done. But this clock, this beautiful analog device, told a story.

Sam glanced at the time. Quarter past three, or close to it. He couldn’t be entirely sure because the minute hand wavered somewhere between the fifteen and sixteen-minute marks. A digital clock would have blinked out the answer without hesitation: 3:16 PM. But Sam didn’t want the precision. He wanted the grace, the flow, the imprecision that mirrored his own life.

Sam’s fascination with timepieces started when he was a boy. His grandfather had an old pocket watch, one of those intricate, engraved treasures with a tiny winding key. Sam would sit on the man’s lap, mesmerized as the old man showed him the gears turning under the polished casing.

“You see, Sammy,” his grandfather had said, “time isn’t just numbers. It’s a dance. Every little cog, every little spring in here, it’s all part of a bigger picture.”

The watch had been his grandfather’s pride and joy, but it wasn’t perfect. It ran slow, always a few minutes behind. Yet, the elder man insisted it told better time than anything else in the house. “You see, a clock like this reminds you that time isn’t fixed. It’s a feeling. It flows, like a river.”

That phrase stuck with Sam long after his grandfather passed.

Now, sitting in his quiet study, Sam wondered if the world had forgotten the flow of time. Everywhere he looked, people seemed obsessed with precision. Seconds mattered more than minutes, and efficiency trumped experience. He’d watch strangers staring at their phones, their brows furrowed as they calculated every second they spent waiting in line or sitting in traffic.

Sam wasn’t like that. He’d grown up savoring moments, letting them linger. When he made coffee, he didn’t rush through the process. He waited for the water to reach the perfect boil, watched the steam rise in lazy tendrils, and took his time stirring the cream. He didn’t time himself brushing his teeth or set timers for his dinner. He lived, not by the clock, but with it.

The analog clock on his wall had become his silent companion. Its gentle motion reminded him that time wasn’t a tyrant; it was an artist. Every tick of a digital clock was like a metronome, unyielding and impatient. But the smooth motion of the second hand on his analog clock felt more like a brushstroke. It didn’t demand his attention. It simply existed, flowing as it always had.

One day, a friend of Sam’s, Mark, came over for a visit. Mark was the kind of man who wore a smartwatch, synced his schedule to five different apps, and could tell you the time in any major city around the world.

“Sam,” Mark said, eyeing the analog clock, “how can you stand that thing? It’s so… imprecise.”

Sam smiled and gestured for Mark to sit. “It’s not about precision. It’s about the rhythm.”

“The rhythm?” Mark raised an eyebrow.

Sam nodded. “Look at it. Really look at it.” He pointed at the clock, where the second hand swept in a slow, steady arc. “It doesn’t rush. It doesn’t bark orders. It just moves. Constant, unchanging. It’s the closest thing we have to infinity.”

Mark scoffed. “Infinity? Sam, it’s a clock. It tells time. It’s outdated.”

“Maybe,” Sam admitted. “But it reminds me of something important. Time isn’t something you can hold onto. You can’t stop it or control it. You can only live in it.”

Mark didn’t seem convinced, but he didn’t argue further.

As the years passed, Sam’s analog clock became more than just a decoration. It became a symbol, a reminder of his philosophy. He found joy in the moments most people overlooked. The sunrise painted the sky in soft hues of pink and gold. The way rain tapped against the window in an uneven rhythm. The quiet moments spent sipping tea and watching the world go by.

Sam knew he couldn’t stop time, but he also knew he didn’t need to. He had his clock, his flow, his rhythm. And in a world obsessed with speed and precision, that was enough.

When Sam passed away in his sleep, his friends and family gathered in his study to pack up his belongings. Mark, now older and perhaps wiser, stood in front of the clock. He watched the hands move in their endless dance and, for the first time, he understood.

Mark took the clock home, hung it on his wall, and let it teach him what Sam had always known: that time is not the numbers it measures but the life it holds.",1,1733100132.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

Driving through here this reminds me of you.Walking through our town makes me miss you.  I miss you and our time together, im at the coffee shop we used to have breakfast at, we bought concert tickets at, kissed at. The restaurants surrounding me that we had so many good nights but bad nights as well. I miss you everyday and while i'm starting to live my new normal, I'm resisting change. It's hard to let you go, let us go. I miss you but it's hard to get over what we had. You were special to me and I can't knock it. I wanted us to be forever, I thought we were going to be married. Part of me does have that wishful thinking, but I know it's not true. We can never be together again, for my sake and your sake. That still doesn't shake off the feelings of you. I can’t forget yet. A part of me wants you to call and text me, tell me how much you miss me. A part of me wants to see you out here and bump into you, but, if it did happen I don't know what I would do! A part of me wants to run up to you, tell you how much I miss you and kiss you. A part of me wants you to f\*ck me and make me forget about everything bad for a little. A part of me wants to run away and a part of me hopes I never see you again. I think for now, i'm better off pretending you don't exist and avoiding you at all costs. If i see you it will hurt more and I'm not ready to be hurt more by you. I miss your face baby, I wish we could do everything one more time.I have a feeling that for a while, I'll stare off in our city, looking for you, craving you to be there hoping to see you again, but I hope that never happens. I'm not sobbing anymore, but I fear that some days I will lose control and uncontrollably sob again. I miss you and wish you were here. 



I wonder if you think about me like I think about you. I miss your body so much. I miss your voice.  I miss your eyes. I miss your lips. I miss the way your shirt smells. I miss your cologne. I miss our bed. I miss our time together. I miss you holding my feet on the couch while we watch TV. I miss you kissing on me. I miss us. it's time for me to avoid thinking about you via shopping for my new apartment and thinking about my new life without you, Without us.

After sticking to pour-overs at home and going to cafes for espresso drinks for years, my partner and I have finally decided to get an espresso setup for our home as a Christmas gift to each other.

While we both had brief stints as baristas twenty years ago, we have a lot to re-learn and would prefer to buy once rather than be on an upgrade treadmill. Workflow and ease of use matter a lot, but so do aesthetics and build quality/warranty. We are very fortunate in life to have more money than sense so budget isn't really a problem, but I'm trying to apply a reasonable budget constraint for machine and grinder combined to keep us at least mildly grounded in reality.

I've done a ton of research over the years, but it's a fast-paced industry with a lot of startups and entrants and it's been hard to track. What's your take on an espresso machine and grinder setup? Additionally, if you think we should spend a lot more (or a lot less!), I'm also open to that.

The baby monitor was ready. Instructions were given. Her phone was fully charged and the volume up. Down for a nap, and off to post. There, the hot wax was transformed into yellow flowers on mountains, and a little red boat tossed about by blue waves. Two hours of dreaming in wax.

The baby monitor was face down on his computer desk but she could still hear the cries through the speaker. It was clear he hadn’t moved from his chair in several hours. Protein bar wrappers and empty wine bottles littered the desk. The pile of crumpled white tissues had grown. 

She picked him up and noticed the wetness. With the wetness always came the redness. Sure enough, his little bottom was screaming. She changed him, dried him, and applied liberal amounts of diaper rash cream hoping to avoid another exhausting trip to the doctor. She fed him, and played with him, and read him a book.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

Not sure.,"So I've recently started using my X/Twitter account that I've had for quite some time.  Anyway, in the midst of giving likes and following accounts.  I've had some follow me back and a few DMs.  Started DMing back and forth with one of them.  She's a girl, from London and originally from Thailand.  She seems really nice and all, saying nice things.  After DMing a bit, she wanted to chat on another app, and I told her I had a Skype account, but she didn't have one.  She asked to move to Telegram or Whatsapp.  I didn't have either, but got on Telegram and we chatted some more.  Exchanged pics and then found out she works for a large financial corp as a cryptocurrency analyst and accountant.  Crypto was a red flag for me.  And on her X/Twitter account the handle was a different name with a number at the end than what her name was. Heronly a l name was on the account though.  That was another red flag.  I asked her about the handle and why it was different and she said she would answer on video call.  I declined because I didn't think I'd look good enough for a video chat after kind of grunging around on my Sunday and I was going to bed soon.  I also felt it was moving kind of fast, but I didn't say that part.  

I started researching scams, and saw that there are indeed scams that do these things and even do fake video calls.  But she didn't ask for money or anything, just things like if she came to my country we could get together for coffee and talk and if I came to hers, the same.  So I'm not entirely sure if it's a scam or not.  She could eventually ask for money or to invest or something I guess.  I just wondered what others thought.  

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that her X/Twitter account was started in 2013 but her posts only go back to July of this year.  And there's over 1,000 followers as well and she follows only a little over 200.

There wasn’t much room for my kids and I to move into an already established house- so much of our things were sold or put into storage. His mom had things just so in the kitchen and had no boundaries to eating food that wasn’t hers (which exacerbated her medical conditions) so I had all of my kitchen items in a separate pantry and fridge/freezer in another pet if the house and would have to take everything needed to the kitchen to cook a meal. I did all the cleaning. I helped take care of his mom. I took care of his son. For 3 years, I made the house as homey as I could, while it didn’t really feel like mine or my kids. Then his mom went into a home and a week later his brother was evicted so I said he could stay with us for a few months to get back on his feet. A week after that we had a total house fire. We spent 4 months in hotels. The stress nearly broke us. We finally get into a very nice rental and my insurance gave me a much bigger check as I did all the leg work for claiming every last thing I could think of that was mine- he only claimed what he had amazon receipts for. Once we get into the place, and need to buy new furnishings- he tells me I can make the house how I want it, he wants this place to feel like home- already kinda doesn’t because his brother is there and I’m always having to be mindful of that- X needs in the shower at a certain time for work, X needs to smoke when he’s stressed, C needs it quiet for his work schedule, ask X what he needs from the store, X will want to eat food too- make enough for everybody. Drives me crazy, but it should only be for a few months right? I can deal that Long. Thing is, I don’t think he’s ever leaving, plus anything I try to do with the house is somehow a problem. I picked all the furniture- (he went with me and I was only looking at things I thought he’d like too and he agreed on) I placed all the furniture (there are only so many places it can go with how the house is designed) and he has stipulations for everything. Even with super wide hallways- he didn’t want anything in them, like a small table by the door or a place to put shoes- said it looked too crowded (had them at the last place). There was no storage upstairs for bedding or towels but he didn’t want any cabinet or anything in the 6 foot wide hallway because it would be crowded(we had 2 huge ones in our much smaller hallway at the last place). He didn’t want me to place anything on the walls because I never put stuff high enough (he’d have the TV butted up to the ceiling if it were up to him) he didn’t want a coffee table because it would make people walk in front of him watching tv on the couch to get to the slider door (he expects everyone to walk way out of their way and around all the furniture for him to not have to blink for 2 seconds or move his head an inch and miss zero tv). He also now wants my lap dog of 14 years and that always slept with us to no longer be allowed on the furniture. He doesn’t think we should have pillows and blankets in then living room because it invites people to lay down and they can do that in their rooms (not even for a movie night!!)  And he thinks my kids need shorter showers and next to no bathroom time (they are 3 teen boys sharing a room)- I did talk to them about making time shorter with 7 people in one house and only 2.5 bathrooms but he’s gotten into timing them and getting mad and saying I’m being disrespectful for letting them! He literally woke me up at 3:00am the other night saying my son took a short shower but then was in the bathroom for another 40 minutes and what if someone woke up and had to walk downstairs to use the other bathroom?!?! It’s really become a thing where it’s a your kids/ family vs my kids thing and I just don’t know if we can come back from this.

Hey guys, a little back story:
I (25F) got married about 6 months ago, and my best friend (23F), whom I was extremely close to, felt really bad and cried a lot at the time considering that I'll be too busy with my new life, which is very understandable. 

Since after my honey moon, I've been trying my best to spend time with her. I would invite her over or visit her about once a week. However going out daily like our pre-marriage routine has become nearly impossible for me to achieve. Since then (about a month and a half into my marriage) she started making many friends every month from her regular coffee shop, university or even online and I can see that they're friendship is becoming stronger as time goes by.

Now seeing that makes me feel extremely jealous, as if she no longer enjoys my company and my stories have become too bland for her, or that I started developing different hobbies (baking and gardening). I know I can't confront her because if anything it will only suffocate her and make her feel obligated to spend time with me, which is not what I want.

I still love her and see her as my best friend but I'm starting to notice that I might not be hers anymore. 
The other day she wanted to play it takes two ( a two player game) and we did for a few days, I wake up the next day she's playing it with someone else and we haven't even finished ours. Have I become too boring? Do I just pretend to not care and move on or did I do something wrong? Do I just go on about my life and make new friends? 
I don't want to force myself in places I'm not wanted. 

I know it can sound like a silly question, but I've lost too many friendships for no reason and I'd like to at least keep the one genuine friendship I've ever had. 
Thank you in advance. 


Update: she gave me the silent treatment for the last month or so despite not knowing what i did wrong, so I confronted her yesterday. Turns out she was mad at me for having to get up every 30 minutes to check on my oven/ dinner for 20-30 minutes at a time and making her wait for too long before hopping on. She realized her reason was lame and would make her look bad so she thought not talking about it and completely ghosting me was the best option. She also kept blaming me for not initiating/ checking up on her which I did but she said nothing was wrong, and said that i was just looking for a reason to get mad... Her argument was that ""I'm not a man and should be able to pick up on social cues better and she doesn't have to clearly state that she's mad at me. I screamed at her honestly for most of the call cause wtf was that. Anyway I had to hang up halfway through and almost 48hrs later and I don't feel like talking to her at all. If anything I feel real bad for expecting anything atp. I'm guessing this is it even if we work it out it's never going back to normal. She might just be looking for an excuse to stop being friends w me and I'm considering cuttung her off atp. ",1,1733099405.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

The “problem”starts when people do make faces to react when I am too aggressive in my tone even if it’s just the way I normally talk (bold, impossible to ignore, authoritative and direct).

It starts when I really hate and get mad at people that are too slow, incapable of doing what their doing, uselessly loud or repetitive, when they are proud of how poorly they work whilst hiding from their resposabilities at work to take advantage of others / do not care about them. 

The problem is huuuuge. Because my superiors do not like me and I need to force a smile and a bubbly, always-available facade to not get myself in trouble. 

I know that to not be in their grace is not going to affect my salary or anything like that, but if they could choose to whom dove a favour against the rules, they would choose others. 

I’ve always played the part of the cutie, dumb dumb girl that shows her insecurities and humble attitude to make her way into the world as the pure, funny and actually not so incompetent cookie. 

It worked for everyone: others did not feel as I were the enemy or an “aggressive” bitch or probably they just didn’t mind it.
In any case it was a shell that was protecting me from being targeted as the annoyed, tense and hostile person that you can’t talk to before she gets her coffee and her morning routine done. It worked perfectly. The only thing that was not okay with it was my inner child, inner peace, and authenticity.

Now I am going to be diagnosed with autism and I paid shit tons of money just to get validated by a doctor and let myself be finally unconsciously myself as I’ve never felt I was allowed to be. And it’s working!!!

But the problems are already arising. 
I got already a huge list of people that I dislike and that dislike me. I’m not afraid of not being seen as the perfect, quiet girl that felt guilty for everything she did or didn’t do for others. And this is where the real show begins.

I don’t wanna follow orders by people that are more insecure than I am. That are unnecessary rude. That are people pleasers or make illegal favours to get to be liked by my colleagues. 
I do not want to force a small talk 10 minutes after waking up w my flatmates. 
I don’t wanna smile if i don’t want to.
I don’t want to be super happy about every single fact people say to me. 

I am not saying I am finally happy becoming a Karen. I do hold myself to a very high integrity. 
All I’m talking about are daily circumstances where people are allowed to be themselves.

Before I couldn’t care less because I was such a nice person, now I am starting to notice all these little but unbearable details. And I can’t help myself. 

I do not care now if people are not treating me so nicely, I am ready to face reality and to accept people can just do not like my defined personality. It’s more about the compromise I have to meet to survive in a society without having to come back home and feel like I had to fight against billions of haters.
(Just so you know I’m exaggerating, I am still pretty popular. It’s just to prevent some scenarios as I’ll probably become more and more myself)

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1733099262.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I've been using a Behmor 1600 Plus to roast coffee from Sweet Marias for almost a decade now. 

For the last 2 years, I've had to use wet paper towels soaked in ice water placed strategically above the heat sensor to stop my machine from hitting the ""too hot"" error message and stopping the roast. I usually roast 1.5 lbs of coffee at a time (yes, yes, I know. that's more than recommended but I have a big family of coffee drinkers) - so I end up playing the 2 minute ""press the C button and re-up on ice water"" game after the main heating cycle is up. 

This is pretty irritating but not a big enough reason for me to plonk down $480 on a new Behmor 2000 AB Plus.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Admirals Pierre, Halsey, and Kelce, along with Trey, and the senior staff officers that were privy to Drov’s existence sat in Drov’s cabin. Pierre’s flag staff sat at a table behind the admirals.

“I apologize for the need to keep you isolated,” Pierre said. “And for not being able to meet with you personally until now.”

“I underssstand the need. Lieutenant Sssuliman hasss been able to ssspend time with me and keep me from feeling isssolated. I have enjoyed the food. It hasss been a while sssince we had fresssh food. Frozen food isss fine for a while.”

“But fresh food is better,” Pierre agreed. “I personally love beef bourguignon with pommes de terre sarladaises and warm crusty French bread and dacquoise for desert. But I am French, and everyone knows French food is the best.”

“I do not think I have had any French food yet.”

“Well, we’ll have to change that,” Pierre responded.

“He’s had French toast.”

“Lieutenant Suliman, I will forgive that, but just this once. French toast is not French. The earliest versions of ‘French’ toast has been traced back to the Roman Empire. In France, the dish is called ‘pain perdu.’ For those of you who are not blesses with the ability to speak French, that means, ‘lost bread.’ I could go on, but I can see eyes glazing over in the back.” Peirre turned back to Mohammad and added, “And don’t start me on French fries.”

“I would not dream of talking about French fries.”

“Wait,” Kelce interrupted, “French fries aren’t French?”

“Oh, Dieu, s'il te plaît, sauve-moi des païens incultes.”

“I think you broke him,” Trey said.

“Save me from the comedians. Anyway, let me introduce you to my staff. This is Admiral Halsey, commander of the Aglildai fleet. Admiral Kelce is my chief of staff.  Fleet Captain Horace Lagerquist is my Security Officer, my Operations Officer Captain Alcide Lapierre, Intelligence Officer Captain Cora Minardi, and Communications Officer, Commander Hwan Chae-wo. Then we have Trey, the Fleet Speaker of the Lopingu.”

“I am curiousss how a member of the Confederation isss part of your ssstaff.”

“It is a long story, but there are many Lopingu-”

Trey held interrupted the Fleet Commander with a raised hand. “A better question would be to ask, ‘why did the Confederation fail in its most basic duties to one of its members?’ Were it not for the humans, the Dalutians would be extinct. I would then ask you, ‘Why should anyone have any loyalty to the Confederation after that?’ I know what our answer is. Which is why we are standing beside the Terran Federation.”

“You already have my anssswer. I am here, aren’t I? Though my reasssonsss are not the sssame asss yoursss.”

“Then tell me, why are you here?” Pierre asked.

“The conflict between the Federation and the Osss’riat’matien.”

“I don’t understand.”

“The Osss’riat’matien Consssortium wasss behind the Ublot blockade.”

“And therefore, they caused the conflict between Terra and the Tloung-hi,” Kelce finished.

“Yesss. My consssortium, the Brekond’di’matien, wasss the sssecond mossst powerful, and by that I mean we had the sssecond mossst casssh and collateral, until the Ublot debacle. I wasss on Terra, doing my bessst to sssecure favorable contractsss. We had leveraged much of our capitol to sssecure the trade rightsss for sssomething your people avoid but to my people isss a delicacy.  A mold named assspergillus carbonariusss that producesss the mycotoxin ochratoxin. To you it is lethal. To my people, it producesss a reaction much like coffee or chocolate doessss in humans. For me, it is a mildly addictive stimulant.

“On my planet, it isss incredibly difficult to produce. On Terra, it isss an unwanted contaminant in vinyardsss. My people would, I believe your term is ‘make money hand over fist.’ I wasss about to clossse the contract when the Osss’riat’matien attacked your human cargo ssships in the Ublot sssysstem. My consssortium lossst billions of miktars.”

“So you really were a trade attaché to your embassy on Terra?” Mohammad asked. “Honestly, I thought you were an intelligence agent.”

‘Oh, I wasss… But that wasss a sssecondary asssignment. But I only gathered intelligence on financial and trade information. Or what you call indussstrial essspionage. I wasss not very good at it. I wasss more interesssted in the assspergillusss carbonariusss contract. It would have made me a junior partner.”

“What caused your consortium to lose so much money?” Pierre leaned forward, leaning his chin on clasped hands.

“Your people attacked all Tloung-hi ssshipping. My people lossst half their merchant fleet, with full loadsss. Admiral Pierre, your family ownsss a cargo fleet. How would that have affected your clan?”

“It would have destroyed us. If I were you, I’d hate humans.”

“I could. I easssily could have hate humansss. But you didn’t ssstart the conflict. The Osss’riat’matien Consssortium did. They had to know how Terra would ressspond to their attack on your ssshipsss. And for that, I hate them.”

“Damn.” Pierre sighed. “Double damn.”

“But there isss more, Admiral. Ssssso much more.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The *Conqueror’s* Flag conference room was full to overflowing. It could normally sit fifty people comfortably. It now sat eighty uncomfortably, and the two side walls were dedicated to holographs of people who could not be present in person. The front wall was dominated by a large scale schematic of the Vredeen system. Green icons designated Federation and allied ships.

The few red icons were the lone surviving enemy ships or defensive installations. If you took the time to count them, you would only find twenty-six of them.

The blue icons were what Intel had determined were Vredeen civilian installations. They had been isolated but not attacked. That did not mean they would be spared. That decision could be put off until there was more known.

“Attention on deck!” Command Master Chief Petty Officer Daniel Osuna’s voice cut through the dull buzz of the crowd as Admiral Pierre entered the room.

Everyone stood at attention until Davis said, “As you were. Take your seats. We have a lot to cover.”

He and his flag staff sat on a raised dais at the head of the room. When the room took their seats, he tapped his datapad out flat and started to speak.

“I’ll get right to it. This has been a resounding victory. But we can’t get complacent. They now know what kind of forces we can put together. But they also know what our force levels are. That is not a secret. Other than the Aglildai fleet and the Onami, Kifful and Mepthofu cruisers, there was no way to hide the fleet’s force levels.

If we gathered this many ships here, we had to take them from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is vulnerable right now.

“They have a couple of options. They can fort up and go strictly defensive or they can attack. I think they will attack. But I don’t think it will be an all-out attack. I think they will hit us in a series of hit and run attacks that will force us to spread our ships back out into a defensive posture.

“Our next mission here is to get the Marines to board any large wrecks and gather any intel we can. Then they will board these civilian facilities and verify they are not legitimate targets. While we have control of these stations, we will vacuum up any data we can. We have forty-eight hours.

“Next item. There are human captives on the third planet. We know how many are there. We’ve already sent a message to the planetary leadership that if those humans are harmed or not returned to us immediately, we will start dropping KEWS on them.

“And the last item, the remaining crew of the *Ōmononushi* managed to escape retake their ship. That’s how we know there are human captives there.

“It is also why we now know why the Vredeen keep attacking us.” Davis paused to let the room absorb what he’d said.

“And it is because humans attacked them first. It wasn’t Federations ships. Not Federation citizens or troops. From what we have learned, they were Bartians. That’s right. Those goddamned pirates caused this. Here’s the rub. The Confederation knew it was not us and did not inform the Vredeen. They decided to use them as catspaws. They were unknowing proxies for a Connie political block.

“And that is the big news. We know who that is. Folks, it’s the Tloung-hi. Keep it down, becuase I am not done. It is not *all* the Tloung-hi. This all stems from the Ublot conflict. We’ve never known a whole lot about the Tloung-hi’s political structure. They don’t really have one. They have oligarchs and trade consortiums. I’d call them criminal cartels, personally. But it was a single consortium, the Os’riat’matien, behind the Ublot conflict. But we didn’t know that and went to war against all the Tloung-hi, and it was not a measured response.  

“It looks like our ‘Big Stick’ diplomacy backfired. There are several oligarchs and consortiums that have decided we are enemy number one, and they are willing to go to great lengths to take us down. Unfortunately, there are plenty others in the Confederation that don’t like us. They are perfectly happy manipulating the Vredeen into attacking us.

“I can see the gears turning in your heads. You are probably thinking the same things I did. What if we told the Vredeen what we have learned? What if we backed off? Could this be resolved without more bloodshed? I thought that. So, I reached out the Prime Minister and asked what she wanted us to do. She told me to send them all the information we have. All of it. Every… single… bit… of data.

“I did that five hours ago. I also offered to meet with their senior military and civilian leaders. If they respond that they want to meet, I will go meet them. If not, then we are still at war.

“If we agree to a cease fire, we will immediately retreat back to the hyperlimit. Knowing this, I want to avoid more bloodshed if we can. But it does not address the fact that they executed prisoners of war. That is unacceptable. But, that is for the politicians to negotiate. If they choose to let it go in the name of lasting peace, so be it. We are the military. We knew the deal when we signed up, and we obey lawful orders.”

The room sat in stunned silence.

The *Ōmononushi’s* escape was common knowledge. The circumstances were not. There’d been thousands of rumors and opinions. They’d kept Drov’s presence completely secret. Outside of the *Ōmononushi’s* crew, no more than ten people knew of his existence.

Though everything he’d shared had proved to be accurate, Davis was still unsure about the Tloung-hi’s motivations. Lieutenant Suliman’s report was very detailed. Pierre and Kelce agreed that Drov was likely an intelligent agent of some sort. The were able to verify his presence on Terra. The Office of Naval Intelligence and the Federal Intelligence and Investigation Service both suspected he was a spy, but they could never prove it. With his cover as a consulate trade official meant he had been untouchable without proof.

Davis planned on meeting both Drov and Suliman later that day. He wanted to get a feel for Drov himself, not rely on other people’s opinions or watered down reports.

“Now, I am sure everyone has questions. I cannot answer all of them. Not that I don’t want to, I cannot. Now, we need to talk about the nuts and bolts. Missile resupply is behind schedule, but I expect full replenishment for all ships within thirty-six hours. Priority goes to the missile ships and battlewagons. Defensive missiles haven’t been a problem.”

The meeting lasted for another hour and a half. It was necessary, but long and boring.

“Asss prisssonsss go, thisss one isss not ssso bad,” Drov said. “At leassst I have good food.”

“You aren’t a prisoner. Not really. There are no guards.” Mohammad waived towards the hatch.

“But I am not allowed to leave. That makesss me a prisssoner.”

“No, it makes you a secret we don’t want everyone to know about. Look, you probably, not probably… You saved our lives. We don’t want to reward that with putting a target on your back. If you ever want to go back home, this,” Mohammad raised both hands and looked around the room, “can never get out.”

“You think they will let me go home?”

“If we can keep your name and involvement a secret, then yes. That is why Admiral Pierre has kept a tight lid on everything. My only fear is that the damned politicians get involved and muck things up. It sometimes feels like that is all they do.”

“Another universssal conssstant. Politissshiansss ‘muck thingsss up,’ if not worse. I think they take a classss on it when they get elected.”

That comment caused both of them to laugh, though the Tloung-hi’s laugh was more like a crackling, wheezing hiss.

“I do want to go home. My matesss will be missssing me.”

“Mates? More than one?”

“Yesss. My people are much different than othersss we have encountered. You have two gendersss. We have three. What you would call male and female and a third which you do not have a name for. We call them t’juka. It translates into ‘one who births.’

“The mechanicsss of our procreationsss hasss some parallelsss to some of your Terran creaturesss call oviposssitorsss. I believe they are called sssearhorsssesss. The male fertilizesss the egg, the female then deposssitsss the egg onto the male ssseahorsss who carriesss the eggsss to term. With my people, the egg is deposssited into the t’juka, who carriesss it to term and givesss birth.

“My people can switch from male or female to t’juka and back. But we cannot switch from male to female.”

“That is the first I have heard of a species with three genders,” Mohammad confirmed. “I’ve heard of a single gender species, the Jinkari.”

“I have not heard of them,” Drov replied.

“The are an interesting species. They are a sulfur-based lifeform with titanium oxide blood. They are a subterranean species.  Comparatively, they are all female, but that is only because they give birth. They reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. They constantly trade genetic material through contact with other Jinkari, which is how they have genetic differentiation.”

“You are a wealth of information. I am impresssed.”

“My parents are college professors. They taught me to be inquisitive… not just to ask questions, but to ask the right questions. Of course all that is useless if you don’t pay attention to the answers.”

“I wasss an indifferent ssstudent. A failing of mine at the time. I have learned the value of inquisssitivenesss.”

“Good for you. Now, I don’t know about you, but I am hungry. What sounds good?”

“Wafflesss? Or fajitasss?”

“Waffles? Breakfast for dinner… I’m game. My mom used to make it for us when we were kids. I only realized when I was older that it was much easier than making a full blown dinner. But waffles with a little fresh orange juice, lots of butter and maple syrup? Sounds delicious. I’ll order some up.”

Since coming aboard the *Conqueror*, Drov had been confined to quarters however, Admiral Pierre had given him a VIP guest room. Mohammad had no duties and decided to share as much time with the Tloung-hi as he could. He hoped it made Drov more comfortable and not feel like a prisoner. Having been a prisoner just a few days ago, he absolutely knew how his friend might feel.

“We can do fajitasss tomorrow?”

“Count on it.  Unless Admiral Pierre asks us to dinner. I could eat some good French food.”",6,1733098685.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1h4hvhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h4hvhi/gf_wants_me_to_meet_her_ex_they_are_still_friends/,GF wants me to meet her Ex (they are still friends & same social circle)?,"I (31M) have been dating my now girlfriend (27F) for about 6 months. This is my first relationship. I entered the dating world in my late 20s and have dated around and nothing has lead to a connection worthwhile of a relationship till now. I've only had 1 sexual partner in the past. Whereas my partner has has had three 1 year long relationship, and other dating experiences prior. She's had 9 sexual partners in the past. 

When I met my girlfriend, she said her 2nd last relationship was toxic. She took a break of dating and had to go into therapy. She then met a guy through work after her last breakup. They became very good friends. He really liked her, and asked her out, wanted to date her for the experience. They already had identified that it wouldn't lead to anything long term given religious differences.

Given her last bad relationship, she started dating him as a way to realize that there were good guys out there. Their relationship lasted 1 years and it ended on amicable terms, they are still good friends. 

When we started going out, she mentioned she was still friends with her ex, and would see him at work occasionally. I figured they’d grab coffee and just talk every once in a while.

The problem is now I’ve come to realize that he is a part of her social circle at work. Her co-workers are good friends with her. They have a lot of mutual friends. She asked me to meet her co-workers and meet him too.

I can be cordial with my GF’s Ex if i randomly bump into him. I just don’t like the idea of always having him around in our social circe (i.e. I wouldn’t want to have her ex over at my house, etc). I know some people would be comfortable with it, but the idea of being around someone who has been physically intimate with my wife, and has loved her makes me feel weird  and uncomfortable (this is due to my dating experience)? She can continue to hang out him and her co-workers, but I prefer to stay out of it. Does this make me an asshole?  she thinks i should be comfortable with this as their relationship is completely platonic. 

On another note, I mentioned to her that a very good friend of mine, and I had feelings for reach other at one point, but we didn’t go out at that time due to religious differences as well. We never dated or crossed any boundaries, we both have long moved past this. She is now happily married, and she is still good friends with me.

My GF hasn’t met my friend yet, I’m not sure how she would feel about being friends with her. I don’t know if she’ll bring the comparison that since I expect her to hangout with my friend (who i had feelings for), I should be okay to hang out with her Ex. But in my opinion, we didn’t even date, just acknowledged our feelings and decided against it, whereas my GF had a relationship. What are your guys thoughts on this?

1h4hvf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4hvf7,Aussie Front lip and fire extinguisher bracket installed,"Joined a while back but I’m not much for posting. Just wanted to share the how Flow Designs Australia front lip and fire extinguisher look. Decent price with the conversion of USD to AUD and the shipping was way faster than I thought.

The parts feel really well made, the front lip has plenty thickness to help protect the bumper and there’s a few good instructional videos on YouTube to help. I added bumper guards underneath too since even at stock ride height I’d scrapped both the bumper and then a week later it’s PPF.

Fire extinguisher bracket feels sturdy, I know there’s the ongoing joke about them catching on fire but you never know when you or someone else will need it. 

It’ll definitely take a few hours to install given the tight space for the chassis mount (and my garage), at least 2-3 hours for the front lip and another hour for the bracket and adjusting the position of the fire extinguisher. Took me under 6 hours from when I opened my garage to when I drove it off the ramps with everything installed (minus ~45 minutes to have coffee/breakfast with the gf and start a load of laundry).

1h4hvdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1h4hvdr/completed_the_w_trek_midnov_ama/,Completed the W Trek mid-Nov. AMA,"Sorry for the super long post! Wanted to give give back to this community that helped us (M36 & F37) a great deal while planning our trip. Ask me anything. We are regular day-hikers in the Pacific Northwest area and this was the first multi-day hiking/backpacking trip for us. We did the trek East to West.

We booked our campsites, meals, park ticket, bus and ferry transportation via Las Torres (it was \~$125 per person more expensive vs booking everything ourselves). We opted to rent tents and sleeping bags from the campsites since we wanted to minimize the weight we were carrying (being the first multi-day hiking trip for us). We booked Vegan meals (details on the food we got below) but also carried Vegan energy bars, Gu energy gels, and a small pack of cashews. 

For the trek we both carried a 36L backpack (Osprey Stratos & Sirrus) and 2 foldable daypacks from Osprey. We had space remaining in our packs even after carrying a Mirrorless camera during the trip. The weather was kind during our time there (light wind, mostly cloudy and a very light drizzle at times).

Including descriptions of all our meals because 1) being vegan, we were concerned we might be given vegetarian food passed off as vegan and ended up carrying more food than we needed to 2) it's expensive - so want to give folks an idea of the quality/variety so you can decide if its worth it, to reduce some weight off the back. Overall impression - it might be a good idea to book dinner and carry other meals if you're looking to reduce cost. It's nice to be able to get a warm meal after a long day.

**Our Day wise plan** (all distances and elevation details from Garmin Fenix 8):

* Day 1: Central to Chileno (1-way details below). We reached central around 4.30 PM and started by 5 PM
   * Distance: 5.9 km / 3.7 mi
   * Elevation gain: 445 m / 1460 ft
   * Elevation loss: 178 m / 584 ft
   * Dinner: 3-course meal (beetroot soup, stuffed eggplant with rice, vegan brownie). There was shared salad for the table
   * You'll get a welcome drink coupon at registration
* Day 2: Chileno to Base Torres (round trip details below). Started at 3.45 AM to see the sunrise at the Towers at 5.45 AM. We carried our day-packs for this hike.
   * Distance: 9.3 km / 5.8 mi
   * Elevation gain (& loss): 695 m / 2280 ft
   * Breakfast: Bread with hummus (more like mashed chickpeas with salt) and roasted veggies, cereal with soy milk, coffee. We ate this once we were back at the campsite. 
   * Lunch bag: Sandwich (hummus, roasted veggies, tomatoes, lettuce), Trail-mix, Orange, Apple, Vegan protein bar
   * Dinner: 3-course meal (lentil soup, black bean patties with vegan sauce, roasted potatoes with dil, vegan brownie, salad for the table). 
   * We chilled at Chileno for the day and drank beer (try the Hoppy Lager!)
* Day 3: Chileno to Cuernos (1-way details below). We left \~8 AM after breakfast
   * Distance: 13 km / 8.1 mi
   * Elevation gain: 439 m / 1440 ft
   * Elevation loss: 764 m / 2507 ft
   * Breakfast (at Chileno): same as Day 2
   * Lunch bag (from Chileno): same as Day 2
   * Dinner (at Cuernos): 3-course meal (vegetable soup, soy & potato cutlets with rice, strawberry pudding most likely made from coconut milk)
   * This was one of the most beautiful days during the W with great views of Lago Nordenskjöld throughout. There is a great wide spot at the top of the ascent peak where you have the lake on one side and Cuernos mountain on the other
* Day 4: Cuernos to Britannico to Paine Grande (details by sector below). We started at 6 AM and requested for our breakfast and lunch bags to be ready overnight. 
   * Total for the day
      * Distance: 26.5 km / 16.5 mi
      * Elevation gain: 1214 m / 3986 ft
      * Elevation loss: 1266 m / 4154 ft
   * Cuernos to Italiano Ranger station (1-way)
      * Distance: 5 km / 3.1 mi
      * Elevation gain: 290 m / 950 ft
      * Dropped our backpacks here and carried our day pack for Britannico
   * Ranger station to Frances viewpoint (1-way)
      * Distance: 2.9 km / 1.8 mi
      * Elevation gain: 335 m / 1100 ft
      * \~0.8 miles was relatively flat with all the elevation gain in the last mile. The climb was filled with annoying (at least on the way-down) small rocks/pebbles
   * Frances to Britannico viewpoint (1-way)
      * Distance: 3.9 km / 2.4 mi
      * Elevation gain: 311 m / 1020 ft
      * the trail was soft mud with ups and downs and gradual elevation gain for 90%. the last 10% had a steep climb over bigger rocks
   * Ranger Station to Paine Grande (1-way)
      * Distance: 7.6 km / 4.5 mi
      * Elevation gain: 220 m / 720 ft
   * Breakfast (at Cuernos): Bread with hummus (more like mashed chickpeas with salt) and roasted veggies, cereal with soy milk, coffee.
   * Lunch bag (from Cuernos): Sandwich (hummus, soy-based meat, lettuce), Trail-mix, Orange, Apple, Vegan protein bar
   * Dinner (at Paine Grande): Buffet style. vegetable soup, chickpeas, red sauce, rice, boiled pasta, steamed mashed corn wrapped in a corn husk (had to ask for this and they got it from the kitchen), salad & hummus, vegan dessert (bottom most in the refrigerator)
* Day 5: Paine Grande to Grey & back (sector wise details below). We started at 7.30 AM and carried just our daypacks. We checked in our back-packs for the day for USD 8. We caught the 6.40 PM ferry back to the bus for Puerto Natales. The views from the ferry are fantastic, so opting for the open deck is a good idea. We thought it might get really cold and windy, but it wasn't too bad. 
   *  Total for the day (round-trip): 
      * Distance: 24.6 km / 15.3 mi
      * Elevation gain (& loss): 971 m / 3185 ft
   * Paine Grande to Lago Grey viewpoint (1-way)
      * Distance: 6.3 km / 3.9 mi
      * Elevation gain: 328 m / 1077 ft
      * Elevation loss: 118 m / 387 ft
   * Lago Grey viewpoint to Grey glacier viewpoint (1-way)
      * Distance: 6 km / 3.73 mi
      * Elevation gain: 188 m / 618 ft
      * Elevation loss: 336 m / 1103 ft
      * All the elevation gain is on the way back with mostly big rocks
   * Breakfast (at Paine Grande): Bread with vegan cheese slices (we asked for hummus and the kitchen gave us this!), Jam, Cereal with almond milk, coffee/tea
   * Lunch bag (from Paine Grande): Sandwich (with lots of hummus and lettuce), 2 packs of trail mix
   * The views from the Lago grey viewpoint are very good and you can consider going just till this point

Overall, the food at Las Torres campsites was more elaborate and tasty but the quantities were fixed. Vertice campsites (we only stayed at Paine Grande) had simple food with as many refills. Personally, we preferred the vegan food (across meals) at Las Torres campsites. 

**Things we would change:**

1. Stay at Frances campsite instead of Cuernos. It makes the Britannico day shorter with a smaller climb.
2. Probably reach Frances/Cuernos on Day-2 itself after taking a break at Chileno after the sunrise hike to Base Torres. Would not change staying the first night at Chileno as Base Torres at sunrise is spectacular. Possible to do it from Central but that would require leaving very early. 
3. Spend a night at Grey Campsite (by making it to Frances/Cuernos on Day-2). This way we could have seen the suspension bridges near the glacier. Folks we met on the trail said it was 3.2 km/2 mi one way which was difficult to add on an already long last day for us. ",2,1733098659.0,Patagonia,5,1.0,False

In a cafe anywhere else I’ve been in the world taking your mugs to the counter is a very polite thing to do, but absolutely not the norm in a cafe. Is that not the case here? I’m now worried about what I need to do…

But I'd love to hear your suggestions for hidden gems, local experiences, or underrated spots that might not be on every tourist's list.

I'll be hopping between Rio & Sao Paulo, soaking in the culture, and of course, indulging in some delicious Brazilian cuisine. If you have any recommendations for food, local festivals, or even tips on how to blend in with the locals, I'm all ears.

Also, I wouldn’t mind connecting with people before I get there. Whether you’re a local or a fellow traveler who’ll be around at the same time, it’d be great to chat or maybe even meet up for a coffee (or a caipirinha!).

Stef got upset because I didn't text her right away for the grand total of 5 minutes. I couldn't even take a piss without her threatening to cut me off to which I replied ""do what you want"". Stef apologized the morning of day three,love bombing me and asking questions to get to know me.

She proceeded to tell me she has a boyfriend and they have been dating for 3 years. She was willing to throw away a 3 year relationship over a guy she met like 10 minutes ago. I didn't even buy her a cup of coffee. Stef tells me the only thing keeping her in her current relationship is she depends on him to get her through her med school internship. Sound familiar?

Since 2020, I’ve been super anxious but not due to anything mental. If I don’t eat for long, or if I consume too much caffeine, or if I’m over stimulated with ADHD meds (or any combo of these), I start feeling the following symptoms:

- back of my mouth where the throat starts begins to feel like it’s closing 

- lips and areas around my mouth, begin to feel tingly with pins and needles 

- eye bags begin to feel numb and twitchy
 
- stomach starts to feel tight and pulls inward

- hands start to feel tingly and numb, fingers begin to freeze 

- thigh muscles feel tight 

- heart starts to race and feelings of impending doom ensue

This would happen without any warning or mental triggers. Can anyone relate to this experience? Does anyone know how I can rid myself of this?

What’s really weird is that I used to consume so much caffeine in my early 20s, but now recently in my late 20s I somehow can’t go past a cup of coffee without feeling the onset of these symptoms.

How did I become anxious this way over time?

Imagine this: you’re sending Bitcoin to snag that rare NFT, pay for a fancy crypto dinner, or transfer funds to your HODL wallet. You’re feeling the thrill of digital currency freedom… until you realize your transaction is crawling through the blockchain traffic jam. 😱 Suddenly, the magic of Bitcoin feels more like waiting in line at the DMV.

Enter **Bitcoin Jumper**, the ultimate Bitcoin transaction accelerator that ensures your transactions speed through the blockchain like a Lamborghini on the Autobahn. 🏎️✨

Ready to ditch the slow lane and leap into the fast track? Let’s dive into the wild world of Bitcoin Jumper!

# Why Are Bitcoin Transactions Sometimes So Slow?

Before we jump into the magic of Bitcoin Jumper, let’s understand why Bitcoin transactions can feel like they’re running on dial-up internet.

Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain, where every transaction must be verified by miners. When the network gets busy—like during a bull market or a viral meme coin launch—transactions pile up, waiting for their turn to be confirmed. If your transaction fee isn’t high enough to entice miners, your payment might be stuck in limbo for hours or even days.

It’s like trying to merge onto a busy highway with a slow car—no one lets you in. That’s where Bitcoin Jumper comes in to save the day.

# What Is Bitcoin Jumper?

Bitcoin Jumper is a **premium Bitcoin transaction accelerator** designed to boost your transactions to the front of the line. Think of it as your personal crypto VIP pass, cutting through the blockchain clutter and ensuring your payments are confirmed faster than you can say “Satoshi Nakamoto.”

🚀 **What it does:**

* Speeds up stuck or delayed Bitcoin transactions.
* Helps ensure quick confirmations, even during high network congestion.
* Works like a charm for both small and large transactions.

The best part? It’s ridiculously easy to use. Check it out here: https://www.bitcoinjumper.com.

3. **Sit Back and Relax** Watch as your transaction zooms through the blockchain and lands in its destination wallet in record time. It’s like watching your crypto dreams come true in fast forward.

1h4h9we,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h4h9we/my_wife_met_her_trainer_for_coffee/,My wife met her trainer for coffee,"So some two odd years ago my wife of 8 years (38f) and myself (37m) had a major fight. At the beginning of covid my wife wanted to help her cousin in Toronto, Canada (whose husband owns a gym) by signing up for personal training, via video chat (We live in the US on the west coast). So she signed up to work with a trainer (30’s m) that is not her cousins husband. and did so on and off for a few years. She was pretty pleased with the results but didn’t stay dedicated to it. After a couple years I tried to give his services a go, and didn’t really like the workouts and stopped doing the sessions and following his routines. These sessions lasted maybe two months for me. Fast forward to early 2023, and we have a one year old daughter now. Due to pregnancy my wife had not had any personal training sessions for quite some time. The trainer had contacted her and let her know he would be visiting our city and wanted to meet up for coffee. I told her I wasn’t really comfortable with it, and I didn’t want her to meet him in person. I really didn’t understand the need to do so, but she insisted. I was upset that I wasn’t contacted as well, seeing as how I worked with him also. At no point was I invited either. After a small spat I believed she was no longer going to have coffee with her trainer. I was wrong, the next day she went to meet him for coffee and they walked around town together for an hour or so. I was enraged by this, and we had a very toxic argument that evening. I expressed my anger about her going on a date with another man, she insisted it was not a date. We went back and forth for some time angrily. For some perspective my wife and I do not curse at each other, and RARELY stoop to name calling. That night I kept to myself and drank a bottle of scotch and smoked some cigarettes (a habit I kicked a decade ago). I understand that the self destructive behavior is toxic and I know I have issues. The topic of the coffee date, is the situation I am looking for clarity on. The next few days we discussed divorce and failed to reach resolution on the disagreement. I vehemently believed that it was a breach of trust and inappropriate behavior for a married person. After another week, we decided to work on our marriage and seek counseling. Which never really came to fruition. We just kind of put the argument on the back burner and pretended like it didn’t happen. Well recently my wife helped the trainer film an advertisement for his business, and he sent her some company swag (water bottle etc). I get extremely mad just seeing the damn water bottle in my house. Recently the coffee date issue came up in an argument as the example of me being paranoid/jealous. This is the one example of this in our eight year marriage. I stood my ground that it was not paranoia. Rather that it was an inappropriate coffee date that still upsets me to this day. So I thought I would bring it to Reddit and get some insight from other people on which one of us is in the wrong, is it both of us ? (probably). ",17,1733097030.0,AITAH,55,0.84,False

as soft as thin paper.

Our interlocked fingers,

covering and uncovering

the secrets of each crease.

You parted my nails from the skin

as grandly as one parts the sea

or spread open the newspaper.

With your breath smelling like coffee,

You poured in my ears seas of things unseen, 

you were whispering lies and they sounded 

so true.

I noticed the television seemed to be very loud, like strangely loud, I thought maybe my stepdad had just fallen asleep to the TV on again. I brought my coffee downstairs, and then went back up for a second cup. I noticed the TV was still incredibly loud, about 5am. That's when I turned the volume down and went to check on everything, I realized my stepdad is dead in his reclining chair. I just can't believe it. I gave him chest compressions for 5-6 minutes until the 911 people ambulance got to us, they said it was sadly far too late. Nothing I could've done. I still feel so sad I couldn't have saved him. He had been having a bit of heart pains the last few days and he also had to take codeine/tylenol lots for his extreme pain from having a bionic neck. Dad, (stepdad), I bet you turned that TV up hoping someone could get to you in time. Maybe it woke me up, I don't know. I'm missing you so much already. Why couldn't I save you. You were only 55. Don't know the actual cause of death yet, but I'm guessing heart attack or stroke because his arm was rigid outwards from his body. 
He technically had been my stepdad for the last 4 years. But just like a second father to me. Stepdad, dad,
I pray you didn't suffer, and I know your life ended too quickly. I ask that god take care of you and may we meet again. Your confidence, valour, strength, courage, would shine through to us everyday. I'm going to miss you forever. I wish I could've saved you but I know there was no chance. I'm going to live better, healthier, stronger, and pray for you everyday. I'm so sorry my stepdad, you did everything for us. I will grieve forever but remain strong. Thank you for everything you ever did for us. My stepdad, you were a second father to me. We had a special bond, we had hundreds of texts and everyday a great conversation when I did get to see you. Dad, my amazing stepdad, I love you. I'm going to miss you forever. I don't know how to feel right now. I don't understand how you could go so soon. You and my mother were getting married soon, very soon, and you treated us like gold. Your soul was bigger than the universe. Dad...I'm so sorry I couldn't help. Dad, my second father to me, I wish I could've saved you. Please rest easy now that you're in heaven.

As I set down my mug I felt blood rush through my body and my vision got blurred and I fell, I remember falling and rolling to my side and closing my eyes. I honestly had felt like I had fallen back asleep but was jolted awake by my husband “yelling” for me to wake up. Honestly don’t know it it was yelling but it looked like it. My ears had been ringing as I closed my eyes and when I came out of it. Total the whole thing lasted about 2 minutes and he called 911, and I was very very out of it and could barely answer.


As the medics sat me in the chair to take me down the stairs I had another episode, I remember the medics asking me questions but I felt like I was trapped in my body and couldn’t talk. 

Both times when I came to I was clammy and greenish pale. And very disoriented. I think
I slept for the majority of the time
I was in the er.

I was told I was dehydrated but had been hydrated and drinking lots of electrolytes especially since I had run an ultra about 10 days prior… and have been in worse states of dehydration with nothing occurring…

It’s two days later and I still have been drinking fluids and eating but had another episode of feeling like I was going to pass out and managed to get laying down before anything happened…. 

Thoughts or has anyone been in this similar situation? 

I guess I’m mainly scared because a few years ago my husband had a few episodes of syncope and was diagnosed with a heart condition and had a pacemaker implanted… so to be frank I’m just a little nervous and maybe a touch of my anxiety from his heart has made me very nervous and honestly scared as to why now… ",1,1733096658.0,Syncope,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t really expecting anything just trying to talk to new people and maybe have a little fun. Then I came across Sam’s profile. He wasn’t the typical type I usually go for but there was something about his bio that caught my attention. He seemed genuine, down to earth and not trying too hard.

Our first conversation was slow, a little awkward even but there was an easy kind of sincerity in his messages. We shared a few laughs about the quirks of our jobs and how difficult it was to balance work and life. He didn’t rush things and we started to talk about real-life stuff.... parenting, dealing with stress, our favorite ways to unwind after a long week. It felt refreshing. Like I could actually be myself without the pressure to impress.

After a couple of weeks of chatting, we agreed to see each other for coffee. I was nervous, more so because I hadn’t had time for myself in so long. But when I saw him walk into the café, he wasn’t at all what I expected in the best way possible. He wasn’t overly polished, just casual and relaxed. And surprisingly, I wasn’t anxious at all. We started talking about everything his family, my daughter, the ups and downs of our careers and before I knew it, hours had passed. It felt like the easiest conversation I’d had in a long time.

We didn’t have an instant connection but it was a connection, and that was enough. It wasn’t a whirlwind romance but a calm, real moment where I felt like I was seen, not just as a mom or a teacher but as me. And for once, that felt like the best thing to happen in a long time.

I’m not rushing anything but I’m curious to see where it goes. Sometimes, the best connections don’t come with fireworks sometimes, they’re just comfortable and real and maybe that’s all I need right now.",1,1733096560.0,DatingStory,0,1.0,False

My next potential roommate and I (both in our mid-20s males) are planning to move back to the city this upcoming spring after saving some money while living at home. I used to live in Irving Park but moved back to the burbs with my parents to save up. Most of my friends are still in Irving/Avondale, but I’m open to other neighborhoods and would love to hear your suggestions!

**Here’s what we’re looking for**:

* We both have cars, and I need to commute to the western suburbs (Wheaton/Warrenville) for work. I’m willing to deal with the commute for a few months while I look for a job in the city. Ideally, I’d like off-street parking or easy street parking.
* Portage Park is probably the furthest west I’d go, but I’m wondering if something further west, like Dunning, would make sense for my commute.
* We’re not big on nightlife, so being near bars isn’t a priority.
* We both make music and spend a lot of time indoors, so having a comfortable, functional space is important.
* A yard or balcony for relaxing/entertaining would be a bonus.
* We’re cool with sharing a bathroom.
* Budget: $1950 for a 2-bedroom.
* Ideally, we’d like to be near a coffee shop or grocery/corner store.

I’ve looked at Edgewater, Portage Park, Andersonville, North Center, Logan Square, and Mayfair. Any thoughts on these or other areas? Appreciate any insights—thanks so much!",0,1733096418.0,AskChicago,5,0.5,False
1h4h23j,https://i.redd.it/2ras3kjdpb4e1.png,Pro tip: Cook your Ginseng,"When I got home this morning I hopped on Debug mode to do some testing and it appears that beverages might be hilariously broken.

With Level 0 cooking a single container of Coffee makes 6 cups that each do -8 fatigue, which loses 2 from the bag itself, and tea bags function as you would expect using one tea bag per drink and giving the full -15 fatigue it normally gives.

At cooking level 5 the coffee makes 7 cups that each give -7 fatigue, only losing 1 compared to the can, but tea bags continue to use the full tea bag while making a drink that only gives -12 fatigue giving a loss of 3.

At cooking level 10 though it gets worse, one bag of coffee makes 8 drinks that each give -5 fatigue and one that gives -2 fatigue, losing 8 potential fatigue compared to just eating coffee grounds like a goblin. Tea's trend also gets worse, giving only -10 fatigue when using the entire tea bag to make a drink.

I also experimented with combining fatigue restoring items and adding multiple doses of each, but the fatigue restored is based off of the last item added with that effect, so no matter how much coffee tea or both you add to a drink, it will only restore the fatigue of one dose of the last added item.

I did test strawberries as well, and at cooking level 10 they add -5 unhappiness compared to the -10 they have when fresh, but when added to a drink they will not expire and cooking the beverage brings it up to -7 unhappiness.

The most important takeaway is ginseng, it's obtainable through foraging and is the only item in the game that currently directly restores endurance, at a +2 endurance when eaten raw. I mainly made this post because I discovered something that doesn't seem to be mentioned on the wiki. Regardless of cooking level, adding ginseng to a beverage will consume the entire piece of ginseng and add it as a spice, while adding the full +2 endurance to the beverage. If you then cook the beverage the endurance recovery goes up to +4 endurance, doubling the effectiveness of each piece.

I also tested the various herbs but wasn't able to verify as much as I would have liked with the time I had to test. It does seem like adding lemongrass as a spice will apply the sickness reduction effect when you drink it, so making beverages with coffee ginseng and lemongrass may be worthwhile for long-term horde fighting as drinking them can slowly manage your fatigue endurance and corpse sickness.

Both houses had dogs present so I blamed that initially, but removing myself from the environment didn't help and doing my inhaler only helped a little. Typically animal allergies will first make my skin and eyes red and itchy and will only progress to breathing issues with prolonged exposure.

 I don't have any food allergies but I am allergic to cockroaches which I've heard can be found to some degree in most coffees, and also nickel. I don't have this reaction to any other coffee to my knowledge, and typically my nickel allergy results in an itchy throat, not shortness of breath. I don't know how my cockroach allergy manifests because I've never lived somewhere with cockroaches. 

I've heard some folks with soy allergies have problems with it, but I'm not allergic to soy (that I know of).

After trying an Aeropress with freshly ground coffee at my sibling's house a month ago, I decided to get an Aeropress, a cheap electric grinder, and some local whole coffee beans.

My goodness does it make a difference! I actually look forward to drinking coffee! I enjoy the process and the smell it brings!

As someone who play Law since Tekken 6, and seeing the movesets from him in comparison To many other charakters in Tekken 8 , i cannot make sense out of the Information.  
For some more information i am atm going between battle ruler and fujin up and down.

do not missunderstand , i know that Law is incredbly annoying to play against , he has a varied moveset that leans towards mindgames ,but as drawback for that he has extremly low combo damage ( in comparison to 90% of the cast) most of his moves are extremly punichable , and almost every move is very easy to fuck up.  
Then you compare that to charakters people constantly try to tell me are hard to play , like kazuya ,brian and yoshi, and i sit there and ask how the fuck those charakters are even comparable to law.

Laws 3+4 ,3 is minus on block for law and launcher punishable by everyone in the game when you duck the flying kick.  
d/b 3 is guranteed launch on block, you can still be hit my mid moves during the 27!!!! frame windup the move has. No other charakter that i played against so far has had even close to that much windup while ALL OF THEM are unhitable by mid moves when they are in that kind of animation. (prime examples, xiayouh, the coffee bitch, Lee, the hole mishima cast )  
ws 3 , one of the few safe options to generate frame advantage , can be easily fucked up in three different way , all leading to getting guranteed launched.  
The nomral Punch String 1 1 1 is minus 13 on block.  
b2,3,4 can be guranteed low parried ( which is one of the main way to go dss )  
b3+4 is -14 on block  
f/d/f 4 ( the slide) no only has a extremly telling and slow windup, is also guranteed pick up on block.  
his parrys are increadbly hard reliant on prediction while others can simply press parry PREEMPTIFLY and parry any mid or high move thrown atm ( case example : Yoshi, ashuka,heihachi )

And i might just add, most of those moves are bread and butter moves for law.  
Ofc he also has some advantages (Dss combo extansion are insane, Mixup Potential)

His rage art is one of the lowest damage ones in the game, he has 3 moves that look like they hit somewhere else.  
His average combodamage is between 35 40 % without wallsplash which goes to around 50 to 60 , maybe 70 % when the enemy fucks up.  
Again , compare that to kazuya, yoshi, brian, hywroang .

All in all, Law players need to be substanial better at execusion mindgames and blocking, while getting nothing of the advantages those "" hard to play"" charakters are getting for getting their execusion right.  
ofc there are the law spammers, but they dont go beyond redrank without having another charakter drag law to over Red.  
i need to perfectly execute almost everything in order to be even standing on the same playing field as most other charakters.  
The cheapest shit in this game is still the mashima cast , and not because of a decently hard lighingt attacks.  
No all of their fucking harass moves that are insanly fast, look the same to the extend that you need to fucking guess which of the 4 varations they are going to do, and when you judge false? oh gurateed launch three quaters of your hp bar gone.  
Argubly jin is the worst of the offenders in that regard , who is also on of the strongest charakters right now.

Inspired by the movie Black Swan and having to deal with perfectionism daily. Constructive criticism is appreciated!

She looked down.
Her rosy pointe shoes are in sight. Her eyes gleam of admiration. She’s a tad taller as she stands on tiptoes. However, agony rushes through her body as she does. She squints her eyes. Crunches her nose. Grits her teeth. She looks down to her pointes which are causing all this gut-wrenching pain and comes to one conclusion, “...They’re so incredibly perfect. I love them.” She holds on to the position, slightly shaking in frailty, breathing a gasp in before eventually letting go. Lightheadedly, she falls to ground.
The warmth of a flame is burning on the other side of the room. The only light there is in the sorrowful room. Grey room. Glimmering in darkness to and fro. Next to her chess board. As a little girl she used to love playing chess. Especially with her mother. She was rather competitive, and she wasn’t the greatest of the greatest. It was fun, but she stopped. Her dark brown eyes wander to the candle. The reflectiveness of the warm lit flame is visible in those eyes. For a moment the pain ceased as she felt the warmth.
Her roommate knocks on the door. Her eyes quickly fell out of hypnosis.
“Enter,” she mumbled.
“Hey, I’ve brought you- What are you doing lying on the floor?”, she asked.
Her roommate is a rather tall woman with dark hair and skin that resembles fluffy white snow with rosy cheeks that reach to deep dark eyes.
“Nothing. Just trying on my shoes. You know? For today?”
“What’s today?” she asked.
“My performance,” she answered in a monotone voice.
“Oh, right. Sorry. I’ve brought you coffee.” She walks up to her.
One foot after another. As she took the third step, her hands falling front and eyes widening, the coffee spurs all over her.
“GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? THAT BURNS!”
“Oh no, I’m sorry! I’m so clumsy!”
“Why can’t you be in control FOR ONCE in your life?!”
“What’s wrong with you? You’re never this furious.”
“Nothing. I’m going to wash my hands,” she said as she marched away.
“I didn’t intend to burn you, god- be a little laidback,” she yelled after her.
“Ugh, always such an annoying perfectionist,” she mumbled to herself.
She took a bar of soap. “She’s always so careless. It makes her life easier.” She rubbed the light pink soap on her hands. “Why can’t she come home sober for once. It’s exhausting. It’s exhausting having to take responsibility on everything,” she thought. She put the soap back still with its water leaking.
She packed her bag. Outside it was perpetually drizzling and pitch black. But here and there were glimmering lights reflecting on puddles. The moon was bright. Bright as shimmering as glitter. Being the only attraction there is in the dark. Glooming an aura of whiteness in the centre of the sky. She was freezing to death with her light tights you could easily rip by one sudden movement. She continued to walk speedily while the rain splashing onto her face made her squint her eyes. Drafts swing her strings of hair onto her lips covering her night vision.
“Ouch. Why are my boots so tight,” she complains when she surely knows she’ll never change into comfortable ones.
She stopped. Hesitated for a bit. Looked down, front, back and left right.
“What is this doing here??”
She wanted to pick it up. She slowly kneeled down reaching her hand to the chess figure. Suddenly a hasty rush of wind made her lose her balance. She quickly stood up of fear and took a slight step back. A face was visible in the damp wall bricks.
“...Mother?”
She stood still. She rubbed her eyes. The reflection is gone. So is the chess piece.
She hastily continued to walk to her place of performance. Whilst walking she closed her eyes. She couldn’t believe what she had just seen. She arrived. In the dressing room she looked at the mirror. Her eyes stand still. A tear fell whilst putting her make- up on. She closed her eyes.
“Honey, what are you doing?”
Quickly she opened her eyes. She looked at the mirror. A hand approached her shoulder from behind. She jumped away.
“Honey?!”
The image of her mother slowly approached close to her face. She looked her up and down. Her mouth nearing her ear.
“You will never be perfect,” she whispered.
She froze as goosebumps went through her.
“I am.”
“You are not. You’ve never been. And you never will be.”
The mother took a sharpened chess figure. Her hand behind her back.
“Even your boots pain you. You’re too proud to admit what horrible traits you have. They’re perfect, aren’t they?
“They are and they do NOT pain me.”
She stood still. She saw the chess figure in the reflectiveness of the mirror.
Hysterically she pushed her to ground and took the chess figure out of hand. She tried stabbing her. Missed.
Mother’s hand grabbed her neck. She couldn’t breathe.
“YOU WILL NEVER BE PERFECT.”
“I A...M,” she answered in a cut off voice.
The face of the mother turned into her own.
“You think you can defeat yourself?” her voice echoed.
She looked into her dark emptied eyes, having no breath left and... stabbed her into heart. - “I will be perfect.”
A knock on the door. “The act is beginning!” She left the room and the body.
She positioned into 3rd position. As the waltz started playing, she stepped onto stage. Ballerinas following her intact. Step forwards, step forwards. Her head gently turning to side. The candle burning. Her hands perfectly falling into rhythm with the music. The candle still burning. Her legs straight and strained forwards with the tip of her pointe agonizingly stretching to ground. No single shaking in frailty when all she would’ve wanted to do was fall to ground and release suffering then and there. Though heavy nervous breathing. The candle burning hysterically. Her face is filled with aching beautiful expressions whilst one hand with the tip of her fingers gently touches her cheek and slides upwards into 5th position. Wax is sliding away. She looked down seeing the sight of her rosé pointes shining of stage light. They looked beautiful again. A slight smile occurred to her face. Wax sliding onto her chess board. But her heart was aching of pain. Warm lit flame burning. Her face was filled with sorrow...Her spin was perfectly timed and perfectly committed. And burning. Her tips touch the ground. Still standing in a tense position, stretching her leg up and staying like that for a relatively long time. The candle leaning into falling. Her eyebrows furrowed and her eyes closed. A tear fell, her heart pains and to be seen are blood stains. A part of wax fell to ground. The waltz comes to an end. She stretched her legs forward and kneeled with one knee down putting her whole upper body slowly front with her arms longing to the end of her leg and her head looking to ground. The flame nears the end. She lightheadedly lets herself fall to ground.
The flame lit her room. With her friend sleeping.
Fire.
“I will be perfect,” she heard her last thoughts say.
She looked over to the side while lying on the ground. She chokes on blood. Her heart red and scarred. The chess piece in sight.
“I... was.... perfect”, she said in a suppressing voice and closed her eyes slowly. 
She should’ve chosen chess over ballet.",1,1733095039.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I've seen more guys ogling over girls who are ""slim thick"" rather than skinny chic looking. Sophie Rain, an OF model, is trending right now. She is not heroin chic looking. She is slim thick. Same goes for Livvy Dunne, Tate McRae, Sydney Sweeney, and Julia Leerdam. Their comments are flooded with men. Meanwhile, girls like Gracie Abrams and Bella Hadid have mostly female attention. 

Not trying to be a misogynist, but are we doing this to ourselves? I only hear about skinny being in again from women. It doesn't seem like men give a fuck. ",493,1733094656.0,TwoXChromosomes,136,0.91,False
1h4gf7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1h4gf7l/acidwatchers_has_helped_me/,Acidwatchers has helped me,"Just marking some progress. I have had chronic cough for years in the morning + a myriad of crazy unknown health issues that has mostly been diagnosed as anxiety and migraine over the last five years.  After years of eustachian tube like pressure that I could never resolve, I finally stumbled on the possibility of respiratory reflux (LPR). According to Dr. Koufman's blog I fit the criteria very well. So joined the acid watchers facebook group beginning of October. Took me about a month, but over November I have been almost fully compliant. 

In the beginning I got worse, but over the month I with some swings, I got better. I did seem to be refluxing more, but I think actually just my numbed out nervous system was becoming ""awake"" again. I had a real ugly sour taste in my mouth for about 2 weeks, but recently that has seemed to go away. Alkaline water was making me feel burning feelings, which I was told was a sign of tissues being sensitive from damage. The weirdest thing to happen was for one day I had burning pee, which I think may have been either my urine being alkaline, or some mild kidney stones? Not sure. It went away though. So good news:  Now my morning cough has nearly disappeared. I can't remember the last time I walked the dog in the morning without coughing up a lung, and this weekend I had no problems.  Also I'm sleeping much better. I've lost 10 pounds! Sadly I still have eustachian tube pressure, so I'll keep giving this diet more time, I've heard it can take many months for the results to add up. I had a blood test as well and all was excellent - especially cholesterol. Mileage may vary there. 

I'd suggest joining the acid watchers facebook group - I'm following that protocol. I eat 4 meals a day, of low acidity. I have a Cerra water pitcher for alkaline water. I have Gaviscon before bed and through the day when needed. I have a mattress topper and wedge pillows to help keep me from refluxing at night. I also give myself 4-5 hours of space between supper and sleep. All the basic stuff. Most food I eat is rice, frozen veggies, potatos, canned salmon, sunbutter, popcorn, chicken breast, quinoa, and sprouted ezekial bread. I try to keep it simple to eliminate issues. Also sadly no coffee.

1h4geik,https://www.reddit.com/r/dyspraxia/comments/1h4geik/i_admitted_defeat_at_work_today_and_walked_out/,I admitted defeat at work today and walked out,"I’m at university to be an occupational therapist. My dyspraxia was missed as a kid and it led to me hating myself as a child because I couldn’t do what all of the other kids were doing. That influenced my decision to become an OT, because I do well academically (when I’m not under pressure in other areas and I can throw myself into it), and I want to help kids the way I should’ve been helped. 

This is relevant because being at university Monday to Friday, I’m limited in what jobs I can do. I absolutely thrive in “sit down in front of a computer” type jobs, and I also thrive doing 1 to 1 work with young children. But there’s obviously no weekend office jobs around. And again, I can’t work in a school or pre-school environment on the weekends either. This means I’m limited to hospitality, retail and cleaning/housekeeping. I did once have a retail job in cell network store, we didn’t really have a shop floor to manage which was nice, customers would come and sit with us and we’d set up their plan on the computers, and grab their phone from the back. This was perfect for me, but unfortunately I moved too far away from this job and needed the money so got this hotel job. 

For me, my dyspraxia is very much to do with my fine motor skills. There’s a bit of issue with my gross motor, I only learnt to swim last week aged 22, and bump into my boyfriend when we’re walking, but those issues don’t really affect my life. But my fine motor skills are the real problem. In most areas of my life I’ve learnt to just adapt. For example, I can never tie my shoelaces properly, so I just buy shoes without laces. I get overwhelmed with cooking, so I stick to one pot recipes where I can just throw everything in there and let it cook. I manage. Our house is clean and me and my boyfriend eat fresh, because Ive adapted. But in work, I lose the sense of control completely and it all goes to hell.

So, this job I got is based in a hotel. They have a restaurant and then 15 hotel rooms upstairs. I was originally taken on as a server but was absolutely terrible. Dropping drink trays, running food too fast and it sliding off the plate on the restaurant floor, bumping in to colleagues, spilling coffee on customers etc. The memory and customer service part of service was generally okay, but once I got overwhelmed by my dyspraxia related mistakes, I’d work myself up into a panic and then my memory and social skills would disappear too. I would start the shift happy, energetic and ready to go. I’d have a perfect couple of hours, then I’d drop something and be a mess for the rest of the shift. This happened every shift.

My manager’s said I couldn’t be a server, I agreed. They told me they didn’t want to let me go and that they wanted to try me in housekeeping as the housekeeping team upstairs were short-staffed. I was nervous given my dyspraxia but I need money, and I thought it’d be a good learning opportunity. I’m okay with general cleaning, but one thing I simply cannot do duvet covers. I end up in a huge mess, frustrated and crying on the floor. We have a system at home where my boyfriend does duvet covers. I do everything else in the house as he works 12 hour night shifts, but duvet covers are his job for my sanity. I’ll do the bedsheets, pillowcases etc, but the duvet cover is for him. 

I thought the housekeeping training would be a good opportunity to finally crack duvet covers! The poor housekeeping supervisor tried teaching me so many times but eventually got frustrated and kicked me off doing beds. I ended up just doing bathrooms and floors. There has been staffing issues recently with housekeeping and I’ve been on my own at times. I’ve sort of managed duvet covers, but it takes me 40 minutes and I have to use a weird ass method where I practically climb into the duvet cover and pull the cover in from the inside. I know, it’s fucked up. But I’d only had 4-5 rooms a day so I was getting away with it.

Today I had all 14 rooms to clean, alone, by 3pm. I knew I wouldn’t be able to get away with it this time and I was in a state of panic the whole day. I stripped the beds, cleaned everything else in the rooms, and then called the general manager to meet me in one of the rooms. I held my hands up and confessed I couldn’t do beds. They asked how I’d managed other housekeeping shifts if I couldn’t do beds, and I admitted either the lead housekeeper was doing beds for me, or when I was alone previously I had gotten lucky getting quiet days where I could get away with spending 40 minutes on a bed. The general manager said we’d do the beds for all rooms together and she’d train me. Despite having her stood next to me and repeatedly showing me, I still couldn’t get the damn duvet cover on. We then tried pillow cases. I can never do the ends neatly but I’ve always gotten away with it. But my general manager saw how I was doing it and wanted to train me on that too. Once again, I was watching what she did but when I tried to replicate my brain wouldn’t communicate with my hands and I’d freeze. She said she was speechless and didn’t know where to go from here, particularly as I’d already been moved to housekeeping from the restaurant.

I could feel myself dying from embarrassment. It was so demeaning. I have a house, a partner and I’m studying for a degree for fucks sake. But I felt completely fucking brain dead in this situation. It was horrid. I held my hands out, told her I admitted defeat, and walked out. The relief was amazing.

I’ll need another part-time weekend job until I finish uni, but I’ve decided it can’t be cleaning or hospitality. Maybe retail but only if it’s the sort of retail where I’m based at a desk, like the previous sales-based retail job I had. I can’t do jobs that require hand coordination, and I’m relieved to have finally acknowledged that. I still remain confident that I should be okay in my career after I finish university, but having to work these part-time jobs in the meantime in soul destroying. They are all based around physical coordination and little hand-coordination tasks (serving in a restaurant, bed-making in a hotel, shelf-organisation in retail etc). I hate it. It’s been the hardest part of being a student for me. I’ve sometimes considered quitting uni so I can get a Monday to Friday office job, a job I can actually do. But I know I’d be harming my prospects long-term.",2,1733094575.0,dyspraxia,2,0.75,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Some of my straight friends have been acting like old men lately when we’re the same fucken age🤣🤦‍♂️ so it’s been miserable hanging out with them.

I just need 8-9 hours of sleep and I feel the same from when I was in high school. I’m full of energy and I don’t need iced coffee (sometimes I still get one just for pleasure lol)

1h4g8o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1h4g8o0/the_cup/,The Cup.,"So I recently got the game (less than a week ago), and are already 50 hours in. **I FRICKING LOVE IT**. Anyway. I was able to buy the cup from the AWESOME shop and I fell in love with it, so much, so I wanted one for myself. As it turns out, it was being sold at [lizarddoggo](https://lizarddoggo.com/products/ficsit-coffee-cup), but looking at the pictures, something didn't seem right. In the game the cup is made from tin/metal, at least according to the sound, unless that's the cup hitting the helmet which is totally plausible. Even then, [lizarddoggo](https://lizarddoggo.com/products/ficsit-coffee-cup) is selling a ceramic version of the cup, and I understand why it would be smarter to do that instead of metal, BUTT I still wanted a metal version and I searched how much it would cost just for one cup (using 3D metal printing companies) and its above 200$ which is a little more than I would pay for a cup xD  
Is there a specific reason why Coffee Stain Studios went for ceramic instead of metal?

1h4g7db,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1h4g7db/just_a_reminder_that_anticipatory_anxiety_is_the/,Just A Reminder That Anticipatory Anxiety Is The Last Thing To Go,"In episode 247 of The Anxious Truth podcast, Sally Winston, psychologist, makes a really interesting distinction. You can separate anxious feelings into 3 parts:
1. The fear (the actual panic)
2. The fear of the fear (being scared of panicking, typically felt during exposure)
3. The fear of the fear of the fear (feeling nervous/ anxious about doing something several days before)

Sally also makes a very important point, that in your recovery journey, Anticipatory Anxiety will be the LAST thing to leave. For anyone who’s done exposure therapy work, youll notice your panic attacks will drop in frequency (1) , then slowly the physical symptoms while out will drop in frequency (2), even though you might still be nervous before hand (3). 

I felt like making this post because after a year and a half of diligent exposure therapy, working from random coffee shops all over the city, moving to Chicago, etc, I had to drive 4.5 hours home by myself this past weekend and was SO incredibly nervous about it the few weeks leading up to it. It was quite literally the only thing I could think about… but lo and behold, the drive was immensely easier than I thought it would ever be. There was no way I could have convinced myself of that without doing it, but then again, the anticipation is the last part to leave.

If you feel like you’re putting in work, but still dread certain exposures and feel like you’re stuck, just remember, that’s totally normal, you are improving, and allow yourself to notice that some things are just anticipatory anxiety. ",34,1733094052.0,Agoraphobia,10,0.97,False

Before my trip, I received a lot of comments/messages on Reddit warning me about safety concerns, the language barrier since I don’t speak Spanish, and the fact that I don’t drive. Well, I’m here to say: NO! I had a wonderful experience, and I want to encourage others to do the same.

Here’s a breakdown of my solo journey through Puerto Rico.

# San Juan (Days 1–5)

**Stay:**  
I stayed in **Condado**, a walkable area with easy access to buses and scooters for trips to **Old San Juan**. I only used scooters or buses. A note on scooters: if you take a scooter at night, you have to book it 4 times before. Otherwise, it doesn't let you.

**Day 1:**

I didn't sleep the day before, so I was so tired. Walked around the Condado area.

* **Lunch:** *Café Bebos* is recommended by many people. I tried mofongo, but it was dry. Not recommended.
* **Beach Bar:** *Número Uno Beach Hotel & Restaurant* – $30 minimum spend. Lovely spot but mainly for wealthy tourists. Especially rich Americans. Not my vibe. I wouldn't go again. And Pino Colado was too weak.
* **Crash Early:** Slept at 9:30 pm :)

**Day 2:**

* **Morning Coffee:** *Gustos Coffee, Miramar* –A cute spot with open windows, great coffee. I journaled there while watching people.
* **Exploring:**
   * Took a bus to **Old San Juan**. (10 minutes ride)
   * Walked to **Castillo San Cristóbal** ($10 covers both forts).
   * Walked through **La Perla** (don’t take pictures here) by the water. I had a romantic moment by myself. :)
   * Lunch at **La Garita** – Mostly locals. Beautiful view, great mofongo, mojito, and pino colado.
   * Walked to **Castillo San Felipe del Morro** (you can use the same ticket from the other port within the same day. It closes at 5 pm)
* **Dinner:**
   * Empanadas at ***The Red Monkey*** – Delicious! and grabbed a local beer.
   * Later, tacos at ***Acapulco Taquería Mexicana*** – Dry and overrated.
   * **Night out:** *Casa Laurel* – A charming, local spot run by an older couple who cook a small selection of dishes fresh each day. I spent the evening surrounded by elderly Puerto Ricans, watching them dance salsa with the karaoke :) It felt like stepping into a family gathering, and I loved every moment of it.
* **The End:**
   * I took an Uber to Calle Cerra, a popular nightlife spot with lots of bars and people hanging out outside. There were plenty of places to dance and grab a drink. I had a cocktail at one of the bars, but the crowd was mostly young. It’s a fun place, but not really my style.

**Day 3:**

* **Coffee & Breakfast:** *Café Comunión* – Great coffee and sandwiches.
   * *K*asalta - Try their guava pastries. Delicious!
* **Old San Juan:**
   * *Barrachina* for piña coladas (meh).
   * *Drunken Cookies* – Highly recommend! You get a small shot with each cookie.
* **Dinner:** *Cueva Del Mar* – Fried whole snapper. So good! Must-Try. and a glass of wine.
* **Night Out:** Checked out **La Placita** but preferred *La Penúltima* – *La Placita* was too crowded for dancing, but a local recommended *La Penúltima - a perfect cocktail bar*. Chill vibe, great drinks, and locals.

**Day 4:**

* **Morning:** Visited a Christmas market in Miramar – Fun and festive.
* **Museo de Arte Puerto Rico:** Loved it! Try to join a guided tour.

**Food/Drink Stops:**

* *La Sonrisa* food truck at *Lote 23* – A must for empanadas.
* a beer stop with locals- **Superduper** (must go) Grab your beer from the fridge. Super cheap
* *Scryer Rum BarrelHouse at Old* San Juan– The espresso martini was okay but pricey. Made a friend here!
* **Evening:** *El Cafetín* – Great music, dance, friendly crowd, and I made tons of friends.
* Salsa at *La Factoría* – Danced for hours. They have live music every Sunday and Monday starting at 10:30 PM. Made friends again.

**Day 5:**

* Run into friends from New York. We were together all day.
* Spent the day relaxing on the beach.
* **Dinner:** Delicious Cuban sandwich at *La Taberna Lúpulo* – 30+ beers on tap, perfect for beer lovers. Lovely bartenders.
* Salsa - Back to *La Factoría* for another night of dancing.
* **Missed My Ferry to Culebra:** I missed my 3:30 AM ferry due to poor planning (the terminal is far), and Uber was $85 . Instead, I booked a last-minute flight to Culebra for $65 on a small plane—best decision ever! Glad i missed the ferry!

**Culebra (Days 6–7)**

**Day 6:**

* **Golf Cart Rental:** I rented from Carlos Rentals for $85/day—the cheapest option available since most others were over $100. My bargaining skills didn’t work this time! I don’t know how to drive a car, but I figured it out and had so much fun. The locals were super helpful, especially with parking in tight spots. 😊
* **Beaches:**
   * **Flamenco Beach** – Umbrella was $15 for the whole day.
   * **Zacos Tacos** – Pricey but fresh and delicious fish tacos and Pino colado.
   * **Evening:** Practiced driving around the island and rested early. :)

**Day 7:**

* **Snorkeling: (smoke weed if you can)**
   * **Tamarindo Beach** – Bring your own snorkel. Started talking with the tour guys in the water and we became friends. They showed me around and all the other beautiful beaches. We snorkeled for about 2 hours.
   * **Melones Beach:** Went there after for another snorkeling experience
   * **Playa Punta Soldado** – Watch the sunset and go into the water. It was like a dream. Sandy flies will kill you if you don't go into the water (Learned from the experience)
* **Dinner:** *Dinghy Dock* – Went there with the locals. A beautiful spot by the water, followed by a visit to a small art gallery next door. Must visit both. And say hi to the gallery owner. He is super knowledgeable and friendly.
* **Stargazing:** Water tower – Bring bug spray for this magical experience. We were there for around 3 hours watching the stars. Smoke weed if you can :)

# Last Morning:

* **Sunrise:** Woke up at 5 to watch the sunset at *Zoni Beach* – followed by breakfast. Don't remember where.
* Smoking and snorkeling for 2 hours in Tamarindo Beach. DREAM!

# Final Thoughts

Take the time to connect with the locals—whether it’s bartenders, baristas, or anyone you meet along the way. Both San Juan and Culebra are incredibly safe, and the people are welcoming and helpful. If you don’t want to be alone, you won’t be. And if you're a bit shy but want to make friends, a couple of drinks might help break the ice. :)

I truly hope this is helpful to other solo female travelers. Don’t let fear hold you back from your adventure! 🌴",16,1733094029.0,PuertoRicoTravel,13,0.94,False
