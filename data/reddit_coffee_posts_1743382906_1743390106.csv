1jntmso,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jntmso/ive_been_talking_to_someone_in_the_night_at_first/,"I've been talking to someone in the night. At first it was weird, but now I'm genuinely horrified.","Everything started 2 months ago. 

In January, I moved to a new house in Port Arthur. I had recently divorced from my husband after a 6 year marriage, and I wanted to live somewhere I could be free. I also brought with me my golden retriever, Milo. At that time he was almost 2 years old. 

When I first saw the house, I was instantly amazed, it was beautiful. The garden was big, filled with green grass (especially Milo was happy) and I immediately contacted the landlord and told him it was sold. 

The 1st night in my new house was perfect. When I lay on my bed, it felt like euphoria was bubbling inside my body, I felt so cozy, safe, and free in my covers, all at the same time. 

Those were the only nights I felt safe though. 

  
On the 4th night, I woke up to some strange growling sounds. It sounded like a baby kitten that was being beaten to death combined with some gurgling and thuds. I woke up and checked the clock, it was 3:55. Milo was next to me in bed and he was shivering and whimpering, which was strange because he had never acted like this before. There was no reason he should've acted this way. 

Oh boy, I was so wrong. 

Because that was when I started actually hearing the growling sounds. It felt like it was coming from the room next to me, yet I couldn't build up the courage to stand up and walk over there. I decided that the growling sounds could be the neighbor's, and calmed myself down to sleep again. At almost 5, the growling sounds finally stopped.  

This continued for almost a month, when one night, something scary happened. 

I woke up to thudding sounds, and this time there was no growling. I looked beside me for Milo, but he wasn't there. In fact, the spot next to me was completely empty but warm, which meant that Milo was here but had just left. 

""Milo!"" I yelled repeatedly. I finally got out of bed and stood up. I slowly walked down the corridor and it was completely pitch black. On my 4th step, I saw a pair of yellow eyes in the dark. It felt like it was the only source of light and it illuminated the dark room. I was so scared that I couldn't even scream. I had no idea what I was supposed to do at the moment. 

""Milo...is that you?"" I reached out slowly and hoped that I would touch that furry, cute little dog that he was. 

Then, another pair of yellow eyes appeared in the dark. This time, I actually screamed. I ran to my room, gasping for air and lo and behold, Milo was sitting at the door of my room, but his hair was all soaking wet, and he was again shivering vigorously. 

I slammed the door behind me, my worries of the yellow eyes started to fade. All I worried about right now was Milo and what happened to him.

""Milo!"" I exclaimed, scared. I found out his whole body was covered in blood. It was like someone had grabbed him and dunked him in a pot of blood, let him stand in the cold rain while some of it washed off, then told him to come back to me. Milo was still whining and whimpering (possibly from the cold), so I decided to wash him up. 

When I was washing him, I could feel someone, no, something's presence looming over me. When I was bathing him, I felt someone watching. When I was combing his fur, I felt someone watching. When I dried him, I felt someone watching. 

Finally when I was done with Milo, it was dawn. I hadn't gotten a good night's sleep, so I went straight to bed again. 

When I woke up, it was in the middle of the night again. Somehow, I had slept from dawn to the next night. Was this possible? I wasn't a very deep sleeper. 

And then it hit me. 

What if, I hadn't slept for so long, in fact Milo's incident was just a dream? I had always had crazy dreams, but this dream felt too realistic to believe. I looked to the spot beside me on my bed, and there Milo was, all cozied up and sleeping.

I couldn't understand anything that was happening to me. I felt scared and unsafe. At this point, I just fell asleep again.

This time, I woke up during the afternoon. I went out of bed to make a coffee for myself, and Milo came along with me. Everything seemed great, only the nightime was when weird things happens. I was scrolling on Instagram when I found this app that allows you to track your sleep and record anything that you say or do in the middle of the night.

That night, I set the app up after having dinner. I ate a fulfilling meal of Mcdonalds and went straight to bed after. I placed my phone in the bedside table and went to sleep.

That night, I slept soundly, my first time in a month. When I woke up, it was morning and I was feeling as happy as a goose. 

I checked my sleep tracker. I had slept for 8 hours straight, and it said,"" WELL DONE"" on the app. I played the recordings that was recorded during the night. What it recorded shocked me. 

In the middle of the night, I could hear sounds of muffled rustling, like someone was looking through my drawers. That was shocking, but not the scariest part. The scariest part was, I heard my own voice asking,"" What are you doing?"" and a deep male voice that said,"" Nothing.""

After that short conversation, the rustling disappeared, and everything was silent. 

How was this possible? I lived in the house by myself, and I was sure of it. I could recognize my own voice although I do not recall saying anything in the middle of the night. And, who was that deep male voice? Could my ex have sneaked in? He did not know any details related to my address, so I was unsure of that. 

The following night, weird conversations was recorded again. I heard rustling again (from the recordings), then my voice saying,"" Go away please."" and a deep male voice again, saying,"" Why?"" After that, it was silent again.

Today, I have moved away from the house because of my frightening encounters with these weird experiences. I no longer have sleeping problems, and I don't see or hear voices in the dark anymore. 

Although I am probably safe now, I still am very curious. 

Who or what was haunting me in the other house? Why? I will never forget my experience in the other house, and one day, I will find you, the person who haunted me.",1,1743389941.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jntmqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wish_apon_a_scam/comments/1jntmqt/whose_fault/,Whose fault?👂,"Dear 💩, your kids were not removed because of a warrant, hotel, TF, CC, KS, because your tiktok famous or too many calls to cps. Your kids were removed because of abuse and neglect from you and your boyfriend. Stop lying. 
You and only you decided to go live and post videos of your life. These lives and videos revealed so much horrendous things. It was so bad 6500+ people were in a reddit sub and collectively decided that your kids needed saving from what was happening to them. This is not the first time and you know this. Your oldest was permanently removed and placed with his dad 7 years ago. Three were removed and you got them back eventually. Now, this time all 5 are gone. There's no way you can post the stuff you did and think 6500 people would think it's ok. Let's delve into some lives and videos. *Food and meals.* Let's start there. We saw your kids beg for food and be denied. We saw them sneak food. We saw them falling asleep at the table at 11 pm waiting for their portioned out slop. We heard you say many times how they only eat 2x's a day. Breakfast ( usually around 1 pm) was the night before left overs. Then MAYBE a snack. Then dinner at 11 pm again. All your kids were underweight and had dark circles and a sallow look. You got loaded teas, ice coffee, biscuit sandwiches, you hid tons of snacks in your room. YOU never went without. You took good care of you. We heard your boyfriend threaten your son with bodily harm because he was hiding food in his room. You would fuss and cry for hours about how you had no food for the kids. You wouldn't stop the dry begging until one or more followers felt so bad they would have domino's deliver lots of pizzas. You sent them to the old man neighbor to ask him for food.  Your kids were constantly HUNGRY.
*Your kids health.* your kids were years behind for wellness checks and childhood vaccinations. All the kids were malnourished and underweight. All the kids had rotted teeth and/or severe dental problems. We saw your daughter crying on camera for 3 days straight about dental pain. It was pitiful. People called cps. Cps made you get her to a dentist. Your baby was left unattended and had an accident where his top teeth jammed way up into his gums. He wasn't seen in your lives for days. You hid him. He got so bad he stopped eating, drinking and became limp and listless. Only then did you take him for emergency care and surgery. Your kids were always full of bruises all over their bodies. The baby needed to ER visits for severe diaper rash. He was never changed. Soggy droopy diaper was the norm.your kids were medically neglected. *hygiene* your kids were filthy. Their clothes were ripped, stained, dirty, didn't fit. Same clothes worn for days. And slept in. Your boy went to church filthy, covered in feces and stinking like poop. The church officials called CPS. Both you and kevin said he was the only one that bathed/showered the kids. You couldn't be bothered. *your house* the house was filthy and disgusting. The furniture was chewed up by the dog and was so stained it looked shiny. You showed us holes Kevin punched/kicked in the walls and doors. Trash piled up in the rooms. Sheets for curtains. Food all over the floors, beds, furniture. Spa tub destroyed, door frames knocked out. No sheets on the beds. The 5 y.o. slept on a filthy crib mattress that you let the dog delivery her puppy on it.  You cleaned only when CPS had a scheduled visit. The yard was trashed too. You showed the baby sitting in dirt surrounded by cat and dog poop. All the smoke detectors were taken down. Vents stuffed with trash. Filthy mop bucket left for weeks. *animals* after you were evicted a dead cat was found in a box outside. Probably the "" missing"" cat Kevin hated. The dog and her pup were so skinny you could see nothing but rib bones. Left outside with no water during a heat wave. Left outside 24/7 in the winter. Full of fleas and tics. Kittens your son shoved down a heating vent. Same son seen kicking and punching a cat in the head. Kevin hitting a new born pup with a hair brush. *safety* the baby crawling around an loaded rifle type bb gun. The baby sitting on counter next to huge boiling pot of soup. Baby on counter with big sharp carving knife. 4 y.o. getting your loaded pistol out of truck console and waving it around in the truck with siblings there. You left them all unattended while you did an errand. Your loaded gun left in your bedside table. Same loaded gun left on bookshelf. Cps finally caught wind of this and made you put a lock on it. You were cited multiple times for kids not being secured properly in the truck. You outside smoking a blunt trying to shoot a target. Making targets with family members faces for the kids to shoot at. Having young son use garden tiller barefoot. * wierd, inappropriate stuff* the lollipop/hard on video. The video of Kevin blow drying the naked baby after his bath. Kevin saying he is the only one who bathes/showers ALL your kids alone because that's his "" bonding time"". Telling your daughter she will be r a p e d and made to call a stranger daddy for 8 years if cps takes them. Your son staring at your daughter while he openly rubs himself as you laugh at it. Showing your son your bloody mess and pads while your live on the toilet. He was traumatized and regressed back into diapers. Taking multiple pregnancy tests during your lives. Having your children record you while you tweak, grind, any vile. Kevin constantly seen nodding out. Drug paraphernalia seen in a lot of videos. Drug pipe, still warm found by your son. You admitting Kevin physically abused you in front of the kids. You admitting Kevin uses corporal punishment to discipline. The way Kevin hugs, kisses, caresses the baby. How you tried to convince Kevin he was the baby's bio dad. *Education* your took your kids out of school because you couldn't get up in the morning and get them ready. They missed so much. The school called cps. Then when you threw something at your daughters face and she went to school with marks, they called again. So you pulled them out. By the time they were removed they were 2-3 years behind other kids. One had a big speech impediment. They couldn't read, write or do basic math. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is TONS more to unravel.
We didn't even get into all the frauds, scams, dry begging, go fund me's, theft by deception. 
So, tell us again how your kids being removed is because you had a warrant. And none of it is your fault. Cmon girl...tell us.
P.S. 6500+ are still here. Making sure those kids stay safe.",1,1743389936.0,wish_apon_a_scam,0,1.0,False

1jntk0n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jntk0n,Any small scale composters who sell?,"I lost my job in the chemical plant as an operator of 10 years back in August of 2024. Been applying like crazy, have had several interviews, doesn’t seem to be working out. I cannot stay out of work too much longer or I’m going to run into some problems, obviously. So my current dream is to start a local composting business. There is none in my area for at least 75 miles out. The potential is definitely there and I know the market demand is also because all of the local nurseries buy compost from out of state to sell in the stores. I already collect from local smoothie shops and coffee shops, but that’s barely putting a dent in it. I also have connections with the local tree companies to dump wood chips on my property. I have a couple acres to work with. I already have 5 pallet bins going since October and that’s with me cutting back on picking up from these different shops. But what I don’t understand is how all the YouTube channels I see say that they turn waste into a highly profitable business when a whole yard sells for $30-$50 and a 40lb sack sells for $5-$10. It takes much more than a yard of raw materials to make a yard of compost. Any tips or suggestions? Guidelines I should follow? I have a lot of ideas but I’m honestly afraid to commit. I want to work for myself more than anything at this point in my life.",5,1743389663.0,composting,0,0.86,False

\- measuring and cutting that tacky drawer lining stuff for six drawers (AND cleaned the drawers)  
\- cleaned pretty much the entire kitchen

1jntgo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1jntgo0/the_butcher_on_barker_street_pt_12/,The Butcher on Barker Street [Pt. 1/2],"The call came in a little after three in the morning. When I reached over to the nightstand, I accidentally knocked over my alarm clock. It crashed to the ground, shattering into jagged shards of plastic and glass. Not a good way to start the day.

I answered the phone. “Look, whoever this is, you owe me a new alarm clock.”

“Get over here.” I recognized Troy’s voice immediately. “We have a problem.”

“A please would be appreciated.”

“Stow the snark, James,” he said. “This is serious.”

I looked around my empty bedroom. There were piles of clothes strewn about the floor, along with old gin bottles and spent cigarette butts. Last night was a haze of loud music and endless drinking. I couldn’t be sure, but my breath said I’d ordered a pizza too.

Looking down at the bits of plastic and glass, I said, “Fine, but while I got ya on the line, let me tell you a little about this new alarm clock you’re gonna buy me.”

While I got dressed, I went on and on about the clock. I wanted one that could connect to the internet, play music, and use Bluetooth. Troy was quiet as I rambled, and when I was finished, he said: “I’m at a brownstone on thirty-second. Apartment twenty-five. Move your ass, we’re burning daylight.”

Outside the bedroom window, the sky was dark and amassed with clouds. There wasn’t daylight yet to burn.

The call disconnected, and I pocketed my cell phone. I swiped my jacket from the floor. There was a slight bulge in the breast pocket. My cigarettes were still there. Then, I grabbed my keys, wallet, and handgun from the dresser. On the way out, I stopped in the bathroom to brush my teeth, but even after relentlessly scrubbing with cheap cinnamon-flavored toothpaste, my breath still smelled like greasy pizza and gin.

Some things never come out no matter what you do.

Driving to the south side of town, I found the brownstone Troy had told me about and stepped inside. The inner walls were white and barren save a few odd holes and yellow cigarette stains. The carpet was fuzzy and mottled by discolored blotches. I’m not one to judge, my place wasn’t much better. The rent was a little more expensive because I lived on the east side, but otherwise, they were pretty much the same.

In the city, in life, you’ve got to do whatever it takes to get by. Even if it means living in rat-infested apartments where neighbors blared screamo music and there was asbestos in the walls.

Climbing two flights of stairs, I knocked twice on the door to apartment twenty-five. Footsteps thundered from inside, followed by the rattle of a chain-lock being disarmed. The door opened, and Troy peered out at me through a crack in the door.

“This better be good,” I said, rubbing the exhaustion from my eyes. “I was having a great dream—”

“Yeah, yeah. You can tell me about it later,” he said, throwing the door open and pulling me inside. He slammed the door shut behind us, locking it again. “Word of warning, situation’s a little tricky.”

In our line of work, when wasn’t it “tricky”?

Troy had your typical bouncer look. Broad-shouldered, short blond hair, lantern jaw, built like a linebacker. He wore dark denim pants and a grimy leather jacket with more years on it than most cars.

He was the kind of guy Mr. Rousseau liked to keep for the first half of the day because he was well-read and personable. Intimidating at first glance, but in private company, he was quiet and reserved. These were the hours Mr. Rousseau handled the legitimate side of the business.

Plus, mornings and early afternoons were the only hours that worked for Troy’s schedule since he had a wife and two kids.

“Wait a minute.” Troy leaned in close and sniffed. “Are you drunk?”

“Not entirely.”

“What the fuck, James! It’s a Thursday.”

“Yeah, and Mr. Rousseau usually has me on at night. So, why the hell am I being called in at three in the morning?”

He gestured for me to follow as he started down the narrow hallway. I didn’t recognize the apartment. Mr. Rousseau lived on the north side of town, and Troy had a house on the west side. The south side of the city was reserved for addicts, deadbeats, and broke college kids. There weren’t many in Rousseau’s personal circle that fit the bill.

We turned at the corner and followed the rest of the hallway to a closed door. Troy hesitated with his hand on the knob, looking over his shoulder at me. There were shadows in his eyes. Despair. He sighed and turned the knob, pushing the door open. Instantly, before I even entered the bedroom, I could taste the metal and copper in the air. Smell the early stages of decay.

If something like that doesn’t wake you up, nothing will.

The bedroom was a dingy space with splintered floorboards and a sagged ceiling. Next bad rainstorm would probably knock out a few tiles. The furniture was ancient and dilapidated. In the far corner, an old boxy TV displayed a screen of black-and-white fuzz, hissing quietly in the background as we examined the scene.

“What the fuck happened?” I asked.

Any semblance of drunkenness had abandoned me, replaced by a stone-cold sobriety that made me want to scream or punch something.

“There was an incident,” Troy said haphazardly. Always the professional. “It’s a bit complicated.”

That was one way of putting it.

On the queen-sized bed was a partially naked girl lying limp on the mattress. Sheets and blankets swirled around her, splattered in blood. Her limbs were splayed at odd angles, lifeless. The back of her head was caved open with a jagged rim of exposed skull peering out through her long black hair. I kneeled to inspect the wound, thinking Troy had maybe brought me in for amateur medical attention. I’d spent the first eighteen years of my life working on a farm, caring and tending to animals. Whenever I wasn’t slaughtering them.

Adjusting the head of a nearby lamp on the nightstand, a bright yellow light shined against the top of the girl’s head. Her injury was untreatable in given circumstances. Blunt-force trauma with noticeable swelling and severe hemorrhaging. The skin was ruddy red with a slight undertone of blue. There were tiny bits of bone, hair, and flesh amongst the exposed grey matter of her brain.

I almost suggested a hospital in the area, but reality dawned on me. I would’ve been better off suggesting a morgue.

Then, as I was examining the wound, the girl’s brain began to shift beneath the undulating pool of blood. For a moment, I thought she might open her eyes and sit up in bed. This expectation died in its cradle as I watched a fly crawl out from the mixture of blood and membrane. Its wings fluttered a few times, and once they were clean, it took off into the air.

I quickly turned away, gagging against last night’s dinner. Shouldn’t have had so much pizza or gin, but I’m a creature of habit.

“Seriously,” I stammered, leaning against the wall, staring down at my shoes, desperately trying not to think about the dead girl, “what the fuck happened?”

“I already told you: there was an incident.”

“Yeah, no shit there was an incident.”

“It was an accident, James.”

You don’t get an injury like that from an accident unless it involves a head-on collision or a flight of stairs.

“Oh, an accident? That makes it so much better.” I glimpsed at the girl again, my heart swelling with a mixture of disgust and pity. “Is she dead?”

I don’t know why I asked. She had the pale complexion of a corpse. The putrid stink of a corpse. Probably had the sour taste of one too.

Troy shrugged. “My gut tells me she’s most likely dead.”

“Most likely?”

“No, yeah, she’s dead.” He considered this for a moment before nodding. “Definitely dead. Mr. Rousseau clubbed her over the head with an ashtray.”

I exhaled carefully. “That oughta do it.” I reached inside my jacket pocket and removed a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, lighting one the instant it met my lips. “Why’d he do it?”

“Lost his cool for a second.”

“Really? Only for a second.”

Troy threw his hands up defensively. “Look, I was just chillin’ in the living room, reading a book, when I heard her scream. By the time I got in here, well, it was finished.”

 “Did he say anything?”

“He wants us to clean it up.”

“No shit, Sherlock. I mean, did he say anything about why he did it?”

Troy scoffed. “He actually wrote a ten-page essay about it if you’re interested in reading it.”

I considered punching him, but the only reason Troy and I had lasted as partners was because we knew not to take it out on each other. We had an unspoken policy: ‘Just do the job and get out. No questions asked.’ In situations like that, though, it was hard to refrain from asking any questions.

“Well,” I said, slowly regaining my equilibrium with the help of nicotine calming my nerves, “where the hell is Rousseau?”

“Don’t worry about it. I called some guys to take him back to his penthouse. But we’ve gotta fix this fast. The girl has a roommate. She’s outta town right now, but she’ll be back around noon.”

“We’re so fucked.”

“Not if we move fast,” Troy promised. “I’ve already got it figured out. I’ll stay here and clean up the mess. I just need you to take care of the body.”

“Fuck you. I’m not driving a dead body through the city at three in the morning. I’ll stay and clean up the scene. You can deliver the girl.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t have a license.”

“Hasn’t stopped you before.”

“My tags are expired too.”

That’s when it hit me. “Oh, fucking forget about it! We’re not putting a dead girl in the trunk of my car.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s my personal vehicle, dumbass.”

“It’s a minivan, not a Maserati.”

“It’s still my car. I’m not letting you fuck it up.”

“It’s what soccer moms use to drive their kids to school. A little blood isn’t going to ruin it.”

I started pacing back and forth across the room. Floorboards creaked beneath my feet. The nicotine was making me sick, and my sleep deprivation wasn’t helping either.

Troy groaned, exasperated. “Will you please just be cool about this? We don’t have time to bicker like an old married couple. We need to get this fixed. Now!”

“Son of a bitch!” I kicked the wall. Dried paint chips fell to the floor. “Okay, alright, fine! What’s the play?”

“I’ve got some plastic wrap and a few blankets. We’ll bundle her up, carry her downstairs, and load her into the trunk. Then, you’ll take her to one of the usual spots.”

By ‘usual spots’ he meant one of the local businesses we used to dispose of bodies. There were a few throughout the city, but my go-to was Mason and Sons, a funeral home on the north side of town. Mason was a pleasant man, despite his affiliation with someone like Mr. Rousseau. And his means of disposal was perhaps the most humane I could think of. Better than the scrapyard or the butcher shop.

We exited the apartment, went downstairs, and stepped out into the parking lot. Troy’s car was near the back corner, far away from the rest. He opened the truck and removed the top panel. Beneath, where there should’ve been a spare tire, was instead a cache of random supplies for situations like this. Handcuffs, duct tape, zip ties, trash bags, bleach, soap, ammonia, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and whatever else.

I almost made a joke about how maybe he should be driving the minivan, but I couldn’t get the thoughts from my mind to my tongue without wanting to puke. So, I just silently smoked my cigarette instead.

Back in the apartment, we gathered everything covered in blood into one of the trash bags. We also threw in some of the girl’s personal belongings like her wallet, keys, and cell phone. Troy took whatever excess cash from her purse, asking me if I wanted to split it.

“You fuckin’ scumbag,” I muttered.

“Oh, forgive me, Prince Charming,” he said. “Some of us got bills to pay.”

“More like alimony.”

Troy cuffed me on the shoulder for that one. In this line of work, it was hard to have a family. Especially on nights when you had to gaze into the emaciated face of a young dead girl, trying not to think of your daughter or wife.

You have to lie to yourself. Detach yourself from the situation. Pretend that you can still be the good guy, but ultimately, guilt always resurfaces. Usually late at night, while you’re in bed, listening to the silence of the world around you, staring up at the shadows on the ceiling like ink blots on a Rorschach test.

I see a happy little dog, you might say. I see a pretty pink pony. I see the shattered skull of a young woman. I see the maggots wriggling around inside her brain. I see myself protecting the man who killed her because I’m just a dog on a leash.

Guys like us develop hobbies to distract ourselves from the silence, from the memories. Troy was a frequent reader of everything and anything. I’d seen him consume more books than a librarian. Once, I even caught him reading the dictionary because he didn’t have any other novels on hand.

For me, I liked to drink and smoke. It helped me sleep. Helped me clear my mind. When I wasn’t drinking, I was working.

My occupation was a complicated matter. If that weren’t already apparent. I usually followed Mr. Rousseau around like a good lil’ pup, going all across the city to visit underground clubs, bars, and other late-night establishments with morally questionable exchanges.

If I wasn’t acting as Mr. Rousseau’s bodyguard or personal assistant, I was off collecting debts and payments. That, or I was delivering packages. Most of the time, I had no clue what these packages contained, but I had my assumptions: narcotics, money, evidence, and so on.

Once, I had to deliver a sphere-shaped package wrapped in duct tape and plastic. I kept telling myself it was a basketball or soccer ball, but my gut told me otherwise. That was the first time I’d met the Butcher. When I handed him the package, he licked his lips and said: “This will do just fine.”

I avoided the butcher when at all possible.

By the time Troy and I finished collecting personal belongings, we had two bags full. I delivered those to the trunk of my car, and when I returned, Troy already had the girl enveloped in cellophane. We were somewhat skilled in the trade of making a person disappear.

We wrapped the girl in a few blankets and quilts. One of them was pink and had the word “Barbie” scrawled across it in swooping letters.

“So,” I said, “your daughter fell out of her doll phase then?”

“That’s what happens when you get them a cell phone.”

The last time we did this, we used blankets designed with monster trucks and Spongebob. His son had just turned eleven and got an Xbox with games like Call of Duty and Halo.

Once the blankets were in place, we secured them with duct tape. Then, after checking the apartment hallways, we carried the body to the parking lot. The sun was just starting to peer over the horizon, but morning traffic still hadn’t hit yet.

With the body inside, Troy shut the trunk and sighed. “You gonna take her to the Butcher?”

“No,” I said, a little too quickly to be impartial on the matter. “Mason’s place.”

“Butcher is closer.”

“She’s going to Mason. End of story.”

He shrugged and checked his watch. “Better get moving before he gets busy then.”

“No, shit,” I said, climbing into the car and starting the engine. “Have fun, Mr. Clean.”

Grumbling, he waved me away and headed back towards the building.

“I’m serious about that alarm clock,” I called out after him. “It better be expensive and brand-new.”

Troy flipped me off over his shoulder and disappeared inside. I shifted into drive and started across the city, careful to obey the speed limit and stop at all traffic lights. The last thing I needed was to catch any unwanted attention.

While I was driving, my hands began to shake. The road oscillated in front of me, fusing with the night sky. Stars blurred and coalesced into a single bright light of fluorescent white. I rubbed my eyes and searched the glove box, returning with a hand-sized bottle of gin. It steadied my nerves, placating the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

A man without his medicine goes a little mad from time to time.

At Mason and Sons Funeral Home, I parked in the back. I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. So, I climbed the back steps to the rear entrance and knocked. It took a few minutes, but eventually, his wife appeared. Her smile vanished, and she looked at me with discernible disgust.

“It’s four-thirty in the morning,” she growled.

“Nice to see you too, Shelia,” I replied, affecting a delicate tone. She, like many others, preferred Troy over me, but she could’ve probably gone the rest of her life without ever speaking to either one of us again. “Mason here?”

She stepped aside, waving me inside. “He’s in the back office. Be quick about it. We’ve got a family coming in at five.”

“You could try to be a little nicer. Mr. Rousseau pays to keep the fuckin’ lights on in this place, y’know.”

Her scowl deepened, forming lines across her forehead, accentuating the hollow crevices around her sunken eyes. She reeled back and slapped me across the face. “Make it snappy, you rat fuck, and get the hell outta here.”

“Fair enough.”

I rubbed the sting from my cheek and moved down the hallway. That’s where I bumped into two of Mason’s sons. I didn’t remember their names, and they probably didn’t remember mine either. But we were familiar with each other.

A while back, Mr. Rousseau made me retrieve the older one from a crack den on the south side while the kid was on a bender. I had to fend off two different dealers and a Chihuahua that wouldn’t stop nipping at my heels.

Because of the younger son, I had to visit a few families on the north side with a large cash settlement to keep them silent about something involving their teenage daughters. I don’t know all the details, but the little bastard wasn’t allowed to interact with any of the grieving customers who came in. Probably for the best, all things considered.

The sons nodded at me and left. I continued down the hall into the back office. Inside, Mason sat behind his desk with a cup of coffee in one hand and a manilla file in the other. He flipped through pages, squinting through a pair of tiny spectacles that were comically small. I had to wonder if he could even see through them.

Despite his kids, Mason was a decent person. As far as humans are concerned. He reminded me of my grandfather. An old oak tree slowly wilting while the rest of the forest was chopped down to make room for new shops and apartments. Just a man trying to stay afloat, willing to do whatever it took to keep his family safe and secure.

Mason glanced up at me and smiled. “James, I wasn’t expecting you.”

“Sorry, Mason,” I said. “I tried to call, but there was no answer.”

“Phone’s in the other room.” He set his coffee down and closed the folder. Leaning forward on his desk, he clasped his hands together and asked, “What can I do for you, my boy?”

He was from a different generation where people said things like “my boy” or “simmer down” or on occasion, such as when I brought his son home from the drug den, “damn shame” while shaking his head.

I sat in the chair across from him and explained the situation, what little I knew. When I was finished, Mason took off his spectacles, pinched the bridge of his nose, and exhaled. He tried to smooth back the wispy grey hair on his head, but there were so few left that they refused to obey.

“The situation’s a bit muddled,” I told him, affecting Troy’s professionalism. “We’re tryin’ to get it cleaned up as soon as possible. So, if you have anything, I would appreciate it. And I’m sure Mr. Rousseau would appreciate it too.”

Whenever dealing with these people, you have to throw out Mr. Rousseau’s name as much as possible. It’s the only way to get them to treat you seriously. The only way to keep their attention. Otherwise, you’re just a rat fuck. A dog without an owner.

“Let me see,” Mason said, flipping through a large black ledger. With every page, he licked his pruney fingers and hummed. “Hmm. Damn shame…damn shame. Young girl, was it?”

“Yes, sir. Not as young as you might think, but younger than either of us. Late teens, early twenties maybe. I’m guessing a college student. Maybe a part-time escort.”

Rousseau met most of his paramours late at night while wandering the city’s underbelly. Dancers at the clubs and waitresses at the bars. A repetitive routine that usually worked in his favour.

“And how’d it happen?” Mason asked.

I hesitated. My tongue wouldn't form the words. “Uh, probably for the best that you don’t know, sir.”

He chuckled. It was easy to approach these situations with a bit of humor when you weren’t looking at the corpse. Even someone like Mason, who’d been embalming and burying bodies since before I could drive, would probably feel faint at the sight of that girl. He’d clutch his metaphorical pearls and blink back tears. Maybe spend the afternoon in his office, drinking from the bottle of bourbon he kept in the bottom drawer.

“How soon would you need a hole?” Mason asked without looking up from his agenda.

“Today, if possible.”

The way Mason and Sons worked was we would deliver a body a few hours before a funeral. They would dig the grave about four or five feet deeper than usual, and we would drop the dead body inside. Then, we’d cover them up with a few inches of dirt, just enough to conceal the corpse. Once the funeral was done, they would transport the coffin and drop it down on top of the other corpse before sealing up the grave.

When the body was taken care of, they burned all evidence and possessions in their industrial furnace. At least, that’s what they told me, but the last time I visited, his younger son was sporting a new wristwatch that seemed vaguely familiar.

“I’m sorry to tell ya,” Mason said, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest, “but we just don’t have any open graves right now. If you can hold onto the body for a few more days, we might have availability this weekend.”

“We’ve got nowhere to store it until then.”

He cocked an eyebrow. “Where is she now?”

“My trunk.”

Mason blanched and reached for his coffee, his hand trembling as he lifted the mug to his lips. “Sweet Baby Jesus! You’ve got her with you as we speak? That’s what you’re tellin’ me?”

“Yes, sir. Unfortunately. Like I said, it’s a bit of a SNAFU.”

“No kiddin’, my boy.” He rubbed the few strands of hair on his chin. “I’m sorry. I wish I could help, but my hands are tied.”

I feigned nonchalance, but in reality, my heart was pounding against my chest. Sweat beaded on the back of my neck. I kept thinking about that dead girl, the hole in her skull, the stew of bone shards and hair inside her head. I needed to get rid of her, to get her out of my trunk so I could go back home, drink myself stupid, and fall asleep. Forget the day, let another replace it.

“You alright?” Mason asked me. “Can I get you a coffee or a cup of tea?”

“No, but thank you, sir.” I had gin waiting for me back in the car. “I should probably get going.”

“You know, I’m surprised to see you again. Thought you would’ve taken your leave by now. That was the plan, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, sir, but things changed. Thought I’d have my debts paid by now, but the bills never stop coming.”

He laughed. “You can say that again.”

Last winter, my father took a spill down the stairs and hit his head. While my mother was doing her best to sell the farm, there were no buyers. It was taking every last penny to keep her afloat while she waited for the life insurance policy to kick in. Bureaucrats always found a way to slow down the process.

I stood from my chair, shook Mason’s hand, and left. His wife followed me out the door, giving me one last glare before slamming the door shut.

When I got back in the car, I was overcome by the putrid stink of decay. I could practically taste the withering flesh, taste the metallic tinge of her blood in my mouth despite the layers of plastic and blankets. There must’ve been a hole or something. A part that wasn’t covered.

I rolled down the window and turned on the AC. Then, I retrieved my phone from my pocket and dialed Troy’s number.

Three rings before he answered. “Everything taken care of?”

“Not quite.”

“Great, what now?”

“Mason doesn’t have any open graves at the moment.”

“Guess you’ll have to go to the Butcher,” Troy said.

My blood turned cold, and I squeezed the steering wheel, digging my nails into the pleather. “No way! I’m not going to the Butcher.”

“Quit being such a baby and just do it.”

“The guy is a fuckin’ freakshow! I’m not going there alone.”

“Well, I’m a little preoccupied at the moment.” Troy took a deep breath and sighed. “You could try Davis’s Scrapyard. I don’t have his number, so you’ll have to drive over. He should be in by now.”

I wanted to smash my phone against the dashboard. Mr. Rousseau paid well, but in some situations, it wasn’t enough. Rock and a hard place, I guess.

“Whatever,” I said, exasperated. “Just hurry up with the apartment.”

“It’d go a lot faster if you didn’t call.”

I hung up and tossed the phone into the passenger seat. My foot pressed against the accelerator, turning the faint glow of street lights into a hazy smear of orange and yellow. Rain pattered across the windshield, and the rubber wipers squeaked against the glass. My hands fidgeted about the wheel, trembling whenever they didn’t have something stable to grasp onto. I reached into my pocket for another cigarette.

By the time I arrived at the scrapyard, I was stifling a gag between clenched teeth. The car reeked of burning tobacco and death. You could soak the inside with bleach, but the smell still wouldn’t go away.

Parking at the front gate, I found Davis in the main trailer, drinking a beer and throwing files into a trash can. He glanced over his shoulder at me, brow already furrowed, eyes bloodshot with fatigue.

“Nah,” he said. No hesitation, no fear. “Sorry, James, but I can’t.”

“You don’t even know why I’m here.”


“Don’t need to, buddy. If you’re here, it’s prob’ly something bad.” He emptied an entire drawer of files into the trash can before tossing it aside. “Trust me, this is the last place you wanna be.”

“And why’s that?”

“Last week, cops busted one of my garages. They’ve been watching my every move ever since. Whatever you’re here for, I doubt you want to get me involved.”

Davis operated several chop shops across the city. On the surface, they were any other garage, but in the back, they were stripping stolen cars for spare parts. Not exactly the worst of Mr. Rousseau’s colleagues, but his operation was big and turned quite a profit. An influential man to have in your pocket.

His scrapyard was convenient when it came to dead bodies. They had the kind of machinery that could crush a vehicle into a tiny cube. Imagine what it did to a corpse. Plus, there was plenty of land to bury bodies, and plenty of rubbish to hide the stink of rotting humans.

“It’s just one girl,” I said. “Slip of a thing. Wouldn’t be hard for you to dispose of. Wouldn’t take any time.”

He scoffed. “Maybe I’m not speaking clearly, but the cops are investigating me. They’re looking into every single thing I do. Dead girl is just what they need to get a warrant. Shit, screw the warrant, that would be enough for probable cause. We’d both be in cuffs, buddy. Is that what you want?”

Sometimes, prison seemed an easier sentence than working for Mr. Rousseau. But at the same time, it wouldn’t change much. I’d still be a mutt on a leash, I’d just have a different owner. Story of my life.

Davis and I went back and forth, arguing about the logistics of the situation, but in the end, I retreated to my car and started the engine again. I almost called Troy, but I already knew what he’d tell me. It’d been with me since I first left the brownstone. I had to go see the Butcher on Barker Street.",1,1743389339.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

We will do other things or I will do something else for him on an every other day basis. Sorry a little TMI…We just don’t have actual sex that much, but sometimes we do. His needs are taken care of ( if you catch my drift) at least 3 to 4 times a week. He will tell me they aren’t which I Do not understand but he told me just the other day that if he had any “extra” money he would get his needs taken care of and he wouldn’t have to be a “little bitch” about it, that then I wouldn’t be the problem. He says I should appreciate him more because I stay at home with the kids. He says he thinks about all the shit I’m not doing while he’s working. We have 3 very active children ranging from 6-13. I was working part time and he told me to stop working. I was working around his schedule because I enjoyed my job but he said if I didn’t stop working I don’t care about our children and our business. So of course I stopped working. I do all the paperwork for the business but it’s not very much maybe work about 2hrs a day for the company. He is a really good cook and normally cooks dinner. I would cook but when I do I can’t cook the same type of food for dinner he has for lunch or he won’t like what I make. I sometimes just make stuff and he will get mad or say it wasn’t that good, i actually am a good cook but when he’s there while I’m cooking he’s telling me what I’m doing wrong I get nervous then he just takes over so it’s not a fight. I love to bake and normally bake. I take all the kids to and from all their sports but make sure to come home eat dinner together, rub his back lay down with him when he goes to bed early but make sure to have the little one ready and tucked in for bed. We have been together for 19years. I feel like I keep up my appearance and figure and get ready every day. I don’t ask for anything beside my daily coffee but I am so easy going. I am a ride or die kind of girl and would do anything for him. I don’t think he has cheated but he accuses me of having an affair because it may be like 4 or 5 days of not having sex. I have so much on my mind and my body doesn’t work like that. I have to initiate it because he says he’s not doing that anymore. I don’t know, I guess I’m just ranting because I feel like I’m a really good wife. I’m not these women on you tube who does some super kinky stuff or has the house spotless with dinner done or breakfast made for him. My house is clean and I try to keep up on all the laundry. When he is home during the week day we will normally have sex in the middle of the day so the kids aren’t home. Part of me wants to just tell him to find his perfect girl, but then I get so sad that, that’s not me and I’m not good enough for him and he will find that. I know I can always be more affectionate and initiate more maybe I am the problem 😞 I’m tired of crying and feeling like I will never be good enough. ",1,1743389261.0,Marriage,2,0.67,False
1jntfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1jntfq4/the_butcher_on_barker_street_pt_12/,The Butcher on Barker Street [Pt. 1/2],"The call came in a little after three in the morning. When I reached over to the nightstand, I accidentally knocked over my alarm clock. It crashed to the ground, shattering into jagged shards of plastic and glass. Not a good way to start the day.

I answered the phone. “Look, whoever this is, you owe me a new alarm clock.”

“Get over here.” I recognized Troy’s voice immediately. “We have a problem.”

“A please would be appreciated.”

“Stow the snark, James,” he said. “This is serious.”

I looked around my empty bedroom. There were piles of clothes strewn about the floor, along with old gin bottles and spent cigarette butts. Last night was a haze of loud music and endless drinking. I couldn’t be sure, but my breath said I’d ordered a pizza too.

Looking down at the bits of plastic and glass, I said, “Fine, but while I got ya on the line, let me tell you a little about this new alarm clock you’re gonna buy me.”

While I got dressed, I went on and on about the clock. I wanted one that could connect to the internet, play music, and use Bluetooth. Troy was quiet as I rambled, and when I was finished, he said: “I’m at a brownstone on thirty-second. Apartment twenty-five. Move your ass, we’re burning daylight.”

Outside the bedroom window, the sky was dark and amassed with clouds. There wasn’t daylight yet to burn.

The call disconnected, and I pocketed my cell phone. I swiped my jacket from the floor. There was a slight bulge in the breast pocket. My cigarettes were still there. Then, I grabbed my keys, wallet, and handgun from the dresser. On the way out, I stopped in the bathroom to brush my teeth, but even after relentlessly scrubbing with cheap cinnamon-flavored toothpaste, my breath still smelled like greasy pizza and gin.

Some things never come out no matter what you do.

Driving to the south side of town, I found the brownstone Troy had told me about and stepped inside. The inner walls were white and barren save a few odd holes and yellow cigarette stains. The carpet was fuzzy and mottled by discolored blotches. I’m not one to judge, my place wasn’t much better. The rent was a little more expensive because I lived on the east side, but otherwise, they were pretty much the same.

In the city, in life, you’ve got to do whatever it takes to get by. Even if it means living in rat-infested apartments where neighbors blared screamo music and there was asbestos in the walls.

Climbing two flights of stairs, I knocked twice on the door to apartment twenty-five. Footsteps thundered from inside, followed by the rattle of a chain-lock being disarmed. The door opened, and Troy peered out at me through a crack in the door.

“This better be good,” I said, rubbing the exhaustion from my eyes. “I was having a great dream—”

“Yeah, yeah. You can tell me about it later,” he said, throwing the door open and pulling me inside. He slammed the door shut behind us, locking it again. “Word of warning, situation’s a little tricky.”

In our line of work, when wasn’t it “tricky”?

Troy had your typical bouncer look. Broad-shouldered, short blond hair, lantern jaw, built like a linebacker. He wore dark denim pants and a grimy leather jacket with more years on it than most cars.

He was the kind of guy Mr. Rousseau liked to keep for the first half of the day because he was well-read and personable. Intimidating at first glance, but in private company, he was quiet and reserved. These were the hours Mr. Rousseau handled the legitimate side of the business.

Plus, mornings and early afternoons were the only hours that worked for Troy’s schedule since he had a wife and two kids.

“Wait a minute.” Troy leaned in close and sniffed. “Are you drunk?”

“Not entirely.”

“What the fuck, James! It’s a Thursday.”

“Yeah, and Mr. Rousseau usually has me on at night. So, why the hell am I being called in at three in the morning?”

He gestured for me to follow as he started down the narrow hallway. I didn’t recognize the apartment. Mr. Rousseau lived on the north side of town, and Troy had a house on the west side. The south side of the city was reserved for addicts, deadbeats, and broke college kids. There weren’t many in Rousseau’s personal circle that fit the bill.

We turned at the corner and followed the rest of the hallway to a closed door. Troy hesitated with his hand on the knob, looking over his shoulder at me. There were shadows in his eyes. Despair. He sighed and turned the knob, pushing the door open. Instantly, before I even entered the bedroom, I could taste the metal and copper in the air. Smell the early stages of decay.

If something like that doesn’t wake you up, nothing will.

The bedroom was a dingy space with splintered floorboards and a sagged ceiling. Next bad rainstorm would probably knock out a few tiles. The furniture was ancient and dilapidated. In the far corner, an old boxy TV displayed a screen of black-and-white fuzz, hissing quietly in the background as we examined the scene.

“What the fuck happened?” I asked.

Any semblance of drunkenness had abandoned me, replaced by a stone-cold sobriety that made me want to scream or punch something.

“There was an incident,” Troy said haphazardly. Always the professional. “It’s a bit complicated.”

That was one way of putting it.

On the queen-sized bed was a partially naked girl lying limp on the mattress. Sheets and blankets swirled around her, splattered in blood. Her limbs were splayed at odd angles, lifeless. The back of her head was caved open with a jagged rim of exposed skull peering out through her long black hair. I kneeled to inspect the wound, thinking Troy had maybe brought me in for amateur medical attention. I’d spent the first eighteen years of my life working on a farm, caring and tending to animals. Whenever I wasn’t slaughtering them.

Adjusting the head of a nearby lamp on the nightstand, a bright yellow light shined against the top of the girl’s head. Her injury was untreatable in given circumstances. Blunt-force trauma with noticeable swelling and severe hemorrhaging. The skin was ruddy red with a slight undertone of blue. There were tiny bits of bone, hair, and flesh amongst the exposed grey matter of her brain.

I almost suggested a hospital in the area, but reality dawned on me. I would’ve been better off suggesting a morgue.

Then, as I was examining the wound, the girl’s brain began to shift beneath the undulating pool of blood. For a moment, I thought she might open her eyes and sit up in bed. This expectation died in its cradle as I watched a fly crawl out from the mixture of blood and membrane. Its wings fluttered a few times, and once they were clean, it took off into the air.

I quickly turned away, gagging against last night’s dinner. Shouldn’t have had so much pizza or gin, but I’m a creature of habit.

“Seriously,” I stammered, leaning against the wall, staring down at my shoes, desperately trying not to think about the dead girl, “what the fuck happened?”

“I already told you: there was an incident.”

“Yeah, no shit there was an incident.”

“It was an accident, James.”

You don’t get an injury like that from an accident unless it involves a head-on collision or a flight of stairs.

“Oh, an accident? That makes it so much better.” I glimpsed at the girl again, my heart swelling with a mixture of disgust and pity. “Is she dead?”

I don’t know why I asked. She had the pale complexion of a corpse. The putrid stink of a corpse. Probably had the sour taste of one too.

Troy shrugged. “My gut tells me she’s most likely dead.”

“Most likely?”

“No, yeah, she’s dead.” He considered this for a moment before nodding. “Definitely dead. Mr. Rousseau clubbed her over the head with an ashtray.”

I exhaled carefully. “That oughta do it.” I reached inside my jacket pocket and removed a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, lighting one the instant it met my lips. “Why’d he do it?”

“Lost his cool for a second.”

“Really? Only for a second.”

Troy threw his hands up defensively. “Look, I was just chillin’ in the living room, reading a book, when I heard her scream. By the time I got in here, well, it was finished.”

 “Did he say anything?”

“He wants us to clean it up.”

“No shit, Sherlock. I mean, did he say anything about why he did it?”

Troy scoffed. “He actually wrote a ten-page essay about it if you’re interested in reading it.”

I considered punching him, but the only reason Troy and I had lasted as partners was because we knew not to take it out on each other. We had an unspoken policy: ‘Just do the job and get out. No questions asked.’ In situations like that, though, it was hard to refrain from asking any questions.

“Well,” I said, slowly regaining my equilibrium with the help of nicotine calming my nerves, “where the hell is Rousseau?”

“Don’t worry about it. I called some guys to take him back to his penthouse. But we’ve gotta fix this fast. The girl has a roommate. She’s outta town right now, but she’ll be back around noon.”

“We’re so fucked.”

“Not if we move fast,” Troy promised. “I’ve already got it figured out. I’ll stay here and clean up the mess. I just need you to take care of the body.”

“Fuck you. I’m not driving a dead body through the city at three in the morning. I’ll stay and clean up the scene. You can deliver the girl.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t have a license.”

“Hasn’t stopped you before.”

“My tags are expired too.”

That’s when it hit me. “Oh, fucking forget about it! We’re not putting a dead girl in the trunk of my car.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s my personal vehicle, dumbass.”

“It’s a minivan, not a Maserati.”

“It’s still my car. I’m not letting you fuck it up.”

“It’s what soccer moms use to drive their kids to school. A little blood isn’t going to ruin it.”

I started pacing back and forth across the room. Floorboards creaked beneath my feet. The nicotine was making me sick, and my sleep deprivation wasn’t helping either.

Troy groaned, exasperated. “Will you please just be cool about this? We don’t have time to bicker like an old married couple. We need to get this fixed. Now!”

“Son of a bitch!” I kicked the wall. Dried paint chips fell to the floor. “Okay, alright, fine! What’s the play?”

“I’ve got some plastic wrap and a few blankets. We’ll bundle her up, carry her downstairs, and load her into the trunk. Then, you’ll take her to one of the usual spots.”

By ‘usual spots’ he meant one of the local businesses we used to dispose of bodies. There were a few throughout the city, but my go-to was Mason and Sons, a funeral home on the north side of town. Mason was a pleasant man, despite his affiliation with someone like Mr. Rousseau. And his means of disposal was perhaps the most humane I could think of. Better than the scrapyard or the butcher shop.

We exited the apartment, went downstairs, and stepped out into the parking lot. Troy’s car was near the back corner, far away from the rest. He opened the truck and removed the top panel. Beneath, where there should’ve been a spare tire, was instead a cache of random supplies for situations like this. Handcuffs, duct tape, zip ties, trash bags, bleach, soap, ammonia, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and whatever else.

I almost made a joke about how maybe he should be driving the minivan, but I couldn’t get the thoughts from my mind to my tongue without wanting to puke. So, I just silently smoked my cigarette instead.

Back in the apartment, we gathered everything covered in blood into one of the trash bags. We also threw in some of the girl’s personal belongings like her wallet, keys, and cell phone. Troy took whatever excess cash from her purse, asking me if I wanted to split it.

“You fuckin’ scumbag,” I muttered.

“Oh, forgive me, Prince Charming,” he said. “Some of us got bills to pay.”

“More like alimony.”

Troy cuffed me on the shoulder for that one. In this line of work, it was hard to have a family. Especially on nights when you had to gaze into the emaciated face of a young dead girl, trying not to think of your daughter or wife.

You have to lie to yourself. Detach yourself from the situation. Pretend that you can still be the good guy, but ultimately, guilt always resurfaces. Usually late at night, while you’re in bed, listening to the silence of the world around you, staring up at the shadows on the ceiling like ink blots on a Rorschach test.

I see a happy little dog, you might say. I see a pretty pink pony. I see the shattered skull of a young woman. I see the maggots wriggling around inside her brain. I see myself protecting the man who killed her because I’m just a dog on a leash.

Guys like us develop hobbies to distract ourselves from the silence, from the memories. Troy was a frequent reader of everything and anything. I’d seen him consume more books than a librarian. Once, I even caught him reading the dictionary because he didn’t have any other novels on hand.

For me, I liked to drink and smoke. It helped me sleep. Helped me clear my mind. When I wasn’t drinking, I was working.

My occupation was a complicated matter. If that weren’t already apparent. I usually followed Mr. Rousseau around like a good lil’ pup, going all across the city to visit underground clubs, bars, and other late-night establishments with morally questionable exchanges.

If I wasn’t acting as Mr. Rousseau’s bodyguard or personal assistant, I was off collecting debts and payments. That, or I was delivering packages. Most of the time, I had no clue what these packages contained, but I had my assumptions: narcotics, money, evidence, and so on.

Once, I had to deliver a sphere-shaped package wrapped in duct tape and plastic. I kept telling myself it was a basketball or soccer ball, but my gut told me otherwise. That was the first time I’d met the Butcher. When I handed him the package, he licked his lips and said: “This will do just fine.”

I avoided the butcher when at all possible.

By the time Troy and I finished collecting personal belongings, we had two bags full. I delivered those to the trunk of my car, and when I returned, Troy already had the girl enveloped in cellophane. We were somewhat skilled in the trade of making a person disappear.

We wrapped the girl in a few blankets and quilts. One of them was pink and had the word “Barbie” scrawled across it in swooping letters.

“So,” I said, “your daughter fell out of her doll phase then?”

“That’s what happens when you get them a cell phone.”

The last time we did this, we used blankets designed with monster trucks and Spongebob. His son had just turned eleven and got an Xbox with games like Call of Duty and Halo.

Once the blankets were in place, we secured them with duct tape. Then, after checking the apartment hallways, we carried the body to the parking lot. The sun was just starting to peer over the horizon, but morning traffic still hadn’t hit yet.

With the body inside, Troy shut the trunk and sighed. “You gonna take her to the Butcher?”

“No,” I said, a little too quickly to be impartial on the matter. “Mason’s place.”

“Butcher is closer.”

“She’s going to Mason. End of story.”

He shrugged and checked his watch. “Better get moving before he gets busy then.”

“No, shit,” I said, climbing into the car and starting the engine. “Have fun, Mr. Clean.”

Grumbling, he waved me away and headed back towards the building.

“I’m serious about that alarm clock,” I called out after him. “It better be expensive and brand-new.”

Troy flipped me off over his shoulder and disappeared inside. I shifted into drive and started across the city, careful to obey the speed limit and stop at all traffic lights. The last thing I needed was to catch any unwanted attention.

While I was driving, my hands began to shake. The road oscillated in front of me, fusing with the night sky. Stars blurred and coalesced into a single bright light of fluorescent white. I rubbed my eyes and searched the glove box, returning with a hand-sized bottle of gin. It steadied my nerves, placating the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

A man without his medicine goes a little mad from time to time.

At Mason and Sons Funeral Home, I parked in the back. I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. So, I climbed the back steps to the rear entrance and knocked. It took a few minutes, but eventually, his wife appeared. Her smile vanished, and she looked at me with discernible disgust.

“It’s four-thirty in the morning,” she growled.

“Nice to see you too, Shelia,” I replied, affecting a delicate tone. She, like many others, preferred Troy over me, but she could’ve probably gone the rest of her life without ever speaking to either one of us again. “Mason here?”

She stepped aside, waving me inside. “He’s in the back office. Be quick about it. We’ve got a family coming in at five.”

“You could try to be a little nicer. Mr. Rousseau pays to keep the fuckin’ lights on in this place, y’know.”

Her scowl deepened, forming lines across her forehead, accentuating the hollow crevices around her sunken eyes. She reeled back and slapped me across the face. “Make it snappy, you rat fuck, and get the hell outta here.”

“Fair enough.”

I rubbed the sting from my cheek and moved down the hallway. That’s where I bumped into two of Mason’s sons. I didn’t remember their names, and they probably didn’t remember mine either. But we were familiar with each other.

A while back, Mr. Rousseau made me retrieve the older one from a crack den on the south side while the kid was on a bender. I had to fend off two different dealers and a Chihuahua that wouldn’t stop nipping at my heels.

Because of the younger son, I had to visit a few families on the north side with a large cash settlement to keep them silent about something involving their teenage daughters. I don’t know all the details, but the little bastard wasn’t allowed to interact with any of the grieving customers who came in. Probably for the best, all things considered.

The sons nodded at me and left. I continued down the hall into the back office. Inside, Mason sat behind his desk with a cup of coffee in one hand and a manilla file in the other. He flipped through pages, squinting through a pair of tiny spectacles that were comically small. I had to wonder if he could even see through them.

Despite his kids, Mason was a decent person. As far as humans are concerned. He reminded me of my grandfather. An old oak tree slowly wilting while the rest of the forest was chopped down to make room for new shops and apartments. Just a man trying to stay afloat, willing to do whatever it took to keep his family safe and secure.

Mason glanced up at me and smiled. “James, I wasn’t expecting you.”

“Sorry, Mason,” I said. “I tried to call, but there was no answer.”

“Phone’s in the other room.” He set his coffee down and closed the folder. Leaning forward on his desk, he clasped his hands together and asked, “What can I do for you, my boy?”

He was from a different generation where people said things like “my boy” or “simmer down” or on occasion, such as when I brought his son home from the drug den, “damn shame” while shaking his head.

I sat in the chair across from him and explained the situation, what little I knew. When I was finished, Mason took off his spectacles, pinched the bridge of his nose, and exhaled. He tried to smooth back the wispy grey hair on his head, but there were so few left that they refused to obey.

“The situation’s a bit muddled,” I told him, affecting Troy’s professionalism. “We’re tryin’ to get it cleaned up as soon as possible. So, if you have anything, I would appreciate it. And I’m sure Mr. Rousseau would appreciate it too.”

Whenever dealing with these people, you have to throw out Mr. Rousseau’s name as much as possible. It’s the only way to get them to treat you seriously. The only way to keep their attention. Otherwise, you’re just a rat fuck. A dog without an owner.

“Let me see,” Mason said, flipping through a large black ledger. With every page, he licked his pruney fingers and hummed. “Hmm. Damn shame…damn shame. Young girl, was it?”

“Yes, sir. Not as young as you might think, but younger than either of us. Late teens, early twenties maybe. I’m guessing a college student. Maybe a part-time escort.”

Rousseau met most of his paramours late at night while wandering the city’s underbelly. Dancers at the clubs and waitresses at the bars. A repetitive routine that usually worked in his favour.

“And how’d it happen?” Mason asked.

I hesitated. My tongue wouldn't form the words. “Uh, probably for the best that you don’t know, sir.”

He chuckled. It was easy to approach these situations with a bit of humor when you weren’t looking at the corpse. Even someone like Mason, who’d been embalming and burying bodies since before I could drive, would probably feel faint at the sight of that girl. He’d clutch his metaphorical pearls and blink back tears. Maybe spend the afternoon in his office, drinking from the bottle of bourbon he kept in the bottom drawer.

“How soon would you need a hole?” Mason asked without looking up from his agenda.

“Today, if possible.”

The way Mason and Sons worked was we would deliver a body a few hours before a funeral. They would dig the grave about four or five feet deeper than usual, and we would drop the dead body inside. Then, we’d cover them up with a few inches of dirt, just enough to conceal the corpse. Once the funeral was done, they would transport the coffin and drop it down on top of the other corpse before sealing up the grave.

When the body was taken care of, they burned all evidence and possessions in their industrial furnace. At least, that’s what they told me, but the last time I visited, his younger son was sporting a new wristwatch that seemed vaguely familiar.

“I’m sorry to tell ya,” Mason said, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest, “but we just don’t have any open graves right now. If you can hold onto the body for a few more days, we might have availability this weekend.”

“We’ve got nowhere to store it until then.”

He cocked an eyebrow. “Where is she now?”

“My trunk.”

Mason blanched and reached for his coffee, his hand trembling as he lifted the mug to his lips. “Sweet Baby Jesus! You’ve got her with you as we speak? That’s what you’re tellin’ me?”

“Yes, sir. Unfortunately. Like I said, it’s a bit of a SNAFU.”

“No kiddin’, my boy.” He rubbed the few strands of hair on his chin. “I’m sorry. I wish I could help, but my hands are tied.”

I feigned nonchalance, but in reality, my heart was pounding against my chest. Sweat beaded on the back of my neck. I kept thinking about that dead girl, the hole in her skull, the stew of bone shards and hair inside her head. I needed to get rid of her, to get her out of my trunk so I could go back home, drink myself stupid, and fall asleep. Forget the day, let another replace it.

“You alright?” Mason asked me. “Can I get you a coffee or a cup of tea?”

“No, but thank you, sir.” I had gin waiting for me back in the car. “I should probably get going.”

“You know, I’m surprised to see you again. Thought you would’ve taken your leave by now. That was the plan, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, sir, but things changed. Thought I’d have my debts paid by now, but the bills never stop coming.”

He laughed. “You can say that again.”

Last winter, my father took a spill down the stairs and hit his head. While my mother was doing her best to sell the farm, there were no buyers. It was taking every last penny to keep her afloat while she waited for the life insurance policy to kick in. Bureaucrats always found a way to slow down the process.

I stood from my chair, shook Mason’s hand, and left. His wife followed me out the door, giving me one last glare before slamming the door shut.

When I got back in the car, I was overcome by the putrid stink of decay. I could practically taste the withering flesh, taste the metallic tinge of her blood in my mouth despite the layers of plastic and blankets. There must’ve been a hole or something. A part that wasn’t covered.

I rolled down the window and turned on the AC. Then, I retrieved my phone from my pocket and dialed Troy’s number.

Three rings before he answered. “Everything taken care of?”

“Not quite.”

“Great, what now?”

“Mason doesn’t have any open graves at the moment.”

“Guess you’ll have to go to the Butcher,” Troy said.

My blood turned cold, and I squeezed the steering wheel, digging my nails into the pleather. “No way! I’m not going to the Butcher.”

“Quit being such a baby and just do it.”

“The guy is a fuckin’ freakshow! I’m not going there alone.”

“Well, I’m a little preoccupied at the moment.” Troy took a deep breath and sighed. “You could try Davis’s Scrapyard. I don’t have his number, so you’ll have to drive over. He should be in by now.”

I wanted to smash my phone against the dashboard. Mr. Rousseau paid well, but in some situations, it wasn’t enough. Rock and a hard place, I guess.

“Whatever,” I said, exasperated. “Just hurry up with the apartment.”

“It’d go a lot faster if you didn’t call.”

I hung up and tossed the phone into the passenger seat. My foot pressed against the accelerator, turning the faint glow of street lights into a hazy smear of orange and yellow. Rain pattered across the windshield, and the rubber wipers squeaked against the glass. My hands fidgeted about the wheel, trembling whenever they didn’t have something stable to grasp onto. I reached into my pocket for another cigarette.

By the time I arrived at the scrapyard, I was stifling a gag between clenched teeth. The car reeked of burning tobacco and death. You could soak the inside with bleach, but the smell still wouldn’t go away.

Parking at the front gate, I found Davis in the main trailer, drinking a beer and throwing files into a trash can. He glanced over his shoulder at me, brow already furrowed, eyes bloodshot with fatigue.

“Nah,” he said. No hesitation, no fear. “Sorry, James, but I can’t.”

“You don’t even know why I’m here.”


“Don’t need to, buddy. If you’re here, it’s prob’ly something bad.” He emptied an entire drawer of files into the trash can before tossing it aside. “Trust me, this is the last place you wanna be.”

“And why’s that?”

“Last week, cops busted one of my garages. They’ve been watching my every move ever since. Whatever you’re here for, I doubt you want to get me involved.”

Davis operated several chop shops across the city. On the surface, they were any other garage, but in the back, they were stripping stolen cars for spare parts. Not exactly the worst of Mr. Rousseau’s colleagues, but his operation was big and turned quite a profit. An influential man to have in your pocket.

His scrapyard was convenient when it came to dead bodies. They had the kind of machinery that could crush a vehicle into a tiny cube. Imagine what it did to a corpse. Plus, there was plenty of land to bury bodies, and plenty of rubbish to hide the stink of rotting humans.

“It’s just one girl,” I said. “Slip of a thing. Wouldn’t be hard for you to dispose of. Wouldn’t take any time.”

He scoffed. “Maybe I’m not speaking clearly, but the cops are investigating me. They’re looking into every single thing I do. Dead girl is just what they need to get a warrant. Shit, screw the warrant, that would be enough for probable cause. We’d both be in cuffs, buddy. Is that what you want?”

Sometimes, prison seemed an easier sentence than working for Mr. Rousseau. But at the same time, it wouldn’t change much. I’d still be a mutt on a leash, I’d just have a different owner. Story of my life.

Davis and I went back and forth, arguing about the logistics of the situation, but in the end, I retreated to my car and started the engine again. I almost called Troy, but I already knew what he’d tell me. It’d been with me since I first left the brownstone.

So I (31m)  met this chick (24f) here on a few months ago Reddit. She's an artist that posts on here frequently. I was going through some dark stuff at the time and we ended up chatting through random circumstance and it was really nice. We got a long really well and just clicked instantly. 
So we end up trading Instagrams. Valentine's Day pulls around. At this point we've been talking for probably a total of three weeks. She makes a post on Instagram, it's a selfie of herself saying how excited she is for Valentine's Day. This immediately came off as super strange to me because she said she was single and all though we had started to flirt with each other it still wasn't much of anything. So I start looking through her likes on the post and it's all a bunch of dudes and I'm going through all their posts and she's in there liking everything they're posting. Shirtless photos. Stuff guys post to obviously impress women.
At that point I just straight up blocked her. I felt so confused and honestly a bit manipulated. Our connection seemed so genuine but after seeing that I'm second guessing everything. I end up forgetting to block one of her back up accounts and she dm's me. She's upset and said I just disappeared out of nowhere so I tell her exactly why I did what I did. She gives me a bunch of bs about how she's just being polite because they like her photos so she was just liking them back. Yeah sure whatever. At this point I'm like listen, we're not dating, I'm not in charge of you or anything and I don't want to be. If you're talking to other men just tell me. Still just some non answer bs. 
So fine whatever, I legitimately like her as a person but I obviously can't trust her romantically so I was like let's just be friends. 
So we chat as friends for a bit but eventually she gets more provocative and I'm not going to lie your boys been down bad due to some real hard depression mixed with drug use so I went along with it and suddenly where back to how shit was originally. Whatever I'm just going to pretend these other dudes don't exist for a little bit and find some way to address it. 
I forget if I mentioned earlier but she's an artist. One day she sent out an art piece to a customer and they where supposed to pay but never did. She's wasn't doing great money wise to start with so then not paying was a really big blow to her. So she has this buy me a coffee website thing where you can buy her a coffee. The largest amount of coffees that one person has bought her at a time was 10. So I chose 11. The next day I go back and check the page and see some other dude sent 12. Like it's a competition or something. Anyway after I saw that I was like who is this dude sending you 12 coffees? And she got super mad at me and just blocked me.
I'm just so confused about everything lol I wasn't even stressed about her talking to other dudes that's the nature of the game just the fact that she refused to admit it despite all of the obvious signs drives me insane. Like I'm not crazy right? Those are some pretty obvious hints.",1,1743389193.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.67,False

*   **Power Delivery (PD):** This allows the hub to charge your laptop or other devices while simultaneously providing connectivity. The power rating (e.g., 100W) indicates the maximum power that can be delivered. For power-hungry devices like MacBook Pros, a 100W PD rating is generally recommended. Look for Anker usb c hub with power delivery when this is important.
*   **HDMI Output:** The HDMI port allows you to connect external monitors or displays.The resolution and refresh rate (e.g., 4K@60Hz) determine the visual quality of the output. 4K@60Hz offers a smoother and more detailed image than 4K@30Hz.
*   **USB-A Ports:** These are standard USB ports for connecting older peripherals like mice, keyboards, and external hard drives.The USB version (e.g.,USB 3.0 or USB 3.1) indicates the data transfer speed.
*   **USB-C Data Ports:** These ports are used for data transfer only and do not support power delivery.*   **Gigabit Ethernet:** This port provides a stable wired network connection, which is frequently enough faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi.
*   **Card Readers (SD/microSD):** These allow you to easily transfer photos and videos from memory cards.
*   **Thunderbolt 4:** The latest generation of Thunderbolt technology offers incredibly fast data transfer speeds and supports multiple high-resolution displays.

I have no real friends, I know my husband's friends and their wives/gfs but our interactions are very limited, we only talk or see each other when my husband and his friends plan to do something, so literally I only have my husband.

1jnt9ii,https://i.redd.it/rqc2l7zatxre1.jpeg,Inconsistent dosing [Grinder],"
Hey everyone,

I have an issue regarding our Mahlkönig GBW 65S back at our coffee shop is and I can’t figure out what’s wrong. After cleaning it, I noticed that it started dosing more than what’s displayed on the screen. 

For example, if I set it to 15g, it actually dispenses around 18g (sometimes more, sometimes less) which is weird and doesn't make any sense. This issue appeared immediately after cleaning, even though I didn’t adjust the burrs at that time. 

Later, I adjusted the burr distance to try and fix the issue, but now my shot times are inconsistent with the draw time , sometimes overaectracted and sometimes under-extracted. On top of that, my grinds now come out clumpy if I grind fine. 
I’ve checked the settings menu, but it’s complicated, and I can’t find anything about recalibrating the GBW scale or resetting the grinder. I also tried power cycling (turning it off and unplugging), but it didn’t help. I checked for retention issues by grinding multiple doses, but the inconsistency remains.

1jnt7v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jnt7v7/i_brought_something_back_with_me_from_my_trip_to/,I brought something back with me from my trip to Europe. (Part 1),"When I graduated college, my friends and I decided to go on a trip to both celebrate our accomplishment and mourn the fact that we were officially leaving adolescence and entering the ”real world”. We decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe as it seemed to be the only place that we could all agree on and was perfectly cliche for a group of (former) college students. We were all experienced hikers and had traveled virtually everywhere in the U.S., so we thought Europe would be a nice change of scenery. Not a lot of planning went into our trip, we just had a vague idea of what we wanted to do. Fly into Denmark, end up in Switzerland, staying in youth hostels along the way. We had set aside a month for the entire trip so we weren't stressed about having a coordinated agenda or planned stops, we just wanted to get drunk at every bar and do things that caught our interest along the way. 



The beginning of our trip went as expected. We flew into Copenhagen and immediately went out to the nearest bar. For the next month, we made our way south through Hamburg, to Hanover, to Frankfurt, and finally to Zurich. Our trip was filled with hiking, drinking, sightseeing, and a few drug-fueled experiences that now seem hazy in my memory. Everything was what I was expecting from the trip until we got to Zurich. When doing the little planning we did before embarking, the one thing that we did plan was our flights. When we arrived in Zurich, it was a few days before our scheduled return flight home. Being at the end of a month-long bender, none of us really felt like continuing partying and decided to go on a short hike in the Swiss Alps before our return trip. 



Not all of us went on the hike. Out of the 5 in total who went on the trip, only 3 including me decided they wanted to see the alps. The two who went with me were my friends Henry and Kyle. To get to the alps, we had to ride a train for about 2 hours. The image of the mountains towering over me as we stood at their base is imprinted in my mind. The smell of the fir trees, the quiet ambience only interrupted by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the leaves. It was truly serene, and Henry, Kyle, and I silently agreed to not disturb the peace with conversation as we started our way up the trail. Even though we were experienced hikers, we were not planning on climbing to the summit of any mountain, but as we continued down the trail at relatively the same altitude, it got cold. Very cold. 



“Do you guys also feel chilly?” Henry asked us.



I turned around to see him shivering in his t-shirt and shorts.



“Yeah it feels like way colder than when we started.” I replied.



We had set out for our day trip at around 11:00 AM and had only been hiking for about an hour, so it should have been getting warmer if anything. We didn’t really think anything of it as we all had sweaters in our backpacks for when it got chilly at night. In Switzerland the temperature in June, when we were there, is around 55 degrees Fahrenheit at the coldest, but we could tell it was getting much colder than that. Still, we decided to keep going since the route we were taking would take around 8 hours to complete, putting us back at the base of the mountain at around 7:00 PM, just before the sun set. About an hour later, clouds started to move in, blocking out the sun and making it even colder. The wind was picking up too, adding to the already plummeting temperature. I could tell that it was easily close to, if not already, freezing now. When we set out this morning, the forecast said that it would be sunny all day, with no clouds in the sky. 



“Guys, maybe we should just turn back now. It’s getting really cold and it looks like it might rain.” Kyle said. 



“Yeah it's getting mad uncomfortable and I don’t want to be cold and soaked.” Henry added.



“Yeah alright, let’s head back. I'm cold as hell too.” I agreed.

“Let me just take a piss real quick, I’ve been chugging water all morning.”



I was disappointed that our excursion didn’t go as planned, but was looking forward to getting out of the cold. I went off the path to relieve myself behind a tree. After finding a nice pine, I unzipped and did my business. Looking up, I noticed a strange symbol carved into the tree slightly above my head. It looked like an owl head with a cross marked in its forehead. I figured somebody got bored doing what I was doing right now and decided to doodle it into the tree, maybe hoping to scare the next pisser. I zipped back up and headed back to the trail to meet up with my fellow hikers, but when I got back to the trail I didn’t see them. 



“Guys?” I said, slightly above my normal talking volume.

“Alright, very funny guys!” I shouted.

“I guess y’all are gonna jump out and scare me now?”



No response.



“Guys?” I tried again, looking around to see if I just didn’t see them when I was walking back. 



I was only met with the howl of the wind and the swaying of the trees. Without any other explanation, I told myself that Henry and Kyle just ditched me as a prank and already started back to the trail head. It felt wrong to me though, I knew that they wouldn't do that to me, especially since we were hiking in a new place and the weather was so rapidly degrading. They wouldn’t leave me alone, even as a joke. I swallowed this doubt and started back towards the foot of the mountain, determined to save myself from the cold and hoping to find my friends along the way. 



Throughout the afternoon, the clouds above me grew denser, darker, until it felt like dusk. Trudging through the cold, windy afternoon it felt like knives were striking my skin every time the wind picked up, tearing my skin apart. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, I checked my watch to gauge how far I was from the trail head and the sweet warmness of the train ride home. It read “2:53 PM”. We had turned around at about 1:00 PM and had started at 11:00 AM, so I should be reaching the beginning of the trail soon I figured. As I read the numbers on my watch, a white flake landed right on the time display. I picked it up with my finger and it melted almost instantly. I looked up to see hundreds of snowy, white flakes falling from the deep, dark gray sky. A feeling of panic and dread filled my stomach. 



“How could it be snowing in the middle of June?” I thought to myself.

“Thank God I’m almost out of here.”



I was hoping with everything in my being that Henry and Kyle would be waiting for me when I got back, standing next to the warm train, waving me inside. However, as I continued down the path, my hope slowly evaporated. I walked for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, still no trail head in sight.



“I should be right by the train by now.” I told myself.

“Did I walk the wrong way when I finished pissing earlier? Did I somehow go back to the wrong trail? Where am I?”



I was starting to panic. Snow was still falling and each crunch under my boot slowly weathering my assurance that I would see my friends or the train again. My feet and my legs were growing numb. I had nothing but my shorts and a sweater to protect me from the unforgiving cold. Still, I kept walking. Eventually, the clouds grew so dark I had to take out my flashlight so I could see the path better. I looked down at my watch, expecting it to be close to sunset. “4:12 PM” it read. I figured even if I did walk the wrong way, I would still end up at the trailhead by 7:00 PM since that’s how long the entire hike would have taken. I continued, each minute growing more and more scared of the reality I was in. Snow was building on the ground, the wind and the cold had still not given up. Each minute had the weight of a freight train, pounding into my body. Luckily, I wasn’t entirely stupid and had packed food and water for the journey, so I would still have my strength to continue. As the afternoon turned into the evening, 7:00 PM came and went and the trailhead was still nowhere in sight. My panic grew with each step I took. It was pitch black now, almost a complete absence of light. We weren’t expecting to stay the night up here, so I hadn’t packed a tent or many camping supplies, just a sleeping bag. 



I started coming to terms with the fact that I would probably have to spend the night out here in nothing but a thin sleeping bag when I saw a light up ahead of me. I felt my heart skip a beat, thinking it was another hiker. At least I won’t be out here alone. Maybe they had some camping gear or at least extra clothes so I wouldn’t freeze to death. However, as I made my way towards the beckoning light, it turned into multiple lights, yellow and warm. I finally got in range to tell what it was, not another hiker, but a cabin. I didn’t have time or the luxury to think about all the warnings I was given by Grimm’s fairy tales in my youth to think twice about approaching this lone cabin in the middle of the Swiss Alps. As I quickly walked towards the cabin, I thanked God with every step and thought about the warmth that would bathe me as I entered the cabin. The cabin appeared rustic, like Paul Bunyan built it himself. There was a big, cast iron knocker on the door. I reached to pick it up to knock, but the door flew open before I even touched it. Greeting me was a tiny, old woman. 



“What are you doing out there in the cold?” She asked in a sweet, comforting voice.

“Come in sweetie, you’re gonna freeze to death!”



“Thank you so much.” I blurted out as I quickly entered the safe haven of the cabin. 



The crackling of a fire met my ears at the same time its warmth covered me. A flood of relief entered my body and mind with the assurance that I would not freeze to death tonight. This only lasted for a minute as I was reminded of Henry and Kyle.



“Are my friends here? Have you seen them?” I automatically asked.



“No, sweetheart, you’re the only soul we’ve seen.” The old woman said with concern in her voice.

“Come in dear, sit down, do you want some coffee? Tea?” 



“Sure, uh coffee please. You’re sure you haven’t seen anyone else tonight?”



I wandered over to the fireplace and sat down on the old sofa, next to the rocking chair. As I glanced over to the chair, I was shocked to see an old man occupying it. I hadn’t seen him when I entered.



“Positive, dear. Your friends probably had enough sense to get off the mountain when it started snowing.” She chuckled.

“What are you doing on the mountain in this weather anyway?”



“I got turned around and couldn’t find my way back to the trailhead.” I said as she handed me my coffee.

“I’m glad I found this place, I thought I was gonna freeze to death for a minute out there.” I took a sip of the coffee. It felt like ecstasy as it dripped down my throat, warming my insides.

“Is it normal for it to snow like this in the middle of June?”



“I remember only one time since I’ve lived here that it’s snowed in Summer. It was many many years ago, when I was about your age. As you can tell I’m not from here,” She smiled.



It hadn’t occurred to me when I was being rescued from the icy cold, but she spoke with an American accent. 



“Oh yes, now that you mention it.” I said between sips of coffee.

“Where are you from?”



“I’m from a little town in Kansas called Columbus. I moved here right after I finished college. I met my dear husband over there on a trip me and my friends took and I’ve been in love with him ever since.” She smiled at her husband who in return continued to rock in his chair as if he hadn’t heard a word that was said.



“That’s sweet” I said to break the silence. 



“Even after all these years he refuses to learn English.”



The old man continued to stare blankly at the fire and rock back and forth in his chair.



“Could I use your phone? To call the park rangers about my friends. I haven’t been able to get cell service since I got to the mountains.” 



“Oh we don’t have a phone dear, we don’t use any electricity here. I’m really sorry about your friends, but you’re welcome to stay here tonight and I’m sure Wilhelm here will go with you in the morning to look for them.” She gestured to her blank husband.



“Oh uhh ok. Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I said with a concerned tone to my voice.



I finished my coffee and after a hot shower, the old lady led me to their guest room where I’d be staying the night. As I crossed the hall from the bathroom to the bedroom, I could see into the living room, Wilhelm was still rocking in his chair, staring at the fire. As I laid down in the bed, I could feel an itch in my throat, you know the kind you get before you get sick. I figured being out in the freezing cold for so long would probably give me something so I just took a preemptive ibuprofen from my backpack and laid down to sleep. 



That night, I awoke with terrible chills and my head pounding. The blanket that was draped over me was drenched with sweat. The ibuprofen I took before sleeping was the last one in my pack, so I wandered out of the bedroom, across the hall to the bathroom in search of more painkillers. I turned on the water and splashed some on my face. Opening the medicine cabinet, I was greeted with a very odd assortment of jars. They were filled with what looked like herbs and fungi. I figured since these people didn’t have electricity, they were probably the kind who grew their own natural remedies as well. The jars had labels on them that specified what they were and what they did. I searched for one marked painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Sure enough, there was one with just that inscribed with sharpie and masking tape. It had the appearance of some sort of mushroom. Cracking it open, a sharp and vulgar odor hit my nostrils. It smelled like burnt rubber. The scent immediately caused me to think twice about taking whatever this was. However, being in immense pain guided my decision more than the hideous smell of the mushroom. I made sure to write down the name of it before taking it though, so I could research it after rejoining civilization. When the fungi hit my tongue, the taste hit me like a truck, it was much worse than the smell and caused me to gag before choking it down. 



I drank an ample amount of water to try and wipe the memory of the taste from my mouth, but it persisted. The effects of the strange medicine were immediately noticeable. My body began to tingle and I became dizzy. Walking out of the bathroom to the bedroom, I took another look down the hallway to the living room and stopped dead in my tracks. The old man was no longer sitting in his chair. I could see only half of his body as the doorframe cut off my view from the rest of him, but I could tell that he was naked. I slowly made my way down the hallway towards the living room. The rest of the man’s body was revealed as I got closer and my viewpoint was no longer obstructed by the door frame. The old man was right in front of the fire, facing towards it. I continued into the living room.



“Hey dude, are you alright?” I said with a nervous quiver in my voice.



He muttered something quietly in German I assume, but I couldn’t hear what it was. Something about him caught my attention though and when I saw it, my stomach dropped. On the man’s left shoulder was the symbol of an owl with a cross on its forehead, the same one I had seen on the tree. The room started to spin, I got lightheaded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was back in the bedroom, lying down on the bed. The only light provided in the room was coming from the hallway. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t. It felt like in those dreams where you try to run, but you can’t, your body is too heavy. As much as I tried, I couldn’t move. My struggle was interrupted by several people entering my room. I could only see their silhouettes created by the warm, yellow light peering in through the doorway. Counting them, there were upwards of 15 people, all of them nude. Among them, I could make out the elderly couple. I tried to speak and ask them what was going on, but I couldn’t. They slowly gathered on either side of the bed and began to raise their arms above me. Once their arms were perpendicular to their bodies, they slowly got down on their knees. I could feel their cold touch all over me. Their hands were wet with some liquid that I can only assume was vinegar, as the smell was overpowering. All of a sudden, it felt as though the bed underneath me had dropped and I had the sensation of falling, like my chest was tied to an anvil and there was nothing below to stop it. My eyes rolled back into my head and my nervous system became overwhelmed.



I awoke what I presume to be the next morning to the pleasant touch of the sun warming my face. Immediately shooting up, I expected to see the mysterious figures from the night before, but I was shocked to find that I was laying in a patch of grass, my backpack to my right. It was a typical June day, the sun beaming down beating on my face. Warm, warmer than usual. No snow or any sign of snow around. My illness was seemingly gone, but I still felt drained from whatever happened. Shakily making my way to my feet, I scanned my surroundings, seeing that I was near a trail, but no cabin in sight. I put on my pack and walked towards the trail. The surroundings felt familiar, the rocks, the trees. As I approached the trail, the owl symbol I had seen earlier beamed from the tree, capturing all of my attention. I stopped mid-step and stared at the symbol, processing exactly what this meant. Questions raced through my mind. Had the occupants of the cabin carried me all the way back here? Had I gone in a big circle? Had I gone anywhere at all in the first place? I put my concerns to the side and turned my attention to what I wanted most at this point, to go home. I started down the path in the direction of where I initially thought the trailhead to be, determined to find it this time. After about 20 minutes of walking, I heard something out in the distance. 



“Trent! Treeent!”

I recognized the voice immediately. I quickened my pace toward the source of the shouting. 



“Henry!” I shouted in return.



Rounding the corner of the trail, I almost wept when I saw Henry and Kyle walking towards me. When they saw me, they began to run towards me while I stood frozen, awash with relief. 



“Where the fuck have you been dude?” Kyle said when they finally got close. 



“You wouldn’t believe it man, there was this cabin and these old naked people and I woke up in the grass and– wait what about you guys, where the fuck have *you* been.” 



“We’ve been looking for you dude, you disappeared yesterday after you went to go take a piss.” Henry said with frustration in his voice.



“No, you guys disappeared.” I retaliated.



“We’ve been shouting your name for the past 24 hours, walking up and down the trail. Where did you go?” Kyle asked.



“I tried walking back to the trailhead, I figured you guys ditched me as a joke or something and went on without me. How did y’all survive the snow, you guys didn’t pack tents or anything right?”



“What snow?” Henry asked, with a confused look on his face.



I returned his look with one of equal confusion.



“The snow. It started snowing yesterday after we split up.”



“What do you mean man?” Kyle chuckled.

“After we split up it got hotter, dude. It’s June, there’s not gonna be any snow up here.”



I explained the rest of my night to my friends, the cabin, the old couple, the ritual that was performed on me, but they didn’t believe me. They figured I was either lying or took too many mushrooms and had a bad trip or something. In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure what happened to me was real either, God knows I didn’t want it to be. 



We made our way back to the trailhead and after about an hour and a half were sitting on a train on our way back to Zurich. The suite was quiet the whole way back. We were all fatigued from this trip and were looking forward to being home. I was resting my head on the window sill, trying to somehow find sleep after the horrific experience I had just endured. I was recounting the events that happened in the cabin when I suddenly remembered writing down the name of the fungus that I took before everything happened. I pulled out the slip of paper it was scribbled on as well as my phone and quickly googled “Mycoterra Maleficium”. I tapped on the wikipedia article for it and scrolled through. “Should not be ingested, could cause hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and diarrhea. Known for being the substance ingested during the 1974 mass suicide of the Black Dawn cult.” This was deeply concerning to say the least, I could feel myself start to sweat and my heart beat increase. How could I be that stupid to take a mushroom that I found in a stranger's house? I was livid with myself, but that was quickly replaced with fear. I clicked on the link for the Black Dawn on wikipedia and nearly dropped my phone when the page loaded. What else was going to greet me but the same owl symbol from the tree and the man’s back.

Did a misstake tonight.,"I quit all caffeine some days before new years in 2023, and before that I tapered down for a few months. It has been a success. I have gotten used to the good sleep and relaxed state of my nerve/anxiety/stress system. I am just a guy that does not use caffeine. I am not a guy that quit caffeine anymore. I am way past that. I have no desire to go back, the smell of coffee does not temt me a bit. Withdrawals is a distant memory.

I use to drink about 600 miligrams of caffeine in espressos and redbull a day before that all my grownup life. I am pushing 50 now.

So earlier tonight I bought my regular orange soda. 1.5 liters and have been sipping on that all night. Sinse 5-6 pm last night. All sunday night I did not feel very well. Lots of negative thoughts (I usually am pretty positive) and I have been kind of pacing around not knowing what to do with myself. I went for two latenight walks because I could not stay inside even though it was getting late. I have been worrying about small stuff all night, and have started and stopped with like 10 things, being to stressed and out of focus to stay on task. When bedtime came I was wide awake and did not even try to hit bed.

Then I saw it now 20 minutes ago. I had bought the wrong soda at the store. orange ""PLUSS"" version of the soda, not the regular one. 150 miligram of added caffeine pluss some energy drink stuff in it..

It is now 4.16 am, I am wide awake, and I still have the restless anxiety feeling in my body. God I am an idiot. Well at least I figured out why I have felt so out it and restless all night. And I have a monday morning that starts in a few hours, packed with work and plans. I wonder how the crash is going to be. No way I will sleep anything before I have to get going with the monday..

Good luck decaf quitters. For you people that is struggling, it IS temporary. The nasty withdrawals will go away. If you keep it up you will come to a point where coffee is not something you think about at all..

1jnt73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/1jnt73n/is_cinderaces_design_really_that_bad/,Is Cinderace's design really that bad?,"Genuine question because I have seen a lot of people share their dislike for Cinderace and its design ever since the game was first released, and neither back then nor now do I understand what that is about.

The main issue people seem to have is that Cinderace looks too humanoid, in terms of body shape and movement...

This has always confused me because Cinderace was designed to be a football playing Pokemon, as soon as I heard footballers would inspire Cinderace I instantly knew it would have to be very humanoid for this to even work, is that not what everyone else expected? If Cinderace had a more animalistic body shape I very much doubt it would be able to tie well into it being able to kick pyro balls the way a footballer would kick a football.

I understand everyone is entitled to their opinions I just don't understand it, I've also heard people say that they can't imagine a Pokemon like Cinderace living in the wild due to its likeness to a human and that it feels unnatural...

But yet I haven't heard similar complaints when it comes to other humanoid Pokemon (which have been around since Gen 1 mind you) such as Lucario, Incineroar, Greninja, Inteleon, Hitmonchan, Gothitelle, Lopunny, the entire Machop line, the entire Ralts line...

Now I get that some of these look somewhat less humanoid than Cinderace in their body shape, but again I refer back to the fact that Cinderace is supposed to be able to move like a human, specifically like footballers, and that just would not work if Cinderace was less humanoid similarly to the aforementioned Pokemon.

Can you imagine Lopunny, the other humanoid bunny Pokemon being able to do what Cinderace was designed to do?

I'm guessing no, because Lopunny's posture and body shape is not suitable to pull off such skills.

I've also heard people mention that there's an episode in the Anime where a Cinderace puts on clothes and looks pretty human.

I saw the image, and sure if you don't pay attention to Cinderace's head it looks like a person, but Cinderace's head is the most animalistic part of its body and for a good reason, since the rest of the body is humanoid the head is what shows you hey this is a bunny.

This argument however doesn't do it for me either since you could chuck clothes on any of the other humanoid Pokemon I've mentioned and they'd all look just as humanoid some maybe even moreso.

These are all the arguments I've heard about Cinderace's design, if I've missed any feel free to let me know.

The reason I make this post is because I love Cinderace as a Pokemon, it's become one of my favourites since sword and shield...

Maybe I'm biased because I love football, and I almost exclusively prefer the fire type starters over the water and grass types, so maybe I was always going to love Cinderace no matter what? I chose Cinderace as my starter during my playthrough and it was so fun to use, I love its signature pyro ball it was always so fun to use, and Cinderace was just the ace in my team in general, I built a balanced and strong team and tried to evenly level all my mons but Cinderace was always leaps and bounds above all my other mons.

And I don't think I'm alone in this I think a lot of you probably experience the same thing but when I go through a playthrough I always grow very fond of the mons I used in my team, so after my playthrough I liked Cinderace as a mon even more.

Look I get that some people may see Cinderace as furry-bait (trust me I don't like this side of humanoid mons either), and I know some people think it looks so humanoid that its creepy, but when I look at Cinderace I just see a cute little bunny guy, that yes may look unnatural in the wild, but is the kind of mon that you can kick a ball around with, or even take to a cafe in the morning when it's time for your morning coffee.",2,1743388452.0,PokemonSwordAndShield,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the beautiful game, where Verona's defense is tighter than a pair of skinny jeans on Thanksgiving, and Parma's attack is about as threatening as a kitten with a feather. This Serie A showdown promises to be a nail-biter, or perhaps more of a yawn-inducer, depending on your perspective.

Verona has been on a roll, winning two recent matches against formidable foes. Their defense is like a fortress, and with Parma's offense being about as potent as decaf coffee, Verona's backline should hold firm. However, Verona's offense is not exactly setting the world on fire, averaging just one goal per game at home. It's like they're trying to win games with the soccer equivalent of a whisper.

Now, let's talk odds. Verona is favored with prices hovering around 2.4 to 2.5 across various sportsbooks, while Parma is the underdog at around 3.0 to 3.2. The draw is also a tempting option at similar odds. But let's face it, betting on Verona to win outright is riskier than trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon.

The real value here lies in the total goals market. With Verona's defense and Parma's lackluster attack, the under 2.5 goals bet is as appealing as a warm bowl of pasta on a cold day. Odds for under 2.5 goals are around 1.73 to 1.98, depending on where you place your bet. It's a safer bet than trusting your uncle to cook the turkey on Thanksgiving.

So, if you're looking to make a smart wager, put your money on under 2.5 goals. And if you're feeling adventurous, maybe sprinkle a little on the draw. After all, in the world of sports betting, sometimes the underdog—or in this case, the under-goal—wins the day.

Looking at the photos, it does look closer to a burger than a normal sandwich. The omni sandwiches are just a dollar cheaper. So I guess the place is just pricey in general.

While supermarket shopping, I only buy meat and cheese alternatives when they're on sale. The meat in particular tends to be *pricey* for how much food you get. I'll just buy a bag of soya chunks instead of using frozen crumbles or meat. The problem with vegan alternatives is that they don't go on sale like omni products do.

I’m having a really hard time dealing with it.,"So I’m 25f, I work as a bartender/waitress. Been working at the same spot for 4 years. This guy is a regular customer, but I have considered him somewhat of a friend because the place I work at is really quiet and he comes in after work multiple days a week and we will talk until late at night, he also would bring me my favourite coffee every once in a while so anyways, I consider him a friend.

3 months ago, he asked me out on a date. I nicely said no, I explained I can’t date because I have mental health issues I still need to work through, which was the truth. I don’t even think it would be fair to someone for me to be in a relationship with them.
I think this was my first mistake because he took it as a suggestion and kept insisting he’d help me.

I still said no and he tried every time he came in to convince me, it’s really hard for me to stand up for myself or even say no to anyone but I finally got more firm from him stressing me out and told him I wasn’t going to date him.

A few weeks ago I was working, I’ve became really good friends with a guy at work (25m) who I told
About this and we were watching the hockey game while cleaning up, the guy i rejected came in and saw us talking and really weirdly started calling me a liar, said I was flirting with him and clearly not “unavailable”. He’s normally very friendly but it was not friendly at all.

Once when my car was in the shop he offered to give me a ride home, and since that night he’s came to my apartment twice. Once he came with dinner and said I couldn’t turn him down since he already bought it, then a week ago he came and I didn’t answer my door and he texted me saying he knew I was home because my car was outside. My friend (same friend from work) was over that night and opened it after that text and he sent me another one calling me a liar for saying I didn’t want a relationship, then came into the restaurant a few days later and apologized and said he was drinking and had a bad night and “needed me”.

I live in a very very cheap building that anyone can get into, so he can get straight to my door.

I don’t know how to make someone stop, my friend from work even thinks he’s creepy and won’t leave me alone at night anymore, he clocks out and sits in the restaurant for 3+ hours just because he’s worried about this guy.

I dont know if this is the right place to post, I dont use Reddit or socials, I just really don’t know what to do here tbh, he said I’ve always been “flirty” with him but I was really just doing my job and being chatty. We definitely became “close” to an extent but it was because he came in so much! 

He also told me I’m hurting him, because he’s feels like we connected and he never had that with anyone before, I feel kinda bad. I didn’t want to “lead anyone on” but I never saw him in a romantic way, he’s the same age as my dad. And what I said about not dating was never a lie either. 

Im just really stressed about all of it, I don’t have good social skills to begin with. A lot of social anxiety, and have never dated before. I don’t even really have a lot of friends, just my one friend from work. 

And him coming to my apartment also freaks me out a lot, I don’t really think he’d hurt me physically but him feeling comfortable enough to just show up there makes me think he thinks we’re a lot closer than we are.",1,1743387983.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1jnt1cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodService/comments/1jnt1cp/i_quit_my_hostess_job_after_4_shifts/,I quit my hostess job after 4 shifts,"This was about a year ago, for context I hadn’t ever worked in food service before, my only previous work experience was in retail as a cashier and I figured “I can work a register and handle customer service so it should be fine.” And I was also desperate as hell for a new job so when they hired me on the spot at the interview I was like hell yeah.

But from the beginning something felt so off about the job and I’m really not sure if I was just experiencing culture shock from being in a new work environment, or if the restaurant I worked at was just weird. 

First of all, gossip and shit talking was commonplace to an extent I had never seen. It wasnt just “this manager is really strict” it was “this waitress is really weird and annoying and she’s gonna try to befriend you so just smile and nod.” It all felt really immature. Through the gossip I also got the sense that the turnaround rate was pretty high which was another red flag. 

My first couple days were hell, its like despite the fact that it was my first time ever doing this job the waiters and managers got really bitchy when I made even tiny mistakes. If I accidentally double sat somebody or forgot to seat somebodys section, they’d be extremely condescending as if I had been working there for months and should know better. Despite how angry they were over my mistakes, they didn’t bother shadowing me to make sure I didnt fuck up even though it was my first week. They sometimes got annoyed when I asked for help on things. On my second or third day, to “redeem myself” for accidentally double seating her, one of the waitresses asked me to get the drink orders for her 6 top and I panicked because they all ordered coffees and nobody had told me where/how to get the coffee and when I went back and told the waitress this she got even more pissed off at me and made another hostess do it. I understand being annoyed by newbies fucking things up but I always tried to be patient and accommodating to new employees at my retail job cuz I know starting a new job can be scary, idk.

Another weird occurrence was one time my shift was over and I my replacement had already arrived so I went to the manager to let him know I was going to clock out (Since I was new a manager needed to sign off when I clocked out idk how it really worked) and he looked at me with utter confusion and a bit of offense(?) and said “why?” And I thought he was messing with me so I laughed awkwardly and said “Because my shift is over?” And with genuine annoyance he said “Alright whatever” and clocked me out. Did I say something wrong? We were pretty busy that day so like, was he expecting me to work past my shift to help out? 

And Im not sure if this is a normal restaurant thing cuz again Ive only done retail, but when I asked another hostess how breaks work (in the sense of like, do I get a 30 if I work 8 hours) she got really confused and said “like, smoke break? Sure I guess just use the back door and dont take too long” and I was like “no not smoke break, like, just a break?” And she was like “meal break? Oh yeah if u want to buy a meal just let a manager know and they’ll put in the order if we’re slow enough to justify it.” Is it normal to not get breaks in food service unless you buy yourself food during downtime? 

Generally it was just a really hostile/weird environment, I ended every shift on the verge of tears or wanting to slam my head into a wall,  so after my fourth shift I quit.

I need to know if my experience was commonplace in food service and I’m just being overly sensitive, or if that restaurant was just weird? Its totally possible that I was just taking things too personally and I’m not built for that kind of fast paced environment, but I wanted to ask this subreddit because I have no frame of reference except for my retail experience.

I miss you terribly. As It Was feels like a stab to the heart every time I hear it, but I can never bring myself to take it out of my playlists. It would feel like I'm committing to getting rid of a part of you. Maybe I need to. Not at the moment, though.

I hate knowing you're only an hour away, and I can't just drop by to see you anymore. I hate knowing your number is still on my phone and I can't just send you a funny meme I found because it reminds me of you. I hate that I can't ask about your day. I miss your voice, your laugh, the way that my soul felt immediate comfort just being around you.

It feels like there's a hole in my heart that was perfectly molded to fit you in, and now it's empty.

Without him I wouldn't be here and posting this. If you are going through this, or anything else just know there's someone who loves you more than anybody ever will on this earth and has given his life for you. Give him a chance and get to know him, cast your heavy burdens onto Him, the One who created you, and is so merciful and graceful, for even me the worst sinner that even though I have turned away from him and don't deserve none of this, He still gave his life for me. He loves you and is always waiting for you patiently!  

I am 29 have always been active and doing sports and I got a call from my doctor 2 months ago saying I have high cholesterol and I need to get on statins right away( Idk why it felt like he was trying to scare me even though I know he wants the best but nevertheless I gave into some fear and panic after that). I was always tired so all that the doctor told me kind of made sense.  I used to eat relatively well, but have been also indulging in to refined foods and meats, sugary foods and drinks, a lot of bread, a lot of eggs(although I know they are not bad but I used to eat them like crazy), sugary snacks, and just diet being all over the place. 

One day I came face to face with death( I had previously mild experiences like that but not to this scale). It was while I was driving to the hospital I was feeling shortness of breath feeling like I was almost winded, heaviness and pressure in my chest, nauseous, and feeling cold. I felt  so much anxiety and an impending doom about to happen( it has happened mildly while driving before, but it was before the doctor has told me I have high cholesterol). I thought the Lord will take me and I was freaking out I obviously didn't want to go so young and just felt like I haven't done nothing with my life, and I died in the car nobody can come help me so I was a lost cause. I called on the Lord, just wanting all this to go away. Then it came to me ""For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."" Everything I have is his. He has given me life and everything else like family etc, and it seemed like it might happen, but thank God for his grace and mercy I am still here to tell this. I have never faced death in this way before, it felt like life caught up to me and slapped me in the face, all the non stop hard work and for what? I realized everything we have here is vain, And I have wasted my life away. I called 911 to come and get me even though I was 10 min away from emergency. Then they found me and brought me to the hospital. It all seemed to be okay and when I glimpsed at a tv, it wrote slowly CALM DOWN. So I saw it as a sign from God to just chill out, but not just now but for all my life I have been running like the rat in the hamster wheel and non stop chasing money and something else that does not matter because once we go at the end the its all vain.

Fast forward to later and now, Praise the Lord, I have stopped eating everything bad( I went into a rabbit hole,I read books on cholesterol and all connection to diabetes(my mom has diabetes), books on diet like fiber fueled, grain brain,  the great cholesterol myth, why we get sick, wheat belly, the cholesterol con, deep nutrition, (there’s more) just everything I thought could help me understand why I have high cholesterol at 29 being active and eating relatively good at least 60 percent okay. I also had all kinds of stomach issues but that's a whole other post. I also listened to a lot of Barbara O’Neill. God gave me discernment and understanding of his wisdom, through Barbara and other places( people in my life, books, and life experiences) to learn that truly, truly if we give our bodies the opportunity to heal itself it will, if we give it the right circumstances. God made this absolutely amazing machine that even though we throw garbage at it non stop, it is resilient and can heal. He has given us food and everything from God is good and everything that is altered by humans is (not always) bad and done with bad intentions(money, big pharma, you know the deal).

It goes without saying obviously everyone is different so talk to your doctor about your situation. Also like Barbara always says we should be our own doctors too and listen to what our bodies tell us and last but most importantly the biggest doctor there is - Jesus Christ! Lean on him for the ultimate help.

My symptoms before were: Always tired, never rested, dry eyes, shortness of breath, a lot of mucus, always getting sick, acne all over my face, dry skin, constipation, a bit of fat but not overweight, almost always sore throat. All now gone or almost gone. I feel constant energy even though I drink no coffee. I sleep awesome, lost weight and can see my abs( I go to the gym a lot before and still now but I had a bit of fat still so couldn’t see it). The body is an amazing machine!

What I ate before: chocolates, chips, refined foods, fast food restaurants, overeating(gluttony), too much eggs, hot dogs, meal preps that I make relatively healthy and when I cook was also relatively healthy homemade cooked food, lots of coffee, sweets, late eating. Dairy, wheat and gluten( bread), artificial foods, alcohol

This is what I did ( let me know if you have any questions) to lower my cholesterol from 7.15 to 3.82 and my triglycerides from 1.42 to .37 and other good results in two months without any statins:

**What I eat now and throughout the two months:** every morning I water fast until noon, then I have my last meal before 8 pm. I try to eat without water right after or during meals. I drink wine sometimes but I haven’t drunk for a while now. I only eat whole plant based organic, gluten free, wheat and milk free foods. Absolutely nothing that has chemicals or is refined, no gluten no dairy and no wheat(it has been hybridized), no coffee although the first month I drunk lots of teas to taper off, I drink at least 3 litres of water a day and wake up and drink a bottle of water first thing in the morning. I eat Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and seeds. First month I ate some Salmon for omegas 6, but the second month no meat at all as I started a Daniel fast which I plant to stop on this Easter, this fast is in the Bible:

I eat:

* Fruits and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or dried without added sugar)
* Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats, barley)
* Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)
* Nuts and seeds (raw, unsalted)
* Healthy oils (olive, coconut, avocado—in moderation)
* Water is the only beverage allowed

I avoid:

* Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy
* Refined grains and white flour products
* Sugars, sweeteners, and desserts
* Processed foods, artificial additives, and preservatives
* Caffeine, alcohol, and sweetened beverages

Lifestyle changes: I have always done lots of sports so I still go to gym in the morning and play sports when I can, but now I have included just simple going out for a walk in the sun and it has been amazing. Hobbies like soccer, snowboarding, running, biking when I can, and just go see a movie by myself and enjoy life and my singleness by going to places alone.

## Key Features Analysis

the functionality and style of a glass coffee table hinges on several key elements. From the type of glass used, to the frame materials and overall design, understanding these features is essential to making the right choice for your needs.

**Glass Type and Thickness:**

The type and thickness of the glass are crucial for both aesthetics and safety. Tempered glass is the preferred choice due to its superior durability and ability to shatter into small, relatively harmless pieces rather of sharp shards. For coffee tables, a thickness of at least 8mm is recommended for optimal strength and stability. Premium tables often feature 10mm or even 12mm thick glass, providing an even more robust and luxurious feel. Some manufacturers also use laminated glass for added safety and noise reduction.

**Frame Material and Construction:**

The frame of a glass coffee table considerably impacts its overall style and structural integrity. Common frame materials include stainless steel, wood (solid wood or engineered wood), and metal alloys. Stainless steel offers a sleek,contemporary look and is highly resistant to corrosion. Wooden frames can provide a warmer,more traditional aesthetic,but require proper sealing and finishing to prevent moisture damage. Metal alloy frames offer a balance of strength and affordability. The construction method, whether welded, bolted, or glued, also affects the table's stability and longevity.

**Shape and Size:**

The shape and size of the coffee table should be carefully considered in relation to the size and layout of your living room. Common shapes include rectangular,square,round,and oval. Rectangular tables are versatile and work well in longer rooms, while square tables are ideal for smaller, more compact spaces. Round and oval tables promote a more relaxed and social atmosphere, as they allow for easier conversation. The height of the table should also be proportional to the seating arrangement, typically ranging from 16 to 20 inches.

**Weight Capacity and Stability:**

A glass coffee table's weight capacity determines how much weight it can safely support without compromising its structural integrity. It's essential to select a table with a weight capacity that meets your needs, especially if you plan to place heavy objects on it. The stability of the table is equally important, as a wobbly or unstable table can be both annoying and hazardous. Look for tables with adjustable levelers on the feet to compensate for uneven floors and ensure a stable surface.

**Design and Style:**

The design and style of the glass coffee table should complement the overall aesthetic of your living room. Modern designs often feature clean lines, minimalist frames, and obvious glass tops, while more traditional styles may incorporate ornate details, wooden accents, and tinted or frosted glass. Consider the color and finish of the frame, as well as the shape and thickness of the glass, to ensure that the table seamlessly integrates with your existing decor. Contemporary options often incorporate mixed media elements, combining glass with materials like concrete, stone, or even acrylic for a unique and artistic touch.

**Additional Features:**

Some glass coffee tables come with additional features that enhance their functionality and convenience. These may include built-in shelves or drawers for storage, adjustable height mechanisms, or even integrated USB charging ports. Consider whether these features are critically important to you and if they justify the added cost. Shelves can be useful for storing books, magazines, or remote controls, while drawers can provide concealed storage for smaller items. Tables with adjustable height mechanisms can be converted into dining or work surfaces.

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen glass coffee table can offer a multitude of benefits, enhancing the functionality, aesthetics, and overall atmosphere of your living space.

By allowing light to pass through, glass coffee tables can also brighten up darker spaces and create a more airy atmosphere.

**Versatile Style Integration:** Glass coffee tables are incredibly versatile and can seamlessly integrate with a wide range of decorating styles, from minimalist and contemporary to traditional and eclectic. The neutral nature of glass allows it to complement existing furniture and decor without clashing or overpowering the space.This makes them a safe and stylish choice for any living room.**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:** glass surfaces are relatively easy to clean and maintain, requiring only a quick wipe with a damp cloth or glass cleaner to remove dust, smudges, and fingerprints. Unlike wooden or upholstered furniture, glass is resistant to staining and water damage, making it a practical choice for households with children or pets. Tempered glass is also more scratch-resistant than regular glass, ensuring that your coffee table will maintain its pristine appearance for years to come.

**Improved Light Distribution:** The transparent nature of glass allows it to reflect and refract light, enhancing the brightness and ambiance of the room. Glass coffee tables can also help to distribute natural light more evenly throughout the space, reducing shadows and creating a more welcoming atmosphere. This is especially beneficial in rooms with limited natural light.

**Space-Saving Illusion:** Glass coffee tables create the illusion of more space, making them ideal for smaller living rooms or apartments. The transparency of the glass allows you to see through the table, creating a sense of openness and reducing visual clutter. This can make a small room feel larger and more inviting.

He initiated the split a year after we had our first child and five years of marriage. He lacked career ambition, didn’t contribute to chores, mishandled savings, and constantly complained about sex. I was the primary breadwinner, blindly supporting him until I went on maternity leave, suffered postpartum depression, and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.

The issues escalated when I stopped financially supporting him, asked him to help with chores, and requested he shorten his four-hour weekend video calls with his family (who live in another country). After an argument, he declared he’d never be my husband again due to “disrespect.”

We live in a co-op unit I spent years applying for. He refuses to move out, claiming his name is on the lease and that he contributes by buying groceries and paying for the internet—though in reality, he covers groceries only every other weekend and claims his credit card is maxed out. He does no cleaning, even in shared spaces like the kitchen and bathroom.

Our child bed-shares with me, and even when I’m sick, he refuses to help and leaves for work. He does, however, do bath time daily and spend time with our child on weekends. But weekends are exhausting—he monopolizes the kitchen and living room, keeps up his long family calls, and indirectly taunts me while on the phone. The age gap between us is made an issue and I am constantly berated for being older than him. I can’t even make myself a cup of coffee until he’s done.

I contacted the co-op, but unless he chooses to leave, we’d both have to vacate. I have savings, but I don’t want to drain them on an expensive lawyer—I need to think about my child’s future. I know he won’t leave or file for divorce because this setup benefits him financially.

I feel completely stuck and exhausted.

They treat people like they are inferior from them. They will ask someone else for something that they could have done by themselves AND they didnt understand other people's circumstances. In example, there were many times when my mom asked me or my brother (also in his 20s) to run some errands when we were busy from preparing exam or just had a long rough days from work and when we refused she would downplay it as us being lazy and just want to play with our phones and proceeds to threat us with ""if you dont treat your mom with respect you will never be successful"". Sometimes it could be as small as writing a phone number or calculating some $$$ when she had pen/notes and calculator right beside her. I am okay with helping my parents but at times i feel like i am being used as a housemaid. 
At times i cant hold any accountability on her. When i was still in my parents' house, she would tell me to do X. Few minutes passed and she would yell at me ""Why would you do X!"". When i told her that she told me to do so, she didnt believe it and accused me of making up things, even when my brother/dad supported what i said. Also I havent heard her saying sorry for idk how many years. 

And who else is doing this? You guessed it right, its my grandma! I dont grow up close with her because she lives far away from us with my grandpa but my yearly visit there really got me some headaches and i bet wont do any good to any sane person in long term. Since i was a kid, she has been telling others to do ""small things"", like grabbing her water, fetch her med, check in her room whether a certain thing is in her room or not when its not an urgent matter. It gets so bad to the point she would be ""(me), please check (thing) if its on my room's desk"" then in 15 seconda she would like ""can you make coffee too while you are on it?"" and when 3 minutes passed she would yell ""where the hell is (me), she takes too long! (Mom), call (brother)!"" or ""(Mom), can you check on (me)?"". It was so bad to the point normal people would think that she's bedridden but she is relatively healthy with no major illness/big surgery history. 
She also doesnt take accountability too. She would ask money from relatives but she didnt explain what this money is for and threw her kids under the bus when the kids didnt even know how this money was used. According to my dad, its been like that since he met my grandma. He told me that when i was still a toddler, grandma rushed to stand up from the dining table and she almost accidentally dropped a bowl of soup on me. He was pissed but my mom was angry at him because i ended up okay and he was just making things bigger than it should be. There are just too many things i wanted to tell regarding these two people but i will hurt my fingers if i told everything they did. 

If there are things i learned from them, it would be to avoid marriage and respect is gained. At the same time, i am wondering if i will end up repeating the cycle too. Few years ago my mom said she didnt want to bother her kids when she is old but my meetings with my mom from time to time proved that to be wrong and she gets closer day by day.

It’s been a stressful time, as anyone who’s returned to work after having a baby can relate to. My sleep schedule has been all over the place—my husband helps with the baby at night, but I still have to pump or feed, so sleep has been tough. Friday morning, I drove to work like usual, but I had eaten too little, drank way too much coffee, and was pumping throughout the day.

After work, I went to the store, then planned to pick up takeout on my way home. But... we never made it. I have almost no memory of what happened next. Somehow, I ended up parked at the end of my driveway and I woke up to a woman telling me to sit down, and a cop yelling at me. I was about two blocks from home, covered in cuts and scrapes, with no recollection of how I got there. I was telling them I was walking to my parents’ house, my childhood home (I was headed in that direction).

My husband was thankfully working from home and looked out the window to see my car parked and running with my son safely in in but me nowhere to be found. The neighbors pointed him down the street where all of the commotion was and he found me in the back of an ambulance, bleeding from my face but otherwise okay.

After a series of CT scans, an EEG and an MRI, everything came back normal, aside from some bruising where I hit my head. However, my D-dimer levels, blood pressure, and heart rate were elevated while I was in the emergency room.

For some context, I had a high-risk pregnancy with a mild placental abruption at delivery, and I was diagnosed with Wolf Parkinson’s White syndrome as a child (which, to my knowledge, was corrected).

I am lactose free unfortunately, and therefore the cow’s milk is the only one I can never taste when I make a drink for myself. I have tasted so many milks but never lactose.
I wonder how does skinny tastes compared to whole and if the flavour is noticeable at all when is combined with coffee. I assume a 8oz flat white will practically take over the flavour profile of the drink but if I make a 12 or 16oz, do you guys get the different taste between the skinny and whole? 
My question comes to the fact that I have made mistakes where I serve trim or whole to someone that ordered otherwise but never have I gotten any feedback. If it wasn’t because of me taking it back they probably wouldn’t realise. 
With plant milks is a whole different story because they have sooo much flavour even across different brands of the same plant source.

# Hydro Flask at Target (2025): Is It worth It? review & Cheaper Alternatives

The Hydro Flask water bottle. It's become more than just a container for your favorite beverage; it's a statement. A symbol of an active lifestyle, a commitment to sustainability, and, undeniably, a touch of style. You see them everywhere – on hiking trails, in yoga studios, perched on desks in offices, and, of course, prominently displayed in the aisles of your local Target. But in 2025, is snagging a Hydro Flask at target still the best move? This in-depth review explores the pros and cons, price considerations, and some compelling Hydro Flask option options to help you make the most informed choice.

## The allure of the Hydro Flask: Why the Hype?

Before diving into the Target specifics and alternative options, let's unpack the Hydro Flask obsession. Why has this particular stainless steel water bottle become such a cultural phenomenon? Several factors contribute to its enduring popularity:

   **Superior Insulation:** The core promise of a Hydro Flask is exceptional temperature retention. Thanks to its double-walled vacuum insulated design, a Hydro Flask keeps beverages cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. This is not just marketing speak; it's a real-world benefit appreciated by anyone who wants iced water on a scorching summer day or hot coffee during a chilly commute. This vacuum insulated water bottle engineering surpasses many competitors.
   **Durability:** Let's face it: life happens. Water bottles get dropped, bumped, and generally abused. Hydro Flasks are built to withstand the rigors of daily use. Made from pro-grade stainless steel, they resist dents, scratches, and, most importantly, corrosion. This durability makes them a reliable companion for outdoor adventures, gym sessions, or simply navigating a busy day. People searching for a durable water bottle will find that Hydro Flask offerings fit the bill nicely.
   **Sustainability:** In an increasingly eco-conscious world, ditching single-use plastic bottles is a priority for many. Owning a reusable Hydro Flask is a tangible way to reduce your environmental footprint. The brand itself emphasizes sustainability, further appealing to environmentally aware consumers. They promote using eco friendly water bottle designs instead of disposables.
   **Aesthetic Appeal:** functional doesn't have to mean boring. Hydro Flasks are available in a wide array of appealing hydro flask colors, from subtle neutrals to vibrant shining tones. The powder coated finish not only adds to the visual appeal but also provides a cozy grip. You can also customize hydro flask bottles to add that personal appeal.
   **Brand Reputation and Social Obligation:** Hydro Flask has cultivated a strong brand reputation built on quality, performance, and a commitment to giving back. Their ""Parks For All"" program, which supports public green spaces, resonates with consumers who value social responsibility.Buying a Hydro Flask feels like more than just purchasing a water bottle; it's supporting a company with a conscience.
   **Accessories Ecosystem:** The Hydro Flask experience extends beyond the bottle itself; a large range of Hydro Flask accessories are available, including different lids (straw lids, flex caps), slings, and cleaning supplies. This allows users to customize their bottle to suit their specific needs and preferences.

## Hydro Flask at Target: Convenience vs. Cost

Target offers a convenient and accessible entry point into the Hydro Flask world. You can browse the selection while doing your regular shopping, compare models in person, and take advantage of Target's return policy. But is it the most economical option?

   **Availability:** One of the biggest advantages of buying a Hydro Flask at target is simply the accessibility.Most Target stores carry a selection of Hydro Flask sizes and colors, especially popular models like the hydro Flask 32 oz and Hydro Flask 40 oz. This allows you to see and handle the bottles before purchasing, which can be helpful in making a decision.
   **Price Point:** Hydro Flask prices at Target generally align with the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).While this isn't necessarily a ""deal,"" it's a consistent and reliable price point. check for Hydro Flask deals and hydro flask sale prices, especially around holidays or promotional periods.
   **Selection:** The selection of Hydro Flasks at Target, though convenient, may be somewhat limited compared to the Hydro Flask official website or specialty retailers. You might not find all the limited-edition colors or specialized accessories at your local Target.
   **Promotions:** Keep an eye out for Target circle offers or other promotions that could lower the price of a Hydro Flask water bottle. Target frequently runs sales and offers discounts on various products, including water bottles.
   **return Policy:** Target's generous return policy provides peace of mind. If you're not wholly satisfied with your Hydro Flask, you can typically return it within a reasonable timeframe for a full refund. This is a critically important advantage over buying from certain online retailers.

## Navigating the Hydro Flask Lineup: Sizes, Mouths, and Lids

The Hydro Flask lineup can be a bit overwhelming at first. Understanding the different sizes, mouth options (wide mouth, standard mouth), and lid types is crucial to choosing the right bottle for your needs.   **Sizes:** Hydro Flasks are available in a range of sizes, from smaller 12oz bottles perfect for kids to larger 64oz growlers designed for sharing.The most popular sizes are the 32oz and 40oz, which strike a good balance between capacity and portability.
       **12oz - 24oz:** Ideal for shorter trips,kids,or those who prefer a lighter bottle. Easier to fit in smaller bags and car cup holders.
       **32oz:** A very popular choice for everyday use. Holds a good amount of water without being too bulky.
       **40oz:** Great for long hikes, workouts, or anyone who wants to stay hydrated throughout the day without constant refills.
       **64oz:** Primarily used as a growler for beer or other beverages. Good for sharing or keeping a large volume cold.
   **Mouth Options:**
       **Wide Mouth:** The wide mouth hydro flask is easier to fill with ice and clean. It's also compatible with a wider range of accessories, such as straw lids and filter attachments. This is generally the most popular choice.
       **Standard Mouth:** The standard mouth is narrower, making it easier to drink from without spilling. Some people prefer it for hot beverages.
   **Lids:** Hydro Flask offers a variety of lids to suit different preferences:
       **Flex Cap:** The standard lid, featuring a comfortable carrying loop and a leak-proof design.
       **Straw Lid:** Provides easy, flip-up access to your drink. Ideal for workouts or situations where you can't tilt the bottle.
       **Sport Cap:** A high-flow,bite-valve lid designed for active pursuits.
       **Coffee Flip Lid:** Designed specifically for hot beverages, with a leak-resistant flip closure.

## Hydro Flask Alternatives: Cheaper and Just as Effective?

While Hydro Flasks are undoubtedly high-quality products, their premium price point can be a barrier for some. fortunately, numerous hydro flask alternative options offer comparable performance and durability at a lower cost. Here are a few considerations and popular brands:

   **Consider Your needs:** Before exploring alternatives, clarify your specific needs and priorities. Do you need the absolute best insulation performance, or are you willing to compromise slightly for a lower price? Are you especially concerned about weight, size, or specific features like a straw lid?
   **Popular Alternatives:**
       **yeti:** yeti products are the closest competitor to Hydro Flask in terms of quality and price. Yeti water bottles offer excellent insulation and durability but often come with a similar or slightly higher price tag. The ""hydro flask vs yeti"" debate is common, coming down to personal preference regarding aesthetics and specific features.
       **Takeya:** Takeya offers a range of insulated stainless steel water bottles that are generally more affordable than Hydro Flask. They provide good insulation and durability and come in a variety of colors and sizes.
       **Simple Modern:** Simple Modern bottles are a budget-friendly option that still delivers respectable performance. They offer a wide variety of styles, colors, and sizes.
       **Iron Flask:** Iron Flask is another popular alternative that focuses on durability and affordability. They are made from stainless steel and offer good insulation properties.

   **Price Comparison:** When comparing prices, be sure to consider the size and features of the bottles. Look for sales and discounts to maximize your savings.
   **Read Reviews:** Before making a purchase,read reviews from other customers to get a sense of the real-world performance and durability of the alternative water bottles. Pay attention to comments about insulation, leaks, and overall build quality.
   **Insulated Tumbler options:** Consider stainless steel insulated tumbler options for coffee or tea. Many brands, in addition to Hydro Flask, offer tumblers with excellent heat retention. A hydro flask coffee mug could be replaced with comparable items.

## Beyond Water: Exploring the Extended Hydro Flask Ecosystem

The appeal of Hydro flask extends beyond just water bottles. The brand offers a range of insulated products designed to keep your food and beverages at their optimal temperature,wherever you go.

   **Insulated Food Jars:** Hydro flask food jars allows you to bring hot soups, stews, or cold salads on the go without worrying about them losing their temperature. These are perfect for school lunches, picnics, or hiking trips. Keeping your food hot or cold in a Hydro Flask food jar is a great option.
   **Growlers:** As mentioned earlier, Hydro Flask growlers are ideal for transporting and sharing beer or other beverages. They keep the contents cold and carbonated for extended periods.
   **Sling Accessories:** The Hydro Flask sling is a convenient way to carry your water bottle hands-free. It's especially useful for hiking, traveling, or other activities where you want to keep your hands free. A hydro flask sling or alternatives can be a good investment.

## Caring for Your Hydro Flask: Cleaning and Maintenance

To ensure the longevity and optimal performance of your Hydro Flask water bottle, proper cleaning and maintenance are essential.

*   **Regular Cleaning:** Wash your Hydro Flask regularly with warm,soapy water. Use a bottle brush to clean the inside thoroughly.*   **Deep cleaning:** For tougher stains or odors, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or vinegar and water. Let the solution sit in the bottle for a few hours before scrubbing and rinsing.   **Lid cleaning:** Disassemble the lid and clean each part separately. Pay particular attention to the straw and silicone gaskets, as these can accumulate bacteria.
   **Avoid the Dishwasher (Usually):** While some Hydro Flask parts might potentially be dishwasher-safe, it's generally recommended to hand wash the bottle to prolong its lifespan and prevent damage to the powder coating. Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific guidance.
   **Proper Storage:** Store your Hydro Flask with the lid off to allow it to air dry completely.This will help prevent the growth of mold and bacteria.
    **Register Hydro Flask:** Registering your product allows you to take maximum advantage of the Hydro Flask warranty.

## The Verdict: Is a Hydro Flask at Target Worth It in 2025?

Ultimately, the decision of whether to buy a Hydro Flask at Target depends on your individual needs, preferences, and budget. If you value convenience, the ability to see the product in person, and a hassle-free return policy, then Target is a solid option. However, if you're looking for the absolute best price or a wider selection of colors and accessories, it may be worth exploring other retailers or considering a reputable Hydro Flask alternative.

Whether you choose a Hydro Flask or a comparable brand, investing in a high-quality, reusable water bottle is a smart choice for your health, your wallet, and the surroundings.Make sure you keep yourself hydrated by any means necessary!

1jnseq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jnseq1/i_brought_something_home_with_me_from_my_trip_to/,I brought something home with me from my trip to Europe. (Part 1),"When I graduated college, my friends and I decided to go on a trip to both celebrate our accomplishment and mourn the fact that we were officially leaving adolescence and entering the ”real world”. We decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe as it seemed to be the only place that we could all agree on and was perfectly cliche for a group of (former) college students. We were all experienced hikers and had traveled virtually everywhere in the U.S., so we thought Europe would be a nice change of scenery. Not a lot of planning went into our trip, we just had a vague idea of what we wanted to do. Fly into Denmark, end up in Switzerland, staying in youth hostels along the way. We had set aside a month for the entire trip so we weren't stressed about having a coordinated agenda or planned stops, we just wanted to get drunk at every bar and do things that caught our interest along the way. 



The beginning of our trip went as expected. We flew into Copenhagen and immediately went out to the nearest bar. For the next month, we made our way south through Hamburg, to Hanover, to Frankfurt, and finally to Zurich. Our trip was filled with hiking, drinking, sightseeing, and a few drug-fueled experiences that now seem hazy in my memory. Everything was what I was expecting from the trip until we got to Zurich. When doing the little planning we did before embarking, the one thing that we did plan was our flights. When we arrived in Zurich, it was a few days before our scheduled return flight home. Being at the end of a month-long bender, none of us really felt like continuing partying and decided to go on a short hike in the Swiss Alps before our return trip. 



Not all of us went on the hike. Out of the 5 in total who went on the trip, only 3 including me decided they wanted to see the alps. The two who went with me were my friends Henry and Kyle. To get to the alps, we had to ride a train for about 2 hours. The image of the mountains towering over me as we stood at their base is imprinted in my mind. The smell of the fir trees, the quiet ambience only interrupted by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the leaves. It was truly serene, and Henry, Kyle, and I silently agreed to not disturb the peace with conversation as we started our way up the trail. Even though we were experienced hikers, we were not planning on climbing to the summit of any mountain, but as we continued down the trail at relatively the same altitude, it got cold. Very cold. 



“Do you guys also feel chilly?” Henry asked us.



I turned around to see him shivering in his t-shirt and shorts.



“Yeah it feels like way colder than when we started.” I replied.



We had set out for our day trip at around 11:00 AM and had only been hiking for about an hour, so it should have been getting warmer if anything. We didn’t really think anything of it as we all had sweaters in our backpacks for when it got chilly at night. In Switzerland the temperature in June, when we were there, is around 55 degrees Fahrenheit at the coldest, but we could tell it was getting much colder than that. Still, we decided to keep going since the route we were taking would take around 8 hours to complete, putting us back at the base of the mountain at around 7:00 PM, just before the sun set. About an hour later, clouds started to move in, blocking out the sun and making it even colder. The wind was picking up too, adding to the already plummeting temperature. I could tell that it was easily close to, if not already, freezing now. When we set out this morning, the forecast said that it would be sunny all day, with no clouds in the sky. 



“Guys, maybe we should just turn back now. It’s getting really cold and it looks like it might rain.” Kyle said. 



“Yeah it's getting mad uncomfortable and I don’t want to be cold and soaked.” Henry added.



“Yeah alright, let’s head back. I'm cold as hell too.” I agreed.

“Let me just take a piss real quick, I’ve been chugging water all morning.”



I was disappointed that our excursion didn’t go as planned, but was looking forward to getting out of the cold. I went off the path to relieve myself behind a tree. After finding a nice pine, I unzipped and did my business. Looking up, I noticed a strange symbol carved into the tree slightly above my head. It looked like an owl head with a cross marked in its forehead. I figured somebody got bored doing what I was doing right now and decided to doodle it into the tree, maybe hoping to scare the next pisser. I zipped back up and headed back to the trail to meet up with my fellow hikers, but when I got back to the trail I didn’t see them. 



“Guys?” I said, slightly above my normal talking volume.

“Alright, very funny guys!” I shouted.

“I guess y’all are gonna jump out and scare me now?”



No response.



“Guys?” I tried again, looking around to see if I just didn’t see them when I was walking back. 



I was only met with the howl of the wind and the swaying of the trees. Without any other explanation, I told myself that Henry and Kyle just ditched me as a prank and already started back to the trail head. It felt wrong to me though, I knew that they wouldn't do that to me, especially since we were hiking in a new place and the weather was so rapidly degrading. They wouldn’t leave me alone, even as a joke. I swallowed this doubt and started back towards the foot of the mountain, determined to save myself from the cold and hoping to find my friends along the way. 



Throughout the afternoon, the clouds above me grew denser, darker, until it felt like dusk. Trudging through the cold, windy afternoon it felt like knives were striking my skin every time the wind picked up, tearing my skin apart. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, I checked my watch to gauge how far I was from the trail head and the sweet warmness of the train ride home. It read “2:53 PM”. We had turned around at about 1:00 PM and had started at 11:00 AM, so I should be reaching the beginning of the trail soon I figured. As I read the numbers on my watch, a white flake landed right on the time display. I picked it up with my finger and it melted almost instantly. I looked up to see hundreds of snowy, white flakes falling from the deep, dark gray sky. A feeling of panic and dread filled my stomach. 



“How could it be snowing in the middle of June?” I thought to myself.

“Thank God I’m almost out of here.”



I was hoping with everything in my being that Henry and Kyle would be waiting for me when I got back, standing next to the warm train, waving me inside. However, as I continued down the path, my hope slowly evaporated. I walked for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, still no trail head in sight.



“I should be right by the train by now.” I told myself.

“Did I walk the wrong way when I finished pissing earlier? Did I somehow go back to the wrong trail? Where am I?”



I was starting to panic. Snow was still falling and each crunch under my boot slowly weathering my assurance that I would see my friends or the train again. My feet and my legs were growing numb. I had nothing but my shorts and a sweater to protect me from the unforgiving cold. Still, I kept walking. Eventually, the clouds grew so dark I had to take out my flashlight so I could see the path better. I looked down at my watch, expecting it to be close to sunset. “4:12 PM” it read. I figured even if I did walk the wrong way, I would still end up at the trailhead by 7:00 PM since that’s how long the entire hike would have taken. I continued, each minute growing more and more scared of the reality I was in. Snow was building on the ground, the wind and the cold had still not given up. Each minute had the weight of a freight train, pounding into my body. Luckily, I wasn’t entirely stupid and had packed food and water for the journey, so I would still have my strength to continue. As the afternoon turned into the evening, 7:00 PM came and went and the trailhead was still nowhere in sight. My panic grew with each step I took. It was pitch black now, almost a complete absence of light. We weren’t expecting to stay the night up here, so I hadn’t packed a tent or many camping supplies, just a sleeping bag. 



I started coming to terms with the fact that I would probably have to spend the night out here in nothing but a thin sleeping bag when I saw a light up ahead of me. I felt my heart skip a beat, thinking it was another hiker. At least I won’t be out here alone. Maybe they had some camping gear or at least extra clothes so I wouldn’t freeze to death. However, as I made my way towards the beckoning light, it turned into multiple lights, yellow and warm. I finally got in range to tell what it was, not another hiker, but a cabin. I didn’t have time or the luxury to think about all the warnings I was given by Grimm’s fairy tales in my youth to think twice about approaching this lone cabin in the middle of the Swiss Alps. As I quickly walked towards the cabin, I thanked God with every step and thought about the warmth that would bathe me as I entered the cabin. The cabin appeared rustic, like Paul Bunyan built it himself. There was a big, cast iron knocker on the door. I reached to pick it up to knock, but the door flew open before I even touched it. Greeting me was a tiny, old woman. 



“What are you doing out there in the cold?” She asked in a sweet, comforting voice.

“Come in sweetie, you’re gonna freeze to death!”



“Thank you so much.” I blurted out as I quickly entered the safe haven of the cabin. 



The crackling of a fire met my ears at the same time its warmth covered me. A flood of relief entered my body and mind with the assurance that I would not freeze to death tonight. This only lasted for a minute as I was reminded of Henry and Kyle.



“Are my friends here? Have you seen them?” I automatically asked.



“No, sweetheart, you’re the only soul we’ve seen.” The old woman said with concern in her voice.

“Come in dear, sit down, do you want some coffee? Tea?” 



“Sure, uh coffee please. You’re sure you haven’t seen anyone else tonight?”



I wandered over to the fireplace and sat down on the old sofa, next to the rocking chair. As I glanced over to the chair, I was shocked to see an old man occupying it. I hadn’t seen him when I entered.



“Positive, dear. Your friends probably had enough sense to get off the mountain when it started snowing.” She chuckled.

“What are you doing on the mountain in this weather anyway?”



“I got turned around and couldn’t find my way back to the trailhead.” I said as she handed me my coffee.

“I’m glad I found this place, I thought I was gonna freeze to death for a minute out there.” I took a sip of the coffee. It felt like ecstasy as it dripped down my throat, warming my insides.

“Is it normal for it to snow like this in the middle of June?”



“I remember only one time since I’ve lived here that it’s snowed in Summer. It was many many years ago, when I was about your age. As you can tell I’m not from here,” She smiled.



It hadn’t occurred to me when I was being rescued from the icy cold, but she spoke with an American accent. 



“Oh yes, now that you mention it.” I said between sips of coffee.

“Where are you from?”



“I’m from a little town in Kansas called Columbus. I moved here right after I finished college. I met my dear husband over there on a trip me and my friends took and I’ve been in love with him ever since.” She smiled at her husband who in return continued to rock in his chair as if he hadn’t heard a word that was said.



“That’s sweet” I said to break the silence. 



“Even after all these years he refuses to learn English.”



The old man continued to stare blankly at the fire and rock back and forth in his chair.



“Could I use your phone? To call the park rangers about my friends. I haven’t been able to get cell service since I got to the mountains.” 



“Oh we don’t have a phone dear, we don’t use any electricity here. I’m really sorry about your friends, but you’re welcome to stay here tonight and I’m sure Wilhelm here will go with you in the morning to look for them.” She gestured to her blank husband.



“Oh uhh ok. Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I said with a concerned tone to my voice.



I finished my coffee and after a hot shower, the old lady led me to their guest room where I’d be staying the night. As I crossed the hall from the bathroom to the bedroom, I could see into the living room, Wilhelm was still rocking in his chair, staring at the fire. As I laid down in the bed, I could feel an itch in my throat, you know the kind you get before you get sick. I figured being out in the freezing cold for so long would probably give me something so I just took a preemptive ibuprofen from my backpack and laid down to sleep. 



That night, I awoke with terrible chills and my head pounding. The blanket that was draped over me was drenched with sweat. The ibuprofen I took before sleeping was the last one in my pack, so I wandered out of the bedroom, across the hall to the bathroom in search of more painkillers. I turned on the water and splashed some on my face. Opening the medicine cabinet, I was greeted with a very odd assortment of jars. They were filled with what looked like herbs and fungi. I figured since these people didn’t have electricity, they were probably the kind who grew their own natural remedies as well. The jars had labels on them that specified what they were and what they did. I searched for one marked painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Sure enough, there was one with just that inscribed with sharpie and masking tape. It had the appearance of some sort of mushroom. Cracking it open, a sharp and vulgar odor hit my nostrils. It smelled like burnt rubber. The scent immediately caused me to think twice about taking whatever this was. However, being in immense pain guided my decision more than the hideous smell of the mushroom. I made sure to write down the name of it before taking it though, so I could research it after rejoining civilization. When the fungi hit my tongue, the taste hit me like a truck, it was much worse than the smell and caused me to gag before choking it down. 



I drank an ample amount of water to try and wipe the memory of the taste from my mouth, but it persisted. The effects of the strange medicine were immediately noticeable. My body began to tingle and I became dizzy. Walking out of the bathroom to the bedroom, I took another look down the hallway to the living room and stopped dead in my tracks. The old man was no longer sitting in his chair. I could see only half of his body as the doorframe cut off my view from the rest of him, but I could tell that he was naked. I slowly made my way down the hallway towards the living room. The rest of the man’s body was revealed as I got closer and my viewpoint was no longer obstructed by the door frame. The old man was right in front of the fire, facing towards it. I continued into the living room.



“Hey dude, are you alright?” I said with a nervous quiver in my voice.



He muttered something quietly in German I assume, but I couldn’t hear what it was. Something about him caught my attention though and when I saw it, my stomach dropped. On the man’s left shoulder was the symbol of an owl with a cross on its forehead, the same one I had seen on the tree. The room started to spin, I got lightheaded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was back in the bedroom, lying down on the bed. The only light provided in the room was coming from the hallway. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t. It felt like in those dreams where you try to run, but you can’t, your body is too heavy. As much as I tried, I couldn’t move. My struggle was interrupted by several people entering my room. I could only see their silhouettes created by the warm, yellow light peering in through the doorway. Counting them, there were upwards of 15 people, all of them nude. Among them, I could make out the elderly couple. I tried to speak and ask them what was going on, but I couldn’t. They slowly gathered on either side of the bed and began to raise their arms above me. Once their arms were perpendicular to their bodies, they slowly got down on their knees. I could feel their cold touch all over me. Their hands were wet with some liquid that I can only assume was vinegar, as the smell was overpowering. All of a sudden, it felt as though the bed underneath me had dropped and I had the sensation of falling, like my chest was tied to an anvil and there was nothing below to stop it. My eyes rolled back into my head and my nervous system became overwhelmed.



I awoke what I presume to be the next morning to the pleasant touch of the sun warming my face. Immediately shooting up, I expected to see the mysterious figures from the night before, but I was shocked to find that I was laying in a patch of grass, my backpack to my right. It was a typical June day, the sun beaming down beating on my face. Warm, warmer than usual. No snow or any sign of snow around. My illness was seemingly gone, but I still felt drained from whatever happened. Shakily making my way to my feet, I scanned my surroundings, seeing that I was near a trail, but no cabin in sight. I put on my pack and walked towards the trail. The surroundings felt familiar, the rocks, the trees. As I approached the trail, the owl symbol I had seen earlier beamed from the tree, capturing all of my attention. I stopped mid-step and stared at the symbol, processing exactly what this meant. Questions raced through my mind. Had the occupants of the cabin carried me all the way back here? Had I gone in a big circle? Had I gone anywhere at all in the first place? I put my concerns to the side and turned my attention to what I wanted most at this point, to go home. I started down the path in the direction of where I initially thought the trailhead to be, determined to find it this time. After about 20 minutes of walking, I heard something out in the distance. 



“Trent! Treeent!”

I recognized the voice immediately. I quickened my pace toward the source of the shouting. 



“Henry!” I shouted in return.



Rounding the corner of the trail, I almost wept when I saw Henry and Kyle walking towards me. When they saw me, they began to run towards me while I stood frozen, awash with relief. 



“Where the fuck have you been dude?” Kyle said when they finally got close. 



“You wouldn’t believe it man, there was this cabin and these old naked people and I woke up in the grass and– wait what about you guys, where the fuck have *you* been.” 



“We’ve been looking for you dude, you disappeared yesterday after you went to go take a piss.” Henry said with frustration in his voice.



“No, you guys disappeared.” I retaliated.



“We’ve been shouting your name for the past 24 hours, walking up and down the trail. Where did you go?” Kyle asked.



“I tried walking back to the trailhead, I figured you guys ditched me as a joke or something and went on without me. How did y’all survive the snow, you guys didn’t pack tents or anything right?”



“What snow?” Henry asked, with a confused look on his face.



I returned his look with one of equal confusion.



“The snow. It started snowing yesterday after we split up.”



“What do you mean man?” Kyle chuckled.

“After we split up it got hotter, dude. It’s June, there’s not gonna be any snow up here.”



I explained the rest of my night to my friends, the cabin, the old couple, the ritual that was performed on me, but they didn’t believe me. They figured I was either lying or took too many mushrooms and had a bad trip or something. In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure what happened to me was real either, God knows I didn’t want it to be. 



We made our way back to the trailhead and after about an hour and a half were sitting on a train on our way back to Zurich. The suite was quiet the whole way back. We were all fatigued from this trip and were looking forward to being home. I was resting my head on the window sill, trying to somehow find sleep after the horrific experience I had just endured. I was recounting the events that happened in the cabin when I suddenly remembered writing down the name of the fungus that I took before everything happened. I pulled out the slip of paper it was scribbled on as well as my phone and quickly googled “Mycoterra Maleficium”. I tapped on the wikipedia article for it and scrolled through. “Should not be ingested, could cause hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and diarrhea. Known for being the substance ingested during the 1974 mass suicide of the Black Dawn cult.” This was deeply concerning to say the least, I could feel myself start to sweat and my heart beat increase. How could I be that stupid to take a mushroom that I found in a stranger's house? I was livid with myself, but that was quickly replaced with fear. I clicked on the link for the Black Dawn on wikipedia and nearly dropped my phone when the page loaded. What else was going to greet me but the same owl symbol from the tree and the man’s back.

My experience on a civil case, just sharing in case others want to know what to expect. Feel free to add your experience as well.

Based on a 3 week civil trial at municipal court with Judge Helson and Bailiff Shannon Raymond:

Selection: received a survey to fill out, submitted it, and was scheduled for a 4 hour zoom selection with about 30 other jurors. They ask questions on your beliefs on a few relevant topics and have you sign off to await further instruction. Was notified via email at the end of that day that I’d been selected and I reported to jury duty the next day.

Logistics: you get paid $10 per day plus a small stipend for mileage. There’s a garage two blocks away and they’ll validate your parking. You can also lock a bike up there.

Breaks and lunch: There’s a lobby type area with WiFi, a fridge and tables you can hang out in during lunch break (1.5 hours per day) but otherwise you have to stay in a holding room with your fellow jurors when you’re not in court. The holding room has a bathroom, coffee pot and tea. You get mini breaks (10-15 min each) from trial in the holding room 2-4 times a day on top of the lunch break. I recommend bringing snacks for the mini breaks. You can have a drink in the courtroom. 

What to bring/wear: You can wear casual clothing or business casual in court (ex: jeans and sweatshirt is fine). No hats. You have to pass through metal detectors to get in the court house but you can bring laptops, food, liquids, etc. They are just checking for dangerous items. The security line takes about 5 minutes to get through. 

Trial: depends on how many witnesses are called and how long deliberations take. In a civil case in WA, jurors can ask questions by submitting them to the judge so that can also extend the length of the trial. They ask you to be there for a date range that they think is on the long end, but you may end early. Court is 9am-4pm, Monday - Thursday. The only reason you need to come to court on a Friday is if your deliberations have started and fall on a Friday. Some people (2 of 14 in my case) will be released as alternates right before the deliberations and will be sent home early.

This is a follow up to my AU with Coffee-Addict Circle. 

Miss Thavel is a 37-year-old German who teaches English. Despite having her menacing and sharp Wendigo claws on display at all times, she’s surprisingly quite sweet and kind, unlike Circle. She barely says cuss words unless she’s scared or super mad and only kills on special occasions, like if a misbehaving student is taunting her for her appearance. 

Ah, yes, her appearance! She has braces because I thought it add to the nerdiness and she also has the same glasses as Circle because I thought it looked cute. 

  
And, if you’re wondering why that heart is there with circle in it, well, thats because Thavel secretly likes, rather loves, Miss Circle. But, Miss Circle unfortunately has her heart set on someone else, Miss Bloomie, which makes Thavel envy Bloomie and act hostile around her at times.

""Mr. Henderson,"" droned an officious-looking alien with twelve eyes and a coffee mug labeled *World’s Best Chrono-Inspector*, ""you are being charged with 37 counts of **reckless timeline manipulation**.""

Frank blinked. ""Uh… I think you got the wrong guy.""

The alien sighed and pressed a button. A holographic display flickered to life, showing Frank ordering coffee at different moments in history.

""Observe: You went to 1842 and ordered a **caramel macchiato** from a saloon in Missouri. That **singlehandedly** led to the invention of *hipster* culture **150 years too early**.""

""That… seems unlikely.""

The alien ignored him. ""Then, in 1972, you visited a **diner in New York** and requested an *oat milk latte*. Oat milk was *not* supposed to be discovered until **2089**!""

Frank raised a hand. ""Okay, but—""

""Lastly,"" the alien interrupted, switching to another projection, ""you traveled to 17th-century France and asked for a *pumpkin spice latte*. The king was so confused he **accidentally declared war on Italy.**""

Frank winced. ""Yeah… I’ll admit, that one got out of hand.""

The alien rubbed his temples. ""Do you have *any* idea how much paperwork **timeline corruption** causes?""

Frank gulped. ""Okay, okay! I’ll behave. No more historical coffee runs!""

The alien nodded. ""Good. Now, sign this **official Chrono-Pledge**, promising you’ll never disrupt the past for something as trivial as overpriced caffeine.""

Frank sighed and signed.

""Great!"" The alien grinned. ""Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to grab a **triple-shot nebula espresso** from *Medieval Rome* before my shift ends.""

Well lets discard Nina and Anna, they are (not that successful) assassins and King is a good guy.

Also discard Reina. Yeah Reina is Queen in spanish and King and Queen sounds cool but other than that, not a good fit.

Marduk: Is King gay? I don’t know but we can’t discard it. I think him and Marduk are in good terms now but a relationship would be just too much. I would say not a good fit.

Lucky Chloe: well they both have tails but other than that, the personalities are just too different. About Kunimitsu, they both wear masks but still think it shouldn’t feel like a good match.

Now moving to the taken category.

Jun: she probably only have eyes for Kazuya, plus I bet King is not into milfs.

Xiaoyu: she only cares romantically for Jin probably.

Alisa: I guess she got feeling for Lars, plus I don’t think King is into robots.

Christie Monteiro: is she with Eddy? Unsure about that.

Now to the automatic no category:

Lili and Asuka are minors, so thats a no.
Panda is an animal, King might use a jaguar mask but thats it.

Now into the potentially a good match category:

Josie: he can help her get more confidence and a good guy like King deserves that good pair of tits. Although still unsure if its a good match.

Armor King: again, we don’t know if King is gay. They share the wrestling passion and maybe they could do feline sounds in bed. Who knows? Still feel unsure about if its a good match.

Lidia: well King is like 30-31 years old and Lidia is probably around that age too. Lidia is like the most jacked female on the roster and King is jacked too. They both value justice and are overall good persons.

Azucena: they both speak spanish. They are both young and King does like coffee too.

Julia: well they share the wrestling interest and they are both into good causes.

I’ll say Julia, Azucena and Lidia could be the best choices.

However, she has not spoken to us in over 3 weeks due to the fact that we told her she can’t bring her step-sisters cat with her when she moves out.  Our reasons were: it’s not her cat, she has not cared for the cat in any way (feeding, changing the litter etc) and although that cat is her favourite, it wouldn’t be fair to the cat since all it’s known is a full house with other animals, two of whom she is bonded to.

She got upset and used this as a reason to unleash on her father a tirade of all of his failings as a father going back to her early childhood.  And how we don’t care about what she wants, needs, etc.  This was all through text btw.  We have tried to talk to her since but she has not even acknowledged our presence.  During this time, we have continued to let her know when supper is ready, my husband makes her coffee in the morning and she continues to have full access to one of our cars. Basically enjoying all the perks of living under our roof but not having the common decency or maturity to have a minimal amount of respect for us.   

I am now of two minds - either grin and bear it for the next 6 weeks or other than still providing a roof over her head, and food in the fridge, provide nothing else.  No car, no coffee, no meals prepared for her.  She wants to act like we don’t exist then she doesn’t need any of the benefits.

1jns2xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tobias_flying/comments/1jns2xo/opacity_the_curious_case_of_the_absent/,Opacity: The Curious Case of the Absent Transparency.,"The old lawyer’s name was Jerry Blight. A man of principle. A man of ulcers. He’d spent forty years in litigation, wading chin-deep through bullshit with a polite smile and a pocket copy of the Rules of Civil Procedure. He thought he’d seen everything—until he retired, bought a recliner with lumbar support, and made the fatal mistake of logging on to Facebook.



It wasn’t long before he noticed something peculiar. Not the usual cat memes or pictures of high school friends whose faces now looked like melting wax. No, this was deeper. Darker. Stupider.



It started with one post: a poorly Photoshopped image of a Democratic Congresswoman posing with a gold-plated toilet and the caption, \*“Your tax dollars at work!”\* It had over 14,000 likes, 6,000 shares, and not a single comma.



Jerry sighed. Then he read the comments. That was his second mistake.  



\*“They all get rich in office! Insider trading, bribes, payoffs! Look it up, she made $12 million last year off Pfizer stock!”\*



He didn’t know who “she” was. He doubted they did either. But they sure were angry.



At first, Jerry tried to argue. He cited the Ethics in Government Act. He linked to the STOCK Act. He even quoted 5 U.S.C. app. § 101 et seq. like it was some ancient spell to ward off ignorance.



But arguing with the internet was like trying to staple Jell-O to a jet engine. The more he tried to inject reason, the more the memes multiplied. Biden with demon eyes. Pelosi bathing in champagne. AOC riding a flaming Tesla paid for with “YOUR MONEY.”



Eventually, Jerry cracked.



“Fine,” he muttered one morning over black coffee and the smell of defeat. “Let’s do this the hard way.”



Thus began The Great Transparency Project.



He was going to pull every financial disclosure from every sitting Member of Congress, paste the raw data into easy-to-read charts, and once and for all shut down the accusations of illicit wealth, stock profiteering, and taxpayer-funded yachts.



Because facts mattered. Because democracy mattered. Because he was losing sleep and yelling at his microwave.



He found the official site easily enough—\[https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov\](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov)—and even felt a glimmer of hope. They had zip files. They had metadata. They had a search form. He clicked “View Disclosure.”



That was when he met his nemesis.



\> \*“Requested Resource Not Found.”\*



He blinked. Clicked again.



\> \*“Requested Resource Not Found.”\*



Jerry stared at the screen. The cursor blinked back. Mocking him.



“This… this has to be a mistake,” he said aloud, as if speaking to the site would jog its memory.



He checked the source code. He opened the developer console. He sent a polite inquiry to the Clerk of the House.



Days passed. The response came in PDF format.



\> “We are aware of technical issues affecting the availability of certain reports and are working diligently to resolve them. In the meantime, you may request individual reports by submitting Form 92B-E in triplicate to the Legislative Resource Center (Room 135 Cannon House Office Building), Monday through Thursday, between 9:00 AM and 11:15 AM.”



Jerry printed the form. He stared at it. Then he made himself a martini.



He never filled it out.



Instead, he posted a single image to his own social media. A screenshot of the “Requested Resource Not Found” error, captioned:



\> “The only bipartisan achievement left in America is making public accountability just difficult enough to not bother.”



It got two likes and one comment:  

\*“LMAO shut up retarded libtard.”\*



Jerry took another sip, smiled grimly, and whispered: “Case dismissed.”

1jns2ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1jns2ql/weird_ass_first_date/,Weird ass first date,"I went on a Tinder date for the first time in a while. The girl seemed nice from our conversation. We work in the same field and had similar interests, we were hitting it off over text, etc. She asked me out for coffee and I said yeah. Necessary background info: I’ve been on T for 10 years, I’ve passed full-time for maybe 9 of those but I’m open about being trans on dating apps since it’s less stressful for me. Also I’m black. 

Our date was this morning. It was weird as fuck almost immediately. The first thing she said after “hello” was “you have amazing lips.” It is 9:30 in the morning, chill. We get our drinks, and then she says “so I bet at this point I’m supposed to say, ‘congratulations, you’re transgender.’” I did not even have a chance to respond (not that I would have known how to because what???) before she went into this mini rant about how, unlike most people, she doesn’t respect trans people just because they’re trans, they have to prove themselves to her. Mind you the extent of my talking about being trans to her is that my Tinder bio says “Trans man.” after the rest of my bio. 

I finally say something and it’s something like “I try to respect people because they’re people.” She doesn’t acknowledge this, and I wish I was joking, says “You weren’t offended by Rachel Dolezal?” Oh, also this woman is white.

I was still in my baby trans years when the Rachel Dolezal thing happened. Also I was 18 and black. So I was fielding (and unfortunately entertaining) “debates” about this nonstop for a few months to a year, and the burnout from that continues to this day. I do not want to hear that damn woman’s name, leave her to her silly little behaviors and let her be forgotten, PLEASE. All I could do when this girl said that was laugh, but she just kept. fucking. talking. She was talking so much and I was in so much disbelief that I couldn’t tell you verbatim, but I will try to reconstruct what she said: “So by your logic” (she doesn’t know my logic, I’ve barely said a fucking word) “she can say n****r” (yes she said it, hard R) “and be completely fine, because YOU know what it’s like to be a woman” (no I don’t, I started T when I was 17) “and seeing men put on valley girl voices and saying it makes them women is totally fine with you. YOU know what it’s like to be a woman, you don’t actually believe this whole thing.” 

At this point the adjacent tables had heard/seen this woman say the N-word pretty loudly at a black guy and were looking at us in confusion/concern, and I had had enough time to process what was happening so I said “what is wrong with you?” She again responded to something I didn’t say by saying “so it DOES offend you? What if I say I’m black? Now can I say my n****r.” (again, hard R)

A guy from the table in front of us got up and said “is everything OK here?” I was already getting up and getting my jacket so I said yeah, I’m leaving now. We were sitting kind of close to the counter as well, and one of the baristas came up too and asked me if everything was OK, and as I was talking to him, this woman stood up and said, and THIS is verbatim, “Stay an incel, then. Die mad.” 

Never mind that I’ve been in several long-term relationships, been engaged during one…anyway, she’d made herself so mad that she walked out of the store before I’d had a chance to finish getting my bag and my coffee, and the barista (bless his heart, he was maybe 18 or 19 and white and seemed very anxious) asked if he wanted me to call the police, and of course I said no lol. The guy from the other table and his wife and I actually ended up striking up a conversation, and we found out we all play Catan and so they invited me to their weekly Catan night. I made new friends out of this!!

The story doesn’t end there though! I blocked the woman on Tinder and texts, but ofc I texted some friends about how insane the date was, and one of my friends recognized her from the Tinder screenshot I sent her. She let me know that this they had gone to high school together (my friend was a senior when this woman was a sophomore) and had also followed each other on Tumblr, but apparently this woman forgot that because she posted on Tumblr that she had terminal brain cancer and then posted (“via her mom”) that she had died. She then opened up a new Tumblr account allegedly run by her fraternal twin sister, posting about the exact same things this woman posted about. The “sister” then once posted about “her sister” dying in a car accident. 

So….. I don’t know what the moral to this story is. I almost got the sense she was manic by how fast she was talking and the way her train of thought ran and how she was acting. But I’m not a psychologist. I can’t emphasize enough how normal she seemed while we were texting. Lol, maybe the moral of the story is to go on a date with a racist and you get new people to play Catan with!",11,1743384740.0,ftm,5,0.92,False

Our goal is to get a place either on (or walking distance to) a nice beach, and in a community where we can get good restuarants, coffee shops, grocery stores etc. Because we are coming with young kids, good health care close by is also important. We'd also consider a day care for our older daughter.

Our thought is to get a 3 bdrm place so that we can have visitors while there.

We'll likely want to get some help to cook/clean also.

2) what should we expect for rent?

I do 90% of the childcare (preschool things, bath, bedtime, doctors), cooking, and cleaning (I do, I track it because I was feeling crazy). I’m always thinking about him. Hell tell me he doesn’t know how I take my coffee or he doesn’t know my order at a popular, regularly visited fast food place. Recently, breakfast for both of was set out. He made his and took it to his office and left mine there unmade, while I made the kids breakfast and cleaned up. I ran a mile and said I was proud of myself and when he heard the time, he said I could have walked. 

If I joke around with him, he’ll yell at me that I’m gaslighting him. If I ask him to please put his dishes away while I’m in the process of deep cleaning the kitchen, he’ll retort that he picks up after me all the time. He never says sorry. He gives me the silent treatment when he’s mad at me. He’s always right. 

I’ve never noticed until recently but he’s very entitled. He thinks that we are owed stuff (free babysitting, money or gifts for a new house).

We had a whirlwind dating and early years of marriage. He was quick to tell me he loved me, quick to propose, sending me just because flowers, letting me use his credit card, showering me with texts, all his friends were telling me how much he talks about me. 

The surface never really cracked until we had kids but I persevered. It was stressful! It was uncertain times! I still can’t get over him telling me he had no sympathy for me when I woke him because I was sobbing in the middle of the night with a four month old that was cluster feeding and I was so tired. Or then him taking the baby out of the room while repeating that.

I think it all came to a head when he confirmed that he didn’t help pack or unpack for our last move because he “made it happen.” It wasn’t that he thought I preferred to handle it or wanted to escape the kid. It was an intentional decision that he made and this is sadly when it all made sense to me. 

Every so often he does a lot, without me having to ask, and I’m surprised and think we’re turning a corner. But we’re not.

Hey there! I’m a 32 male who recently had surgery to remove the growth caused by Osgood Schlatter Disease in my knee when I was a teenager. My understanding is that it’s a pretty uncommon surgery (there's only a handful of Reddit posts of folks with detailed journals of recovery) so I thought I would share my experience with the surgery and recovery, describing my surgery experience, the first two weeks of recovery and the things I wish I knew.

Big picture: its been two weeks and all seems pretty good so far. The pain was worse than I expected the first few days, but has quickly gotten pretty manageable. The three biggest things I wish I knew were...

1. After Day 5, when my leg felt pretty stable, to put some extra padding inside of the brace while sleeping. Helped so much with comfortability at night
2. To have a leg strap! No clue why my doctor and the post-op instructions didn't include this, but you can't move my leg up/down for a while and need some kind of strap to move it on/off a bed/car/chair etc by yourself
3. To have someone staying with you or vice versa for the first 10-14 days. I could imagine a world where after Day 7 I was on my own, but wow it has made life so much easier (especially at the beginning and end of the day) to have a family member staying with me. Even though I also had a friend around everyday, I think it really kept more active and less stressed to have this other assistance I could lean on.

Before I get into the recovery journal, here's my quick OSD history and what led to surgery:

I only had OSD in my right knee but it’s always been decently prominent and visible. When I first had OSD around 12, I had a little bit of pain for a year or two but then it went away. Sometimes it was a little achy over the years, but never in a debilitating way. However, a year ago I started becoming more physically active (playing a lot of pickleball, bending and running and pivoting) and had been experiencing more knee pain around the OSD site. I had a clear xray, 20 PT sessions over 4 months and nothing made it better. After getting an MRI that was totally clear, I got ref’d to a knee specialist who said it was all the symptoms of adult OSD resurgent pain, likely due to the OSD growth getting irritated/dislodged by the increased activity. I got schedule for a surgery to remove the OSD growth, as the surgeon believed not only would that fix the pain and limitations around working out I was feeling, but allow me to get stronger and more active than I’d been able to before.

**Pre-op week**:

* I stopped exercising/athletic activity about four days before the surgery, with just minimal walks in the 3 days leading up.
* I picked-up my knee brace the week beforehand and picked up my medication a few days beforehand. I wore the brace around a few times before the surgery to get used to feeling and would absolutely recommend
* I set up a google doc for friends to sign up for the first few weeks to come hang/bring me food/take me out of the house since I wouldn’t be driving. For me, this was a good system.
* The morning of the surgery, I wore a tank and shorts. That's been my go-to outfit in the two weeks since. 

**Day 1**: (I know sometimes this gets called Day 0 by my doctors referred to it as Day 1)

I arrived at the hospital a few hours before the surgery (9am). They shaved my leg, gave me my crutches and set up my IV. (One piece of advice: when the specialist taught me how to use crutches, I suggested we try it with the knee brace on –– seemed obvious to me but wasn’t something he’d ever thought to do before)

Once my surgeon was ready (11am), it was pretty quick, probably less than an hour (done at 12pm). I slowly came out of anesthesia over the next hour or two.

My surgery was pretty ideal. Sounds like I was lucky on a few fronts: First, my growth was in one solid piece, and hadn't split into any fragments. It was a 1cm x 1.5cm growth (my doctor said: “it really seemed like it wanted to come out”). Second, there was no scar tissue to clear up (a little lucky since, again, it had been causing sporadic pain for about a year). Third, they didn’t have to remove the nearby bursa sac (apparently sometimes they do and it’s not inherently a bad thing if they do, just meant it was overall more minimal).

I was cleared, technically, to put full weight on my leg if standing on both –– but a lot of this is subject to one’s comfortability. Day 1-14 I’ve felt comfortable standing unassisted with weight on both feet, but (whether psychological or physical) have always used crutches to walk. Likewise, I was technically cleared immediately to bend 90 degrees, but it took until Day 5 to try bending and Day 12 to do 90 degrees. 

Around 2/3pm I was ready to go home; they added a little Vicodin to my IV for the ride home\* before heading out.

Overall, the pain wasn’t so bad on Day 1. Maybe like a 4/5 (on the 1-10 scale). I stayed with friends who took care of me. Got home at 5pm and I practiced walking twice in the paved backyard before bed. Had dinner and played a game. 

As a stomach sleeper, I had tried to practice sleeping on my back the week before –– and I actually slept pretty OK that first night. I think I spent part of the night on my good side with the OSD leg on top and that was a good position too.

**Day 2**:

So this was the day things started to hurt. Pain was intermittently as bad as a 6/7 out of 10. 

I was prescribed Tramadol (in addition to Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen) and I pretty quickly started taking 1.5 or 2x the dosage prescribed because the normal dosage was having no effect (talked to my doc and looked it up, was safe to do). I also had a few CBD gummies throughout the day. I was pretty desperate to get relief. 

The pain seemed a lot higher than what my surgeon had told me to expect, but the surgical assistant said it was normal when I described what I was feeling (throbbing mostly). I got prescribed a second round of Tramadol because I was going through it so quickly, but I actually never ended up using it –– the initial amount was ultimately enough to get me through Day 2 + 3 and I stopped by Day 4. I walked around two or three times for about 5 minutes each this day, but otherwise rested. I worked (remotely on my comp, writing mostly) for a few hours. 

The biggest thing my doctor forgot to tell me was the need for a foot strap! I couldn’t move my leg up/down/horizontally (still can’t on Day 12 all that much) and you need a strap around your foot to move it in and out of bed/car/couch/etc. 

**Day 3**:

Pain was, at its worst,  sometimes like a 6/7. 

The thing is that walking was always fine, it was just generally throbbing and achy pangs around the surgical site that was causing pain. 

I went to my physical therapist (who I’d been seeing intermittently for six months beforehand) –– he was surprised the surgeon had told me to see him so early, there wasn’t much to do at the moment and just to rest. However, I’m actually really glad I went because I got a couple helpful things from the PT: First, it was good to just get another reality check that the pain I was feeling was normal and nothing to be concerned about. Second, he explained that the single most important thing for the first week is just to focus on ensuring the knee stays straight. He said you can always get the bending back but its much harder to get full straightness back. He said the only exercises to focus on was using my muscles to push my knee flat/so that the back of the knee is touching down. He also said to try bending as it is comfortable up to 90 degrees, like the surgeon said. 

I took a lot of pain medication and basically spent the rest of the day in bed after this. A few friends came by to watch stuff with me and bring me food. A family member, staying with me for the next nine days, arrived in the evening. 10pm on Day 3 was the last time I took the Tramadol.

**Day 4**: 

Pain was, at its worst, more like a 5 out of 10 (trending down from Day 2 + 3)

I spent most of the day in bed. I got up to walk once or twice and I think it felt a little bit better to put more weight on the OSD leg. 

**Day 5**:

Pain was, at its worst, 4 or 5. 

If Day 2 + 3 were bad and Day 4 was neutral, I would say Day 5 was the first “good” day. With the family member staying with me, I got out of the house for about four hours. 1pm-3pm we went to a park nearby. I walked about 500 feet on crutches (flat surface) to a nice sitting area. I took a nap just because that was so tiring (but not painful). Then 3-5pm we went to a diner, was able to maneuver fine and put my foot up on an extra chair.

The only thing is this was the start of some sleeping issues. I think I was just so tired Day 1-4 and on painkillers that I was sleeping better and those more painful days, but from Day 5-10 it really took a lot of figuring out how to get in a comfortable position. It involved a lot of extra pillows and blankets around my legs to pad/raise/support them in different positions. The one thing on Day 10 that I figured out which I wish I knew earlier was that is I padded my leg \*inside\* the brace it was all more comfortable. What I’ve been doing since Day 10 is wrapped my leg in a fluffy sweater/lightweight small blanket, \*then\* strapping my brace over it, so it’s still straight but with internal padding that makes sleeping in the brace more comfy. 

(Changing Clothes) This was also the first day I changed my clothes. I spent the first two post-op weeks in shorts and tank top. I absolutely needed help with changing the shorts. 

**Day 6**:

Pain was, at its worst, a 4, mostly just while trying to sleep. 

I was out of the house for about eight hours, but doing pretty simple stuff: a friend picked me up at 11am for lunch. At 1pm, they took me to a library to work. This was my first day trying to wear a backpack instead of having someone carry things for me, which was good to get used to. Around 6pm, I got dinner with another friend. My family member with me always brought along a pillow and an extra jacket to kind of bundle up so I always had options to help prop my leg up on something

Over the course of the day, I was in and out of the car four times and on my own at the library for a little bit, all a good learning experience. I think I tried either a CBD gummy or melatonin for sleep. I practiced bending and got to 45 degrees.

This might’ve been the first day I was icing a little more directly. I sort of tried on Day 4 and 5 but I just couldn’t really get the ice pack close enough without feeling discomfort/weight on the surgical area.

**Day 7**:

Pain was, at it’s worst, a 3 or 4. 

Another increasingly active day. I was outside of the house for about 10 hours. A friend picked me up to go to a coffee shop, where we practiced bending. I got to about 50/60 degrees. There’s never been \*pain\* with bending, just pressure and pulling sensation around the surgical site. 

We also did some slow walking to practice really putting more weight on the OSD leg, that was good. Then I got picked up to go to a cafe for lunch, and then driven up to the mountains nearby to play backgammon at a picnic table overlook. After sunset, we went to the movies. We called in advance to make sure the theater had recliner seats. We brought in a pop-up stool for my leg just in case it wasn’t long enough. I was worried I’d feel restless or need to readjust a lot, but it was really great. The other thing I learned at the movies was just to be unafraid to ask for assistance with doors. Doors are really tricky in crutches (and really heavy at the movie theaters…)

**Day 8**:

Pain was, at it’s worst, a 3 or 4. 

I had my second PT appointment. We got to 80 degrees bending! It took me a long time to get there and I only did two attempts at bending. He said between now and the next appt (Day 13) to see if I could built up to 10 repetitions of bending. 

Another reason I think my surgeon was overly optimistic about: he told me I’d be driving in a week… but on Day 8 I still couldn’t lift my leg while sitting horizontally at all. My PT said to just keep practice and, if nothing else, just to try visualize it while attempting to lift my leg (felt kind of like that scene in Kill Bill where she tries to get her toes to wiggle). 

I changed clothes again this day and I was able to figure out how to do shorts by myself without assistance.

I spent the day with my family member picking up supplies for a work event I was MC-ing that evening (!). It was a 40 person event from 6-10pm where I was leading folks through activities and hosting a panel discussion. It was effortful, but honestly fine to do. I was standing/walking (on crutches, obviously) maybe a little too much, but there weren’t any repercussions felt from it. 

I practiced holding a tote bag and carrying other non-backpack items throughout the day while in crutches which was a good experience. 

**Day 9**:

Pain is, at it’s worst, a 3. Just pressure but no longer as achy around the surgical site or any random sharpness when I make an awkward step. 

In pursuit of trying to get the horizontal leg lift (and get back to driving…) I’ve been doing lateral leg raises (i.e. while sitting on my side) which feel very comfortable and easy, and then slowly rotating around more onto my back to do horizontal. Still can’t quite get there but making a bit of progress. 

(First Shower) This was my first shower since surgery. I had done one or two standing spongebath kind of things with a lightly soapy rag, but hadn’t tried a proper shower. I have a step in shower, too, so… not ideal. What I learned is that I can do a scale pretty comfortably on my good leg and to leverage that to go backwards into the shower. I put a chair in there and had a bit of help from a friend but regardless… it was complicated. But felt really great.

My family member was supposed to leave this day but in the morning we both decided it would be a huge help to have them for some extra days around. 

**Day 10**:

Pain was at most a 3. 

A friend picked me up to go to the library makerspace and do some crafts. Then I went to a park to play backgammon with the family member. All that felt fine. 

Then, ambitiously, we tried doing a longer, more complex walk: about 1/3 of a mile, descending 60 steps and going up 20. It felt like the perfect amount of challenging to try (again, still on crutches in leg brace). It took probably 30-40 minutes. I intermittently was slow walking on both feet and then hopping along quicker on the good foot. I had to take two long breaks where I could sit down for a few minutes. But ultimately, no so bad. 

When I did exercises in the evening, I got to 90 degrees and I was able to start horizontally picking up my foot a little bit if I started by doing lateral leg lifts. Both huge pieces of progress.

Again, this was the evening I thought to wrap my leg in extra padding under my brace while sleeping –– such a good move. I was even able to comfortably roll on my stomach a little bit without endangering my knee in any way. 

One other thing about this day: I decided to readjust my crutches to make them an inch shorter (and the handles an inch higher so they’d be in the same place). The reason was that I felt like I could definitely start putting more weight on my legs and wanted to try to take weight off my shoulders/armpits.

**Day 11**:

Pain was at most a 2/3. 

Ran some errands with family member, when to a cafe for lunch, then walked around my community garden with another friend. Kind of a solid average amount of activities, nothing too complicated but not too passive either. 

This was the first day that icing directly above the surgical site (with a thin cloth between) felt totally comfortable. Again, like I said on Day 6, the weight of it on my knee felt bad… but totally unbothered now.

**Day 12**:

Pain was at most a 2 or 3.

I did another long walk, like the one of Day 10. This one was all flat. Pain-wise, it’s fine, just effortful! Really feels like a workout. 

I can’t tell if it’s psychological but I can’t do the horizontal leg lift without starting from a side/lateral leg lift first… so weird. It’s not even that the momentum turning from side to back is what helps. I can even pause for 15 secs between reps. But then if a few minutes go by, I can’t do a horizontal lift. Again, my PT said this was totally normal and takes a bit of time to get back… I’m just focused on it for the purposes of driving, but TBD.

As I'm laying in bed, I feel some upset feelings in my stomach. I'll spare the details, but I had a lot of buried emotions to process that I've been working on. I felt this detail is important.

I accepted how I felt, as painful as it was. A flood of emotions and memories followed. But what happened next was more interesting.

I felt myself drifting away during this. I just became lost. I couldn't tell if I was asleep or awake. I couldn't feel my body anymore. I was just in emptiness.

Then I begin to feel the most incredible sensation I've ever felt in my life. It felt like buzzing all over my body. There's kind of a static everywhere and I start to hear this person's voice. I don't know exactly who it is.

It sounds like they're on a TV, in the distance a little bit. I can only just start to make it out. It's got a man's face on it.

He's saying ""I started in Geometry, first. That's where you'll find me""

At this point these waves of feelings come over me, that are so beautiful, I've never felt something so beautiful. I think this must be what it feels like to be my soul. Just beauty, no pain or anything. It's perfect.

I could sense I had a form too, and my form wasn't a human form. It was like a crazy psychedelic form that stretched out. It was glorious. It was like finally, I was me. All of me. It was like I'd waited so long for that. Like a stretch after a million years of sleep. Well, time didn't make sense anymore. I was beyond time.

So I start asking questions but I really wish I could remember the more of the answers. All I know is that this thing exists outside of what we see, and it's trying to find a way to interact with us. It's not alien. It's not anything we have words for. It's something else.

I said to it, like oh wow this is amazing. What are you?

The vibrations peaked even higher and then I felt all these little hands all over me, like tickling me and I heard BLUBLELENBELNLBELUEUE in a child's voice followed by giggling

It gave me such a fright I woke up. Then I felt guilty. Why am I afraid of a child's laughter? Oh what a Grinch I am, I thought.

I was just left thinking after that, oh god. What what was that?

- Very good sleep
- Consistently wake up the same time 
- Stable energies throughout the day 
- No more blurry vision even when I eat sugar
- The intermittent black dots in my vision have stopped

Cons
- No motivation to do much of anything except stay in bed 
- Headache only lasted about a day and it was the second day 
- I’ve been eating more sugar, but my understanding is if I minimize the fat intake with the sugar it’s not as bad 

Background 
- 40 years old, and have been drinking coffee since about age20 
- Drink a lot of soda in my teenage years 
- So I could estimate 30 years of caffeine 

Two weeks ago I got either the flu or pneumonia and was in bed for an entire week so I use that opportunity to quit coffee 

From what I’ve read on this forum the first two weeks are the worst and it seems to get better from there so hopefully I’m coming out of it 

It’s just that I’ve had literally no motivation to do anything. Like in my mind I have all these ideas and things that I need to do. But when I sit down at the computer, I’m just staring off into space for hours. I just want to stay in bed and sleep. Could that be part of the detox? ",8,1743383666.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Then its like 2-5 day break of little to no pain. Then starts up again. 

Blood tests, US, and CT scans all normal. The last few weeks I've had a pretty persistent pain. I went to the doctor on Friday and she wrote me an order for the HIDA scan. 

Then come Saturday my nagging pain stopped. It went from a 5/6 to a 1/2. Every once in awhile I get a sharp zap in that area but it quickly goes away. I even had a handful of fries yesterday evening and I didn't have an attack. I also drank two cups of coffee this weekend, which was a trigger for me in the past, and still nothing. 

So my question is, if I don't have any more pain, should I still get the scan? ",3,1743383588.0,gallbladders,8,1.0,False

I’m not completely out of the woods yet but I would say I’m feeling about 85% better. 
I always promised myself that I would make a post when I had constructive info on how I’m successfully healing my gut.
So here it is, I had to go on a strict gastritis diet. It pretty much entailed googling everything before I ate it. I supplemented with slippery elm capsules before every meal to help lubricate my throat and stomach before eating. I started having a glass of aloe juice a day. 
Things that I avoided because through trial and error I found they were making things worse. Beef, coffee, yoghurt, banana, soft drink, chicken mince, sausages. 
Healing your gut through a gastritis diet does not have to be boring. If your after some delicious recipes that I personally used to get through this, just message me, I’m more than happy to help and encourage you to heal too! 🫶🏻",2,1743383526.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

I've tried a number of recipes from Filtru's recommended recipe (my coffee came out harsh) to James Hoffmann's recipe (he prefers it light ata kaya my brew was also light). I noticed na halos walang gumagamit ng original recipe so sinubukan ko and the results were pretty good. Di ko pa nasubukan with a lighter roast, but generally for a dark roast I prefer it. Granted, this is dark-roasted Barako, but having it come out not as harsh is nice for once.

It also helps that it's quite simple and can be used without a scale. It's adjustable too if you want to serve three ""espresso-style"" shots (di recommended to use 4 Aeropress scoops since aapaw talaga if you try filling it up to the 4).

Also, fun fact: you can use the funnel pala on a carafe if the Aeropress base is too wide to sit on the rim properly.",1,1743383520.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

For many people, especially those who are neurodivergent, initiating tasks can feel incredibly difficult. That’s where body doubling comes in.

  

## What Is Body Doubling?

  

Body doubling is a simple but powerful strategy where you work alongside another person, either virtually or in person, to help stay focused. The other person doesn’t have to help with your task. They just need to be present and working on something of their own.

  

This shared focus can be surprisingly motivating. It’s not about pressure or competition. It’s about gentle accountability and having someone in your corner while you work.

  

## Why It Works for Neurodivergent Brains

  

For people with ADHD, autism, or other forms of neurodivergence, executive functioning challenges can make it hard to start or follow through on tasks. Body doubling supports these brains by:

•  Creating a sense of shared structure

•  Making tasks feel less isolating

•  Offering a low-pressure form of accountability

•  Helping to reduce overwhelm and distraction

  

Sometimes, just knowing someone else is working beside you can help quiet the noise in your mind and make it easier to focus.

  

## What Does It Look Like?

  

Body doubling can take many forms. You might:

•  Sit in a quiet Zoom room with someone while you both work

•  Go to a coffee shop and sit near a friend

•  Join a virtual coworking or study group where everyone checks in and then works quietly

  

You don’t need to talk much, if at all. The presence of another person doing their own task can be enough to shift your mindset.

  

## Come Try It With Us

  

If you’ve never tried body doubling, or if you’ve done it before and found it helpful, this is your sign to give it another shot.

  

**Join us for our virtual study session tomorrow evening.**

Whether you need to tackle schoolwork, organize your week, or simply check off a few small tasks, this is a welcoming space designed with neurodivergent brains in mind.

I will apologize now, this may get a little long but I will try to summarize as much as I can. I also just need to vent a little. 

I first met my (36f) bf (37m), 5 yrs ago when I moved to a new state. I was staying with family and we went shopping, he came to assist and I was kind of attracted to him from the jump. I have a type, tattoos and a smart ass attitude (but in a funny way). A month later I ended working at the same store, not because of him but because it was close to my families house and the only place actively hiring at the start of covid. I was not doing well before I moved, my grief over losing my mom had me in a chokehold. I was crashing on peoples couches, drinking, doing drugs and just all around sucking at life. I talked to my family, jumped on a bus, and 3 days later I moved to another state across the country to start over and try again. Getting this job was the first big positive step forward for me. 

It took about 2 months of making excuses to stop and talk and some light social media stalking, and outright telling him I was interested before he realized I was flirting with him. We went on our first date and we had so much fun. We talked about our lives, I told him a bit about my past and I found out his wasn't too far off, maybe even a little darker. He sold me this story of his past with drugs, a cheating ex, and how he had moved home because even though the house was ""in his name"" she was pregnant and he didn't want to kick her out. He made it sound like he owned said house. I have heard that story change multiple times throughout the years and I'm still not sure I've ever gotten the truth. He implied that he also moved home to help his parents out with paying bills, I later found his parents are very comfortable in their finances and he didn't pay them shit.  Needless to say, I drank the kool-aid. 

Anyhow, I fell hard and fell fast. We even talked about buying a house together, which thank god I came to my senses and we opted to get an apartment instead. About 10 months in our relationship we moved into our apartment. There were some behaviors that I knew I would have to help him grow out of, his gaming habits and general messiness. Guy stuff. For time saving purposes I will not list everything that I learned in that first year and the 3 years since I have lived with him but one thing became glaringly obvious, I fell in love with a giant man child and mommas boy. I learned that he was not just messy, he was dirty. Trash left all over the coffee table, food bits on the floor from late night gaming snacks, leaving food out over night, clothes staying where ever they land. I had never seen it before because him mom always picked up after him when he was living with them. We had multiple fights about his obsession with gaming, his inability to manage his money (he had 1 bill in his name and even though I gave him money for it, it would still be late), and his insane jealousy because of his cheating ex. 

Meanwhile, over time I was working my way up in the company. I went from a measly part time position, to a full time, to a coveted sales position, and eventually management. Now I work with a division of corporate, still low on the totem pole but already have my manager putting in recommendations for promotions for me. I had never done this well at a job in my whole life. I had never worked for a company this long. I quit drugs, rarely drank except a few nights out with the few friends I managed to make, and was so proud of myself for becoming ""an actual adult."" I even had good credit again! When I got the sales position he was jealous because even though he has the skill set to be successful in a role like that he had a crappy attitude, was often late, and used bull shit excuses about a very manageable health thing to leave early. Hey made me feel so small about my promotion that I didn't even get to celebrate it, instead I cried that night because apparently the only way that anyone succeeded was because they kissed ass and no one was actually promoted for their skills, it was just a popularity game. I worked my ass off for that position. I showed up early, offered to stay late, helped anywhere and everywhere in the store, and dealt with angry Karens with a smile on my face.  To his credit he felt bad and learned from that experience and has been happy for me with every position I have moved up to since then. 

This is getting long so lets fast forward. We are still renting but moved into a house that was quite a bit more than our apartment but we were doing well work wise (he eventually left the company we worked for and ended up in a much better paying job). Also our family had grown by 3 fur babies and we needed more space. I think about 6 months ago he lost his job. I told him to apply for unemployment but his pride and ego got in the way. He always gave me an excuse that there was some sort of issue with his application but I honestly don't think he applied for like the 1st 2 months. His parents were giving him money to go towards rent but I was still picking up about an extra $500 of household expenses every month. At some point he closed his bank account and never opened one again. All his money gets deposited to his dads bank account and then his mom would give him cash. He BARELY put effort into finding a job. Between his unemployment, being able to borrow off his parents, and me covering whatever was left he was awfully comfortable staying home. I told him I get it, I've been unemployed before, but if he was going to be home all day he could pick up more of the house chores. Did he? NO! He is the king of weaponized incompetence. He took on one dedicated chore of doing the dishes and he was still inconsistent on when that would actually get done. We started fighting more and more, it became a weekly event. 

Remember me mentioning the gaming? I am not against gaming but he took it to a new level. He had a game room off the garage. Last winter he would be out there with a little electric heater cranking up our electric bill. As the months started to get cold and our household stayed at a 1 and 1/2 income household (he was on unemployment but making less than half of what he was making when he was working) I told him he could bring his game into the living room to keep the electric bill down. That same night he started sleeping on the couch. Not because we fought and I made him. He does it because he plays until 2 or 3am, gets off the game, watches people play other games on youtube and falls asleep. That was 3 maybe 4 months ago. Our relationship honestly feels like we are roommates at this point. He is working again. To get him to take the job hunt seriously I took away his game controllers and threatened to sell it to put towards bills. He managed to find a job a week later (imagine that) but still making considerably less, meaning I am continuing to over extend myself to cover our monthly expenses. My credit has taken a hit because I had missed payments due to having to cover so much more of the expenses. After almost 5 years together, 4 years of me managing all of the expenses, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and doing most of the work to care for the fur babies I had a moment of clarity where I realized I'm done.  I never signed up to raise a man who still acts like a teenager. Something I didn't mentioned but is worth noting is when we would fight, 90% of the time it would escalate because of him. I'm a talker. He starts yelling, throwing things, hitting things (not me but still red flag behavior), then starts crying and using self deprecation to the point that I somehow end up consoling him. Then the next day he acts like none of it ever happened. 

Back to my moment of clarity and why I may be an asshole. I have started to look into apartments in the city. I have a serious lifelong medical condition and because of it I can't drive, our town doesn't have public transportation so if I leave I have to move out of town. I've talked to one or two close friends about my plan to leave. We have 5 months left on our lease and because of the financial hole he has dug me in I don't have the money I would need to break the lease and pay to move into a new place. Also I need time to figure out how to untangle our lives. We are both on the car, have a shared phone plan, etc. etc. Our lease is up at the end of August I plan to move right after our last month of rent is paid. The only reason I haven't told him yet is I don't trust him to not bail and leave me paying for this big house on my own. I feel bad because I am giving myself 4 or 5 months to plan, prepare, and save. I planned to tell him when we got our offer to renew but one of my friends says to not tell him until July to ensure that I won't have to take all of these expenses on my own for the next 4 months. Am I an asshole for not telling him I plan to leave and giving him the same amount of time to get his plan in order as I am giving myself?

1jnrjcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jnrjcq/wife_cheated_on_me_with_her_ex_boyfriend/,Wife cheated on me with her ex boyfriend,"This is brand new. It only happened about a week ago. I have been with my wife for nearly 9 years but married for 2. We are both in our late 20s. She is from another country so much of our relationship was long distance for many years until a little over 2 years ago when we were finally given her visa. 

I say this because we waited for 2 years on the visa while I worked to earn money to be prepared for our future. We became very distant and lost during this waiting period and even separated for a while. She had another boyfriend while we were separated. When we were notified of the visa approval, she called me out of the blue and told me she wanted to come and try and fix everything. I have tried very hard for the last few years to make her feel comfortable and successful. We recently moved half way across the country for a job she has always wanted to try. I gave up my good career to allow her to try this dream. So yes, I have been very depressed and lost the last few months trying to find myself again. 

My wife has always loved traveling. She has never been able to travel alone but has always wanted to try it. She has been planning a trip to another country for a very long time and I was hesitant but I told her just to try to have fun and she can always come home if something happens (She gets free flights). I was a little reluctant partially because the specific country is the same place that this ex boyfriend had moved to. I told her that was very strange and convenient but she always brushed it off as it's a huge country and I haven't spoken to him in years. 

She comes home from the trip immediately claims I am too depressed and unhelpful and she is tired of it and wants to separate. I am confused but fight back desperately trying to save our marriage because she was very stern about being done which seemed strange. 

I went to stay at my brothers house for a few days. I sent her flowers and a card while I was gone and then she called me. 

She told me while we were separated she had gotten pregnant from the ex and had a miscarriage which she had never told anyone about. I then asked her if she had seen him on her trip and she said yes we met for a coffee. I asked again. And she said they went to a bar. Then she said they had kissed and told me that I know what else happened. 

For a side note. When we had first gotten married I had caught her talking to him before but she always said it was over and never again. Now I believe it was probably never over but I have no idea. 

I am just desperately lost.  I quit my job I had started here to try to have less stress on us. I am 2000 miles from my family and do not know anyone here. This is also not anything I would ever want to ask my family advice about. I just don't even know where to begin or what I can even do. If it is even worth counseling or if these issues are too far gone for me to be the one even trying. Anything would help. I need to know the views of others who might have struggled with this too",5,1743383000.0,Marriage,15,0.69,False

*told my husband to mandate that I allow her into the delivery room (he didn't do this)
*called her when I was in labor and she drove to the hospital calling me a ton of names until I let her in the room. She said I was being unfair as my mom was there (last min choice on my part) to support me during the labor process. 
*I ended up letting her in the room and she complained the whole time that I was taking to long and she was tired/hungry. She left for a hotel and said to call her when I was about to push so she could see her baby being born.
*her spouse posted photos of our baby all over his FB even though we asked them not to and she said if I didn't want to see the pics to unfriend him.
*she constantly tried kissing baby when we asked not to
*came over to my house the day we got home from the hospital expecting me to host them and cook lunch for everyone while she held the baby. I had a third degree rip so I had a ton of stitches and it hurt to walk.
*demanded I apologize to her because she didn't get to hold baby as long as others did in the hospital since a nurse took them for observation. 

Currently pregnant with my second (almost 30 weeks 🎉) and my husband has enforced that we be NC with her. He has really stepped up a ton since having our first and put boundaries up with her. This pregnancy has been so much more chill and for that I am grateful.",24,1743382978.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,1.0,False
