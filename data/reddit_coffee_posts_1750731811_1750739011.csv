1lj1qpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/1lj1qpm/lost_a_6month_friendship_over_a_simple_weapon_test/,Lost a 6-Month Friendship Over a Simple Weapon Test,"I’m not usually the type to post something like this, but I need to get it off my chest. I had a friend in Fallout 76 that I’ve been playing with almost daily for the past 6 months. We farmed together, traded gear, did events, shared builds, and helped each other out. I genuinely considered him a solid teammate and friend.

A few days ago, I was testing a new Enclave Plasma Rifle I modded. I just wanted to see the DPS it could do in real-time. I asked him politely, “Hey, can you attack me so I can test my damage on you in return?” Pretty standard stuff in this game, right?

Instead, he activates a Stealth Boy, puts on Reflective Armor, and lets me die instantly. Then, out of nowhere, he starts saying things like “You need nerves of steel to kill me,” and implying I was trying to challenge him. It caught me off guard — because I wasn’t trying to “kill” him or flex in PvP. I was just testing numbers. That’s it.

What should’ve been a 2-minute test turned into a full-blown argument. I tried explaining my side, multiple times. Told him it wasn’t personal, wasn’t PvP, just a test. But he kept pushing it and spinning it like I was jealous or trying to prove something. I wasn’t. I never even bragged or tried to act like I’m powerful.

It got dragged out over the next few days. And for context — I’ve helped this guy a lot over the months. Gave him hundreds of canned coffee, True Hikers, Sentinel mods, armor, plans — all for free, no questions asked. Just because that’s how I play. I like helping.

But instead of hearing me out, he blocked me.

So yeah… 6 months of friendship, just gone — over a misunderstanding and some misplaced ego.

I’m not posting this to get pity. I know Fallout friends come and go. But it just sucks when someone you supported and played with for months doesn’t give you the same understanding back.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Wasteland’s still big, and there are better teammates out there.

1lj1oop,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1lj1oop/i_27f_dont_know_whether_to_marry_him_28m/,I [27f] don’t know whether to marry him [28M],"There is so much context needed so I’ll try to keep it brief- but several years ago at my job I was introduced to an intern, we’ll call Dan. I say this at the risk of sounding self-absorbed but Dan fell in love with me at first sight. For months, he was around me; he would include me in every conversation, he would bring me coffee, try to genuinely get to know me. And from an objective standpoint, he was perfect. A man with a really good career path, who spoke my native language, had a good family, etc 

Except for the fact that Dan was too obsessed. 

I didn’t know this until months later, but Dan had gone to his parents the day that we met and essentially instructed them to keep an eye out for wedding venues/ start thinking about marriage more seriously as he’d found his wife- me. Mind you, I had JUST MET the man. He was at the job longer than I was, and had a closer bond with my coworkers, and had spoken to several of my female friends/ coworkers about his feelings begging them to try to convince me or gauge my feelings. 

I very quickly caught on to his crush- mainly because he was very obvious and my coworkers had reported all of their conversations back to me- and confronted I him. We had a very positive conversation and we mutually agreed to set  some time aside to get to know each other. At this point, we’ve probably know each other for 3 months. 

I went home that night and thought for some time about the situation. I’m a bit religious so I asked god for some guidance. 

Side note— I want to take a second to address something very important—  there is absolutely not an ounce of physical attraction on my end, and I find his personality VERY feminine. He is very outgoing with large friend groups, and I’m a complete introvert*** 

When I woke up in the morning the thought of running into him at work made me so anxious that I ended up taking the day off of work. I cried my eyes out, and at the time I couldn’t really tell what was wrong- but I did know in my gut that this relationship wasn’t right. So I went in the next day and told him that I wanted to stop.

He took the news terribly and took a month off (he had a very flexible internship). I felt terrible- like I had broken this man’s heart beyond anything I ever thought I was capable of doing. Every day I would come into work and ask his supervisor where he was and he’d just say it was something medical he couldn’t disclose. I tried texting apologies but he was very dry. A month or so passes and he ends up switching internships so he was working days I wouldn’t be in the office and in parts of our office that would ensure we would never run into each other. 

Some time goes by and coworkers are asking about what happened to our wedding plans. And if we’d ended our relationship - and I’m furious because we were never together. This might sound a bit narcissistic, but I had just come out of quite literally the lowest point of my life- bumped into a man that had developed an obsessive crush and told everyone that we were destined to be together (behind my back)- and when I let him know gently I didn’t see a future he disappeared and acted like I was some kind of a monster.  

Months pass and we eventually talk things out and I apologize profusely. We’re both writers and I think at one point I had made a joke to lighten the mood and said something to the effect of- well as least I hope you got some good writing material out of this, and that I couldn’t wait to read it in the future when his poetry compilation is published. At which point he has told me that what he was able to write was so cruel that he would never let me or anyone see it. This really hurt because again- I didn’t intentionally try to hurt him. He moved jobs and works for a different office but we are still very casually in each other’s lives. We’ll see each other in public events every blue moon, or he’ll send me a check text every few months. 

Years later and he is still a passive part of my life. He makes jokes about us often and tries to set some time aside every time he’s in my side of town. I reject every time because I don’t want to hurt him anymore, I feel like I’ve been cruel enough. 

The problem is that in my culture I’m getting to an age where if I don’t settle down within the next few years it’s very likely that I will live a life completely alone. I have very little luck with men-the only ones I’ve ever come into contact with have been unbelievably cruel and evil and so I’ve always walked away from those relationships. In the back of my mind I think about Dan as being a good settlement. He’s kind, and I don’t think he’d ever physically or emotionally abuse me. I think we could live an “okay” life and I think over some years I could learn to love him. But I find this unfair for the both of us, we both deserve to be with people who choose us first. From what I know, Dan hasn’t tried to move on or meet anyone new. And I feel like I’m standing in the way of both of our happiness. I don’t know what to do and would love some objective feedback

Basically narcolepsy was brought up as a possibility by my doctors and I was supposed to have testing back at the beginning of the year but I had to cancel it because one of my medications (for another condition) gave me insomnia issues and now I have to take another medication to sleep at night. I stopped taking the sleep medication since it stopped working, but I know it wasn't affecting how awful I feel during the day. For years I've had fatigue issues, and I've fallen asleep in some weird situations. 

How do you guys wake up in the morning? I'm on summer break right now, but I'm in college and my schedule is insanely full next year. A typical day I get up at 6am because there's a chance I'll need a nap after my morning shower, but I'm not actually awake and fully functioning until 4pm (and even then I wouldn't say no to a nap). Naps are required during that 10 hour period (ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours). That's ten whole hours of going through the motions and barely functioning. Right now I can sleep 14 hours and cut that unfunctioning time in half, but I can't in about two months. Last year I got through my morning classes by half coherent notes (nearly failed that class) and not needing notes because it was a literature class and as long as I read the assigned reading it was fine. I can't do that next year and I can't afford to fail a class. I won't even have time for naps because I have so many classes scheduled. Also coffee is useless.",3,1750738540.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False
1lj1nj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1lj1nj0/im_sick_of_the_snapchat_requests_in_online_dating/,I'm sick of the Snapchat requests in online dating. I've tried to give people the benefit of the doubt and been burned repeatedly.,"I am a man who tries to be empathetic.

Sure, I thought, maybe some women get bombarded with notifications, so of course they might want to take the conversation of their actual matches to a quieter app.

Sure, I thought, maybe some women are afraid of getting shamed or whatever, and prefer Snapchat as a safer platform where texts and images don't stay up forever.

Sure, I thought, maybe some people prefer different apps over others.

Sure, I thought, maybe talking over Snapchat is safer for some women than giving out a phone number.

I tried. I really did.

Initially I'd matched with 3 scammers in a row who all wanted to take it to Snapchat, then I started unmatching or left swiping everyone with an Insta or Snap bio, or who sent me that stupid ""dO yOu HaVe S N A P ????"" question (they always put snapchat in non-Latin characters in their bio, like the pi sign for N, and break it up or use weird characters like it's some slur?) as a first message, or don't even pretend and just drop a username, but we all know what site it's used for.

It's just mindblowing. One match after the other is nothing but this:

""Do you have s c?""

""sc?""

""Are you on s n a p?""

""snap""

Then after a period of almost no conversations with this strategy I figured hey, maybe there are legitimate reasons not to chat with your matches on the actual dating app with a dedicated chat function that works perfectly fine. Let's give people the benefit of the doubt again. I started trying to approach every snapchat request in good faith.

One after the other, scammers, like 5 or 6 in a row this time. I just honestly lost count. Some of them chatted with me for a surprisingly long time before dropping their scam, others asked me stuff like ""Where do you live?"" when that is literally on my Tinder profile. If you were genuine I can't believe you didn't even bother to actually read it, if you're a scammer you're asking stupid questions that only irritate me further. People complain about men having crappy openers but I swear 95% of all women I've ever matched with, even the ones I thought were genuine, were just ""hey"" or ""hyd?""

Even more frustratingly, some of the snapchatters then wanted to take the conversation to WhatsApp. Why not just go to WhatsApp in the first place? Why not just exchange numbers and text each other with these phones we carry in our pockets 24/7? Why does every single thing have to be through some stupid app? Just text or call me! I just...I'm too tired. I just can't conceive of an explanation for so much app hopping.

I am exhausted, and what's even worse is that it's not like there's even legitimate people amongst the scammers. It's just one person begging for money (or worse, selling something) after the other, and that's if I get a response back at all.

I am just so tired. All I want is to arrange a time and a place to meet for coffee or dinner with a single, genuine person. I cannot tell you how many thousands of times I have swiped. I haven't been on a date in two years, and I've blown around $1,000 on professional photos and premium subscriptions across multiple apps.

I started planning how I would stay out of sight and make my way out of there. That's really where it ends although I had a feeling that I would be caught and killed.

(Fantasy)

 Chapter 1: Sweet Dreams and Loss

Eddie dozed in his recliner, adrift in the soft glow of memory. Carol's laugh gilded the air; her lips brushed his and lingered. On the carpet, Kenneth squealed under a volley of tickles while baby Lisa slept on Eddie's chest, rising and falling with his breath. These were the colors of his life.

But dreams get brittle. A shadow seeped in, draining the room of light. Lisa's tiny hand no longer tapped his shirt; her breaths turned shallow, then stopped.

Eddie jerked awake, palm pressed to the cramp beneath his ribs. He reached for the patched-leather notebook on the side table, flipped past a dozen half-finished pages of song lyrics, and scribbled: *""Lisa—dream again. Ask Kenneth about the castle.""* The pen shook, but the handwriting stayed neat—Marine neat—because some habits never leave.

""Carol... please..."" he murmured. The silent house offered only the refrigerator's low hum. Twenty-three years of photographs watched him from the mantel; one of Lisa held his gaze until his eyes burned. Finally, he snapped on the TV, letting canned laughter try—and fail—to push back the dark.

---

## Chapter 2: Cemetery Gates

At midday, Eddie ate a small lunch and then got everything ready for his afternoon drive to the cemetery.

He rode the winding road toward the cemetery, humming a familiar tune.

Suddenly, someone texting swerved into his lane, running Eddie off the road. He quickly rolled down his window, and Eddie's deep bass voice belted loud, ""Watch the road!""

He muttered to himself, ""Self-absorbed SOB. Keep playing on that phone until you kill somebody."" He sat and settled himself before driving away to his important destination.

Eddie Riley pulled up to the cemetery curb in his old brown box Chevy. Eddie popped the trunk and gathered his floral arrangements along with a bucket of small landscaping tools.

He arrived at his family's plots and set down his supplies. He took out a quarter and flipped it. ""It's always heads,"" he said with a sad smile. ""Lisa's always first.""

Kneeling beside her grave, Eddie sighed. ""Damn weeds grow like—well, weeds... Lisa, I'm sorry I let this get such a mess, baby girl.""

He pulled weeds, trimmed the grass, and cut a clean edge around Lisa's plot. He remained silent for a while, pressing a hand to the cement marker and thinking: *Lisa, your daddy will always love you more than all the world and all the stars.* He softly sang ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat,"" as if she were still in his arms.

He thought of how imaginative she had been—the stories she loved, the characters they pretended to be together. A quiet wave of grief and tenderness passed through him as he adjusted her decorations: a painted wooden castle, a carved stone mountain with white-painted snowy peaks, and a kaleidoscope of colorful flowers.

He read her favorite story—a fantasy he had written himself. (Eddie had once been a published fantasy writer, but he became a police officer not long after Lisa's death.) Afterward, he sat in silence a few moments before saying goodbye and gently kissing the ground above where she lay.

Eddie couldn't visit Carol today because she was buried in another city with her parents. Instead, he moved on to clean and edge the second plot belonging to his father, Tommy. He arranged flowers in a coffee mug that read ""Death Before Dishonor."" The headstone read:

```
Tommy Riley
Father, Decorated Marine, 40 Years Police
To be as Tommy is to be the best we have.
```

""Dad, I just miss you,"" Eddie said quietly. ""You know, if you hadn't found me all those years ago, I'd be dead, and not a soul would have cared. Forever my father.""

He paused, reflecting, then carefully finished his work before heading home.

As Eddie rode the winding road home, he thought of Lisa's favorite lullaby and sang the words. He repeated the lyrics, lost in thought. In his mind, the song became something deep and profound. The pain he carried in his voice was beautiful in this moment. For some reason, in his final moments, he felt something more. His eyes were bright, and he had a full heart.

The five inches between life and death were crossed as he sang the words, ""life is but a dream."" Lights on a straight and narrow road altered their path. A woman, typing the words ""I love you,"" looked away for a split second, and they both died on impact.

Eddie was gone. Numerous ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks lined the highway, lights flashing and sirens filling the air as we faded up and away.

## Chapter 3: Fleeting Transformation

Eddie Riley's journey home ends as another journey home begins in darkness.

A spark ignited his vision. He smelled the earth's rich soil and heard the crackle of leaves. A sudden burst of energy gave him sight from within a dark, broken cocoon. He flew through a dense forest, just above the thickets, alongside others in vibrant colors. In this life, he rode the wind and rested atop still waters. For nearly a year, what was once Eddie Riley fluttered in an earthly dance among his kind—a feeling of connection to the earth that can't be described, yet somehow we understand it. No concept of time or death existed—only unbridled freedom. It was a short life, yet a grand one, intertwined with nature and what it means to live. Eddie lived a peaceful life as a butterfly, and it was a life without regret.

Winter came, and he fell back to Earth. Then, for a while, there was nothing.

## Chapter 4: Eddie's Return and Stories of the Past

Only the faint sound of a distant bell remained. Gradually, Eddie became aware of his human form once more. He was disoriented for a while. He blinked, gathering himself. Then he took off his glasses, turned them in his hands, and said, ""I'm Eddie Riley.""

""Why's it so dark?"" he wondered aloud. ""I'm dead, aren't I? Hello? Hello?""

""Wh-what the... where the hell am I?"" he mumbled, lost and bewildered, until he saw a distant, flickering streetlight.

He glanced around in every direction, then shrugged. ""Well, I guess I'm supposed to go this way.""

He started walking along the asphalt through the darkness. He wore his Marine uniform—freshly pressed—and was clean-shaven. Rubbing his sleeve, he breathed in the familiar scent of the fabric, stirring a deep nostalgia within him. A surge of pride welled up as he remembered a time when he'd accomplished something truly worthwhile. Somehow, he knew this feeling wouldn't last long.

A brisk, cold breeze cooled him, but the closer he came to the light, the darker his feelings became.

He rubbed his arms and popped his collar. With every step, the air grew colder, and a feeling of dread stole his prideful enthusiasm. As the scene became clear, he stood hauntingly still.

Unimaginable pain washed over his soul. Eddie recognized this ominous place, the place where his heart, body, and mind had been so coldly severed.

The streetlight cast long shadows, and there he saw himself—seven years old, without a proper winter coat, sitting on this very bench under the same stark light.

That night returned with cruel clarity.

""Okay now, Eddie boy, damn it, don't you move from this bench!"" Her voice was heartless, hard-edged—a tone he'd never forgotten. Her priorities were as misplaced as her paper-thin soul.

""I was so scared,"" Eddie whispered, his voice breaking. ""All I wanted was to watch her get off that bus and take me someplace warm. She didn't even send someone to get me.""

He grimaced, looking down at his trembling hands. ""Look at that boy,"" he rasped. ""How could they just walk by a child all alone? I think it's because of my skin color. Those people would have helped a white child.""

His voice was haunting as he hollered, ""I would have helped you!""

She didn't look back. Eddie gasped, the words catching in his throat. The image of her boarding that bus was forever imprinted in his mind.

Little Eddie huddled beneath newspapers, desperately trying to keep warm. The eyes of those who stared and passed him by as he froze were a memory he would always carry.

Following his mother's order, he stayed. He looked hopefully at everyone who passed during the first day, hurt and confused while he was still coherent enough to feel anything. Eventually, he stopped looking for help and hung his head, shivering uncontrollably.

After two full days, his body had turned blue, frostbite gnawing at his flesh. He lay unconscious, feeling deceptively warm in the final stages of hypothermia.

Officer Tommy Riley was a man of kind disposition, a person with eyes sharply focused on protecting the innocent and finding ways to make the city better.

He wasn't just patrolling but looking to see if anyone needed help—offering a blanket, a ride to shelter, and a way out of the dangerous temperatures that night.

He could barely see the small shape as he drove by slowly in his patrol car.

""What in God's name is that?"" he muttered, squinting through the frosty windshield.

His heart stopped. ""Is that a child?"" He realized it was and bolted from his squad car.

The officer rushed to scoop Eddie up, placing him in his warm car and frantically wrapping whatever he could find around the boy's small frame. He pressed close, sharing body heat as he reached for his radio.

""Dispatch, this is Officer Riley, Badge 4729. I have a 10-52 medical emergency, juvenile male approximately seven years old with severe hypothermia."" His voice shook as he held the boy. ""Request immediate ambulance at Jefferson and 8th, bench near the bus stop. The child is unresponsive, possibly critical. Expedite, expedite!""

He dropped the radio and pulled Eddie closer, whispering, ""Stay with me, buddy. Help is coming. I've got you now... stay with me."" Tommy's eyes welled with desperation; he feared he was losing this innocent child.

Old Eddie didn't blink as he watched what he had always tried to imagine. He focused on every detail. Pride filled him as he watched his father's every movement and expression. He whispered, ""My father was the best of us."" Memories of his father filled his mind like memories flash before death.

The memories slowed, and he played the moments that gripped him most in his mind.

Officer Tommy had visited little Eddie while he was fighting for his life multiple times and made many inquiries to his family. His mother signed her rights away and skipped town before they found out she left him on purpose.

Now Eddie was strong enough physically to answer some questions Tommy needed to ask.

Tommy smiled and sat down. ""You gave me a good scare out there, Eddie. How did you get all the way from your house to 8th and Jefferson, son?""

Little Eddie didn't speak. He just looked slightly away and was painfully still.

Tommy calmly asked him questions until he realized that while Eddie was strong enough to speak, he wasn't okay mentally yet.

Day after day, he came and tried different things to get him to speak# Row Your Boat - Chapters 5-6 (Corrected)

Not for information so much as it became a personal goal for Tommy to see this child was going to be OK.

The psychiatrists said he most likely had schizophrenia. These were the days before PTSD was in medical vocabulary.

After little Eddie was put in the orphanage, Tommy still came and spoke to him.

""Hey, Eddie, it's me again, Officer Riley. I brought you another comic. I know you're smart because you read these comics, Eddie. I can tell you're reading them by how your eyes move when you look at the pages.""

""Hey, Eddie, I know you're smart. I can sense it. That's a skill I've picked up being a Marine and a policeman. See, I can read how smart you are like you read your comic books.""

""It's called intuition. Have you ever heard of intuition, Eddie? No?""

Eddie glanced over at Tommy slowly, and with everything he had, he looked Tommy in the eyes.

Tommy smiled big for a moment and said, ""You know what, Eddie? I'm with you, son. I made up my mind before the last visit. I'm not leaving you behind.""

With all his courage, Eddie quickly walked over and hugged Tommy. Tommy, surprised and struck deeply, began to cry lightly. ""I've got you, Eddie. I'm sticking it out with you. I swear to you, death before dishonor. That means I die before I leave you behind.""

Little Eddie built his courage like a character in one of his comics. To him, Tommy was secretly the character he read about.

Eddie spoke clearly when he said, ""Truth, honor, and justice."" Tommy began patting Eddie with vigorous enthusiasm.

""You said it all, son.""

As the lights from the rescue unit faded into distance, Eddie reflected, feeling both the heartless mother's indifference and his father's heartfelt, unrelenting passion.

No matter how good a father is to a son, it cannot fully heal the scars left by a cruel, indifferent mother.

## Chapter 5: Understanding Eddie and Eddie Boy

""I'm tired,"" says Eddie, but he wouldn't sit on the bench. He lay down on the grass and fell asleep. Sometime later, he awoke to the sound of a distant whistle.

He heard it—a melody, a hauntingly familiar song.

He grunted while he rose from the grass. He focused his gaze on the source of the whistling and whistled back: ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream...""

> A single streetlamp floated ahead like a lantern lost at sea. Asphalt gleamed with frozen dew; every step crackled. Somewhere, a freight train moaned, then fell silent, leaving him alone with his breath and the echo of the whistle that shifted into a voice as a figure emerged from the darkness. The boy finished the timeless tune, his eyes locked on Eddie.

""Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream...""

""Is it?"" Eddie asked, his voice trembling with an emotion he hadn't felt in years. ""Is it but a dream?""

""This isn't a dream,"" the boy said, noticing the redness around Eddie's eyes. ""Do you remember this place?""

""Like it was yesterday,"" Eddie replied, glancing toward the bench.

""Yeah, I remember too,"" the boy said, chewing on his thumbnail.

Eddie's trembling stemmed not from fear but from decades of buried emotions.

""I'm sorry,"" he cried out. ""I wasted much of your life, Eddie boy.""

Eddie boy seemed distracted; he looked around nervously. ""Can we sit down?"" he asked quietly. ""You know, the bench and the streetlight didn't do anything wrong.""

""That's true,"" Eddie replied softly.

They sat in uncomfortable silence for a few moments before Eddie broke the tension.

""What do you know about where we are and what's happening, Eddie boy?""

The boy gathered his thoughts, glancing around anxiously. ""When people grow old and die,"" he said, his voice cracking, ""they face themselves as a child. Everyone has to do this—unless they die before they grow up. Though I hear there are exceptions...""

The streetlight flickered above them, casting shifting shadows across their faces—one weathered by time, one a vibrant teenager, both carrying the same soul. In the distance, another light flickered.

""This is kinda freaky, man. Sorry... I gotta go..."" The boy stood up.

""I thought you had to judge me,"" Eddie said, confused.

""Not me,"" the boy answered, pointing to the flickering light. ""Him. But first, you gotta hold on to my arm, and I gotta hold on to yours.""

""Okay, if that's what you want, Eddie boy."" They clasped each other's forearms in a firm grip.

""Wait a second!"" Eddie exclaimed. ""Whoa, what's happening? Why are you disappearing? Where are you going?""

""I'm outta here,"" the boy said. ""Just remember it's not a dream. It's so much more than a dream.""

""Hey, Eddie boy, wait, I need to tell you something important.""

Eddie boy said, ""I won't remember any of this. Just remember me."" Eddie boy's image faded until it was gone.

Eddie briefly pondered the strange way his teenage self disappeared and how nervous Eddie boy was.

*Hell, I don't remember being that anxious.* He turned towards the coming light.

Eddie was struck with nervousness as his intuition told him who approached.

Time seemed to warp and distort as Eddie watched someone holding a light, moving it with childlike wonder—up and down, side to side, occasionally spinning it in circles. Eddie removed his glasses and cleaned them with a familiar gesture.

""It's me,"" he said softly. ""Playing with a flashlight.""

Little Eddie turned toward the streetlight, flickering it playfully, adding his own sound effects.

""Bet you can't hit me with that beam,"" Eddie teased, grinning at the spark of youth that still lived within him.

The boy took aim eagerly, and Eddie played along. ""You got me!"" he declared, pretending to fall dramatically onto the bench.

Eddie boy asked, ""Hey, you okay?""

Eddie opened one eye and said, ""Yeah, don't I look okay?""

Eddie boy laughed. ""You're crazy.""

Eddie studied the boy, trying to recall how he'd felt and thought at that age. Tears formed as he watched the boy play.

""Easy with that light,"" Eddie said gently, smiling at the memory of his own childhood energy.

""Do you know who I am?"" the Eddie boy asked.

""Yes,"" Eddie answered, meeting his gaze. ""You're me."" His voice cracked with emotion.

He smiled and chuckled while he watched Eddie boy play as he should, with unbridled freedom.

Old Eddie's smile was wide and enthusiastic.

Eddie boy disappeared into the darkness, then bounded back into the glow of the streetlight, dancing. Eddie laughed. ""Come on, Eddie!""

""Show me what you've got,"" Eddie boy challenged.

Eddie laughed and said, ""OK, but it's been a long, long time.""

Eddie moved with surprising rhythm, remembering what he thought he'd lost.

""There you go! You still have it, Eddie.""

Soon, Eddie stopped to catch his breath, and the boy settled down beside him.

""Hard to stay still sometimes, isn't it?"" Eddie said.

""Mmhm..."" Eddie boy replied.

""Know where we are?"" Eddie asked.

""Mmm... it's before you get to go home,"" Eddie boy replied.

""What kind of home? Heaven?""

Eddie boy gently patted Eddie's shoulder. Eddie looked at the touch, then slowly met the boy's eyes.

""It's home,"" Eddie boy said, with the brightest smile Eddie could remember.

As they sat together, buried memories resurfaced. Eddie's heart thundered with emotion.

""I'm sorry, Eddie boy... I wasted your twilight. I hid away in that house and gave up on you. I never thought about what you wanted.""

Eddie boy shook his head, scooting closer. ""Remember this?"" he asked softly.

He began patting Eddie with familiar tenderness. ""No one ever patted us when we were babies,"" Eddie boy said.

""Maybe that's why you stayed up in that house... why you avoided neighbors. Why you couldn't be happy. Maybe you just needed family to be happy..."" He paused. ""I saw you, though... saw how hard you tried. You stayed. It's my favorite memories,"" Eddie boy said. ""It's okay. You took good care of your kids.""

""Look,"" little Eddie pointed. ""It's us.""

The streetlight projected a scene of Eddie at twenty-five, gently patting newborn Kenneth with the same rhythm he now felt on his shoulder.

Eddie boy smiled with pure joy as Eddie tentatively patted his shoulder in return. ""See?"" Eddie boy said.

""He was such a happy baby,"" Eddie recalled, his voice trembling.

Their faces mirrored each other in a smile. A new father, younger Eddie, sang softly, ""Oh sweet pea, won't you dance with me..."" Carol's voice rang out, ""Eddie, look!"" They watched baby Kenneth discovering water for the first time, mesmerized by its gentle flow through his tiny fingers. Eddie and Carol stood together, pillars of love and stability.

""Lucky babies,"" Eddie boy murmured.

""It's the light..."" Eddie boy said.

""What light?"" Eddie asked.

""What you did,"" he replied, pointing first to Eddie, then to the scene.

""I love you, Eddie,"" Carol's voice echoed as the memory showed the couple embracing in their kitchen, Carol's face glowing with comforting warmth.

""See?"" Eddie boy said, nudging Eddie. ""You made her glow; you made her happy... I told ya you did good.""

More memories unfolded: Kenneth taking his first steps into Eddie's arms, father and son playing catch, late-night homework sessions, Carol's home-cooked meals, and Eddie determinedly typing his first book—the one he nearly threw away, though Carol somehow knew it was special.

""I never imagined it would really happen,"" Eddie whispered.

As he reminisced of innocence and felt the truth of his heart, he was taken away by a vision of his mother screaming foul words so loud in his ear it brought him physical pain and emotional damage he could never fully shake from his soul.

""Mama didn't love us,"" Eddie said softly.

""She did,"" Eddie boy insisted. ""She was sick. The drugs...""

""She wasn't good even before that,"" said old Eddie.

""I know. I try not to think about it.""

Old Eddie spoke of the past. ""She left us at a bus stop. Said she'd be right back. We stayed for two days until Dad came.""

""Every day, we wondered if we should have waited longer... if we should go back, in case she returned to apologize. I watched out windows for years, thinking she wouldn't leave forever.""

""She wasn't like other moms,"" little Eddie boy said, ""but she did come home sometimes. She could be real sometimes, remember?""

Eddie said, ""Eddie boy, I truly don't remember.""

""Mhm... I want to go home, Eddie. No more talk about Mama.""

""Deal, Eddie boy.""

""It gets harder,"" Eddie boy warned. ""This isn't easy, what we're doing. It's not home yet. It's up to both of us.""

He paused, listening as a baby's cry echoed through the air. Eddie recognized it instantly, and a surge of pain, fear, and anger followed.

""No! I'm done!"" Eddie shouted, lumbering into the darkness. ""I can't, Eddie boy. I just can't.""

""We gotta,"" Eddie boy called after him. ""To go home, we gotta see.""

Eddie stood in the darkness, his back turned to the heart-wrenching sound. ""Lisa, my baby girl... I can't abandon her again..."" Slowly, he turned around, tears flowing freely. ""My Lisa, my baby girl...""

He dropped to one knee, hands clasped in front of him, forced to see what he'd run from for so many years.

The projection flickered to life:

""She's perfect,"" Carol said, beaming.

""She's beautiful. My daughter,"" Eddie's voice echoed, filled with pride.

""She really was perfect,"" Eddie whispered.

Eddie boy knelt beside him, mirroring his posture. His breathing grew labored; he pressed a hand to his chest. Eddie looked to Eddie boy and asked, ""Does this hurt you?"" 

Eddie boy answered, ""It's real hard this time."" 

Eddie's short fuse was ignited.Eddie rose to his feet, pacing anxiously as the scene darkened. ""Where is He?"" he shouted into the void. ""I want answers! How could You let it happen, God? Why did she have to suffer? Why would You do that? It should be against the rules!"" His voice thundered. ""Against the laws of the universe!""

Eddie boy rushed forward, pulling Eddie's collar down to his height and whispering, ""She's home, it's okay. Listen...""

Laughter rose from the darkness.

""Lisa!"" Eddie shouted, his face alight with sudden joy. He cupped his hands around his mouth, calling toward the laughter. He stood shouting her name repeatedly with unbound joy. In his excitement, he lost sight of Eddie boy.

""Eddie boy... oh, he's hiding... Eddie boy, come back from the dark... I can't find you..."" His heart pounded. ""Eddie boy! Don't leave me here. I want to be with you and Lisa!""

From the darkness came Eddie boy's voice: ""This was never about us.""

""You're going to leave me here?"" Eddie asked, disbelief etched on his face.

""You're not left,"" Eddie boy replied. ""You come home when you want. You didn't hurt anybody, Eddie.""

""You're good inside, see? I said you was, didn't I?""

Eddie shouted, ""Yes, you did, but come back; I need to know more. What is up to me?""

""You'll see,"" he answered. ""I can't tell, but it's going to be real hard.""

Eddie boy shouted, ""Remember, we always dance together. Your stories are just like mine... Think about both you and me when you write your next story. You couldn't even dream about what's next, Eddie!""

""I don't understand!"" Eddie called into the cold night air.

The song ""Row Your Boat"" had been stuck in his head, and he hummed. He was truly afraid, but he had been afraid before. He was so much more afraid then than he was now. Briefly, he imagined the carnage of war he blocked until they seemed gone. He was lost in thought of his fallen brothers, and he cried out, ""Against the laws of the universe!""

Then, lights in the distance appeared as 8th and Jefferson began to manifest.

Snow curled across the road in thin, brittle sheets. The bus's brakes hissed, steam billowed from the wheel-wells, and yellow interior light spilled onto the drifts—more stage-light than shelter.

On the bus, the driver sings: *Row, row, row your boat, gently down the river, if you see a polar bear, don't forget to shiver.*

## Chapter 6: Cora

The bus slowly approached, and his glasses reflected the headlights like mirrors. The bus engine idled to a stop. Eddie saw an old woman he didn't recognize. Her movements were slow and labored. She stopped and looked toward Eddie, shaking her head as light flurries danced in the rising breeze.

""This is your stop,"" the driver said.

""I want to get off at another stop,"" the old woman said, fear in her voice.

""This is the last stop,"" the driver insisted.

""Is it?"" she said, looking back at the bench. A vision of Eddie, his skin tinged blue, his body limp and lifeless, flashed before her eyes.

She lowered her head.

""Ma'am, please exit the bus,"" the driver yelled. He turned his head with a look of pure utter malice. His eyes resembled polished mirrored black obsidian. ""Now, Cora,"" he said, pointing to his black eyes. He mouthed the words: *Hell awaits.*

She trembled with horror. ""Okay, sir."" She whispered, feeling faint as she staggered down the steps of the bus.

Eddie gulped after hearing her name. Confusion, fear, and a strange sense of recognition washed over him as his heart thumped hard and fast. He gathered himself as she stepped off the bus.

The bus driver smiled and waved in a friendly manner to Eddie as he drove on.

They stood silently, the only sound the wind whistling through the bare branches of the trees as the flurries increased.

Cora, now a very old woman, looked at the ground. ""I-I have been waiting on that bus for you, for I don't know how long,"" she began, her voice trembling. ""Voices talk to me, telling me what I did to you. They aren't nice voices."" She paused, her eyes filled with fear.

""You almost died while I danced. They tell me, they tell me loud and often, Eddie boy. I waited in...""

Eddie's voice rose, ""I waited on that same goddamn bench under that same flickering light.""

The sounds of a bustling city street filled the air. Eddie saw himself, small and shivering, huddled beneath a tattered newspaper on the bench.

""No, look, Mama!"" he cried, his voice loud and hollow. ""I was blue, I was moments away from death! I should have been worth more! Stray dogs had it better than me... At least they have each other to sleep against...""

""Eddie, I..."" Cora started, reaching a hand out as if to touch the projection, but it wavered and fell back to her side. A tear traced a path down her frail, trembling cheek. ""I was young... and so lost before you were even born. I thought those men, that life... that's all there was, all I deserved."" She looked at Eddie, her eyes pleading for understanding he might not be able to give. ""I was a bad mother, but I never meant for you to be so cold.""

""Oh, the voices,"" she said, clutching her head in her hands. ""They tell me horrible things. Please... I have relived this over and over.""

""I relived that cold-ass shit my whole life!"" Eddie shouted, his voice thick with rage. ""Am I supposed to feel sorry for you now?""

A projection of Eddie boy lying in the dark on his bed of dirty clothes appeared. He moaned, grimacing, ""Mama, help...""

""See, Mama, that's what starvation looks like! Go fuck yourself, Cora. You ain't my mama! Hell, you ain't even human, Cora.""

""Please... I know, I'm sorry,"" she whispered, her voice seemed to echo in the wind, tears and anguish pouring through her weak frame.

Eddie's voice, deep and resonant, boomed like thunder, as if it could shatter the very foundations of hell. ""Look!"" he roared. ""He saved my life. He took care of me. The police you hated were my savior. He stayed and took me in as if I was his own blood. My father! His name was Tommy Riley! I'm Eddie Riley! Not Eddie Holmes!""

""Who's my father, Cora?""

""Tommy Riley..."" she whispered, her voice barely audible above the wind.

A gust howled through the bus stop, and the scene around them became a blizzard.

""I'm cold,"" Cora said, her teeth chattering.

""Well, I'm hot, Cora. Stand there and just be cold."" His voice, raw with anguish, cracked. ""Don't try and make me feel sorry for you. I ain't gotta feel nothing for you! Do you? Do you feel something for me?""

He remained silent, his hands trembling as tears welled in his eyes. Eddie sat, drained from the adrenaline-fueled anger, his forehead resting in his palm as he thought it over.

The cold couldn't penetrate the burning rage within him, and his mother's presence offered no solace to his wounded heart. Exhausted, he gave up, his eyes growing heavy. He sat for a long time, trying not to think. It had been a heavier journey than old Eddie could have ever imagined.

He glanced back to where his mother had stood, his heart sinking as he realized she was gone. ""Cora!"" He spun around frantically. ""Cora!""

A lump in the snow caught his eye. He dropped to his knees, digging desperately until he uncovered her blue hand. The snow was cold and unforgiving, biting into his skin. His deep breaths echoed in the silent night.

Finally, he managed to free her from the snowdrift and carried her limp body to the bench. He lay against her, desperately trying to warm her. ""My warmth isn't enough,"" he whispered. ""Cora...""

""Eddie boy, can you call me Momma?"" she rasped weakly.

""I can't save you, Momma. I'm not enough. Did you love me at all?""

""I don't know what love is, son.""

Eddie hesitated, then asked softly, ""Did anyone ever love you, Momma?""

Her tears froze on her cheeks like tiny diamonds in the moonlight. She whispered, ""You did..."" Cora's body shook with pain and deep, dark shame.

""I threw you away and left you in the cold, but I never thought nobody would help you.""

Eddie gently replied, ""I learned a lot in my life. Yes, you had free will and chose to harm me. Yes, you were a bad mother in every sense, but you never had a teacher. Tommy Riley is my father and teacher.""

""I want to learn, Eddie. Please don't send me to hell.""

""Momma, I was never going to send you to any hell. Just stay with me."" Eddie screamed into the darkness, ""Help! Please, someone help!""

""Momma, I was angry and wasn't listening. Momma, I think you need help. Looking back, your behavior wasn't that of mental stability. I think we can help. I'm sorry you are hearing voices.""

The faint sound of sirens and flashing police lights cut through the storm. ""Someone's coming, Momma!""

Cora's voice cracked painfully. ""I treated you so bad, but you still hugged me and said 'I love you, Momma.' I'm so sorry.""

""We will teach you about love, Momma.""

Cora wept uncontrollably.

""I know it hurts, Momma,"" Eddie said softly, holding her tightly. ""I choose forgiveness.""

A familiar sight emerged from the swirling snow—a squad car pulling up to the curb. Tommy, his father, rushed toward them, his face etched with concern.

""Together, son,"" his father said as they worked quickly to warm her in the car.

""Dad, where have you been?""

""Home, son. I can't wait to see you there."" His father's voice carried a warmth Eddie hadn't felt in years. ""I love you, son.""

""I know, Dad. You were a great father.""

Tommy placed his rough, calloused hand on Eddie's head. ""Remember, you weren't my adopted son to me. To me, you were flesh and blood. Always my son.""

""I'll take care of your mother,"" Tommy said quietly. ""She didn't deserve your forgiveness, Eddie. Is she okay?""

""Eddie, she can't die,"" Tommy added.

""Oh, I didn't think about that,"" said Eddie.

Tommy said, ""It's a little strange, but you'll get used to it.""

He embraced Eddie firmly. ""Home has a special place for you,"" he whispered. ""It doesn't matter if she deserves your forgiveness. It's about something more... something rare in your heart. Never has a father had a better son.""

""Will I see you there, Dad?""

""You will, son. It's eternal, boundless. All you can imagine is there.""

""How do I get there?"" Eddie shouted as Tommy opened the squad car door.

""Just close your eyes and imagine it, and it will be. Say, 'Take me home.' Go, son! Go to infinity!""

Eddie smiled, closed his eyes, and imagined. He whispered, ""Take me home.""

When he opened them, he was thirty, riding a black stallion in his prime. The wind whipped through his hair, and the sun warmed his face. Beside him, Lisa shouted joyfully, urging her horse forward. Her sharp adventurous demeanor was inspiring.

Eddie felt the powerful stallion beneath him, its muscles rippling as they raced across endless emerald fields. Lisa's laughter was wild and free, filling him with boundless joy.

They rode until Eddie raised his hand, signaling to slow. The stallions drank from a cool, clear stream as Eddie and Lisa sat in tranquil silence.

Once upon a time, Lisa had dreamed of such a place as she lay dying in her father's arms. Lisa rested her head gently against Eddie, listening to the trickling water. As she drifted to sleep, peaceful tears flowed from closed eyes and her face glowed.

Eddie dreamed of his past life, floating weightless among vibrant, untouched landscapes. The deepest sleep without fear or regret surrounded them in violet and light blue auras.

He awoke to a sweet, familiar smell. His eyes widened and his heart raced. Before him, a boat painted with red and white stripes gently rocked on the water.

A woman in a beautiful white dress sat aboard. She raised her finger to her lips, mouthing silently, ""I love you.""

Eddie began to cry as Carol stepped from the boat and embraced him. They kissed tenderly again and again, gazing deeply into each other's eyes. She laid her head on his shoulder, and together they drifted peacefully into sleep, Eddie smiling from her sweet familiar smell. Carol felt safe and alive.

They awoke to find Lisa sitting in the boat, smiling.

""Come, Momma. Come on, Daddy. Let's go downstream."" They joined her, floating gently under moss-covered branches and an intertwined canopy of trees. Butterflies danced overhead, and trout swam alongside.

As they drifted downstream, Lisa sat behind her mother, carefully braiding her hair. Eddie asked softly, ""How is this possible?""

Lisa turned to him, speaking with wisdom beyond her years. ""Our past, our earthly existence, our pain—that's what made this possible. What is this, Daddy?""

Eddie paused thoughtfully, and the answer came clearly. ""It's God's perfection.""

Lisa nodded slowly, returning to braid her mother's hair. Carol whispered, ""Here we are again together. Praise be to God."" ""I love you, God,"" Lisa proclaimed, with depth and soul in her sweet voice.

A family flowed gently and quietly for a while.

Ahead, a clearing opened, bathed in sunshine.

""Don't rock the boat!"" said Eddie with laughter as he stood up to look.

""It is like a dream, but it's so much more,"" he said with a full heart and wide smile as he gazed upon newfound innocence.

Eddie saw Tommy standing with his hand gently on Cora's shoulder, handing her bags filled with seeds.

Tommy asked, ""Do you like gardening? This ground has the blackest soil I know. Do you want to grow here?""

Cora replied quietly, ""I'm willing to try. Can you tell me about my son? Can you teach me?""

Tommy smiled warmly. ""Yes, I will teach all I know.""

They waved warmly as Eddie, Carol, and Lisa pushed off further downstream. Eddie shouted joyfully, ""Thank you, Dad! See you soon! We wanna go further downstream.""

Lisa turned and said, ""Daddy, can you thank God?""

Eddie's resonant voice thundered joyously and unbridled, ""Thank you, my God, with all my heart and soul!""

""Okay, here we go!"" Eddie shouted with glee.

Eddie gently took the paddle from its mount, glancing warmly at Lisa, then Carol, his eyes moist with a happiness he never thought possible.

""Well, Daddy?"" Lisa prompted playfully, smiling expectantly. ""Don't we have a song to sing?""

Eddie chuckled, shaking his head softly. ""Not today, Lisa. Nope, can't do it."" His body shook before letting out a joyful laugh. He settled down, wiping his eyes and said, ""Okay, yes we do, baby girl.""

Then he looked deeply into their faces, knowing he had arrived—finally and fully—at home.

""One, two, three,"" he began with unbound enthusiasm. Lisa's spirit soared through her as she and Carol's voices joined sweetly in harmony.

Together, the words rose gently, resonant and peaceful, carried along by the current beneath the canopy's shade and beauty of nature's play on light and shadow.

""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream,
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream...""

1lj1lfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1lj1lfd/did_i_handle_this_well/,Did I handle this well?,"I don’t really need an explanation, just some perspective.

I’m demiromantic, demisexual, and also pansexual. Something new happened to me recently, and it left me confused.

I was walking around, feeling pretty happy, when a friend approached me and said:

“Hey bro, I did something. A friend of mine thinks you’re handsome and wants to talk to you. Give him a chance.”

When he said that, my heart kind of sank.

For context: I’m currently in love with someone else. It wouldn’t matter to me if it was someone of the same gender — that’s not the issue. The issue is that I already have strong feelings for someone, and in a very different context.

I didn’t know how to respond to this situation. I didn’t know the person who was interested in me, and I couldn’t just pretend. After some thought and encouragement from a close friend, I decided to tell the truth.

I usually don’t tell people I’m demi and pan, but I felt like I had to this time. I tried to explain: I might have been interested if things were different, but if I had said yes, it would have felt like a “plastic romance” — something fake. I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, and I was honestly flattered by what that person said. But I’m just not in a place right now to start anything new.

It’s not about their gender or orientation. It’s just more complicated.

“I don’t even know how to respond to that kind of situation. I’d need, like... at least ten coffee chats to even begin feeling a connection.”

For me, I don’t fall in love because of looks or a first meeting. I can’t force it — it’s something that takes time. It’s almost like luck.",1,1750738327.0,demisexuality,0,1.0,False

1lj1idn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lj1idn/related_doubt_about_using_milk/,Related doubt about using milk,"Very new to the coffee brewing scene! At the elementary stages with French Press and Moka Pot, driven primarily by YouTube tutorials and experimentation. I have a major doubt about the use of milk.

I get why we might brew in water instead of milk, but a lot of the purists talk about not letting milk go past the 70 degrees mark because then protein/lactose breaks down and milk begins to taste horrible.

Now comes the very Indian part. Haven't we all been drinking tea and in general milk only after bringing it to boil (not talking about pasteurisation, just the act of making tea). I'm wondering, if that habit has just made us habituated to the post high temperature milk? Because in one of the early experiments I boiled the milk separately, and one time boiled milk with coffee grounds in it. I didn't find it repulsive as such but again, I'm no expert food taster.

Anyone with any insight on the whole milk aspect?",1,1750738048.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. Helldivers. Destiny. Recently reinstalled Darktide. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and all that jazz. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or would be up game on Xbox or ps5. And spamming me pet pics. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact.

1lj1f1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1lj1f1a/first_703_coeur_dalene_what_i_learned/,First 70.3 - Coeur D'Alene - What I learned,"I had a lot of questions going into this race that I read through this sub to get answers for, and I see a lot posted.  With my wealth of knowledge from one race, I thought I'd share what I learned as a newbie that may help some others.

First, you can just do things.  If you want to do a 70.3 without doing a sprint, oly, etc, etc before a half, you can.  If you want to do well and not suffer, then training is hard and time consuming, but go for it.

I did come in with a strong base of fitness, but lifting and running (10-20 miles per week).  I haven't swam or been on a road bike since HS, over 20 years.

Very impressed Ironman, CDA was very well run and a great experience for competitors and family.  I ran in the Ironkids 1mile with my 4-year old.  He got medal, got cheered on, loved it.  Awesome weekend all around.

**Training:**

I use [Humango.ai](http://Humango.ai), I might as well be a spokesman now.  Took over 2 years of training data from Garmin Fenix and built a plan for me.  I travel regularly for work and was able to modify it accordingly.  I have a Garmin Fenix and Zwift, they all talk to each other and made tracking easy.

My plan was 3 swims, 3 runs and 3 bike sessions per week.  Sat/Sun were bricks.  Rarely hit 3/3/3 because I needed a rest day or life got in the way.

When I was traveling for work, I'd move those workout to a run (easy anywhere) or a swim if there was an LA Fitness in town.

I probably averaged 9 hours a week of training.  Some weeks were 12+, but some were 6.

If I was going to skip a workout, it was definitely a swim . . . because I hate swimming, and because it was the least important.

I missed two weeks in May because of a killer sinus infection, couldn't breath, walking was all I could handle.  Bounced back with a month of hard training before my taper.

Swim - Most my workouts were interval, I rarely swam extended periods.  At most was 800 meter repeats.  Usually shorter, higher intensity.  Pool swimming sucks, it's boring and repetitive.  Open water swimming is creepy and lonely, but I got 3 good open water swims in before the race.  You need to practice swimming in your wetsuit, it is different.  Learn to breath on both sides, paid off during the race.

Bike - Get a trainer.  Riding outside just isn't consistent.  You need to do it and be comfortable on the bike, but trainer is 10x better for building strength and endurance.  I had no time on a road bike, much less a TT bike.  Fun facts, TT bike don't corner well or handle rough road.  It's also squirrely getting from aero to low bars or back.  It's squirrely reaching for a rear water bottle.  Hitting a small pothole is terrifying in the aero position.  It's also fun as hell to go 40mps downhill . . . get to know your bike.

Run - My favorite, love running.  Get miles.  Get fast miles, get slow miles, get a lot of miles.  There's not much to say here.  Get a good playlist, get outside and run.

**Nutrition:**

My wife is a great, healthy, cook, so we don't eat out much.  The last month I made sure to make my own lunches for work, simple meat, veggie and rice.  The week before I started to cut out veggies and eat more bread, rice, tortillas with meat.  I didn't really carb load, I just ate good food.

Friday before I had a good pasta dinner with chicken and glass of red wine (gasp!).  Saturday I had eggs and toast for breakfast, and sandwich for lunch and chicken dinner.  Took an Imodium that night.

Morning of race, I had my staple, Greek yogurt, granola and fruit with a lot of coffee.  Another Imodium.

I like Tailwind electrolytes with carbs and Honey Stinger snacks.  Water bottles were filled with Tailwind and bike packed with waffles and gummies for the bike.  I ate regularly, but it sucks on the bike, nothing is appetizing, force yourself to eat.  Also, bananas at the aid stations are money, just don't crash trying to get one as you fly by.

I brought nothing for the run and relied on aid stations.  I rotated between water, electrolytes and coke for drinks and ate bananas and oranges every other stop I think.  Grabbed half a bar at some point.

**Race:**

Swim - It sucks.  You stare into the bottom of a lake, while swimming into people or they swim over you.  It's hard to spot the giant buoys.  You swallow a bunch of water, throws everything off and can't get in a rhythm.  Like all things, it will pass, and you're out.  Peelers are awesome, use them to get your wetsuit off.

36:25

Bike - I really enjoyed the bike.  Like most drivers and road bikers everywhere, people don't understand how the road works.  Plenty of riders camp on the left side, blocking, but saw nobody enforcing it.  Clears out after the first couple miles though and you should have a lot of open road.  CDA had a lot of hills, and I probably left a little on the bike course afraid to ruin my run.  Saw a few wrecks and one ambulance, but he was sitting up so hopefully ok.  Again, fun to go fast, but get comfortable on your bike.  Time flew by.

2:57:39

Run - Felt good out of transition and settled into a comfortable pace.  People cheering in front of their houses, plenty of opportunity for family and friends to see you with 2 loops, just an awesome time.  I was told it was a flat run . . . whoever said that was lying.  Mile 8, knee felt like it was going to explode and my hamstrings were toast, hard to turn over the legs.  Found the finish and friends cheering, all worth it.

1:47:45

Next day, I feel pretty good.  Legs a little sore.  I'm excited to lift weights again, that's been neglected.  I'm going to get on a mountain bike and golf and do some other things . . . but I'm pretty sure I'll also get another race on the calendar.  That was too much fun.

It seems like the choice really dictates the *kind* of cozy you're going for.For example, a living room with a plush, tufted Chesterfield sofa, a dark wood coffee table, and maybe a Persian rug feels like a classic, warm, almost historical sort of comfort. It evokes images of curling up with a book next to a fireplace. Conversely, a CozyCribTales setting featuring a minimalist, low-slung sectional sofa, a glass coffee table, and pops of luminous, geometric art feels more modern and airy – a cleaner, more streamlined version of cozy that still prioritizes relaxation and comfort.

Which do you find more inherently ""cozy"" in those settings? Or does the appeal really come down to personal taste and how well the furniture is integrated within the overall design?

1lj1e6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1lj1e6v/i_need_help/,I need help 😭😭😭,"I have reasons to believe Candida is the issue, but am open to other suggestions. Please please give me any advice you have. I feel as if I’ve tried everything and my mental health is so low, I don’t know how much longer I can go on struggling like this. 

For the last ten years I have had debilitating bad breath. It doesn’t matter what I try, it doesn’t go away. Sometimes it will lessen for short periods of time, maybe half an hour to an hour or so but it ALWAYS comes back. My tongue is coated but not extremely so. Sinus congestion, huge constant amounts of PND, horrible taste in my mouth that grows as the day goes on, constipation. 

For years I tried random cleanses, nasal rinses, acid reflux diets, supplements galore. Saw a naturopath and multiple doctors who have been unable or unwilling to help me. Dentists say my gums and teeth look AMAZING. 

Eventually I realized Candida is my problem, this is due to an independent saliva test, a blood test that showed elevated antibodies and the fact that treating Candida as the problem is the ONLY thing that has helped some of my symptoms. I feel as if I go above and beyond trying to eradicate this thing and all things will get better: tongue looks better, sinuses feel amazing, no more PND or slime, no bad taste for the most part, but breath stays. Honestly sometimes when I am working hard to treat it and seeing improvements in those things, the bad breath reactions (nose rubbing, distancing from me, sniffing, covering nose completely etc) get WORSE, while everything else improves. I am trying to trust the process of healing but I don’t know what else to do.

This is what I am doing now: 

—Carnivore diet (I know this is not the best diet to increase biodiversity but for now it is the only thing that gives me even a little relief) 
—extended fasting every once in a while to starve them off even more
—oregano oil twice a day
—that one acid I can’t ever spell (something with a ud) 
— an extra large dosage of biofilm busters with good reviews twice a day
—no coffee, no alcohol, no sugar
—getting sunlight and movement everyday
— zeolite when I remember
— nasal rinses with food grade hydrogen peroxide
—-extended oil pulling with both crushed up nystatin pills and then a second round with food grade hydrogen peroxide 
—- dry brushing and making sure I sweat each day too to stimulate detox pathways
—drinking tea good for the liver

Quite frankly, I am EXHAUSTED, and the one worst symptom is NOT changing. 

Things I have tried in the past: 
—taken other supplements (I’m trying to keep things simple rn lol ironic) like colostrum, thag other milk thing that feeds good bacteria, l glutamine, a whole bunch of other anti fungals and good gut supplements
—acacia powder
—fermented coconut drinks with NO yeast
—enemas, both coffee enemas and enemas with nystatin in them 
—colonics
—carnivore +resistant starches
—ivermectin 
—drinking food grade hydrogen peroxide
—I’m sure more things I can’t even think of

How is it that with ALL of this I am not seeing significant change??? Last year I did carnivore and all these supplements for over 3 months and still got bad breath reactions from people quite regularly. 

I honestly don’t know what else I can do but living life this way is killing me. I am embarrassed everyday. I have almost no friends. No love interest or possibility of dating. No ambition or ability to go after success in life because every interaction is miserable for both parties. 

Please please please tell me what else you think I can try 😭😭😭 do I just stay the course and hope for the best??? 

Also to add — I search my poo sometimes and the only thing I’ve found that is reasonably similar to a parasite is possible liver flukes but I am not confident in that. I could have lived or even could currently live with mold as I’ve always loved in older buildings, but when this all started, I was most definitely NOT exposed. ",1,1750737673.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

After landing a job in banking, I started to realize I should take my personal banking seriously. Currently, I am with RBC in a Student Package (Which expires in 2 years). I currently have no investments and just let my savings sit dry in my RBC account. I currently have the AMEX Cobalt, and I am also seeking for a secondary credit card. (One to use when a terminal does not accept AMEX)

Quick background:

\- 20 something year old with 3 bills (350/mo for my car, 300 for insurance, 200 for gas). Spotify and YouTube premium may be sprinkled in. 

\- I usually use my credit card for dining out or buying small misc stuff. 

\- Was able to secure a 3% LoC Unsecured that I may use to benefit off of the HISA promotions (Shoutout work lol)

I have been eyeing the Tangerine benefits for a bit. The 5 month 4.50% HISA is very appealing to me, and Im thinking of switching. The credit card 2% cash back also seems like a cool perk. I am thinking of swapping to ScotiaBank and having a student account there JUST IN CASE I require something from a brick and mortar. (Probably buy a coffee a month just to have the account active.)

Has anybody had problems switching from a brick and mortar to online banking? I rarely go into the branch as is, but having the option won't hurt. I have seen numerous great reviews on this subreddit about Tangerine, so it looks like a solid option.

Each day we all experience many different emotions. Positive emotions make us feel good but negative emotions can affect us deeply. Emotions can be hard to control and can affect our ability to manage our daily lives. Our emotions affect those around us and vice versa. The mood of those we’re close to also affects our mood.

Being able to manage emotions and have “good emotional health” greatly boost your mental state, including your relationships with family and friends. And it affects overall mental health and brain health. Good mental health begins with good emotional well-being.

**What Is Emotional Well-Being?**

Emotional well-being is being able to recognize and cope with various emotions and deal with stress and pressure in life through understanding. It includes being able to adapt to change and difficult times. People with good emotional well-being manage their lives more effectively, helping them build and maintain good relationships with the people around them.

**How Important Is Emotional Well-Being?**

Good emotional well-being has a direct impact on overall mental health. And it also affects relationships with people around you. Studies have also found that good emotional well-being affects physical well-being too. Practicing good emotional well-being is extremely important. Being able to manage your emotions effectively also helps you manage your relationships with those around you. Good emotional well-being…

* Improves mental health
* Enhances relationships with those around you.
* Make life better.
* Increases your chances of career success.
* Improves health: There is clear scientific data that good emotional well-being boosts the immune system, reducing the risk of various illnesses.

**How to Recognize Good Emotional Well-Being?**

Good emotional well-being is the ability to recognize emotions and manage them appropriately. It can involve many elements:

* Being able to recognize your own feelings and accept them as true, not denying their existence or trying not to accept them. If you’re angry, for example, acknowledge it and admit you’re angry.
* Being able to handle and express various emotions appropriately, such as anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, amusement, satisfaction.
* Being able to express yourself and face others appropriately.
* Feeling good about yourself with self-esteem and accepting your identity.
* Having the skills to cope with stress, frustration, crises, or other negative emotions.
* Knowing and accepting your gender identity.
* Being able to build and maintain good relationships with close people.

There are many signs that indicate good emotional health, such as:

* Being able to talk about your emotions or concerns.
* Being able to say no when necessary without feeling guilty.
* Feeling mostly satisfied with life.
* Feeling that someone cares, gives support, so you don't feel alone.
* Having ways to relax to reduce stress.

**How to Check Your Emotional Well-Being**

So how can we check our emotional health? Consider the following simple questions.

* Do you view stress as a learning opportunity or something to be avoided?
* Can you recognize your physical sensations, emotions, and behavior when you are stressed?
* Do you allow yourself to be honest about your feelings?
* How do you take care of yourself each day?
* If you are struggling and need help, do you have the courage to ask others for help?

**How Can We Create Emotional Well-Being?**

Emotional well-being is a skill that everyone can practice and strengthen. There are 6 secrets to creating emotional well-being:

1. Create a habit of falling down and getting back up

Life has ups and downs. People with good emotional well-being are better able to bounce back from setbacks. Rise up from mistakes quickly and be strong. You can practice falling and getting up by...

* Knowing how to maintain your physical health.
* Giving yourself some time each day.
* Learning to look at problems from other perspectives.
* Learning from mistakes
* Always expressing gratitude.
* Considering your beliefs, meaning, and life goals.

2. Know how to relax and let go

We have to face stressful situations. Stress makes us alert and energized in times of need. But if stress continues for a long time it becomes a chronic accumulation with a negative effect on the mind, brain, and body. Having good emotional well-being requires practicing stress relief as follows.

* Get enough sleep.
* Exercise regularly.
* Know how to prioritize what to do first, what to do later.
* Don't be too hard on yourself. Practice encouragement and be gentle with yourself.
* Find a relaxation method that suits you.
* Dare to ask for help.

3. Give importance to getting quality sleep

There are many things we have to do each day. We might get less time to sleep and rest. But sleep is vital for our mental health and our brains. When we're sleep deprived, our brains are tired. Thinking and awareness of emotions will deteriorate. Creating good emotional well-being requires quality sleep, which can be practiced as follows.

* Be disciplined about sleep. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
* Keep your bedroom dark and quiet.
* Don't forget to exercise regularly. Exercise will improve the quality of your sleep.
* Use screens appropriately. Don’t watch TV or use your mobile phone to the point of disturbing sleep.
* Practice relaxation before sleeping.
* Avoid alcoholic beverages or tea or coffee before going to bed.
* If you do all this and your sleep isn’t getting better, see a doctor.

4. Be mindful and focus on the present.

Being mindful in the present helps us to be aware of our emotions and inner feelings and of people and things around us. Being mindful enhances our awareness. We can practice as follows.

* Take a deep breath and feel the cool air flowing through your nostrils. Then count slowly in your head 1, 2, 3, 4, then pause for one second. Then exhale slowly through your mouth, counting in your mind as well 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Practice repeating this often until you can feel the breath naturally.
* Try going out for a walk slowly, paying attention to the nature around you, the smells, the lights, the scenery, the wind blowing against you.
* Eat mindfully. Pay attention to the taste of every bite you are chewing and know when you are full enough.
* Try practicing being aware of your body's sensations. Get to know your body from your inner feelings. Slowly consider the sensations of each part of your body.
* Try searching for other resources for learning how to practice mindfulness in a way that suits you.

5. Cope with loss with understanding.

Loss is natural. When someone we love passes away there will inevitably be sadness and sorrow. We can learn how to cope with the emotions of loss in the following ways.

* Take care of yourself.
* Talk with friends who care.
* Don't make hasty decisions right away.
* Join groups of people who have suffered loss to help each other.
* Consider consulting with an expert.
* If you experience problems with daily life, consult a doctor.
* Accept and endure the feelings of loss. And as time passes your feelings will gradually improve.

6. Build good relationships with people around you

Scientific research has discovered that good relationships are one of the factors that greatly influence physical, mental, and brain health. Good relationships contribute to a long life, whether it’s relationships with your life partner, family, friends, neighbors, and community. They’re all interconnected and  can be strengthened as follows.

* Build good relationships with your children.
* Create active habits for yourself, your family, and close friends.
* If you have to look after another family member, try asking other people for help. Don't bear everything alone.
* Join clubs or groups to do hobbies or activities together such as drawing, chess, petanque, etc.
* Try taking a class to learn new things.
* Volunteer to help society in areas you value, such as schools, libraries, and community gardens, or maintenance of religious places.
* Try traveling, meeting people, making new friends.

**Summary**

We all experience a variety of emotions that come our way at every stage of our lives, both positive and negative. Good emotional well-being is another dimension that is crucial to overall good health because it helps our mental health. Maintaining relationships with those close to you helps protect the brain from degeneration. Living in an environment that promotes and supports true and well-rounded emotional well-being, including activities, shouldn’t be overlooked for good quality of life in all aspects,

I have had the most traumatic year of my adult life, family members dying, my sibling needing a transplant, and my family being evicted from their home. So I am very lucky to have this friend who has visited me multiple times this year, knowing that I haven’t been able to do the same. I let her know that I would be able to visit her on an upcoming weekend about a month ago. However things have changed for me again. I lost my current contract and I have to move from the state I’m currently living in on the 30th to go back north to my family’s home. And then drive back down to her on the third. Four hours up to my home six hours down to her then another six hours a couple days later. I really want to see them. But visiting her at her home is hard. We live very different lifestyles. I’m always very uncomfortable by her boyfriend, there is never any food in the house, they eat out for every meal and typically don’t provide any snacks during our stay. Last time I visited her, I was hungry stressed out and uncomfortable because of her boyfriend‘s behavior for the entire weekend. He threw multiple fits and even shut himself in their bedroom one night and didn’t come out until the next morning. I have to rent a car to visit her so it’ll be around $400 for the weekend to begin with and then to eat out every meal adds up very fast. It just ends up being such a waste of money since we don’t spend our time the same way they are very relaxed and would prefer to stay back home and hang out or go shopping and I’m an explorer when I’m in a new place. I always want to check out a museum or coffee shop,etc. The last time I visited, we went to the mall…Overall, I am dreading spending a ton of money for a uneventful likely uncomfortable weekend. I have been so stressed out this whole year and felt like I haven’t had any time off. I feel like such a bad friend for not wanting to go, but I know I will be uncomfortable so I’m dreading going. Feeling this way makes me feel so guilty because she’s such a good friend to me. I am just so burnt out from this year. ",2,1750736990.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

No one can find out.,"I work in a costumer facing position. For the entire time I've worked here I've drank water out of a coffee thermos that's from a local coffee shop. The logo and name for the coffee shop is printed clearly on the thermos. I got it for free from when I worked at the coffee shop for a couple months a few years ago. The coffee shop has a deal if you go in with one of these thermoses you get a discount refill. 

However, I don't like coffee and I've always filled up with water because it keeps the water nice and cold, and it looks nicer than having a plastic disposable water bottle in front of customers. You can't actually see what I'm drinking. 

Some time after I started working here a coworker made a joke about me being too good for the free coffee we have back in the employee break room. And that I must be a die hard fan of the coffee shop cuz I only ever get it there. I kind of leaned into the joke without revealing it's just water. Now it's sort of become a thing around the office that I get a big refill in the morning and come back with another refill after my lunch break and that I love coffee only from this coffee shop. 

Last Christmas and for my birthday I was given gift cards to this coffee shop. I was very grateful because the place is a bit pricey. I spent them on pastries and breakfast sandwiches and filled my thermos up at the water fountain. I also got a sock monkey mug with hot chocolate supplies which I genuinely love and use at home.

My boss's boss from out of state came in at one point with a chain brand coffee and saw me drinking out of my thermos and asked if they were good. I said they were the best and (jokingly) it's the only way to survive in this place. They laughed and I laughed. Introductions were made. We shook hands. It was good. 

I've recently gotten a promotion and a pay raise and I am pretty sure my pretend love of coffee has something to do with it. My boss drinks coffee throughout the entire day and we've chatted about what the best roast is. I bullsh*t my way through the entire conversation. And how there's probably something wrong with people who prefer tea. She said I'm reliable and always ready to take on whatever the day gives me ""just as long as you've had your morning cup!"".

I imagine this is what people who smoke cigarettes together feel like. Or when everyone's drinking beer at a party. Like some kind of teamwork building exercise. Community bonding.

But I don't like coffee. I don't even really like tea. I just like cold water. But I pretend. I'll have to take this to my grave. ",1,1750736431.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

She love-bombed me early: lots of texting, heart emojis, “can’t wait to see you,” etc. We met, had sex the first night, and started seeing each other regularly. Every time = sex, but no affection outside the bedroom. Emotionally controlled.

She started criticizing me — my posture, my parenting, what I cooked. She got upset when I had coffee with a female friend and insisted we delete dating apps to make things exclusive early.

She said I made her feel “calm and seen” — and that she wasn’t used to that. She admitted she was used to drama and didn’t know how to be chill in a relationship.

After sex one night, she cried and said she couldn’t talk about what was on her mind. A few days later, she broke up with me, saying, “I keep waiting for something to change in my heart, but it doesn’t.”

A month later, she texted me out of the blue to check in. We had coffee — she asked if I’d been dating, and when I said yes, she looked uncomfortable. Then she dipped and never contacted me again.

Just wanted to share something a bit personal that’s been weighing on me and see if others have experienced something similar.

I recently moved back to California, specifically the Sacramento region, after spending nearly two years in Rome. While I was there, I found it incredibly easy to build connections within the creative and filmmaking community. People were genuinely open to chatting, grabbing coffee, sharing stories, and lifting each other up. In less than two years, I made more meaningful creative relationships than I have in 2 decades out here.

Since being back, I’ve reached out to a few people in my field that I’ve known for years, nothing major, just a casual message like, “Hey, I’m back in town! Let’s grab a coffee, would be great to catch up.” I didn’t get a single reply. Not even a polite “sorry, too busy.”

It left me wondering: why is it so hard to connect in the U.S., even with people in the same industry who I know? Is it the pace, the competitive mindset, the culture of being constantly booked and ""hustling""? I know everyone’s busy, but I also know from experience that collaboration and conversation are the lifeblood of creativity.

Has anyone else dealt with this weird silence or lack of community, especially after returning from a place where connection felt more natural? I’d love to hear your thoughts, maybe even tips on how to rebuild meaningful creative relationships in places where everyone seems so closed off.

Background:
A few months ago, my JURA failed, so I switched to a Moccamaster and DF64 Gen 2. I opted for flat burrs for roast preference and the grinder has been dependable. Still, I missed crema, so after extensive research, I added the ECM Mechanika Max. I needed a compact, plumbable machine with consistency—Synchronika was too large for my space. It came down to a few choices but I really liked ECM part quality.

Setup Update:
I dialed in the setup while chanting the mantra GRIND FINER. Started with a double shot in a bottomless portafilter using local medium roast coffee that wasn’t too old. Hoping for 17g in 34 out in 25ish; Based on my research, I set the grinder to 12—fired it up, but only drops came through. Years at the academy wasted. Chanting again, louder and more aggressive, GRIND FINER, I moved to 10—still nothing. Could it be, it couldn’t right? I shifted up to 16, and it was perfect. I thought I would make 2-3 drinks per day but now I'm at around 5 and that doesn't count affogatos.

Next steps: 
1) Going to plum then get all the advanced settings going 
2) Figure out how to clean a steam head that a wife 'accidently' cleaned with a paper towel and made it spontaneously fuse to the metal (i love her more and more each day) 
3) Flow control for a later date but I don't miss it yet",12,1750736032.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

The headlights cut through the trees like knives, slicing strips of pale light from the dark. Branches dipped low over the narrow road, and every time they lit up in the beams, my stomach jumped. In the backseat, Beebee dozed off again, but Mom gripped the wheel with white knuckles, eyes scanning the shadows like she expected something to leap out.

""You want to tell me what in God's name is goin' on now?"" she asked. Not loud. Not soft either. Just tired.

""We need to go to Papaw Zeke's,"" I said. ""He can help us. He knows how to stop it.""

She glanced over at me, but didn't say anything.

""I should've told you sooner,"" I said. ""I didn't know how. I didn't want to scare you. Or Beebee.""

She kept her eyes on the road. ""You should've.""

""I tried,"" I said quietly. ""Back when Beebee first started seeing it, I told you what he said. You told me it was just an old story. I figured you wouldn't believe me.""

She still didn't speak, but I saw her jaw tighten.

""It started small. Beebee talkin' to something I couldn't see. Then the drawings. Then the window. Every time I tried to say more, it felt like the words got stuck in my throat. Like something didn't want me to speak. I just thought if I got him out of the house, out of the woods, maybe it would stop.""

""What is it?"" she asked. 

""Somethin' old. Somethin' that lives in the trees,"" I said. ""I don't know that it's really the Green Man from the stories, but it's somethin' like it.""

The trees broke suddenly, and gravel cracked under the tires. Mom pulled into Papaw Zeke's driveway and slammed the brakes. The Mercury rocked to a stop in front of his dark little shack. She lay on the horn, three sharp blasts.

A porch light blinked on. Then the door creaked open, and Papaw Zeke stepped out, squinting through the dark, bare-legged in a red union suit.

""God almighty,"" he yelled. ""It's the middle of the damn night.""

""Zeke,"" Mom called, climbing out. ""Something came to the house. It got in.""

He blinked, then nodded once and turned back inside. We followed him into the small kitchen, the air heavy with old tobacco and stronger coffee. Beebee climbed into a worn recliner and fell back asleep, curled up like a cat. Mom and Zeke sat across from each other at the scarred kitchen table, steam curling from mismatched mugs.

I told him everything else that had happened. The dreams. The drawings. The face in the window. The hand on the couch. The scream the house made. Zeke didn't interrupt; he sipped his coffee and nodded, eyes darker than the room around us.

When I finished, Mom looked at him hard.

""What do we do? Call the sheriff? The mayor?""

Zeke shook his head. ""No. We have to do this ourselves, Claire. I have to do it. After Pete died, there ain't nobody left but me who knows how to seal it away.""

Mom didn't answer at first. Her hands were wrapped around the mug like it was the only warm thing in the world.

Zeke looked at me. ""I need the boy. I can't do it alone.""

""He's just a kid.""

""I wasn't much older than him when I ran off to the war,"" Zeke said. ""He's ready, Claire. Whether you want him to be or not.""

The silence stretched. Then Mom let out a long, ragged breath and looked at me, and I nodded.

""Take the little'un up to the church,"" Zeke said. ""Not Pastor Mike's. The old church. Go around the side. Knock until Reverend Amos answers. Tell him Old Man Zeke's calling in a favor. The Episcopalians owe me one. That thing in the woods can't get in there, won't go near it. The kid'll be safe.""

We stood outside as she packed Beebee into the front seat. She gave me a long look, kissed my forehead. 

""You look so much like your father."" She said, giving me a final hug.

She got into the car and drove off without another word. The tail lights vanished down the gravel road.

Inside, Zeke handed me a bundle of old clothes. ""Pete's. He was a thin one. Should fit well enough.""

They weren't a perfect fit. Too long in the sleeves and legs, but I remember thinking they were better than pajamas. Having some adult clothes felt like armor.

He laid out the shotgun on the table, then opened a small leather bag. Inside was an old silver dollar and an iron nail.

""You keep these. When we find the tree, you drive that nail in through the coin. I got words what need to be said over it, kind of like a spell. Something Pete found in an old book.""

""The buckshot won't kill it. It'll just drive it back long enough for us to finish."", he continued.

We checked the gear. Flashlights. Hammer. The bag. The shotgun.  Then we climbed into his old yellow Ford and headed out to Broke Neck Ridge.

The drive up to the ridge didn't take long. Ten minutes, maybe less. Zeke's old yellow Ford groaned and bucked the whole way, tires digging deep into the muddy road. Gravel snapped under us, and the trees pressed in so close their branches scraped the roof. It felt like the woods were trying to hold us back.

Near the top, we hit a flat stretch. That's when I saw the old wooden sign nailed to a leaning fencepost.

Broke Neck Ridge Trail - 2.8 miles.

Beside it stood a thick-barked tree with three white rectangles painted in a triangle.

Zeke lifted his flashlight and pointed. ""Trailhead. It starts here.""

We left the truck and stepped onto the trail. The beams of the flashlights stretched out, then vanished like the forest was drinking in the light. I kept my shoulders tight. 

We didn't talk.

After fifteen minutes of walking, we reached an old oak, tall and blackened. Its top half snapped off and charred like it had been hit by lightning. 

Zeke stopped, voice low. ""We turn here.""

He didn't explain, and I didn't ask. He said it quietly, like the woods might be listening.

The ground turned mean after that, slick with moss, roots curling up like fingers. I was glad for Pete's boots, even if they were too long in the toe. They gave me something solid underfoot. The land twisted and dropped, then rose again.

We came over a ridge, and the trees fell away.

There was a clearing. Wide and long and hollow, like something had swept its hand across the forest and scraped it clean. 

Once we got to the center, I could see at the far edge there stood a scatter of trees I didn't recognize. Big ones. Crooked. The trunks didn't grow straight; they were twisted like something had wrung them out. The bark looked rough and scaly, not like any tree I'd ever seen.

They didn't look old. They looked ancient. Out of place. Out of time. Like they belonged in one of Beebee's dinosaur books.

The air changed.

No wind. No bugs. No sound at all. Just the thick, damp air and the unnatural chill pressing down. My flashlight barely cut through the gloom ahead. The dark felt like a physical thing pressing down on us.

I swallowed hard. ""How will I know which one?""

Zeke didn't look at me. ""You'll feel it,"" he said. ""Now get busy. I don't know how much time we've got.""

I moved toward the twisted grove, my flashlight beam dancing across the strange bark. Each tree looked wrong in its way. Some were leaning at impossible angles, others with branches that spiraled like corkscrews. The bark felt cold under my palm, rough and scaled like a snake's belly.

Behind me, Zeke swept his light back and forth across the tree line, the shotgun cradled in his other arm.

The third tree I touched made my hand jerk back. The bark was warm. Alive. I pressed my palm against it again and felt something deep inside. It was a slow, heavy thrum. A long pause. Then another thrum.

""Keep your voice down,"" he whispered, jogging over. ""You sure?""

I nodded, my hand still pressed to the bark. ""I can feel its heartbeat.""

Zeke pulled out a small leather journal, pages yellow and brittle. He flipped through until he found what he was looking for, then held his flashlight close to the text.

""Lugal shoo-zi, shu anshe é-gal, mu-zu-dim!"" he called out, his voice echoing strangely in the clearing.

The words seemed to hang in the air, and then the clearing itself responded. There was a deep rumble that came from everywhere and nowhere, like thunder rolling up from the earth's core. The tree under my hand began to glow with a faint blue light, pulsing in rhythm with that ancient heartbeat.

""Quickly now,"" Zeke said, bringing the shotgun up to his shoulder.

I fumbled for the silver coin and iron nail, my hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped them. The hammer felt impossibly heavy. I pressed the coin against the bark, right over the strongest pulse, and lined up the nail.

The first strike rang out like a bell, the sound sharp and clean in the dead air. The tree shuddered under the blow, and its glow flickered.

That's when the forest exploded.

Something massive crashed through the trees at the edge of the clearing, branches snapping like matchsticks. It moved wrong. Too fast, too fluid, like water made of shadow and wood. The Green Man burst into the clearing, and I understood fear in a way I had never known before.

It was huge, twelve feet tall at least, made of living wood and moss and things that grew in the dark. Its face was a mask of leaves and bark with eyes like golden pools reflecting nothing. When it moved, I could hear the sound of old wood creaking, roots tearing from the earth.

The shotgun boomed behind me, once, twice. The Green Man yelled with a voice that was like boulders tumbling down a mountainside. A sound that made my teeth ache and my bones feel hollow.

I hammered the nail again, deeper this time. The blue light pulsed brighter.

Behind me, Zeke screamed. It wasn't a human sound but something raw and broken. I heard his body slam against a tree with a wet crack, like a branch snapping in a storm.

The story of Lot's wife flashed through my mind. How she'd turned to salt because she looked back when she shouldn't have. I kept my eyes on the nail, on the silver coin, on the job that had to be finished. The Green Man's footsteps shook the ground. Its breath was the smell of deep earth and rotting leaves.

One more strike. The nail drove home with a sound like a door slamming shut.

The blue light flared once, then faded.

I dared to turn around.

The Green Man had stopped mid-stride, one massive hand reaching toward me. As I watched, its feet began to sink into the earth, roots spreading from its toes like fingers grasping for purchase. The change crept up its legs, turning living wood into regular wood and bark. The blue glow traveled through its body like veins of light, and wherever it touched, the creature became fixed, immobile.

In seconds, where the Green Man had stood, there was another twisted tree. But if you looked closely, you could still see the face in the bark, the eyes in the knots, the mouth in the hollow between two branches.

Papaw Zeke lay crumpled at the base of another tree, his body already beginning to change. Moss crept across his shirt, and lichen spread over his face like a green mask. His fingers were sprouting tiny ferns.

I ran to him, grabbed the truck keys from his pocket before they disappeared completely under the growing carpet of the forest floor. No wonder they'd never found Pete's body.

I paused for a moment and said a quick prayer. Hoping that wherever he was, Papaw Zeke was at peace.

The walk back down the trail felt like it took hours. My legs were shaking, and Pete's too-large boots kept slipping on the moss-slick rocks. The night's warmth had returned once I left that cursed grove, but I was still cold all the way through.

I'd never driven before, but I figured out how to start Zeke's old Ford and managed to keep it in gear. I let it coast almost all the way down the mountain road. The engine whined and bucked, but it got me there. By the time I reached the old stone church, the sky was turning gray with dawn.

Mom and Beebee ran out to meet me, and I fell into their arms, finally letting myself shake apart. Beebee hugged my neck and asked why I was wearing old grown-up clothes, and I told him it was because mine had gotten dirty.

It was over. The thing that had been calling to my brother from the woods was sealed away, bound with iron and silver and words older than memory. The forest was just a forest again.

But I knew I'd be back someday. The nail wouldn't hold forever, and someone would need to remember the words, remember the way up to that twisted grove where ancient things sleep fitfully in the dark.

Some knowledge comes with a price, and some prices you pay for the rest of your life.

I'd let myself believe the camp had pushed the shadows away. Perhaps we'd outrun what lived in the trees. But I was wrong. The shadows had been waiting.

The rain began as a whisper on the windshield. Only a soft hiss, nothing more. But by the time we were halfway home, it had thickened into a unseasonably cold, needling drizzle, turning the roads slick and mean.

Pastor Mike slowed the van's engine to an idle and by the time the sign for Carson's Knob Station drifted into view, every edge of the world felt slippery and dangerous.

Beebee slept beside me, his head against the fogged-up window, and he snored softly, completely spent. His fingers twitched now and again, like he was still building something in his dreams.

We stopped at the gas station so folks could use the bathroom or grab snacks. Pastor Mike was at the pump. Some of the other boys stretched their legs or got a soda from the machine outside. Beebee didn't stir when I nudged him, so I stepped out alone and slipped into the garish hum of the mini-mart lights.

That's when I heard them. Two women were by the coffee machine, speaking low. Not whispering, exactly, but close. Like they didn't want to be overheard.

""You hear they found what happened to Kit Jacobson?"" a younger voice asked.

""Lord, yes. Up at Carson's Knob. Heard it looked like the forest chewed him up and spit him out,"" an older voice replied.

""Three days he was gone. Just three. God bless ‘em. Poor folks."" 

I stopped in my tracks between the candy rack and the squeaking hot dog roller. My stomach turned to stone.

The air in the store felt tighter. My face flushed with heat, and every breath tasted like rust.

Kit Jacobson was Beebee's age. I'd been to his house, we both had. Beebee went to his birthday party.

It could've been him. Would've been, if we hadn't gone to camp. If we hadn't left when we did.

The candy bar I ate tasted like cardboard.

Mom met us in the church parking lot. She didn't smile. Just stood beside the Mercury, arms folded, already bracing herself. She hugged us without a word and barely looked at me.

The drive home was dead quiet. I remember watching the tree line blur past, the rain streaking sideways like the woods were trying to reach in.

We pulled up, the porch light throwing long shadows across the siding.

Inside, she locked the door behind us. Didn't say a word.

She got a pot of soup going, and the scent should've been comforting, but the warmth of it couldn't quite chase the chill that had followed us home.

We ate in silence. The only sounds were the faint clinking of spoons and the hum of the fridge. But I could feel it. She was trying to find the words.

When she finally spoke, it came out sharp, like she'd been holding her breath.

""Something happened to the Jacobson boy. Kit. Nobody's got no answers, and the whole town's on edge.""

She didn't need to say more.

""No woods. No errands. No walking to town,"" She continued, her voice flat, like the decision had been carved in stone.

""You boys stay in sight. I mean it.""

I looked at her hands wrapped around that chipped coffee mug, her knuckles bloodless from the grip.

And I understood.

She didn't say it out loud. Not with Beebee humming softly beside me, tapping his fingers against the table like he heard music I couldn't. But she didn't have to. I saw it in the set of her jaw, in the way she flicked her eyes to the living room window and back, and in the tired, concerned look behind her glasses. 

She didn't have the whole story. But she knew enough.

Enough to know something had come out of those trees and taken a child.

""You hear me?"" she said, quietly, her eyes not on Beebee, but on me.

I nodded.

That night, I woke up with a start.  Not to a sound, or a dream, but to the unmistakable feeling that something was deeply, terribly wrong.

There wasn't a sound, no dream to shake off. There was only the sudden, absolute awareness that something was wrong.

The air was dense. Not warm, not cold, but heavy, like the air was full of water that hadn't turned to rain yet. 

A shiver ran over me. Not from any chill, but from instinct.

I listened. Beebee was still breathing, soft and steady.

Then I heard it.

Not the house settling. Not the wind. The walls were groaning.

Wood shifted under pressure. Nails ticked and popped like old joints giving way. The sound came from everywhere, like the walls were bracing themselves against a weight they wasn't built to carry.

The nightlight flickered briefly, and for a second, the room went completely dark. When it returned, the shadows were longer. Closer.

The room grew cold and clammy, and for a moment, I had the image of being in the mouth of something dead and rotting.

Then I saw it.

A massive, bark-covered arm unfolded outside the window. A hand with fingers too long, too many joints. There was no knocking or clawing; It simply rested against the glass like it wanted to feel the warmth inside.

Then came the face.

It emerged from the gloom, slow and soundless. From the trees. From somewhere else entirely. Like a memory rising from water.

Moss and lichen threaded through the bark. Leaves curled outward like a crown. Its eyes were shut. But even closed, I felt them on me.

Then, slowly, with unbearable patience, they opened.

Amber. Wide. Unnatural.

They were too large. Perfect amber circles with impossibly tiny pupils. Pinpricks in molten gold. Eyes that didn't belong to anything human. Eyes that held time in them. Not years. Ages. Eternity.

The room dimmed. The nightlight seemed further away, as if it were losing ground.

Those eyes looked through me. They knew. And in them, I saw something ancient and eternal. Not death. Something that watched death pass by.

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe.

I blinked. And I felt the memories come back.

It had always been there. Every time Beebee watched the woods. Every time I turned away and shrugged it off. It had been watching.  And it had made me forget.

In a blink, it was gone.

Then the house... screamed.

Not the wind. Not the trees. The house.

My ears rang as the walls groaned. Wood shrieked as it was stressed near the breaking point. Glass shattered somewhere in the front room. I jumped from the bunk, feet hitting the cold floor as the house trembled around us.

I heard Mom's feet before I saw her. Barefoot, frantic, nightgown twisted.

""Boys,"" she said, breath ragged. ""I don't know what in Sam Hill is goin' on, but we need to go. Now.""

She turned to grab her purse or keys, or maybe moved on instinct. 

But Beebee didn't flinch. He looked toward the living room and said, in a voice too calm for any child:

""He came to play.""

Mom froze. Then she grabbed us both and ushered us down the short hallway.

We rounded the corner and stopped cold.

The Green Man was forcing his way in. Not all of him. 

His arm had breached the shattered window, thick as a tree trunk, bark flexing but not breaking. One gnarled hand rested on our couch, fingers splayed like roots, dirt and leaves scattered across the rug.

Part of his face, the corner of it, was visible through the opening. Pressed against the frame.

Mom gasped, a raw sound that didn't sound like her. Beebee giggled, as if this were the punchline to some cosmic joke only he understood.

I don't remember what I did. I think I was crying. Or shaking. Or both.

The Green Man turned, impossibly slow. He didn't move like a person. He shifted, like a mountain rolling its shoulder.

I don't know if it spoke, not in words. But I heard it. Felt it. A sound low enough to make my chest vibrate, like something massive shifting underground. It spoke with the sound of an earthquake.

Mom didn't wait.

She reached for the one thing we were never allowed to touch: Dad's old shotgun above the sideboard.

She didn't hesitate. Didn't flinch. Whatever she saw in that thing didn't matter. There was steel in her eyes, the kind that said she'd protect us no matter what. She loaded the shotgun and snapped it shut.

The thing made a sound. Low and resonant, like a rusty gate groaning in the belly of the earth. A thick, mossy arm stretched forward towards us in a way that wood shouldn't be able to.

She raised the barrel and fired. 

The blast cracked the room wide open. Green and black matter exploded across the wall. Bark splintered. Glass rained down.

Beebee screamed. Maybe I did too. All I could hear was ringing.

For a single heartbeat, the Green Man's face, etched in ruined leaf and moss, hung in the air. It didn't make a noise. It was just gone.

It had folded in on itself, like a leaf curling under heat.

""Get in the car,"" Mom said.  ""Now."" 

Her voice was like flint striking steel.

We ran.

I dared a glance over my shoulder, just for a moment, but all I saw was the broken window and the place where the world had stopped making sense.

A well-planned vegan diet can provide all the essential nutrients, including iron, which is crucial for overall health. However, plant-based diets often present challenges when it comes to iron intake, as the iron in plant foods (non-heme iron) is less readily absorbed by the body compared to the iron found in animal products (heme iron). To ensure adequate iron levels in a vegan diet, consider the following strategies:

- **Incorporate Iron-Rich Plant Foods:** Include foods rich in non-heme iron, such as lentils, chickpeas, beans, quinoa, tofu, tempeh, pumpkin seeds, and dark leafy greens like spinach and kale. These foods are excellent sources of iron and should be staples in your meals.
- **Enhance Absorption:** Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources, such as oranges, bell peppers, strawberries, and broccoli. Vitamin C significantly boosts the absorption of non-heme iron, making it more available to your body.
- **Avoid Iron Inhibitors:** Certain foods and beverages can inhibit iron absorption. Reduce your intake of coffee, tea, and calcium-rich foods during iron-rich meals. Instead, enjoy these items at different times to maximize iron absorption.
- **Consider Fortified Foods:** Many plant-based products, including cereals and plant milks, are fortified with iron. Check labels to find fortified options that can help meet your daily iron needs.
- **Regularly Monitor Iron Levels:** Consult your healthcare provider for regular check-ups to monitor your iron levels, particularly if you are experiencing symptoms of deficiency like fatigue or weakness.

By consistently including a variety of iron-rich foods and enhancing their absorption, those following a vegan diet can effectively meet their iron requirements and maintain optimal levels of this essential mineral.

# Best Adjustable Height Coffee Dining Table [2025 Review]

The adjustable height coffee dining table is a versatile piece of furniture designed to seamlessly transition between a low coffee table and a full-height dining table. This innovative product addresses the needs of individuals living in smaller spaces or those who frequently entertain, offering a flexible solution for both casual relaxation and formal dining. It stands out in the market due to its space-saving design and adaptability, offering significant advantages for apartment dwellers, condo owners, and anyone seeking multi-functional furniture.

## Key Features Analysis

The adjustable height coffee dining table offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall functionality and user experience.

**Adjustable Height Mechanism:** The core of this product is its adjustable height mechanism. Most models utilize either a gas spring lift or a mechanical lever system to raise and lower the tabletop. The height range typically spans from approximately 16 inches (coffee table height) to 30 inches (dining table height), providing comfortable options for various activities. The mechanism should operate smoothly and securely, locking into place at the desired height without wobbling.

The gas spring lift systems are generally preferred for their ease of use and quiet operation, while mechanical lever systems are often more robust and may offer a higher weight capacity. Regardless of the mechanism, a well-designed system is crucial for the table's longevity and usability.

**Tabletop Material and Finish:** The tabletop is a critical component, influencing both the table's aesthetics and durability. Common materials include engineered wood (MDF or particleboard) with a laminate or veneer finish, solid wood, and tempered glass. Laminate finishes offer affordability and scratch resistance, while wood veneers provide a more natural and premium look. Solid wood tables are the most durable but also the most expensive.

The finish should be water-resistant and easy to clean, as the table is likely to be used for both eating and drinking. Options range from matte to high-gloss, with matte finishes generally being more resistant to fingerprints and smudges. The tabletop's edges should be smoothly finished to prevent chipping or snagging.

**Base Construction and Stability:** The base of the adjustable height coffee dining table is responsible for providing stability and support. Most models feature a metal base, typically made of steel or aluminum. Steel bases are stronger and more durable, while aluminum bases are lighter and more resistant to corrosion. The base should be wide enough to prevent tipping, especially when the table is raised to its full height.

Some models incorporate adjustable feet to compensate for uneven floors, ensuring a level surface. The base's design should also complement the tabletop's style, creating a cohesive and visually appealing piece of furniture.

**Folding or Extending Tabletop (Optional):** Some adjustable height coffee dining tables offer the added functionality of a folding or extending tabletop. This feature allows the table to expand its surface area, accommodating more diners or providing extra workspace. Folding tabletops typically consist of hinged sections that can be folded out to double the table's size.

Extending tabletops, on the other hand, often use a butterfly leaf or drop-leaf mechanism to add extra length. These features are particularly useful for those who frequently host guests but have limited space for a dedicated dining table.

Key features of the adjustable height coffee dining table include:
* Adjustable height mechanism
* Durable tabletop material
* Stable base construction
* Optional folding or extending tabletop

## Core Benefits

**Space Optimization:** The primary benefit of an adjustable height coffee dining table is its ability to optimize space. It eliminates the need for separate coffee and dining tables, making it ideal for small apartments, condos, and other space-constrained environments. Users can easily switch between using it as a low coffee table for everyday relaxation and raising it to dining table height for meals or entertaining.

This versatility frees up valuable floor space, allowing for a more open and functional living area. For example, a studio apartment dweller can use the table as a coffee table during the day and easily transform it into a dining table for dinner parties in the evening.

**Versatile Functionality:** Beyond its space-saving capabilities, the adjustable height coffee dining table offers versatile functionality. It can be used for a wide range of activities, including eating, working, playing games, and crafting. The adjustable height allows users to customize the table's height to suit their specific needs and preferences.

For instance, someone working from home can raise the table to a comfortable height for typing on a laptop, while a family can lower it for a casual game night. This adaptability makes it a valuable addition to any home.

**Enhanced Comfort and Ergonomics:** By allowing users to adjust the table's height, this product promotes better posture and ergonomics. When used as a coffee table, it can be raised slightly to reduce strain on the back and neck while reaching for drinks or snacks. When used as a dining table, it can be adjusted to a comfortable height for eating, preventing slouching and promoting proper digestion.

This improved comfort and ergonomics can lead to reduced back pain, neck pain, and other musculoskeletal issues. It also makes the table more accessible to individuals of different heights and abilities.

## FAQs Section

**How easy is it to adjust the height of the table?**
Adjusting the height is generally quite easy, depending on the mechanism. Gas spring lift systems typically require simply pressing a lever or button and gently lifting or lowering the tabletop. Mechanical lever systems may require slightly more effort but are still relatively straightforward. Most models are designed for smooth and effortless height adjustment.

**What is the maximum weight capacity of the table?**
The maximum weight capacity varies depending on the specific model and construction. Most adjustable height coffee dining tables can support between 50 and 100 pounds. It's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications before placing heavy objects on the table to avoid damaging the mechanism or tabletop.

**What is the typical lifespan of an adjustable height coffee dining table?**
The lifespan of an adjustable height coffee dining table depends on the quality of materials and construction, as well as the frequency of use. With proper care and maintenance, a well-made table can last for several years. Regular cleaning and avoiding overloading the table can help extend its lifespan.

You know the drill where they were immigrants that came to America for us to have a better life bullshit. I understand that they work day and night and is always tired and busy but they never try to understand me. I also work day and night with them but they never seem to appreciate it. I would literally just say I'm tired and they'll say something like ""You think money is easy to earn"" and all that nonsense. I used to yell back but I became numb as I know that my mother would go crazy. I go to work with them ever since I was 7 years old. I go there once I get out of school and I'm only allowed to go home when it hits 8. Then I'll have to go home and do school work that always stresses me out because my parents can't help if I don't understand. They always expect 95s and above or I'll get lectured and my phone taken away. I got my first phone during 9th grade only because I needed one for my class. They didn't trust me at first and called my school to ask and ruined my first impression. I guess that they got used to my grades being good that they think I can work my ass off and still remain on top of my grades. I've never had a allowance and the only money I get is 10 bucks every week if I work. But at the end of every week, my mom wants boba or coffee and it always comes from my pockets because I suddenly became unappreciative. I try to save up the money but it'll be gone as soon as their birthday comes up or something. I don't understand how my birthday meant nothing after I turned 10 but I'd still have to celebrate their's. Trust me I have tried to negotiate with them and talk about my feelings many times but nothing ever changes. They would be nice for a day and it'll be back to the way it was. It's not worth all the hassle and my tears. After all my hard work in highschool, I finally got into a ""good"" college and somehow they can't pay for my college because I was unappreciative my whole life and was lazy. If they'd let me go to a community college, I wouldn't have to be in so much debt. They said if I had helped more, they'd pay for my college. I know that it's not true because why would aunt pay for my cousin's full tuition even if my cousin never helped out. They'd probably say how we're not financially stable but my aunt's family is in the same situation as us. My parents always said that I spent all my money on my friends. I only have 2 friends. I bought them drinks once after they helped me with my FAFSA and all the stuff that I was confused about. They said I'd rather help a stranger out rather than helping my own family. My dad would do something but my mom is the most selfish and stubborn person I ever met. She'll rather go trust what a customer say about some scholarship over me. The worst part is that she loves to share my ""bad behavior"" and complain about me to her customers. So I don't get why she hates me so much, why they both hate me so much. They wouldn't even show up to my graduation because the weather was too ""gloomy"". I had doubted if I was adopted but nope I look like them. I don't know what to do because I don't want to get a loan because of the interest. I have accepted my fate now to be a broke college student in 30k debt every year. So I hate them with all my heart.

Even when I tried to stay awake, fear would wear me down. And the moment I closed my eyes, that thing in the woods would come one step closer.

I had fallen asleep.  Only for an hour, but it was long enough. 

The sound of a gentle summer rain tap-tapping on the roof had lulled me into a much-needed nap while Mom worked the lunch rush at the diner in town. I hadn't meant to drift off. Just a minute, I'd told myself. Just to rest my eyes.

The moment I opened my eyes, I knew I shouldn't have let myself sleep. I bolted upright, instantly awake. 

I looked around, listening intently. I knew something was wrong, even if my sleep-addled brain couldn't quite focus on it.

Then I saw them.

Wet, muddy footprints trailed from the back door to my and Beebee's bedroom. I stared, frozen. 

Each footprint was small. Bare. The smell of moss was overwhelming.

I jumped off the couch and ran down the hall. Thankfully, Beebee was lying in the bottom bunk, sound asleep. 

But he was drenched to the bone, like he'd walked through a storm. Mud caked his feet, and his shirt clung to him.

I grabbed a towel and dried him off as best I could. Wiped the mud from his legs. Got him into clean clothes. Tucked him in tight. 

He never stirred.

I looked over at the little clown clock beside the bed.

It had been an hour. Maybe more.

He could have been out there for an hour.

I sat on the edge of the bed, heart pounding, counting each slow rise and fall of his chest, scared to death it might stop.

I spent the next half hour cleaning up the mud from the hallway.

I was starting to hit the wall. My body was worn out, nerves frayed. I could only stay so alert for so long. And the truth I didn't want to admit, not even to myself, was simple:

I couldn't watch him every second.

Not on my own.

We had to get out of the house. At least for a day or two.

Aunt Paula was out. Her husband was still out of sorts, and the last time we went over, he'd thrown a fit just from the sound of Beebee's constant humming.

We didn't have much in the way of other family.  Not that you could call in a pinch. Not without a long drive.

When Mom got home, she was in a mood. Some out-of-town executives from the mining company had stopped by the diner and given her hell.  Made her redo an order twice, complained about the coffee, and stiffed her on the tip.

Beebee barely touched his dinner. He moved like a wind-up toy, running on empty, eyes glassy and far away. Mom didn't notice. She was hunched over the kitchen table, scratching numbers on a notepad and comparing bills against the bank statement.

I couldn't tell her. I couldn't add one more thing to her troubles.

Then it came to me. The church youth retreat.  

I searched for the flyer Pastor Mike had handed out. I found it on the living room table, mixed in with old magazines and newspapers. ""Youth Retreat, July 14-20. Fellowship, Bible Study, Canoeing, and Bonfires.""

I skimmed past the photos of smiling kids in matching t-shirts. Pastor Mike's face, front and center, holding a marshmallow on a stick.

The camp was held a half day's drive south, on the edge of the Cumberland River. 

For a moment, I let myself imagine it: Beebee safe in a church cabin, playing games, nowhere near that thing.

Then I saw the cost.

Fifteen bucks per kid.  Thirty for the two of us.

That was darn near two weeks' groceries. Maybe more.

I went to our bedroom and pulled the old Flintstones lunchbox from under the bed. It still had the faded sticker of Dino on the lid and a dent in the side from where I'd dropped it off the porch on my first day of kindergarten. It rattled softly as I opened it.

Inside was everything I had.

Sixteen dollars and forty-five cents. A crumpled mess of dollar bills and a not insignificant pile of change. 

Two and a half years of birthday money, change from under couch cushions, and odd jobs for Aunt Paula and Uncle Henry. A few dollars from lawn-mowing. Even coins I'd picked up off the sidewalk downtown. Every penny meant for that Schwinn Stingray I'd been dreaming about.

I stared at it. Felt the weight of it in my hands.  Then I thought about Beebee.

This wasn't about a bike anymore.

I double-counted the pile of change and worn bills, then snapped the lid shut and walked into the kitchen.

Mom sat at the table, hunched over a yellow notepad, one hand scratching numbers while the other cradled a coffee mug. The table was littered with unopened mail, a half-finished crossword, and the weight of too many days like this one.

""Mom?"" I said quietly.

""Mmm?"" She said, not looking up. I slid the flyer in front of her. She finally set her pencil down.

""Pastor Mike's youth retreat. It's next week.""

She glanced at it, then at me.

""I remember.  You've mentioned it before."", she said with a soft sigh.

""I know money's tight,"" I said quickly, ""but... Beebee might like it. They have a special cabin for kids like him. It's out of town, near the river. There's Bible Study and games and...""

She cut me off with a look. Not angry, tired.

""Sam,"" she said gently. ""It sounds nice, but thirty dollars? That's a lot right now.""

""I know,"" I said.

I stepped forward and placed the lunchbox on the table. Opened it.

She stared down at the contents.  The coins, the crumpled bills.  Her mouth tightened a little.

""It's enough for one of us,"" I said. ""Beebee can go. I'll stay.""

For a long moment, she didn't speak. She just looked at me. Really looked at me. Like she was trying to reconcile the child standing there with the man he was too quickly becoming.

""You'd do that for him, wouldn't you?""

""I'd do anything for him,"" I said. 

Her eyes welled, but she blinked the tears back. She reached out and pulled me into a hug, not tight, but firm and steady. Like something holding me together.

""We'll make it work,"" she said softly. ""I'll figure it out.""

I didn't say anything. I could only hold on.

And for the moment, I let myself believe it would be enough.

I'm writing this in 2025 to warn you about the cost.","The wind made a low sound in the winter stiff grass of the cemetery. My mother, sister, and brother stood rawboned in the cold beside the new earth and I stood with them. We did not look at each other. We looked at the hole.

My father, who had been the warrant for our lives was in that hole and we were what was left. Four shapeless things set to motion by some old and forgotten custom because the man who gave us shape was in the ground and whatever part of us that knew the right way to stand or breathe was down there with him.

The ride from that place was quiet. My mother (Eleanor) sat beside me and her hands were knotted one on top of the other in her lap. In the back my sister (Clara) had listed against my brothers shoulder (Thomas.) He stared out at the passing dark with the stone face of a boy playing at manhood and I could feel his gaze on the back of my neck from time to time.

We arrived home. The air was choked with the baked meats and pale casseroles of the neighbors, a sick kind of charity that no one would touch. The portraits on the wall held their counsel and his chair by the hearth was a black void that drew the light into it.

A woman from next door was speaking. Mrs. Gable. “Eleanor you must eat something. You will need your strength.”

My mother smiled. “Thank you Carol. You are too kind.”

I could not stand the sound of their whispers nor the weight of their pity. 

They looked at us like we were relics of a sudden and common tragedy. 

I would not be one of them. 

I had to leave.

“Mother,” I said. “I’m going to take a drive, just to… clear my head”

She turned her dark eyes on me. They were old eyes. “Leo perhaps it is best you stay. The hour is late.”

“I wont be long,” I said. “I just need some air.”

Clara looked up. “Well don’t go too far Leo.”

“I wont.” I put my hand to Thomas’s shoulder as I passed.

I woke the engine and pulled the car from the curb and left behind the house with its false piety and its wilting flowers. I had no destination. I just drove. I pushed the car out onto the blacktop and the tires screamed on the turns. 

The houses fell away to fallow fields and then the fields gave themselves over to the woods, a dense and unbroken wall that ran along the old state road. Here I thought I would find a silence I could stand. For some miles I did. Only the engine and the wind that tore through the open window.

The sun was going down in the west and it bled across the sky in violent hues of orange and deep purple. Its beauty was an offense and a blasphemy. The world had no right to such colors when my father could not see them. I pushed my foot to the floor.

And then the engine choked. It coughed once and then again. The steady hum of the motor tore itself into a rattling gasp. The car shuddered and bucked and I wrestled the wheel and guided its dying weight to the gravel shoulder just as the engine quit altogether.

I tried the crank. 

It gave a lone dry click and then nothing. 

I sat there for a long time with my hands gripping the wheel. The colors bled out of the sky and left it a bruised and draining gray. I was stranded. On a road that went nowhere flanked by a black and serrated wall of trees. Miles from a town that was awash in my own sorrow. The last light died behind the treeline and the dark seeped into everything.

And it was in that quiet that the sound came. Drifting from the absolute black of the woods. It was low and it was lonesome and it was the slow aching voice of some stringed instrument.

I believed it to be a cello though I could not say for certain. I sat in the iron shell of the car and listened to it and knew nothing else.

For a long space of time one part of my mind spoke reason. I would have to be a fool to walk into the woods at dusk on an empty road. Thomas would have called me so. My mother would be made sick with the worry of it. And yet, I would have to be a fool to also sit in that dead car. 

The road was empty of other travelers. There were no houses here. There was only me and there was the sound. I reasoned that it was a man and that a man might help me and I pushed open the door of the car. The music was made clearer. It was a tune of impossible sadness. It called to me.

The trees were old, and thick black pines stood like skeletons against a sky draining of its light.
""Hello?"" I said.

The cello did not stop playing. 

It only beckoned me onward into the coming dark.

I do not know how long I walked on that soft bed of pinefall but I broke through the trees and into a clearing and I stopped. The thing I saw was wrong and it was right all at once. In the center of that small glade on the trunk of a felled tree sat a man. He held a cello before him and its wood shone with a deep and secret light and he drew the bow across its belly with his head bowed to the work. He was still save for the measured slide and return of his arms. The clothes he wore were dark and finely cut and they had no place in such a setting. His hair was the color of a crow's wing and his face was a bloodless pale. He played out the last of the phrase and the final note hung in the air like a soul loath to leave its body and then it was gone and there was only the low hum of the forest night. 

He looked up then and his eyes found me in the gloaming. They were dark and they were deep and there was a great stillness in them as if my coming there was a thing he had been waiting on for some long time.

""Lost, little bird?"" He said.

I cleared my throat of a sudden thickness.
""My car,"" I said, and gestured with my hand back toward the road I had left. ""It broke down on the service road. I… I heard your music.""

""Ah,"" he said. A smile touched the corner of his mouth. ""It does tend to carry on the evening air. Forgive my lack of a formal concert hall."" He set the bow to rest across the strings. ""It is a dangerous thing to wander into these woods after dark.""

""I was hoping you might have some way to get a message to town,"" I said. ""Or know of a nearby house with a telephone.""

The man stood and I saw that he was tall and slender and he moved with a litheness that was not entirely natural. ""There are no houses for miles,"" he said, and his tone was soft and I thought I heard pity in it. ""And my means of communication are rather more... esoteric. My name is Julian.""

""Leo,"" I replied.

He took a step from the log and I took a step back from him. There was a warning in the deep part of me, a cold bell sounding a final alarm. He saw this and he stopped and the smile did not leave his face.

""You are burdened, Leo,"" he said. And his dark eyes looked not at me but into me as if he could see the hollow ruin in my chest. ""I saw it on you the moment you stepped into my glade. You carry a heavy weight. A loss…""

The truth of his words struck me dumb. As if he had reached into my skull and pulled the thought from me. ""My father,"" I whispered. ""We just buried him this afternoon.""

""I am truly sorry,"" Julian said, and the words sounded true in a way that nothing else had. ""There is no pain like it. The world keeps turning, foolishly, maddeningly, and you are left with an amputation in your soul.""

He took another slow step toward me and this time I did not move. ""What if I told you there was a way to soothe that pain? To quiet that part of you which knows only how to grieve?""

I blinked at him. ""What are you talking about? Nothing can do that but time.""

""Ah, but time is a crude, clumsy surgeon,"" he said. He stood now no more than an arm’s length from me and I could feel a coldness coming off him. ""It dulls the wound by piling scar upon scar, burying the fresh ache under a heap of smaller ones. But it never truly heals it. The pain remains."" He tilted his head like a curious hawk. ""I offer something more profound. A release. A gift that rewrites the very nature of suffering. It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever. The hurt will become a thing you observe, like a painting from your past, but no longer a blade twisting in your gut.""

His words were a dark gospel sung to the raw and weeping wound inside of me. That part of me that clawed for release was now stronger than the part that counseled fear. I only wanted the pain to be over.

""How?"" I asked.

Julian's smile widened and I saw his teeth in the twilight. They were very white. ""It is simple,"" he whispered. 

And his hand rose and came to rest upon my shoulder. The cold of it was a shock. His touch was absolute and I knew I could not move from that spot if I tried. His other hand rose and cupped my jaw and he tilted my head to the side.

""This will only sting for a moment,"" he said. ""Then, the healing begins.""

Before my mind could make sense of his meaning he leaned his head to my neck. I felt a sharp and piercing pain, a pain of two points like hot needles driven into my flesh. A gasp was torn from my throat but no cry would follow it. 

A great and sudden weakness flooded the vessel of my body and the world upended itself. The dark trees smeared into streaks of black and the last of my grief and my fear dissolved into a rushing dark. 

The last thing I saw was the darkness of his eyes as he looked down upon me. And in them I did not see malice. I saw what I took to be a terrible and profound pity.

I woke to the steering wheel pressed into my chest. A gray and cheerless light seeped through the glass of the car windows. It was dawn. And the memory of it came back to me. 

A pale face. 

The touch of a cold hand. 

A pain like two spikes driven into the flesh of my neck. 

I sat upright with a winded gasp and my own hand flew to my neck. My fingers found two small hard knots on the skin, like the bites of some strange insect, but I knew in my soul they were not.

I was in my car where I had been. The door was shut. There was no sign of the man Julian, and there were no tracks in the dirt but my own leading to the dark wall of the woods. I did not know if it had been a dream or not.

My body felt… strange to me now. The hollow ache of grief had been muted. I knew the fact of my father’s death but I did not feel the weight of it. And in place of that weight there was a high and terrible alertness. 

On pure instinct I reached for the crank and gave it a turn. The engine caught and tore itself into a living sound, a sound of greater power than I had ever known it to possess. I put the car in gear and I fled that cursed stretch of road.

The familiar streets of my town were different. The clatter of a milk wagon down a side street was like a gunshot right next to my ear. The smell of coal smoke from a chimney a block away was like a black powder in my lungs. The world came at me, an assault on the senses. It was too much.

I pulled the car to the curb before the house and I killed the engine. I stilled myself for what was to come. I saw the curtain in the window twitch and then the door was thrown open and my mother was on the porch. The black dress was still on her. She had not slept.

""Leo! Oh, thank God, Leo!"" She came down the steps in a rush and her arms were around me as I stepped from the car. ""Where were you? We were beside ourselves! Thomas was just about to go looking for you with Mr. Gable!""

I held her. And through the thin black cloth of her dress I could feel the frantic beat of her heart. I could smell the life on her, the heat of her blood in the veins and the salt of her skin, and some new and ravenous thing woke in the pit of me. I pulled back from her as if from a fire.

""I'm sorry, Mother,"" I said. ""The car… it stalled on the old service road. I must have been more tired than I thought. I fell asleep waiting for someone to come by.""

She put her hand to my face and its warmth was a brand on my cold skin. ""You're pale as a sheet. And you feel so cold. You come inside this instant. I'll get some coffee on, and there’s leftover ham.""

The thought of coffee made me sick. And the image of the ham, of its pink and lifeless flesh, sent a gorge rising so powerfully that I had to clench my teeth to hold it down.

""No, Mother, please. I just… I need to lie down. The exhaustion just caught up to me, I think.""

Inside, my sister Clara was at the foot of the stairs and the worry on her face gave way to relief. And Thomas stood in the doorway to the sitting room. His arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes were hard and they questioned me. ""Where'd you go?"" he asked.

""The car broke down,"" I said again. And I pushed past him toward the stairs. ""I’m fine.""

But I was not fine. The house was full of their life, of their heat and their breath. I went to my room and I closed the door on the sound of them. I leaned my back against the wood. And a hunger I did not know clawed at my gut. It was not a hunger for any food I had ever eaten.

I stumbled to the small mirror over the washbasin. The face that looked back at me from the silvered glass was my own and it was not. The skin was tight across the bone and it held the waxy pallor of a corpse. But it was my eyes that held me. They were still blue but there was a new darkness swimming in them, a depth that had not been there before. 

And the pupils were blown wide like an animal’s. And as I stared the man in the mirror parted his lips. And my tongue, of its own volition, went to my canine teeth. And found that they were longer. That they were sharpened to a point.

A great dizziness washed over me. The memory of the man Julian. *It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever.* And the grief was far and distant. But in its place he had put this thing. This cold alertness. This revulsion for food. This awful and unholy hunger. He had given me his gift. And I ran my trembling fingers over the two perfect punctures that lay hidden beneath the collar of my shirt, and I knew. The cost of curing the soul’s grief was the soul itself. I was no longer Leo, a son and a brother. I was something else entirely.

The days that followed were a new kind of hell. I lived in a sepulcher of my own making with my bedroom curtains drawn tight against a sun that held a searing malevolence. The pale light that trespassed through the gaps itched and burned my skin.

My family in their grace and their ignorance respected what they took to be my exhaustion. They left trays of cooked meats and bread outside my door and the food went untouched until my mother would retrieve them hours later with a small sigh.

And the hunger grew. My own stomach was a place of disgust for the food of my mother’s house. When Clara would knock and her clear voice would pass through the door it was a torment. 

When I heard the sound of my brother Thomas in the hall, the sound of his hot thrumming life was a tremor of want that went through my whole body. 

I stayed in that room not for myself but for them. For what I had become viewed my family not with the love I knew but with a cold and terrible calculus.

""Leo, please,"" my mother said through the door on the third night. ""Let me in. Talk to me. Doctor Hanes said he could make a house call. Are you ill? Whatever it is, son, we can face it together.""

""I am fine, Mother,"" I called out to her. I was coiled on the bed, my fists clenched to whiteness. The drum of her heart through the thick oak of the door was a lure I could not long deny. ""I just need rest. I will be down in the morning.""

But on the fourth night the hunger was a tyrant and my body screamed for what it now needed. I knew if I stayed within those walls I would lose what little purchase I had and commit a horror that could never be undone. When the last of the light had gone a fever came upon me and all reason was ash. I had to be out of that house. I had to feed.

I slipped from my room and I passed through the dark house and it made no sound to mark my going. The floors that had groaned my whole life beneath my weight were now silent under my feet. I passed down the stairs like a draft of cold air. I unlatched the front door and I went out into the night.

The moon was a high cold eye in the darkness and it bathed the world in a silver light that was more true to me now than the sun had ever been.

I did not go to the woods. The nature of the thing I was knew that the herd was in the town. I stalked the edges of it and I kept to the black shadows of the alleys and the stone walls of gardens. And every sense was a fire in me, alive to the night and what it might offer.

And then I heard him. The unsteady scuff of his bootheels and a slurred and tuneless song. A man who had come from the side door of Connolly's Tavern, too deep in his cups to navigate the main road. He was a tramp I knew by sight. He stank of cheap whiskey and sour sweat and beneath it all was the rich copper scent of his blood and it was a call to the deepest part of me.

I took him in the narrows of the alley behind the butcher’s shop. He was fumbling at his trousers with the slack jawed confusion of the drunkard. He saw me step from the ink black shadows and he squinted his eyes.

""Hey, what you... what you want, boy?"" he slurred.

I gave him no answer. 

There were no words for this.

I crossed the space between us in less than a second. One hand clamped to his mouth to quell his cry and the other pulled his head to the side and the vein there pulsed against the night.

The world went red.

There was the brief terror in his eyes and the panicked thrash of his limbs and then a gurgling sound as the hot iron taste of his blood flooded my mouth. And it was a benediction and a damnation in a single instant. The relief was ecstasy, an explosive charge that silenced the agony I had carried for days. The flavor was life itself. Rich and deep and true. It stilled the beast in me.

When the fever passed I fell back from him. The man slumped to the stones. His eyes were wide and they saw nothing. A small dark trickle of his blood had run down his chin and his neck was a ruin. The cobblestones were slick and black with him. I looked at my own hands. At the front of my shirt.

A great wave of revulsion crashed over the calm of the predator. And the boy named Leo was there again, staring at the work he had done. I had killed a man.

I fled into the dark, trembling with a foul mix of satiation and a loathing for myself that had no bottom. I found a horse trough blocks away and I washed myself in the cold clear water.

When I slipped back into the sleeping house the silence was no longer a refuge. It was an indictment. I was the wolf in the fold, a monster cloaked in the skin of their son and brother. The new and terrible keeper of Julian's awful and bloody gift.

""I insist.""

My mother said the words in the hall. I had crept from my room for a glass of water and she stood there waiting for me. The light from the downstairs lamps was a hostile glare that made me squint my eyes.

""We will all have dinner together tonight,"" she said. And her arms were crossed over her chest. ""At the table. As a family. The Gables sent over a fine roast, and Clara baked a loaf of bread. There will be no more of this hiding in your room Leo. Your father would not have wanted this.""

I could not argue. ""Yes, Mother. Of course.""

Her face changed. The hard lines of her resolve softened. ""Good,"" she said. ""Six o'clock. Thomas will be home from his part time stocking work then. It will be nice. We will get back to normal.""

Normal. 

The word was from a language I no longer spoke.

At some minutes to six I came down the stairs. And the smells that rose from the dining room were horrible. The rich scent of roasted meat, a smell I had once coveted, was now the perfume of cooked death. The yeast and wheat of my sister’s bread was like the smell of dry dust.

They were all there when I entered. Clara gave me a small and hopeful smile. Thomas looked at me and his usual suspicion was held in abeyance by his mother’s will. My mother sat at the head of the table near the steaming dishes and her face was lit with the brittle triumph of a woman who had wrested one small victory.

""Leo! Come, sit,"" she said, and gestured to my seat across the table from Clara. ""I will serve you a plate.""

""Thank you, Mother, but I can serve myself,"" I said. 

I placed onto my plate a slice of the beef so thin it was translucent. I took a single boiled potato. A sprig of green parsley. I sat. The life that came from them, the heat of their bodies and the rhythm of their breathing and the low thump of their hearts beating just beneath the skin, all of it was an agony to me. The hunger that had been sated but two nights before stirred in the pit of me, a sleeping wolf roused by the proximity of the flock.

""It feels so good to be all together,"" Mother said. And she began to speak of the weather and of the goings-on at the parish. Clara spoke of a book. Thomas said nothing. He only watched me from over the rim of his glass of milk.

I took up my fork. I nudged the potato. Forcefully, I lifted it to my mouth. The moment its mealy substance touched my tongue my body rose in revolt. My throat closed like a noose and a hot bile climbed my gullet. I forced it down with a swallow of water.

""Clara, this bread is simply wonderful,"" Mother said. ""Leo, you must try a piece."" The basket was passed to my hands.

I took a piece and I tore a small corner from it and put it in my mouth. It was dry wool. It was tasteless ash. All I could think of was the man in the alley. All I could remember was the glorious and terrible torrent of his life.

""Is something wrong, Leo?"" Clara asked. ""You look as though you've eaten a lemon.""

I pulled my lips back from my teeth in a thing that was meant to be a smile. ""No, not at all. It's… delicious. I think perhaps my stomach has shrunk from not eating properly these past few days.""

Thomas set his fork down and the sound of the silver on the china was a sharp report that silenced the table. He was looking at me.

""You haven't swallowed a single bite, Leo,"" he said. ""I've been watching you. You just move it around the plate.""

""Thomas, that is enough,"" Mother said.

""No, it's not,"" he said. And his eyes never left my own. ""Something's wrong with you. You're always cold. You never go out during the day. Your eyes look... strange. And you haven't eaten a real meal since the day of Father's funeral. Don't lie and say you have. We can all see you haven't.""

A great silence fell over the room. The ticking of the clock in the hall was the only sound. My mother stared at my brother as if he were a stranger to her. And Clara’s gaze went between us and her bottom lip began to tremble. All of them looked at me.

A low pressure built behind my canines. My hands below the table had taken the napkin and were twisting it into a knot. 

I had to leave. Now.

""I don't feel well,"" I said. I pushed my chair back from the table and its legs shrieked against the polished wood of the floor. ""Thomas is right. I'm not hungry. Forgive me.""

I did not wait for their reply. I turned and fled from the light of the room and from their living faces. I took the stairs two at a time. I shut the door to my room and I locked it and I collapsed against the cool wood of it. My body trembled with the thing it held inside me. And from downstairs I could hear the sound of their voices. Muffled and urgent. My mother's reprimand. My brother's hot defense. My sister beginning to cry.

The lie was cracking.

A week passed in that house and it was a week of coldness. I became a ghost in my own house, a creature of the upper floors and the deepest hours of the night when I might slip down for a glass of water from the tap.

My brother's suspicion was a wall between us now, and my mother’s love was now fear.

The hunger in me had been fed. But it was a patient beast. It was coiled and it was waiting. And a thing stronger than the hunger rose in me now, a need that drove me from the house. A need for answers.

What was I? 

And what were the laws of this new and cursed earth I walked upon?

There was only one who knew.

That night, when the house had fallen into a sleep that was not restful, I went out from it. The car answered the crank. It did not fail me now. I drove the miles of dark road back to the place where everything had changed. I parked the car on the patch of earth where the man I was had died.

I went to the wall of the woods. The path to the glade was not a memory in my mind but now a new instinct in my blood.

""Julian!"" I called to the darkness. ""I know you are here. Show yourself!""

There was no sound. I stepped into the trees. The branches that reached for me I broke with a strength I had not owned before.

""There is no point in hiding! You did this to me. The least you can do is explain!""

""Such impatience,"" a voice said. It came from directly behind me. I turned and he was there. Julian, leaning against the great trunk of an oak. ""Patience is a virtue of eternity, Leo. You must learn it.""

I did not have the time for his philosophy. 

""What did you do to me?"" I said. ""What am I?""

He pushed himself from the tree and walked toward me through the gloom. ""Is it not obvious?"" he said. ""I gave you the gift I promised. I have made you like me. Immortal. Strong. Keen of sense. You are untethered from the sluggish, inevitable decay of your kind. We are predators at the apex of the world, beings of the night."" He paused. ""Or rather, you are a confused fledgling who blundered through his first feed like a clumsy animal. I heard of your work in the town. Very… enthusiastic."" 

A cold shame washed through me. ""He was a person,"" I said. 

""He was sustenance,"" Julian corrected. ""Cattle have names, too, I'm sure. You mustn't get attached. Sentimentality is the anchor that drowns our kind. It roots you in a world you are no longer a part of.""

""My family… I cannot eat. The smell of their food makes me sick. And when I'm near them… I feel...""

""The hunger,"" he said, and he nodded as a scholar does at a simple axiom. ""Yes. Their beating hearts. The sound is louder to a newborn like yourself. It takes a discipline you do not yet possess to live beside them without seeing a meal. It is a skill, I confess, that I myself have found little use for.""

""But this, this is not a life,"" I said. ""I am a prisoner in my own home. The sun…""

The amusement left his face. ""Ah, yes. The great Tyrant Sun,"" he said. ""That is the one true law. The price for what we are. You are right to hide from it. Direct sunlight is death, Leo. A swift and ravenous death. Avoid it as you would the very eye of God.""

“So that’s it? I'm condemned to the shadows forever? To hide from them, and starve for…""

""For blood,"" Julian said. ""Say the word. You must accept what you are. That is the only path. You crave the essence of life. Red blood. Human blood. Your life is measured now from hunt to hunt."" He stepped closer and the unnatural cold of him washed over me. ""I chose you, Leo, for the great darkness I saw in your grief. I thought to grant you a life where such pain had no purchase.""

""You did not cure my pain, you made it eternal!"" I said to him. ""I will lose them all, my mother, my sister, my brother, and I will still be here when they are dust. Your gift is a curse.""

A strange and knowing sadness touched his lips. ""Perhaps,"" he said. ""Or perhaps you have not lived long enough in its shadow. A century from now, when their faces are but a painless echo, you will see the mercy I have given you."" His words were the words of a madman. ""Now, go home, fledgling. Learn control. Your family is your first and greatest trial. Live beside them. And we shall see if you are a shepherd or only a wolf. The choice, as they say, is yours.""

He turned then. And he did not walk into the woods but was consumed by them, the deep shadows pulling him back into themselves until he was gone. I stood alone in the moonlight. I was chilled not by the air of the night but by the terrible and lucid knowledge of what I had become. He had given me the laws of my new life, and a challenge. To control the beast. Or be devoured by it from within.

The knowledge I had from the man Julian was no comfort. 

The laws of my new damnation were a map to a hell I now knew by name.

And so I went out into the night to do the work that must be done. I took to the lonely roads between our town and the next. The drunks and the tramps of my own streets I left to their miserable sleep. Their disappearances were too close to home. instead, my hunts were for men who traveled alone, for farmhands returning late from a distant field. Julian's cold catechism was my guide. I learned to be a clean and silent predator. The bodies I gave to the deep woods and the earth took them without comment.

But my brother was not a man for illusions. He had our father's eyes and our father's unwillingness to abide a lie. The sickness I had claimed as my shield had grown thin with the passing weeks. He watched me. And he knew the man I had been, and he saw the wrongness of the thing I had become.

He chose his time. One night when I was coming from my room to go out upon my hunt. To take a drive, I called it. Mother and Clara were abed. He was waiting at the foot of the stairs. A shadow standing in the greater shadow of the hall with his arms crossed over his chest. He barred my way.

""Out for another drive, Leo,"" he said.

""The night air clears my head,"" I said. And I made to step around him.

He did not move. His eyes, so like our father’s eyes, held mine. ""I do not believe you,"" he said. ""Mother chooses to believe. And Clara is too afraid not to. But I do not. I have been watching you. Since that night.""

""Nothing has changed,"" I said.

""Everything has,"" he said. And he took a step toward me. The living heat of him rolled off his body in waves and the coiled thing in me stirred. ""You are stronger. I saw you move that heavy crate of Father's old books in the attic last week like it was nothing. I remember it took both of us to get it up there. And you’re faster. And colder. Mother touched your arm this morning, and she said it was like touching marble."" His voice went lower. ""What happened on that road, Leo? What was done to you?""

I tried to keep my voice flat. ""You are letting your imagination run away with you. It is only grief.""

""This is not grief,"" he said, and he shook his head slowly. ""Grief makes you weak. It makes you cry. It makes you need people. You... you are the opposite of that. You avoid the daylight. Where do you go every night? Tell me the truth, Leo.”

""There is nothing to tell,"" I said. ""I am handling my grief in my own way. And I would appreciate it if you would stop keeping watch on me like I am a criminal and let me live in peace.""

He stood there. ""You are not him,"" he whispered. His eyes fell from mine. ""I do not know what you are. But you are not my brother.""

And with that he unbarred the way. He stepped to the side. The small war he had been waging was over and he had lost. I passed him by and I opened the door to the night. I could feel his eyes on my back, the eyes of a stranger. I knew as I went out from the house that the last door to the man I had been was now closed and barred forever.

The quiet dread my brother had harbored began to seep from the walls of our house and bleed into the very soil of the town. The disappearances of lone men, scattered by miles and weeks, began to spread to the public. At first it was whispers over fence posts, then a low murmur in the general store. Then, the matter was made ink and given a name in the *Creek Valley Ledger*.

""Another Traveler Vanishes on County Line Road,"" my mother read aloud one evening. Clara’s hands were frozen over the bright colors of her embroidery. Thomas stared into the fire place. I stood half swallowed by the shadow of a velvet curtain.

""Authorities issue warning,"" Mother went on. ""Travel after dark on the less frequented roads is ill advised until this… this rash of 'unexplained incidents'… has been resolved. They suspect wild animals. A bear, perhaps, or a cougar.""

In the charged stillness that followed her words, I felt the shift. Three sets of eyes, a silent and unified inquiry, turned to me, the family’s nocturnal traveler. The animal they spoke of stood among them, cloaked in the skin of their son, their brother.

In that moment, a terrible clarity descended upon me. My presence in that house was no longer a comfort but a slow and creeping contagion. My deceptions, my spectral comings and goings, my very unnatural being had not just cut the fabric of our family; the predator I contained was now casting a long and bloody shadow upon the world they inhabited. To protect what remained of them from the rot I carried within me, I had to excise myself from their lives.

It was the final and only act of love the monster I had become was capable of.

That evening, I did not retreat to my room. I remained among them, a silent witness to a life I was already outside of. I watched my mother in her chair, her nimble fingers mending a pair of Thomas’s socks. I watched Clara at the desk, the glint of lamplight on the pale gold of her hair as her lips moved silently, forming the words she composed in a letter to our aunt. And I watched Thomas, who sharpened a small pocketknife with a whetstone. He never looked at me, but I knew he felt my gaze.

I committed every detail to the long, empty vaults of my memory. The gentle slope of my mother’s shoulders. 

The nervous way Clara tucked a stray wisp of hair behind her ear. 

The hard calluses on my brother's hands. 

I was burning these memories into my endless mind, a final, perfect memory of all I was about to abandon.

Hours later, when the house lay in the absolute stillness, I made my preparations. I had packed nothing. My old life required things. My new one required only me. 

I took the small amount of money  I had. In my room, a hard knot formed in my throat. I took up a pen and on a single sheet of foolscap, I composed my last lie.

*Dearest Family,*

* I must go away. There is a sickness in me that I cannot cure by staying here, a restlessness in my spirit that will do more harm if I remain. Please, do not try to look for me. Do not grieve for me. Think of me only as having set out on a long journey. I know you will not understand, but know that I am doing this because I love you all more than words can say.*

*Yours in memory,*

*Leo*

The ink was not yet dry when I laid the note upon my pillow. I slipped from my room and stood for one final moment in the upstairs hall. Their heartbeats, a steady, tripartite rhythm of life, was the last true music I would ever hear.

I descended the stairs and went out into the night. I did not take the car. I would simply walk. I would walk until the sun became a threat on the horizon, and then I would find shelter and wait for the darkness to grant me passage once more.

And that all happened in 1918. 

That was the last time I ever saw my family. 

The world went on. It remade itself and remade itself again. Horses were gone. Automobiles took over. Quiet towns became  loud cities.

I learned to live in the spaces between. Chicago. New Orleans. San Francisco. New York. I never stayed long in one place. My face did not change and people, in time, would notice.

I was once a watchman in a factory that built weapons for a war my brother may have fought in. 

I was once a bartender in a jazz club full of smoke. I served liquor to men and women who thought their lives were endless. Their beating hearts told me a different story.

I became the predator Julian had envisioned. Clean. Quiet. Untraceable. I learned to hunt other predators. The brutes in back alleys, the swindlers who fed on the hope of others. It was a rule I made for myself, a small thing to keep the man I had been from turning to dust inside me.

But my family did not turn to dust. My curse was a perfect and unforgiving memory. Their faces did not fade. The final quiet evening in the sitting room was a scene I could not forget. I learned that love did not require a beating heart, and grief did not scuff or wear with the passing of years.

Once in a decade, I would permit myself to look. I learned the ways of it. I dug through the dry archives of counties and the records of men. I peered into the lit screens of microfilm, and later, swam in the great black ocean of the internet.

I found it all, piece by agonizing piece.

In a society paper from 1925, I found Clara’s wedding announcement. She had married a doctor from Philadelphia. There was a photograph, a grainy black-and-white image. She was beautiful in the style of the day. She looked happy. I hoped the man was a good man. I hoped he made her laugh. I wondered if she ever spoke of her brother who was lost.

One night in the archives of a Midwestern city, I found the name of my brother. It was on a list of men who had fought in the Second World War. *Thomas Alden Croft. Private First Class.* He had survived. A kind of pride, moved in me then. He was the man our father would have wanted him to be.

The decades passed like the turning of a page. It was the 1950s. On a buzzing microfilm screen, I found the notice of my mother’s death. Eleanor Croft, 1878-1952. An obituary. *Beloved mother of Clara Bellweather and Thomas Croft… Preceded in death by her husband, George, and her son, Leo, who disappeared many years ago…*

The year is 2025. A six-lane highway is in place where the service road once lay. Cars move at a faster speed, their passengers are lost in small, glowing screens. I stand at its edge.

When the sun is a final red smear on the horizon, the ache begins. It is not the hunger. I cross the manic highway, slipping through the river of traffic like smoke, and enter the quiet of the woods. Some of the old trees are still here.

I come out into the town cemetery. It has grown in the last century, a creeping city of stone that has swallowed the fields. I walk past the new graves. My feet know the way to the old section, where the marble has been worn soft and blind by a hundred years of rain.

I stand before a simple family plot, marked by a cross of graying stone. My heart always feels as if it tries to beat here. I kneel on the cool grass. My eyes do not need the light to read the names.

I touch the first stone.

*ELEANOR CROFT*
*BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER*
*1878 - 1952*

A long life. She had seen her grandchildren. I hope they were a comfort to her.

Next to her lies my sister.

*CLARA BELLWEATHER (NÉE CROFT)*
*A LIFE FULL OF GRACE*
*1902 - 1988*

She saw a man walk on the moon. Did she tell her children a ghost story about the pale brother who walked into the night and never returned?

And Thomas. Brave, honest Thomas.

*THOMAS ALDEN CROFT*
*A DEVOTED HUSBAND AND FATHER*
*1904 – 1965*

He died too young. The war had perhaps taken its payment late. Or life had. He had been a better brother than I was given the right to be.

Then there is the last spot. A marker for my father, his dates ending just before my own story began. And next to it is a wide and hollow stretch of green earth. There is no stone for me. I had done my work too well. The boy named Leo Croft simply vanished. This empty ground is my only monument. I am forever here beside them, and forever gone.

This is all that is left of the boy who grieved for his father one hundred and seven years ago. My grief is not gone. It has been made a pure and eternal thing. Julian was wrong. He did not cauterize the wound. He encased it in amber. The pain of their loss is as it was in the first moment.

The moon is high now. My lone shadow falls long across their graves. I am alone now. For all the time that is left. The hunger, the hunt, the life in the shadows, that is not the curse.

This is the curse. This vigil. This memory that will not fade. This is the horror. To be a living monument to a dead love, haunting the graves of my own past. Forever. ",2,1750735485.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

recently got my hands on a second-hand Breville Barista express and I'm still trying to learn how to pull good (non-sour) espresso shots.


I've been troubleshooting my grind settings because I wasn't hitting espresso-level pressure, or only barely. My outer grind adjustment was set to 1, I was getting a yield of 60g from 18g of coffee in about 30 seconds. My inner burr was initially at setting 5, so I adjusted it down to 1, thinking I could then fine-tune with the outer dial.
Is there any issue with keeping the inner burr as fine as possible all the time? After adjusting I got 30g out in 45s so it’s on the right track probably just over did it I think.

Thanks!

I used to think drawings were harmless. Only crayons and paper. But when a child draws something they shouldn't be able to, you stop thinking in terms of pretend.

Beebee did not take my going to baseball camp well.

When school let out, he always wanted to tag along wherever I went. He wasn't old enough for the camp, though, and boy, did he pitch a fit when Coach Wilson pulled up that morning in the church van with the other kids.

He was always happy to see me come back, though. It was just a day camp, and we were usually home well before five o'clock. Overjoyed, Beebee would run up and excitedly show me the track he'd made for his toy cars in the dirt or the log cabin he'd built for his Weebles.

One evening, while I was still sweaty and worn out from camp, Mom let me know she was heading into town to cover a late shift. Usually, Aunt Paula (my Dad's sister)  sat with us, but her husband had taken ill and she couldn't.  Mom didn't like leaving us by ourselves, but as she always said, ""You gotta do what you gotta do.""

""Oh, and Beebee wants to show you somethin' in the backyard,"" she added. ""He's buildin' somethin' out there, Lord knows what. Just... don't let him get too filthy. Sandwiches are in the fridge, and make sure he gets washed up.""

I nodded. I took my responsibilities as the older brother very seriously.

Mom got in the old rust-colored Mercury and drove off toward town; the engine sputtering like it was about to croak.

I had just stepped outside when Beebee came running up, grabbed my hand, and pulled me toward his project.

It looked like a child's idea of a shelter, but it felt older. The sticks bent inward like they were bowing to something, bound tight with frayed cloth strips that fluttered even when the air was still.. Tiny squares of colored paper were glued onto the frame, designed in no pattern I could make sense of.

""What... what is it, Beebee?"" I asked.

""House for Green Man,"" he said.

""Come on, Beebee, you know that's just make-believe,"" I replied.

""Made a house for Green Man. He'll come play,"" he said, completely sure of himself.

The smell of moss and sweetgrass wafted over us, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. This was wrong, not the kind of wrong you can explain, but the kind that makes your spine itch.

""Beebee... ain't no Green Man. There's nobody out here but you, me, and the rabbits,"" I said, realizing I was half trying to convince myself. ""Now get cleaned up for dinner.""

Beebee skulked dejectedly back into the house, kicking at the dirt, the screen door clacking shut behind him.

It was all in his head. It just had to be, I told myself.

There was no Green Man.

Dinner was ham and cheese with Miracle Whip on white bread, the kind of meal you ate without tasting. I chewed while watching the shadows stretch across the backyard.

After I got Beebee cleaned up and ready for bed, he lay on the floor for a while, drawing with crayons on the old paper bags Mom saved for him.

I flopped down on the old couch and tried to quiet my ears. The fridge buzzed in the corner, the breeze rattled the window screen, and Beebee was humming that same silly tune. Every sound felt too loud, like the house was shrinking in on me.

I turned on our little TV, adjusting the rabbit ears to get a better signal, just to have a little noise in the background. The Waltons, I think. 

I looked over at the sideboard where Mom still kept all of Dad's things. Their wedding picture sat in the center, framed in worn brass, flanked by his old work boots, cracked leather, soles worn nearly through. His union badge was propped up beside a chipped ""Consolidated Coal"" coffee mug that still had his initials scrawled on the bottom in fading marker. A pack of unfiltered Camels, unopened, inside it. A folded-up ball cap from the mine. And above it all, his old shotgun in the rack on the wall, dusty and unused.

It wasn't just storage. It looked like a shrine.

I don't think Mom would ever admit that, but I knew. More than once, I'd heard her, standing in front of the sideboard, talking to Dad like he was still alive. That stuff wasn't going anywhere. Not ever.

When Beebee started nodding off, I made sure he got into bed. It might have been summer, but Mom still wanted us asleep by a decent hour. As he lay sleeping on the bottom bunk, I took a look at what he'd been drawing.

It was a face. Wide and flat, but framed in something wild. Not hair. Leaves. Like it had grown out of the woods. The yellow eyes, though only crayon, stared back with an impossible depth that made my breath hitch.

I stared at that picture and knew right off it wasn't some kid's doodle. The lines were too sharp, the shapes too… knowing. As if whoever drew it had secrets no eight-year-old ought to. Something about it just didn't sit right.

Then I felt something crawling in my mind.

I'd seen that face before. I couldn't say where or when, just that it wasn't new.

Stone. Rain. Green moss in the cracks. Not quite a memory. A ghost of a memory.

I blinked, heart picking up. Tried to shake it off.

It's just a drawing.

It's just something from a book or a dream, or the TV.

But I could see it now. Not on paper. On a wall.

Carved in stone. Mouth closed. Watching.

The Old Church.

I'd walked past that face a hundred times and never really seen it. But now it clung there, in the corners of my memory, like something that didn't want to be remembered but refused to be forgotten.

The world spun, and I felt sick.

Where else had I seen it? Why was I so afraid? My guts flipped, and every part of me screamed to run. It was the kind of fear that settled deep in your bones.

I searched my memory, but it was like trying to recall a dream I'd already forgotten. It was familiar, but buried deep. The face emerged, surrounded by leaves, its skin the deep, mossy green of bark in shadow. The kind of thing you don't speak about. Not because you forgot, but because the woods don't let you.

I moved quickly through the house, making sure all the curtains were drawn and the windows locked. I wanted to stop thinking about it, but I couldn't.

Mom would be home in half an hour, and she'd be upset if I were still awake. I had to be the big brother. I had to take care of Beebee. He was my responsibility.

My thoughts swirled in a dizzy loop, and for the first time in years, even though there was barely enough room, I crawled into the bottom bunk beside Beebee. I closed my eyes, desperately trying to clear my mind and will myself to sleep, but sleep wouldn't come.

The usual sounds of the night, the call of the whip-poor-will and owl, the chirping of crickets, the croaking of frogs, should have been a reassuring lullaby.  On any other night, they were. But tonight, they sounded strange, almost mocking. 

The worst, though, was the sound of the breeze blowing through the branches. 

It didn't whisper, it called.

Beebee's soft breathing filled the space between us. I could only stare into the dark, waiting for morning.

We did a rip-the-band aid style breakup - they stayed with her (ex) because she had a house, she had family that could support her, the kids had bedrooms they knew and schedules they kept around that place. 

>*I made the hard call to be the non-custodial parent to keep them stable. I made this choice because I loved them, and didn't want them to see a messy breakup that would have destabilized their lives.*

It's been so f-ing difficult since the divorce. Ex is very hard to work with , and my oldest barely talks to me. The now 7yo and 9yo both spend lots of time sobbing, remembering, missing me. The 7yo even told me the story of her last day at school - wishing I was there and having a complete meltdown because I wasn't the one to pick her up. That was a memory I'm sure she's going to keep in her heart for the rest of her life.

I'm having a considerably heavy surgery tomorrow morning. Truth be told, I'm pretty nervous because it's the first big surgery I've ever had. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the unknowns, of being cared for by strangers, of anesthesia, etc. So, naturally I wanted to call them up and chat *just in case.* Everything's probably going to go fine, but I'll be damned if something happens and I choose *not to call* and say *I love you, I'm proud of you* one final time before the procedure. 

I don't say it enough. Is there an \*enough\*? You know - enough *I love you*'s, or tucking them into bed? or calling them on the phone to make sure they know I'm still in their lives? 

Why does being a parent make me so happy, and fulfilled... but simultaneously feels like the most soul-crushing chapter of my life? Why is it so good, and soso hard at the same time? 

*I love my little ones, my treasure.*

If you're reading this, and you're divorced or struggling thru custody stuff, or if this just struck a note with you - let me know. I'd love to connect parent, to parent. Maybe we could hop in discord and have coffee together once in a while or something. 

With love,

For context -- I have only dated two women but both were long-term, 15 years & 4 years. Both started as friends and became relationships organically. That means I'm actually going on dates for the first time in my life at age 39. 

And I don't understand. 

I went on a date with a kind person tonight, she laughed, we had good convos, opened up. But I was nervous & it's a very hot day. So I couldn't stop thinking about how sweaty I was and then I was distracted by everything around us. It was a loud coffee shop. I know I wasn't my regular self because I felt so scatterbrained. 

This was someone I had the most in common with out of anyone I spoke to and seemed aligned on a lot of things. By the time I got home she sent me the we're not compatible message. I wished her the best and accepted she wasn't feeling it. 

But I know for a fact that I got in my own way tonight because of nerves, discomfort & overstimulation. 

Anyone have any tips for dating with ADHD or maybe how to set myself up for success better? I'm really surprised someone I had so much alignment with was dead-sure I wasn't the right fit after one date but I also think it's completely valid and if I was her, I would probably feel the same way. 

A part of me thinks maybe I shouldn't be dating like this and just let things happen organically like they have in the past. Maybe that's better. I find this really awkward and uncomfortable. ",0,1750735032.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

[USA],"Long story, but I stayed at an Airbnb for 2 weeks. I chose the location because it was within bus distance of where I needed to work everyday, and because it was on the cheaper side (I am a student, and I have to travel for this part of my program but the school only gives a small stipend). When I arrived, none of the outlets in the bedroom were functional, there was no coffee pot, and no baking sheets/dishes to use in the oven. I informed the host and he ignored my messages for a couple days (which was how long it usually took him to reply to any of my messages), then brought over a dirty hot water kettle. The outlets were not usable for my entire stay (could not charge my phone in the bedroom at night, it was also my alarm clock so I just had to charge it at work every day and be without a phone all morning). And a hot water kettle is not great for making drip coffee. Almost all of the food I purchased for the 2 week stay was microwaveable because I did not have a car with me and was working long hours so could not just go to the grocery store on the bus at night. Then the microwave started sparking 6 days in - whenever it was used, it acted like it does when metal is put in the microwave. So obviously dangerous, a fire hazard, and there was no fire extinguisher in the home. I informed the host and he tried to troubleshoot it and mansplained to me how to use a microwave before admitting there was nothing he could do. He told me to use the very small toaster oven (that smelled burnt inside with burnt residue) instead of just providing dishes for the regular oven or getting a new microwave. I couldn't eat most of the food I had already purchased without risking a house fire. I have provided Airbnb support with video/photo evidence, and they said I can request a partial refund.

1lj0h0x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lj0h0x,Ultimate Tassie Adventure Itinerary,"I recently got back from the most whirlwind solo adventure I’ve ever pulled off — 6 nights and 5 full days in Tasmania (Jan 1–7), and I somehow squeezed in every major region and a few unexpected gems. Hikes, wildlife, remote beaches, car camping, breweries, even the Southern Lights — it was nonstop exploring, and 100% worth it.

Here’s what I managed to hit in just one week:

Hobart: Took a dip at Seven Mile Beach as soon as I arrived to Tassie in the afternoon, changed and Ubered to Cascade Brewery, strolled around the harbor admiring the city architecture, finishing my first evening with a nice dinner on the harbor, (I’ll find the restaurant I ate at and post in the comments).
	
Day Two was probably my most amazing day in Tassie and hands down one of the best days of my life. Of course everyday I spent in Tassie was absolutely magical, but my second day was just so special.
• Left my Airbnb at Seven Mile Beach, picked up my rental car in Hobart, drove up to Triabunna
• Realized I needed to make a booking to go to Maria Island as they were packed lol, I initially wasn’t even going to go here but so many Tassie locals were recommending I go, so I’m very glad I did later in my trip.
• After getting groceries in Triabunna, headed North on the beautiful A3 highway up to Devils Corner for lunch (this wasn’t planned at all, I just saw it on the right side of the road and knew I had to stop there, it was super worth it, great pizza + beer and even better views)
	•	After Lunch, drove up to Freycinet for Wineglass Bay: Lookout hike, crystal water, epic drone shots, beautiful lil hike overall.
	•	After the lookout hike, continued my way up north to Binalong Bay / Bay of Fires: Camped at Swimcart Beach for my first night, I made it in time for sunset and this was hands down my favorite camping spot of my trip. Weather was very clear 2/1/25 and I could see every single star in the sky; something I don’t see where I live in the USA. The aurora australis began to put on an absolute show and it was the most beautiful night sky I have ever seen. To top it off, the local who was parked right next to me Mitchell, had a great camera which I commented and we made great friends and ended up chatting about life the entire night in his RV while admiring the beautiful aurora. Huge shoutout to Mitchell!!

Day 3 the adventure continued

• Said my goodbyes to Mitchell and started making my way inland towards Ben Lomond. Took much longer than planned, maps took me on this gravel road in the middle of nowhere and I encountered other drivers who had told me that the road leads to a dead end, so I ended up turning around with them. By this point, it was already close to the afternoon and I was hungry so decided to make a detour to Launceston, as I wanted to visit there anyways. Just stopped for a quick lunch to refuel, then headed to Ben Lomond.
	•	Ben Lomond: Drove up Jacob’s Ladder in a Mitsubishi Lancer mind you, got there around 5pm and had the entire place to myself. Stayed there for almost 2 hours just taking in the incredible views, such a special place and would love to drive up there again!!
• After Jacob’s Ladder, drove to Deloraine as Mitchell had recommended I camp there and it was right in the middle of what I wanted to do the next day!! Deloraine is a great little town, stopped at the bar once I got there for a few drinks then it was just a one minute drive from the bar to the campground.

Day Four

• Woke up and saw my beautiful campground in Deloraine for the first time in day light, so beautiful and loved seeing all the ducks in the pond!! Great vibes in Deloraine, also had my first shower in a while there lol.
	•	From Deloraine, I drove to Cradle Mountain: Day hike + Dove Lake views, absolutely stunning alpine views! Great drone shots, it’s the most popular hike for good reason! Quite an easy hike, would have continued on the trail if I had more time. I loved seeing the black birds there as well; let me know what the name of those birds are! 
• After Cradle, drove on the A10 down to Tullah - super underrated town imo, of course not much to do because it is very small, but I had a great dinner at the restaurant there with absolutely incredible views of Lake Roseberry, where I ended up camping for the night after some good dinner and drinks. It was such a beautiful camp-spot, very sketchy road for my Mitsubishi to get there as it was all muddy and I had to get out and move sticks out of the way, but it was super worth it and I also did a nice cold plunge to end the night.

Day 5:
	•	Drove roughly 20 minutes to the side of the road where the Mount Murchison hike starts: Most underrated alpine hike I’ve ever done, more people need to put this on their Tassie itinerary!! Absolutely insane 360 degree views, from tin mines, multiple lakes, valleys, rugged mountain landscapes, it truly blew me away. This was definitely more of a proper hike, and all of the Tassie locals I spoke with at the top also said this is their favorite hike in all of Tassie, so don’t just take it from me!! Truly amazing, pictures don’t do it justice.
• With that being said though, looks can be deceiving, and this is where I had my major obstacle of the trip. I was the last person to come down Mount Murchison as I was taking in the views myself once the locals left, but that backfired on me and I got lost; I had to do this sketchy ass climb back to the summit and I kept retracing my footsteps, still lost. Long story short, I was lost for about 3 hours and all my water had drained at that point, I climbed up this rock that was flat so I could sit down and I called for a helicopter to pick me up. I look behind me, and I finally see that damn trail marker! Police told me this was their 3rd call that week about someone getting lost, so it wasn’t just me being stupid, the trail there is quite narrow and not as many trail markers as there should be. I got down Mount Murchison in a record time of 55 minutes, and downed my last water bottle that I had in my car, not initially realizing that was my last one. Once I had service again, I let the officer I was speaking with know that I made it down safely, and my legs were definitely sore the next day lol. This was the most thirsty I’d been in my life, it was 85F that day and you Tassie locals know that’s a pretty hot day for you guys, and by the time I finally made it back to my car, it was maybe 7:30, so the nearest store that was open was like 90 mins away back in Deloraine. I absolutely hightailed it in my Mitsubishi to Deloraine because I was still thirsty out of my mind, finally made it to the store and downed two water bottles right as I got in the store lol, still paid for them of course. Restocked on water and food, then went back to the campground for another night which felt so relieving once I finally got there. For some time, I genuinely thought I was going to have to endure the night up at the summit but thankfully I found my way back. Also, HUGE shoutout to Tracy, one of the locals I met at the summit, for trying to guide me down the mountain via FaceTime!! Even though it didn’t work and service was limited, she was so helpful the whole time and such a nice lady. I’ll attach a picture of her here. My initial plan after the hike was to drive all the way back to Swimcart because I loved it so much and I was going to be heading down the east coast the next day anyways, but after everything that happened I was pretty gassed out and didn’t want to be driving through the night. Even though I got lost, it was a great experience and the most incredible hike in Tassie hands down.

Day Six

Pretty big driving day, I drove all the way from Deloraine and made it to Triabunna early afternoon.
•	Maria Island: Took the ferry from Triabunna, heard a Tassie Devil as soon as I made it to Maria Island! Hiked Fossil Cliffs, saw wombats for my first time and admired the beautiful view! I was told there were penguins on the small island just north of maria, also turned out to be a bad idea since I decided to fly my drone to the island in hopes of seeing the penguins, I didn’t see any and it was too windy for my drone to fly back to Maria, so it is in the Tasman Sea now lol. I had been absolutely blessed with incredible weather that whole week, I feel like day six was a more typical windy grey Tassie weather experience. Honestly, I did really like Maria Island, however I definitely liked Bruny more especially after what I’m about to say here:

•	From Maria Island, I drove all the way South to Bruny Island: Drove to the south part and had at Hotel Bruny, which was one of the best experiences of my life. I tried oysters for the first time and had some drinks, but that’s not why it was one of the best experiences, this is when I experienced true Tasmanian hospitality, one of the most touching experiences ever. There was an older man seated at the bar area, so I sat myself next to him and started chatting, his name is Gary and I also spoke with his friend Paul. As we were drinking and conversing, I asked him where the best place is to camp in Bruny. He said, “you don’t know where you are going to sleep tonight!?” I said something like no, I’ve just been going with the flow this trip and been sleeping in the back of my Mitsubishi rental. He then invited me to stay in his RV for the night which was on his property!! We drove to his house which he recently purchased, we had more drinks, watched his British comedy show, talked more about life, and eventually called it a night. He told me that I could help myself to as many drinks as I’d like which were in the fridge in the RV. cider & BBQ, quirky bread fridge
	
Day Seven
•	My last day in Tassie, and definitely my most emotional one. I reorganized everything in my car and got my things all packed up, Gary fixed me a coffee and I ended up conversing with him for another hour or so. While we were drinking our coffee, I saw an albino wallaby in his backyard!! So freaking cool, I just love Bruny. Anyway, we were talking and he was telling me more about his life and how one of his kids passed away from cancer, it was tough to hear and just made me have even more respect for him. When I left, his words of advice were, “work hard, play hard, and travel while you’re young.” I will always remember this and I absolutely bawled my eyes out once I left. He said young people like me is what keeps him going. HUGE shoutout to Gary, if you are ever at Hotel Bruny and see an older gentleman with glasses, sit down next to him and start chatting, it may very well be one of the best experiences you will have. I will attach a picture of him here, I love how he still had his bathrobe on 😂
• Tried to drive to cloudy bay after but couldn’t find the right route but honestly I wasn’t too worried about not seeing it, in the moment I was just sad to have left Gary’s place lol. 
•Drove up to the Neck on my way back to the ferry, super cool lookout and I liked reading about the history with Truganini!!
•After the Neck, I drove to the iconic bread fridge and that was very cool to see! From there, I drove to the ferry with my bread and I ended up buying some last minute souvenirs for family once I got off the ferry, I think I bought the gifts from a store in the kettering area, I may be remembering this incorrectly though.
• Took the Mitsubishi to the car wash once I made it back to Hobart, they said this the cleanest they had seen a car comeback in months 😂😂 made me so happy to hear, as I broke too many rules driving that car lol with all the off roading but still took great care of it.
	•	From there, I Ubered back to the airport and that’s the end of my incredible journey through Tasmania!! 🇦🇺 

How I did it:
	•	Rented a car from AAA Car Rental in Hobart and camped almost every night except for my first night and at Gary’s (AAA car rentals is one of the only car companies that rents to 20 year olds like myself, I highly recommend it if you are coming to Tassie and you are around my age). Another piece of advice is to not stay at Airbnb’s so you’re not tied to one place, this is how you can really adventure Tassie. I know there are some incredible accommodations all throughout, so maybe next time I will try some out.
	•	Started early, made the most of my days, drove a bit late, and didn’t waste much time in cities
	•	Had amazing luck with weather and timing
	•	I did not Pre-save maps, ferry times, and locations offline (highly recommend and good learning experience for me, definitely advise to do all these)


Additional Notes/Thoughts:

• If you’re thinking of doing Tasmania in a week — yes, it’s possible. I know what I did in a mere six days would take most people weeks, but I truly didn’t feel rushed and was so happy the entire time. I also loved all the driving, since I live in the USA and it was truly a different world driving all through Tassie and taking in all the scenery and seeing wild kangaroos while on the road.
• Mount Murchison is not talked about at all on this reddit which has surprised me, and I hope at least one person reading this will add this to their Tassie itinerary. Ben Lomond was a second for sure, and Cradle/Wineglass are absolutely stunning don’t get me wrong, but to me Mt Murchison takes the cake, and again all the Tassie locals I met said it’s also their favorite hike.
•Swimcart Beach I absolutely recommend, favorite camping spot hands down in Tassie. That Aurora was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, and you could really see every star in the sky, I was up til 3 am with Mitchell just admiring this beautiful place. 

• Things I would like to do when I return: Hike Mt Amos since I only did the lookout hike, explore more of the North Like Stanley/Penguin, and go further out west to Strahan. Would also like to visit some type of zoo as J actually never saw a Tassie Devil, which I know is very rare to see one in the wild but still would be cool to see at some zoo. Also, would love to do more swimming, I didn’t do as much swimming as I’d like, but I saved the swimming for Vanuatu, as that’s where I went after Tassie. Would love to go back to Bruny and see Gary again, and I’m absolutely camping at Swimcart beach again!! Mitchell told me when I was at Swimcart that there is bioluminescence and that it was going south towards Bruny, I never saw it but would love to try and see the bioluminescence when I return. Speaking of camping spots, I heard Cockle Creek is a good one, I just didn’t have the time for it but I’d love to give it a try. Lastly, I’d like to hike or drive up Mt Wellington to see the entire Hobart area, not so high up on my list but would be a cool experience.

Happy to answer route questions or any questions you guys have in general! Also happy to provide more pictures if anyone is interested. Tasmania truly blew me away, I didn’t know fully what to expect but left with the most beautiful memories and experiences. I really hope this post will inspire at least one person to travel to Tassie or do some things I listed that maybe you didn’t initally think of doing, that would truly make my heart happy. I also took a bunch of videos, I have no editing experience but may create a YT video one day, let me know what your thoughts are on that. Five months later, I still think about my time in Tassie everyday and can’t wait to go back. Also, thank you to anyone who read this long ass post, I really hope you took something positive away from this!! I have so much love for all of you in Tasmania, and so much love from Northern Virginia 🇺🇸❤️🇦🇺",13,1750734737.0,tasmania,1,0.81,False

There is a flower shop near me that I always get bombed by a ton of crap orders when I log on, usually 10am.  One morning one wasn't bad and I took it.  The lady complained when I showed up that she sets the deliveries for 11am, but drivers start showing at 10 and it irritates her.

Ohhhh so that's why her shop bombs me with offers in the morning....

So I asked a friend who works management at Walmart if that's what they do.  He said no but after thinking about it he answered why

Walmart sends people down isles to collect all items in that aisle for many orders.  In the back room everything gets separated and scanned in for the individual orders.  So they complete orders in batches, and the system is sending out pick up requests for all of them at the same time.

This morning I got a Walmart order and hit the coffee cup.  Moved farther away from it waited for it to ask if I was finished and wanted to go back online.  Didn't see another Walmart offer ",2,1750734565.0,UberEatsDrivers,7,0.75,False

So I’ve got 6yoe, 3 as a product designer at a large bank. There was a long and tough time of learning regulations, mastering bureaucracy, and working my craft but it’s more relaxed now. My job is 80% new feature development and overhauls of legacy stuff.

I had an afternoon review today for a new feature I’m working on. I put on some coffee, good music, and basically went from nothing (paper sketches) to something very presentable (high-fi responsive prototype, multiple states, plans for research validation) in just a few hours. Showed the work to enthusiastic feedback and next steps with a group of PMs, tech leads, and principals. People were excited to see the ideas and genuinely debated on how to get it done the best way.

Yeah, I’m surrounded by people that make much more than me and ostensibly have authority over me—product managers, engineering managers, executives—but I feel that I have an intangible leverage over their work that punches well above my weight.

To put it into perspective, the group I reviewed with is fairly large and serious. PMs from FAANG, software architects with 20+ YoE. The tech leads are all top H1B guys who brought their families to the US on the basis of working here, and spend their time managing people to build stuff… that I design alone in my apartment. And they listen to me? Trying not to have an ego about it and just be grateful.

Like, if I was just worse (or better) at my job—it ripples all the way through front end, back end, QA, customer support, legal, sales etc. All these people depend on the work. For that reason our leadership fights to keep me, a 26-year old art grad, happy and occupied.

Yeah, it was tough getting this job. Some things are still tough. But the fact that I can just put on coffee, jam out, and *not* want to die? That’s kind of the dream, maybe even the point of a career. I can kind of see why design jobs are so hard to secure. If there’s anyone out there looking, please hang in there and interview confidently with the idea that your work is so important to the business.

[AUD$800],"Hi All, i'm looking to replace my aging and frustrating Sunbeam EM0480 grinder and looking for a bit of an upgrade.

So far i'm looking at the Baratza Sette 270 and Sette 270Wi, but open to pretty much anything in the price range of these (like Euraka Mignon line, Precision GS7, or Baratza Vario+). One caveat is that my wife also will be using it and under no circumstances will she weigh a dose herself, so any machine needs to have a hopper than can hold more thana single dose. This means unfortunately that awesome grinders like the DF64 and Vario VS3 are out. The time/weight functions will help ensure that she and I will get a great coffee without having to manually weigh every time. We usually make Espressos, piccolos or flat whites. She will often have a single shot piccolo during the day to another reason for time/weight settings.

I know the noise of the Sette is a big turn off for most, but my sunbeam grinds at 85-90dB so even the Sette will be quieter than the Sunbeam!

How beneficial are the scales in the 270Wi vs the timed dose in most other grinders? I really like the idea of weighed doses but it's quite a bit more expensive.

1lj063i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lj063i/my_last_cigarette/,My Last Cigarette,"I have been thinking for a long time about quitting it. So I guess today is the day. I still vaguely remember when I started it. It was in my hostel during my college days back in 2022. I was a bit drunk at that time still thinking why I started it honestly. I have come a long way, since then I have tried to stop it many times and then lapsed again. Over time it has sort of become a night routine for me. I have had thousands of cigarettes with my tea, coffee, cold drinks and alcohol. I have had it with my friends and alone when I was in a meloncaly. 

My mother has told me so many times to not smoke but I guess it didn't matter much to me. So you may ask why today. I don't know why, but today feels a good day to just leave. I am gonna have a haircut as well today. Something has changed but I can't put a finger on exactly what. 

I was talking to someone over an anonymous app, let's name her 'A'. She told me that I should stop it. I exactly remember the day, it was 16th june 2025 after 11pm. She said you know why pregnency rates are going down, it's because of men who involve themselves in such sedentary lifestyle and not just destroy their life but also the woman's and their upcoming child's lives as well. She also said if you think what you are doing is so good, then why not tell it to your parents. I actually have no answer to it, but I do think my parents know it. She is younger than me, but I way mature in thoughts, ""Jo Insaan khudse pyaar nhi kr skta, wo kisi aur se kabhi nhi kar payega"", ""agar sab kuch jaan ne ke baad bhi aap nhi sudhroge to aapka, aapse bada dushman koi nhi hai"". These lines stuck with me. I know I love myself more than my cigarette, I have to.

I don't have much money left in my bank account as well. Probably a few thousand rupees at max, and just enough money to make it through the next month. I am just broke at this point. I still try to be positive about the fact that I have food to eat but the dread of not having money is just killing me at this point. I just know that this is not what I want my life to be, but here we are. 

I think I was a good kid back then and honestly not much has changed now, it's just that being kind is not enough. I need to be competent to earn money. It has been more than 2 months now since I have a job. I ruined my last interview and there is nothing to look forward to. You might think why I am telling you this, the thing is I have been feeling judged by my family. They don't say it to my face but I know. Everyday when I talk to my mother, I just try to be positive as she is very possessive. I hate it most of the times honestly, I want to be sad. Like how can I pretend to be cheerful and positive when I know the reality is totally different. The only time I feel at ease is when I am having drag. 

The cigarette does not judge you, it just waits on your lips to be sucked in. I don't feel any hit as well, it's not as good as the first time as well. I don't know why, but I still feel at ease. Probably it's just that it is the only time when I am not thinking about anything else. But lately that feeling is going down as well. 

There was a time in my life when I used to listen to a lot of bollywood music, but with time the liking just vanished. Some of it can be blamed to the fact that bollywood is not making good music, but mostly it's just me, I don't connect it with anymore. I still remember there was a time, when before going to sleep I used to listen music on radio, this was long back around 2010-11. I used to pulg in my wired earphones on a nokia phone, one bus in my ear and the second in my father's. I don't know why I never liked that, probably because for me music is very intimate thing which I like to do it alone. 

I still do listen to music, but my prefrances have changed. I am more into hip hop now. Not as much into international, I prefer DHH. But lately that feeling is also fading. What I am trying to convey is that there is a time for things to come and go in your life, and there is no point in clinging to those things. Likings change with time and that's fine. But before leaving it completely I want to have it one last time, just for reminiscing. Just for that one last time, because I know there is no going back from this. 

If I remember correctly my first cigarette was Marlboro advanced. And my last Cigarette will be Marlboro Classic Regular. I think that with time your preference for cigarettes changes as well. Right now my favourite is the new Editions cigarette, I like it's flavour so very much, it's the best tasting cigarette that I had by a long margin. Then there is indie mint, for a long time I didn't try it as people told men don't smoke indie mint. But I like it, I think after advance it is my most smoked cigarette. 

I was also very interested in lighters. My first lighter was simple nothing special. It was transparent blue/violet which you can find in any nearby kirana shop. My second lighter was a gas lighter, utility wise they are the best, as the speed of wind does not affect the fire. It's hard to explain, but I never liked these gas lighters as they light the cigarette in one go. There is something about using match sticks or a normal lighter, it takes more effort it feels worth it. 

\-------------------------------------------------;

I just had my last Cigarette with tea. It's 7.50am right now in Gurgaon. It just started to rain as well while I was smoking. It should mean something right, I want it to mean something. I listened two songs as well. One by Jagjit Singh, Tujhko dariya Dil ki Kasam and other by Talha Anjum, downers at dusk. Downers at dusk is my most streamed song in last two years since it came out in Feb 2023. I like that song very much. It has helped me so much during my tough times, and it makes so much sense to listen to it while I am smoking my last. I think it deserves this.

I was also thinking about how I smoked a cigarette. I like to hold it in my left hand, it looks much more aesthetic. My friend likes to hold it using his thumb and index finger, I think he learned this from peaky blinders. I hold it between my index and middle finger. 

It made me a bit emotional while I was throwing the bud and the lighter. I wanted to hold it for a bit longer, but it's time to let it go now. I feel at ease now. I can move on now. I gave my cigarette the best farewell, smoking it in the balcony while it's raining and my favourite song in my ears. I don't know what else I could have done. Probably enjoy it more, but I don't really feel anything right now. 

I smoked my first at night when I was high, and I smoked my last in broad day light in my full senses. In a way I started at night and I smoked till morning, and now it's time to move on. It is a new day and I have to do a lot more.",7,1750733812.0,india,2,1.0,False

Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober.

I once heard someone say ""A grateful person will never drink"" and that resonated with me.

When I was drinking, I found that hardly anything was ever good enough, people rarely met my expectations or requirements, and I was just unhappy with the world.  The only way I knew how to escape this awful place was to drink.

In sobriety, I came to understand that I needed to appreciate the world around me or I would want to escape back into the bottle.  Part of what helped me was practicing gratitude, and I do mean _practicing_.  To me it seems to be like any other kind of muscle -- the more I practice gratitude, the better I get with it and the more powerful it feels.  My appreciating the world around me, from the little things like a warm cup of coffee, to the big things like the fact that I'm sober one more day, it helps me want to stay in the world rather than escape it.

Because… this wasn’t a written blog, or a private caption. It was a 10-slide aesthetic reel set to Count Basie, intercut with moody clips of her folding laundry and making pour-over coffee while describing deeply traumatic abuse in centered white font.
It was giving “clean girl confessional meets cinematic trauma arc” and I’m not sure the vibe matched the subject matter??

Some thoughts:

She clearly went through something horrific, and deserves healing—but is Instagram the space for this kind of story in this kind of format?

Why mix trauma narration with soft lighting, curated outfits, and shots of her chic kitchen backsplash?

Ending the post with “and that’s when I met my husband” was… a transition.

Comments are full of “so brave queen” and not one person seems to question the packaging?


Again, this isn’t about gatekeeping trauma expression. But influencers making content out of it? It starts to feel like pain is just another part of the personal brand😬 And that feels… icky.

Would love to know how y’all feel. Empowering? Exploitive? Just poor taste?

The first light of dawn crept over the treetops, cold and colorless, casting a pale haze through the smoke-hung clearing. No one had slept.  

They hadn't even tried. 

Ashes still curled from the fire pit, long since gone cold, and the three of them sat scattered around it-silent, slumped, hollow-eyed. No one spoke. No one moved. Ben's face was drawn, his eyes red-rimmed, locked on the tree line like he expected it to step forward and speak. Liz clutched her jacket tighter around her body despite the summer air. Cass's leg jittered with nervous energy, tapping a rhythm that frayed everyone's nerves.  

Every crack of branches in the woods made them flinch. Every gust of wind through the needles drew darting glances.  

The screams had stopped hours ago. 

But the silence was worse. 

Somewhere out there, whatever wore Evan's voice-whatever taunted them with it-was still waiting.  

Still watching. 

Still close.  

""We need to move,"" Liz said hoarsely, breaking the stillness. Her voice sounded like gravel.  

""We can't stay here another night."" 

No one argued. 

But no one stood up either. 

Because deep in their bones, they all felt it.  

Last night had cracked something open.  

The sound of the forest seemed louder now. Every rustle of leaves, every groan of a shifting tree, pressed down on them like the pressure of a deep ocean. Liz stood at the edge of the clearing, her arms wrapped tight around herself, eyes searching the thinning trees where Riley had vanished.  

Ben broke the silence, his voice low but steady. ""We have to decide. Now. Do we look for Riley... or go back to base?""  

No one spoke at first.  

Liz's eyes were fixed on the tree line. ""If he's out there... alone, injured... we can't just walk away."" 

""But we don't even know where he went,"" Cass argued. ""He could be anywhere. You heard those things last night. He might've-"" 

""Stop,"" Liz cut her off. 

Ben exhaled sharply through his nose and crouched, drawing a quick map in the dirt with a stick. ""We know he ran northeast. The slope he went toward is steep-he wouldn't have made it far if he slipped or twisted anything.""  

He looked up, meeting their eyes. ""We check the ridge. One hour. We stay together. If we find nothing by then... we head back to base."" 

Liz nodded, though her hands trembled as she zipped up her jacket. ""One hour,"" she echoed. 

Cass stood up, slung her backpack over her shoulder ""We should go now then, before we change our minds.""  

The group moved out, boots crunching over pine needles, the forest rising around them like a cathedral of silence. The deeper they went, the heavier the air became-suffocating, thick with a damp, earthy rot.  

Fifty minutes in, the trail ended. There were broken branches-signs of something having passed through. No blood. No clothing. No Riley. 

""Time's almost up,"" Liz said, her voice hollow. 

""Wait,"" Ben said suddenly, stepping forward. 

""There-on that tree."" 

A strip of fabric. 

Faded red. Torn and stuck to a low branch, stiff with something dark and dried.  

Liz pulled it free. Her voice barely escaping her throat. ""It's from his hoodie.""  

Ben turned slowly in a circle, eyes narrowing.  

From somewhere behind them, too far to see but too close to ignore, came a sound of a branch cracking.  

Not underfoot. 

Snapping. 

Followed by silence. 

Then... a soft, wet sound-like something dragging. 

Cass took a step back. ""What hell was that?"" 

Ben, fixed on the tree line, froze.  

Beyond the first wall of trees-thirty feet out- stood a figure. 

Still. 

Pale. 

Naked. 

Facing away from them. 

It was Riley. 

Or... it looked like Riley. 

He stood with his back to them, feet sunk into the old mud, his bare shoulders twitching in sharp, unnatural jolts. Not shivering, but twitching. Like a puppet fighting against invisible strings. His head lolled slightly to one side, like it had been unhinged, held upright by little more than muscle memory.  

""Riley?"" Liz called out before she could stop herself. 

No response. 

Just that strange, staccato movement. His limbs jerked subtly-shoulders, spine, knees-like something inside him was trying to figure out how to wear a human body. The air around him seemed wrong. Denser somehow. Too still.  

Then Riley's head twitched.  

Once. 

Twice. 

And snapped halfway around, just shy of a full turn. A low groan reverberated through the trees. Not from him, but from somewhere just behind where he stood.  

Suddenly, Riley dropped onto all fours with a sickening crack of bone. 

His joints bent the wrong way-elbows jutting out, knees twisting backward-as his body contorted into something inhuman. 

Then without a word, he skittered into the woods. His limbs jerking wildly.  

 Cass screamed, her hands flying to her mouth.  

""Did-did you see his face? It wasn't Riley, I-it couldn't have been!"" 

Liz backed away slowly, her eyes wide, mouth trembling. ""That sound-his bones-oh my god, what the hell happened to him?"" 

Another sharp crack echoed from deeper in the trees-Riley, or the thing that had once been Riley, moving fast and low through the brush.  

""Run,"" Ben breathed, voice barely audible. 

""Run!"" 

Cass didn't need to be told twice. She turned and bolted, her boots pounding against the earth. Liz was right behind her. Grabbing Ben's sleeve and dragging him as another sickening howl echoed from the forest. It wasn't quite human; it wasn't quite animal. 

The three of them tore down the narrow trail they'd come from earlier, branches clawing at their faces and gear, adrenaline drowning out the burn in their legs and lungs. Behind them, somewhere in the maze of trees, twigs cracked in rhythm.  

It was following. 

Ben dared a glance over his shoulder-and instantly regretted it.  

A pale shape darted between trees, far too fast and too low to the ground. For a split second, it looked like Riley's face grinning at him upside down-wide-eyed, twisted, impossibly stretched.  

 Ben skidded to a halt. Mud kicking up as he stopped, drew his .44 from his holster, and aimed it to the trees behind them.  

""Ben!"" Cass shouted, jerking to a stop ahead. 

""What the hell are you doing? MOVE!"" 

""We can't outrun it,"" Ben said, voice tight but calm. ""Not all of us."" 

Liz's eyes widened as she ran back toward him. ""Don't do this. Come on-don't be stupid."" 

He glanced at her. ""I'm not. I'm buying you time."" 

Liz opened her mouth to protest, but something in Ben's face stopped her. She swallowed, her eyes shining. ""You better make it back. You hear me?"" 

Ben nodded, jaw clenched. ""Get out of here, get help."" 

Liz’s breath hitched. She grabbed his arm for a second-just a second-then let go. 

Cass with her eyes beginning to fill with tears, ""I better see you again Ben."" 

Ben smirked; eyes locked on hers.  

""I'll see you soon."" 

Then, Cass and Liz took off. Their footsteps fading into the forest. 

Ben stood alone. 

Breathing calm. 

Pistol steady. 

The forest held its breath. 

Five shots cracked through the silence, each one ringing like a bell of defiance. 

Then came the scream-raw, broken, painful. 

Then nothing. 

  

Part VII:   

Cass and Liz tore through the forest like hunted animals, the breath burning in their lungs and thorns clawing at their arms. The trees blurred past in streaks of green and shadow, but neither dared stop. Not after what they'd seen. Not with that thing wearing Riley's face still smiling in their mind. 

Branches snapped beneath their feet. Roots reached like fingers to trip them, but adrenaline kept them upright. A single thought propelled them forward: Keep going, don't look back. 

They didn't speak. There was no time. Only the sound of wind, the sharp rush of footfalls over wet earth, and the scream in their hearts pounding like war drums in their chests.  

It wasn't until they broke through the thicket that the world seemed to tilt sideways.  

Cass stumbled first, skidding to a stop. Liz nearly collided with her, gasping and bent over, hands on her knees.  

They had returned.  

The clearing. 

The grove. 

All around them, the trees loomed tall and solemn, draped in bone windchimes that had long since stopped swinging. The remains of those who'd vanished over the decades clacked softly in the breeze-tiny taps like knuckles on glass. Animal skulls stared from the branches. Ribcages curled like cages from the canopy above. 

But now there was something new. 

At the center of the grove stood a wooden post, sharpened to a crude spike. And strung across it, arms out like a grotesque scarecrow, was a skinned human body. 

Raw, pink, dripping. 

The head was gone. 

Strips of flesh flapped in the wind like flags of meat. 

Cass fell to her knees with a strangled cry, covering her mouth. Liz didn't move. She stared, wide-eyed, until the world narrowed to a pinpoint and the silence swelled with nausea and static. 

The body had no face. But the shape, the stature, 

It was Riley. 

The real Riley. 

Liz's legs gave out. She sat back hard on the earth, the impact rattling up her spine. Cass crawled toward her and grabbed her wrist with trembling fingers. 

""This... this can't be real,"" Cass trembled. ""What are they? What is this place?"" 

Liz sat frozen, her breath shallow and uneven. The wind had died completely-so sudden, so complete it felt like the world itself had stopped breathing. 

The bones above them-strung between the trees like trophies-gave a final rattle and stilled.  

Cass, sobbing at this point, finally broke. 

Cass let out a cry, clutching at her scalp as if trying to claw the thoughts out of her head.  

""They watched us, waited for us. This place-this hell-it doesn't want us to leave."" 

Her cries turned into laughter. High, broken, the sound of a mind coming apart at the seams. ""We thought we could search. Rescue. Like we mattered. But they were playing with us... like they did with Evan..."" 

There was movement in the trees.  

Liz snapped her head towards the noise. 

There, standing in the clearing, was Riley, covered in blood. 

Smiling. 

Liz jolted up, terrified. 

""Cass... we need to move. Cass!"" 

Liz reached for Cass, but Cass flinched away, her body trembling violently. She rocked back and forth on the cold earth, laughter spilling out of her like a cracked music box. ""We're not going home. We're not going anywhere. We're already gone."" 

Liz stumbled backward, her breath catching in her throat.  

Riley stepped closer 

Liz's eyes locked on Riley, heart pounding. 

Behind him, appeared a figure. 

The thing stood tall, its limbs too long and too thin, as if someone had stretched a human form like wet leather over a deer's frame. Its skin was the color of old ash. Dry, cracked, and clinging too tightly to the bone beneath. But it was the eyes that stopped everything: not glowing, not reflective-just pits of endless black. No iris, no white.  

Just void. 

Then, as if sensing Liz's gaze, the thing twitched-its neck cracking as it turned toward her. And with a sound like fabric tearing, a split opened across its face. Where a mouth should be, flesh peeled back in a ragged, unnatural smile, revealing rows of uneven, needle-sharp teeth embedded in raw twitching muscle. 

Then it spoke. 

Broken, its tone fluctuating high and low, until it finally matched the pitch of Cass's cries. 

""We... search... mattered... buut they were pllaa-"" Then suddenly, its voice changed.  

It sounded exactly like Cass.  

speaking perfectly, ""they were playing with us... like they did with Evan."" 

""Cass, please,"" Liz pleaded, begging her to come to her senses.  

Cass just laughed harder, curling herself like a child hiding from a monster under the bed. 

The thing moved even closer. 

Liz backed away slowly, one hand fumbling behind her for anything-her pack, a flashlight, anything. Her foot hit a rock, and she nearly fell, catching herself just in time. She didn't dare take her eyes of the horrifying sight of the thing. 

""CASS!""  

Suddenly, Cass snapped out of her psychoses.  

The world became utterly silent. 

Then, came a subtle whisper, right next to Cass's ear. 

""I'll see you soon."" 

Cass, overtaken by shock, slowly turned. 

There, inches from her face, 

Was Ben. 

Smiling. 

 

Part VII: 

Cass didn't even have time to scream. 

The thing wearing Ben's face-moved with impossible speed. One moment he was inches from her face, the next his hand was around her throat, lifting her effortlessly off the ground like she weighed nothing. 

His eyes were wrong. 

Too black, deep and ancient. 

Cass kicked and clawed at his arm, nails raking down the pale, cold skin. It felt like trying to scratch stone. 

Ben tilted his head. That same, terrible smile never left his face. 

And then, he began to peel. 

He reached up with his free hand, and dug fingers into Cass's jawline, and started downward. 

Her scream finally found its way out. 

Raw and ragged, as flesh came free in strips. 

Blood sprayed across the trees like ink. Her body convulsed violently in his grip as layers of skin were torn from her like tissue paper. Her face was locked in a grotesque mask of agony, mouth open, eyes rolling back. 

With a final jerk, the thing snapped her neck. 

The sound echoed through the woods like a gunshot. 

Cass's lifeless, ruined body crumpled to the ground.  

Liz couldn't move.  

Her legs wouldn't work. 

Then a fourth creature emerged from behind Ben. 

Looking directly at her. 

Liz finally had gotten herself to move. 

Branches clawed at her arms and face as she pushed through the underbrush. Her lungs burned. Her vision blurred. But she didn't dare stop. The forest blurred around her - every tree identical to the next, every path looping back into itself. The forest felt alive, pulsing with breath, watching her from all sides. 

She spun around - no landmarks, no trail.  

Just woods. 

Endless, shifting woods. 

Every direction looked the same. 

And behind her, far off, came the sound of cracking joints and wet footsteps. 

She took off in a blind sprint, crashing through bushes with no real direction- just away.  

Her breath tore ragged from her throat, heart pounding so loud it nearly drowned out everything. Branches slicing her skin, but she didn't stop.  

She couldn't stop. 

She needed to hide. Somewhere, anywhere. 

But there was nothing. 

No hollowed tree, no outcrop, no boulder to duck behind. Just endless black forest swallowing the amber sunlight and stretching in every direction. 

She stumbled on roots and caught herself on a sapling, her legs trembling. Still, she ran. 

Then, the ground vanished. 

She skidded to a halt just feet from the edge of a cliff, a sheer drop yawning before her. The wind rushed up from the cliffside below, cool and endless. 

Chest heaving, she looked behind her.  

Nothing. 

But it was coming.  

It always came. 

Her fingers fumbled at her jacket pocket. She had forgotten completely about the camcorder, the one from Evan's campsite. She turned it on with shaking hands, the tiny red recording light blinking to life.  

""I am Liz Gray"" she said, voice quaking. 

""If anyone finds this... for the love of god, turn back."" 

Sounds cracked behind her, scratching of trees, and heavy footsteps. 

She looked directly into the lens now, wide-eyed, and desperate. 

""It wears you,"" she said. ""I saw it tear one of my partners to shreds, and it copied her voice as she screamed."" 

The noises behind her getting closer. 

""It isn't me."" 

She shut off the camcorder. 

Shaking, she said, ""I'm not dying like this, not to those things."" 

Her heels kissed the drop. She looked down, the fall was far. Maybe far enough, maybe not. She clenched her fists. Gritted her teeth. She took one last breath and jumped. 

The wind calmed, and time slowed. 

......................................................................... 

But the fall never came. 

The thing had caught Liz over the cliff by her hair. 

She felt her scalp tearing, her hair ripping, and her screams tore through the entire forest. With its free hand, with blinking speed, it smashed it into Liz's throat, crushing her windpipe, completely silencing her. 

With Liz fighting its grip, it brought her within inches of its face, and it spoke, it sounded as if Liz was talking to herself. 

The words echoing back into her mind,  

""We're here to rescue someone. Not to entertain campfire stories."" 

Her eyes widened, the pain in her throat stinging as she feels blood filling her mouth. 

She had said it with conviction that first morning at base camp, standing across from Ben, Cass, and Riley. Her arms crossed tight like a shield. She'd meant it, to stay sharp, grounded in facts. But now, face to face with this thing, she realized, they were dead the moment they stepped into the forest. It had been waiting for them to come find Evan. They were being watched from the beginning.  

The thing held tight around Liz's throat still, and with its other hand, it raised it to Liz's forehead, 

And started peeling. 

Part IX:  

TWO WEEKS LATER 

 The early morning sun cast long, slanted shadows through the mist creeping low across the forest floor. The hum of generators and the smell of reheated coffee hung in the air as a new team gathered at the base camp-an upgraded version of the one Liz had commanded. More personnel, more equipment, and more urgency. 

No one had heard a word from the original search party. 

They were now missing along with Evan. 

No sign of Evan, Liz, Ben, Cass, or Riley. It was as if the woods had opened their mouth and swallowed them whole. 

This time, the state had stepped in. Uniformed forest service officers stood alongside local search and rescue volunteers. The command tent buzzed with tension that hung heavier than the clouds above. 

Captain Jonas Keene, mid-40s, hard-set jaw and tired eyes, stood at the front of the group. A man who'd done tours overseas and wildfires out west. This was just a search they told him. People get lost. But no one wanted to say out loud what they really believed. 

""This is a rescue mission,"" Keene said, voice firm as he held up a map of the restricted zone. ""They've been out of contact for two weeks, they should've been back by now, but that doesn't mean they're gone. Terrain's rough, weather turned on 'em. Maybe they're injured. Maybe they're holed up somewhere waiting."" 

No one responded.  

Keene ran a finger along a winding trail. ""We spread out in grids. Two-man teams. Radios on, no wandering. We keep to daylight, and we mark everything. Got it?"" 

Heads nodded. 

Near the back stood Marcus Shaw, a former firefighter turned search and rescue, who'd seen his share of twisted ankles and missing hikers-but nothing like this. Not five people vanishing without a trace. No emergency beacons. No GPS signals. Just silence.  

Keene's voice cut through the silence. ""Let's move. We've got light for another ten hours. First checkpoint is the ridge that enters the restricted zone. No heroics. No solo ventures. Stay sharp and stay loud. Here is a picture of all the missing persons we are trying to find. Keep them with you. If you find one, radio in.” 

There was the rustle of packs and crunch of boots as the teams began to move toward the tree line. The wind dropped as they entered the woods. The air shifted. Cooler. Denser. Sound seemed to fade beneath the canopy, swallowed by pine and shadows. 

As the group rounded a bend in the narrow path, someone stood ahead- still and waiting.  

There stood Liz.

The sliding glass door that leads out to your veranda provides me with all the sights I need to see to keep me fulfilled. 



You get up every morning to start your day at six with a workout. You’re punctual. I like that.



Your beautiful muscles stretch and strain, fighting against your body weight for their fibers to break themselves down and repair them once more, continuing the cycle to make yourself stronger and better. Your persistence is admirable and your stamina is unmatchable. 



You fix yourself breakfast after you shower, tossing back freshly blow-dried brunette hair after a short shower. Soft, kissable lips sip iced coffee laced with protein powder as your luscious green eyes devour a psychology textbook, your glittery purple pen jotting down a copious amount of notes. I slip a little whiskey into my coffee and add the same amount of sugar. One day, I’ll take you for coffee. 



Just the two of us.



Your textbook plops closed after exactly fifteen minutes. Someone’s cramming for an exam they forgot to study for. You review notes and crack open your MacBook, typing away as the minutes tick by. You cheer to yourself, your little practice quiz going better than you expected, clearly. 



Your professor’s a fucking asshole. 



I know this because we both have the same psychology class. You sit in your same seat in the front row as he critiques an ‘anonymous’ student’s essay after the exam and holds nothing back. He trashes your arguments and criticizes your choice of sources, calling them ‘outdated’ and ‘invalid’. Some of the students whisper to another and wonder who would have written an essay like that. 



I can see you sink into your seat and it makes me sad for you. Assholes like that never recognize hard work and pure effort. My folks always said to me growing up that true grit was what counted in life, if you were making an effort, you were doing better than those that never made an attempt at all. 



You’re understandably a mess after psychology, returning to your apartment and tossing your knapsack onto the wooden floor, the contents spilling out haphazardly. You slip into an oversized All Time Low shirt and crank up the music, tossing yourself onto your bed, quiet sobs forcing their way out of you, eyeliner laced tears stain your pillow case. I wish I could lay next to you and have you let it all out onto my shoulder. 



Your cell phone rings. It’s Friday night and your friends want you to come out tonight.



You sniffle, and after a bit of consideration, you accept. 



…



For someone that makes as much money as he does, the professor knows not to make himself stand out. It’s smart, really, when you consider all the muggings that have been popping up as of late. 



He doesn’t hear the crunch of gravel underneath my work boots as I cross under the streetlight, my prized skinning knife from my farm boy days clutched tightly in my right palm. He has no idea what is coming, no semblance of the slightest warning as he curses to himself, wondering why his car won’t start. Putting sugar in his gas tank was a classic move. Making friends with the kids that went to juvie in high school really taught me some valuable tricks. 



He impatiently dials AAA, stepping out of his car into the cool autumn weather. I can still remember seeing him ask you to stay after classes ended for the day and the look on your face when he’d initially displayed your essay. You looked so sad. It broke my heart.



A couple of stabs into his kidneys is all it takes to take down the prehistoric fuck. He crumples like paper, screaming and begging for his life as I dig both his eyes out. 



His criticizing tongue sits loosely in my gloved hands, blood soaking my tried and true worn blue jeans and my green army jacket. The slab of muscle is slimy and wet, like a really thick slug as he rasps and rattles on the floor, odd sobs interrupting in awkward intervals that sound more like guttural wails. 



Looks like all those hunting trips paid off. 



…



Your four girlfriends hug and kiss you, all dressed up in their Baby Phat, Juicy Couture, and Von Dutch get-ups, you apologize to them for being late as they do so.



 The white bandana tube top that teases your well-muscled figure is revealed as you slip off your prized Harley Davidson leather jacket and toss it on the back of your chair, black jeans cling to your long legs and are complemented with high-heeled leather boots. 



You chit and chatter with them about how everything is going: your classes, your job at the real estate firm, your assignments and projects. They ask about your dad, how’s he doing, where has he been, yadda yadda. You mention his birthday is next week.



Noted. I should buy the man a gift. 



These girls don’t suit you. They’re boring, wastes of time. They look like they suck the energy out of you, with the way they egg you on and push you to drink with them. You cave to their peer pressure and order a rum and coke. They all down their drinks in record time to get up and dance to some Sean Kingston song. 



At least you’re enjoying yourself. I’d never fault you for that at all.



Trouble comes in the form of a jockish football playing-type approaching you from behind on the dancefloor. He makes a slightly drunken attempt at flirting with half-assed pickup lines that you laugh off and politely tell him you’re not interested. Your friends flash their little hand signals popular with the club going types eager to avoid lecherous, drunken men. 



You give them the thumbs up after the man fucks off in search of easier prey. You excuse yourself to the bathroom after your second rum and coke, your friends discussing the latest gossip about the job and how they all thought it shameful for our psych professor to tear apart your essay like that. 



But you won’t have to worry about him anymore. 



When you come back, you look exhausted and worn out. Someone’s social battery is drained. You bid your friends goodbye and they offer to see you out and wait with you for the cab. You decline and tell them you’ll call them as soon as you get in. 



Stepping out into the pale moonlight, you call up a cab and pop a Tylenol after rifling through your purse, muttering about how maybe tonight wasn’t the right night for rum and coke. The jock who approached you on the dancefloor tries his luck again after he extinguishes a cigarette.



He pelts you with pet names and offers to keep you company, because ‘a girl like you shouldn’t be out alone’. You decline as he blows cigarette smoke in your direction, his face shifting into an offended expression with undertones of anger. 



You won’t give him a chance, he says. Your eyes narrow and tell him that he had no chance to begin with. He won’t take no for an answer. 



He tries to grab at your arm and stop you from leaving. He’s a nice guy, he says. He isn’t like the creepozoids inside that’ll love her and leave her. You tell him he’s obviously had too much to drink. 



He doesn’t like that, his teeth gritting and his hand snatching at your wrist. 



Your jab hits him square in the nose when he successfully manages to pull you toward him. You hit him again in the sternum and follow-up with an overhand right, your blows sobering him right up. 



Your cab pulls up. You hop in. Amazing work, but I’ll take it from here, my dear. 



He calls you all sortsa names as he saunters and staggers his way back to the side entrance of the club, muttering to himself about how badly he needs to piss.



The first couple of times he took me hunting, dear old dad wanted me to master the basics of hunting and killing small game. The majority of hunting is a waiting game, a test of patience in detecting the right moment to pounce upon your prey. Oftentimes, I’d find myself purposefully injuring the animals in order to be ‘forced’ to put them out of their misery. 



A small flick of the wrist is typically all it takes to snap the necks of bobwhites and American woodcocks. Dove heads pop off like the bottle caps of those Mexican cokes. You stood on the necks of turkeys to kill those annoying fuckers. Birds were always delicately fragile things, easy to capture and rewarding to break. 



It was loads of fun to watch squirrels fight me tooth and nail as I drowned them in the river, their bodies squirming, writhing, and struggling for the slightest chance to get away from me. Only one of them ever got to escape from me, when my hand slipped and he bit me, leaping out of the water and scrambling away before I could pop it in the skull. 



Other times, you could barely hear the snap of their spine break after I swung them by the tail into a nearby tree, but it's always so hard to gut and clean ‘em when they’re a bloody paste. It also creates suspicion that requires unnecessary work and effort to cover up. 



Slitting throats is efficient, but every time I slit the throat of an animal, it puts their self- preservation instinct into overdrive, rabbits especially. Those little shits would be biting, kicking, and screaming until it was all over and I’d be left with scratches up and down my wrists. I found that every time I finished off an animal myself that it always tasted ten times better when dad and I got to cooking.



I slip into the bathroom, unwrapping one of the medium-sized blue garbage bags that I keep in my apartment. He doesn’t hear the click of the deadbolt, the loud sound of his urine blocking out any slight sound I make. I slowly unravel the plastic bag as I slide against the stalls. 



The bag makes its way over his head and around his face as I apply a rear-naked choke. An elbow frees him from my grasp. A quick jab to his throat is all I need to put the fight to a screeching halt after I dodge a couple of hastily thrown swings. I slip the bag over his head, slamming my knee into his ribcage as hard as I can. 



Drunks never put up a good fight. 



His face meets the toilet, nostalgia floods my veins as he futilely thrashes and struggles against my grip, both hands pushing down on his head, his torso area in between my legs. The squirrel goes slack, hands limp at his sides and head bobbing like an apple.



You miss the newscast that covers his murder. 



He won’t be missed.



…



Your girlfriends ambush you at your apartment, looking to surprise you with a gift as an apology for not being able to take you out to a birthday dinner last Friday. I mark my calendar as I sit in my car with my binoculars.



Classes have been postponed since they discovered both bodies. They’ve put a curfew in effect. The papers speak of a possible serial killer. 



If only they knew.



From what I can see, it’s something long inside a big box with black and white wrapping paper, the Hallmark type. You slice it open with the small knife you carry on your keys next to your pepper spray, greedily clutching what I almost mistake for a rifle. Maybe that would be a good gift for you, we could go hunting together. 



You’d love it. 



It’s a telescope. You’ve always wanted one—a real one, that is. Not the ones sold in Toys R Us to little kids that will inevitably sit in a dusty attic to waste away and be forgotten about. They help you set it up, adjust the lens, and you look to the sky in amazement.



They give you another gift: a notebook to track the constellations in the sky. You hug them, ever so grateful for having met them, tears in your eyes and all. 



Maybe I should get you a gift. One to make you forget all about that telescope. 



…



You peer through your telescope and gasp at the stars in the sky, constellations painting the beautiful abyss of black, like a mass of glitter. 



You scribble this one and that down in your notebook, this time with a black glitter pen that matches the sky. I sip on another coffee to keep me awake after I get a good workout in and order some food. You’re really getting me into some bad habits.

I just want to make this post to get some facts straight about the development of the project and the ability of people to be heard in regards to this project: for and against, without even delving into the arguments actually made so much.

On April 2, DOT gave a presentation to the CB1 Queens Transportation Committee concerning the 31st St redesign: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRi56GhcdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRi56GhcdE)

April 2 Committee Agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-REVISED-Transportation-memo-Agenda-31-F-04\_02.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-REVISED-Transportation-memo-Agenda-31-F-04_02.pdf)

The proposed redesign: [https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-apr2025.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-apr2025.pdf)

On April 7, a petition was created calling for rejection of the redesign: [https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-plan-in-astoria](https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-plan-in-astoria) (currently \~4.2k signatures)

On April 13, a petition was created calling for support of the redesign: [https://www.change.org/p/bring-safety-improvements-to-31st-street-in-astoria](https://www.change.org/p/bring-safety-improvements-to-31st-street-in-astoria) (currently \~3.4k signatures)

On April 14, the 31st Street Business Association held a press conference on the SW corner of 31st St & 31st Ave.: [https://astoriapost.com/astoria-residents-business-owners-rally-against-proposed-bike-lane-on-31st-street](https://astoriapost.com/astoria-residents-business-owners-rally-against-proposed-bike-lane-on-31st-street)

The organization was joined by Assembly Member Jennifer Rajkumar who represents Assembly District 38, which includes parts of Glendale, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, and Ozone Park.

On April 15, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzqb\_I9vJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzqb_I9vJM)

The redesign was not part of the agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-April-Memo-Agenda-L-04\_15.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-April-Memo-Agenda-L-04_15.pdf)

Board members were to not yet consider the proposal, let alone vote on it. The President of the 31st Street Business association began the public comment section. A former candidate in the Democratic primary for District 59 of the New York State Senate also spoke shortly after. Representatives of the following businesses had an opportunity to speak: King Souvlaki, ZA & D Service Station, Astoria Central Parking, Under Pressure Coffee, and Pilates Designs. The last representative mentioned he had met with three DOT officials earlier that same day. A couple of parents/residents also spoke not in favor of the project.

Parents and residents of Astoria would each have a chance to speak in favor of the project (about seven or so total).

On May 20, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9iutBX22lA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9iutBX22lA)

The redesign was not part of the agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-May-Memo-Agenda-revised-L-05\_20.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-May-Memo-Agenda-revised-L-05_20.pdf)

During comment for the Item #1: IKOS Rezoning for Senior Living Facility at 32-07 31st Street, the President of the 31st Business Association interjected concerns about travel for seniors as it relates to the 31st Street redesign. He ended by expressing disappointment that during the last monthly meeting public comment was cut to only ninety seconds per person.

During public comment, a gentleman spoke out against the redesign. Born in Astoria, he claims to have never once had a dangerous run-in with cars as a pedestrian or bike rider in Astoria. He would go on to make an analogy about how chickens in a rural area are able to cross a road without traffic lights, signs, or barriers so we should expect careful, thoughtful people to be able to do the same in Astoria.

A woman would later also speak out against the 31st St redesign as well as the 31st Ave redesign.

On June 13, thirteen additional businesses announced they would join the petition against the DOT proposal: [https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-proposal-in-astoria/u/33616881](https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-proposal-in-astoria/u/33616881)

Also on June 13, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, and Council Member Tiffany Caban stated their support of the resdesign: [https://astoriapost.com/lawmakers-back-dot-31st-street-bike-lane-redesign](https://astoriapost.com/lawmakers-back-dot-31st-street-bike-lane-redesign)

On June 17, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRPtnLOnnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRPtnLOnnY)

A presentation by DOT about the redesign became a later addition to the original agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-June-Memo-Agenda-06\_17-Revised.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-June-Memo-Agenda-06_17-Revised.pdf)

The presentation slides: [https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-jun2025.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-jun2025.pdf)

I highly recommend viewing and hearing the public comment section with much greater clarity here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOPA27wr\_80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOPA27wr_80)

Throughout all public comment sections, a balance of speakers for and against was always sought. During each public comment, instruction was always given that written comment could be submitted to the board for consideration as public comment is normally limited to two minutes: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/frequently-asked-questions.page#faq06](https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/frequently-asked-questions.page#faq06)

CB1 normally wraps up and needs to leave the space by 10 PM, which is around the time DOT officials had finished their presentation and fielded questions from board members. They were continuously delayed by yelling and interruption from people against the proposal. Time was allowed for public comment, however, before CB1 even began the segment of the agenda to hold a couple of votes and conduct their internal business.

I just want to make a few observations about this most recent meeting:

1) As the DOT presentation about the redesign was about to start, opponents of the plan swarmed behind the podium to coordinate holding up signs in opposition. Camera crews and reporters from PIX11 and CBS New York were in attendance to specifically film this section and interview participants about it (kudos to them for staying so late):

[https://pix11.com/video/astoria-businesses-clash-over-proposed-bike-lane-safety-plan/10812371/](https://pix11.com/video/astoria-businesses-clash-over-proposed-bike-lane-safety-plan/10812371/)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwegygtTJhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwegygtTJhs)

2) To again create a balance of opinion while already running late and against the clock, the chair directed that four people would be able to first speak against the plan and then four could speak in support. The chair also made note that some opponents have already had time to speak at either an earlier meeting or with DOT so perhaps others who have not been heard should speak. Despite this, four members of the 31st Street Business Association read a press statement using up all of the allotted time for speakers against the project. Written statements can be submitted here: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/contact.page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/contact.page)

3) The President of the 31st Street Business Association included a remark: ""Despite our demand to be heard as a collective, \[DOT\] repeatedly tried to pick us off one-by-one."" For one, getting one-on-one meetings with DOT officials would allow business owners to address their specific concerns. And two, based on the conduct at this meeting, it's not hard to imagine why government employees would seek to address specific concerns with individual businesses rather than address all of the businesses at once.",9,1750732544.0,astoria,3,0.77,False

Mostly machine-translated but I corrected  some errors / idioms***

  
In 2022, I graduated from university in International Relations with a good knowledge of Chinese. At first I wanted to go to China for my master's degree: in my second year I went to study in the city of Harbin and fell in love with this country.

My BF and I wanted to move abroad together after graduation, but at that time visa restrictions were not yet lifted because of the Covid. We had to look for an alternative.

We applied to an agency that helps to look for jobs abroad. At first we were offered vacancies as animators in Turkey or Egypt, but at some point the Philippines came up. The requirements included Chinese - it was perfect for me because I didn't want to forget the language without practicing. Back in Russia, we had online interviews, but only I was sent an offer. They offered me an office job in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. We thought about it for a long time, but we decided to go together.

I knew nothing about the Philippines. When I told my parents I was moving to Manila, they said, “Sorry, where to?” I had to learn everything about the visa, local culture, and language right before the trip. I was under the impression that if the Philippines was close to China, they would be similar. But I was wrong․

Working at an online casino

Philippine culture and architecture is a mixture of something Spanish and Asian. Also the mass culture of the Philippines is very influenced by the USA: here even the second official language is English. Most of the inhabitants can maintain a normal conversation in English, so Tagalog I did not learn.

The first time after moving to Manila, I was in shock. Besides having to adapt to the climate, foreign culture and food, I found out where I was going to work. I had a clear description of the offerer: a plain office job. But it turned out to be in the field of POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators) online casinos.  
I realized that I was already in the Philippines and could not quit my job, even if it went against my moral views. It was simply a matter of survival. I stayed in this field for two years, changing three companies.

I always worked 6/1: six days a week in the office. All my colleagues were from different countries: Vietnamese, Koreans, Malaysians, Indonesians. I was the only one from Russia. And it wasn't always easy.

The Asians I met are, for the most part, very noisy. They have almost no understanding of personal boundaries, or they perceive them in their own way. It's a normal story for Filipinos to just not show up for work. HR once wrote to a coworker of mine who didn't show up to the office, worried that something had happened to him. And he replied, “I don't want to come,” and that was it. This is not an isolated case: I think many people here do not think through the consequences of their actions and do not care about the future.

  
I was also always cold in the office. I was freezing for two years in the Philippines - it sounds surreal because it's tropical and it's almost always 30-degree heat outside. But indoors and in offices, the air conditioners are on 16-18°C. I was constantly told: “Polina, you're from Russia, you're used to the cold”. I replied: ""My dears, I am used to the cold, but it is cold outside, and we dress warmly. Inside the houses we keep warm.""

In my first position, I worked in customer support. For the first six months, I supported both myself and my partner: I was paid in the range of $1,100-$1,200 a month. When I quit and got a job at the second company, I recommended my BF them, but he didn't pass the probationary period. Gradually, problems accumulated in our relationships, and we broke up.

At the second company, I had a higher position as a platform manager, but I didn't have enough skills to feel comfortable. So I left and got a job at a third company as an HR manager. During my probationary period, I was paid 1800 dollars a month, and afterwards I was paid 2000 dollars

  
It's a very high salary for the Philippines. We were forbidden to publicize it so that the locals would not know that we expats get much more. For example, a local cashier earns about 270 dollars a month and an office clerk earns about 300 dollars.

In December 2024, I decided to quit my job. I was tired of this schedule to the point where I could no longer continue. I can't remember a single month when I didn't come home in tears and think about quitting.

I was lucky: as soon as I wrote my resignation, in the Philippines, the president issued a decree that banned POGO companies. After that, my company moved to Cambodia.

Dream housing and virgin nature

In Russia I was a photographer and dreamed of returning to that. Since my dismissal, I have been doing photography and videography, teaching Chinese and counseling people on Chinese Batsu astrology. So far I have not been able to reach the previous level of income: in one month I can earn 400 dollars, in the next - 900 dollars.

The company used to issue me a work visa. I just handed in the documents, the rest was the employer's responsibility. After I was fired, I went to Hong Kong to cancel my work visa. Now I am in the Philippines on a tourist visa. With it, I rented an apartment and fly between islands with no problem.

I rent a studio in an apartment complex for 20,000 Philippine pesos (about $350) a month. I can use the pool, gym, movie theater, conference room and co-working space for free. I am happy with everything. At one point I wanted to go back to Russia and thought: how come I have to pay for the gym? And for the swimming pool too?

  
I am fascinated by the nature of the Philippines. It is so diverse that there is something for everyone. I can get to Boracay, one of the most beautiful islands, in an hour by airplane. If I want to go surfing, I can fly to Siargao Island. Manila is located on the largest island of Luzon, and there are many mountains and waterfalls.

I like the smiling Filipinos and their positive attitude to everything. When my parents flew to visit me, they said: “People don't smile like that in Russia”. When I flew to Russia on vacation after living in the Philippines for a year and a half, I noticed it too.

Bureaucracy, visual noise and poverty

But the Philippines has its drawbacks. In Manila, for example, it is impossible to walk down the street. It is very difficult to walk from your neighborhood to a neighboring neighborhood because there are no pedestrian walkways. Public transportation is very inconvenient and runs on a strange schedule. There are also jeepneys, one of the symbols of the Philippines. I never know where they are going and they are terribly unenvironmental: they emit black smoke. I always travel by cab and have got used to it, but when I remember how well developed public transportation is in Russia, it becomes sad.

The Philippines can compete with Russia in the level of bureaucracy. You can't make a move here without a piece of paper. Once I ordered a mirror for myself. The parcel was left in the lobby, and I thought I could pick it up quickly from there. But they sent me to the local housing office to get a permit. I ran around the residence and did the paperwork to get the mirror home.

Filipinos are very slow people. Any process that can be stretched out, they will stretch it out. They are also very religious and believe that everything is predetermined by god, so there is no way they can change their lives. That said, Filipinos are a very friendly nation and will always help.

Manila is quite a dirty city. On my way to get a coffee, I can meet a person sleeping on a cardboard on the street. The dirt, the smells, the poor people on the streets - it makes it hard for me. I try to surround myself with beautiful things and be in something visually pleasing.

I don't see the Philippines as a permanent place to live - more like a phase. But for now, the pros outweigh the cons. Next year, I plan to enroll in a master's program in China. I've been dreaming about it for five years, but it hasn't worked out so far. I want to enter a creative field and develop as a photographer.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Yankees vs. Reds: When Your Starter’s Worse Than a Pop Song in 2025""**

The New York Yankees (45-32) roll into Cincinnati to face the Reds (40-38) on June 24, 2025, armed with a 1.5-run spread advantage and a starting pitcher, **Allan Winans**, who’s about as reliable as a TikTok trend. The Reds, meanwhile, counter with **Nick Lodolo**, a pitcher who’s basically the anti-Winans, fresh off a 4-1 win over the Cardinals.

**The Odds:**

* **Moneyline:** Yankees -1.6 (favorites), Reds +2.4 (underdogs).
* **Spread:** Yankees -1.5 (-110), Reds +1.5 (-110).
* **Total:** 9.5 runs (Over +183, Under -233).

**Why the Reds Might Win This With a Straight Face:**  
Lodolo (4.20 ERA, 1.25 WHIP) has the stuff of a guy who’d probably win a “Most Likely to Be a Barista” contest—consistent, unshowy, and not prone to spilling coffee (i.e., giving up runs). The Yankees? They’re starting Winans, who’s authored a 5.85 ERA and a 1.55 WHIP this season. Fun fact: Winans’ ERA is higher than the Reds’ team batting average (.252).

**The Under Is a Safe Bet for Grandma:**  
With both teams’ offenses resembling a slow-motion car crash (Yankees: .238 team BA, Reds: .245), the **UNDER 9.5 runs** (-233) is as safe as a vault in a world of Bitcoin memes. The Reds have hit the UNDER in 5 of their last 7 games; the Yankees? They’ve hit the UNDER exactly once in their last 10.

**Prediction:**  
The Reds will win 3-2 in 10 innings, with Lodolo looking like a $100 million draft pick and Winans looking like he forgot his own pitch count. The Yankees’ offense will muster exactly one hit, a double by Aaron Judge that’s ruled a ground rule single because the umpire was distracted by a squirrel.

**Final Score:** Reds 3, Yankees 2.  
**How It Happens:** The UNDER cashes, the Reds cover the 1.5-run spread, and the Yankees’ GM starts drafting a press release for next year’s “Rebuild 2026: Electric Boogaloo.”

*Place your bets before the Yankees’ lineup becomes a case study in why you never trust a pitcher named “Allan.”* 🎲⚾

Well now I finally seeked help after being in denial how I was mentally. 3 weeks before starting lexapro I started a strict diet, eating 1 time a day which consist a protein and vegetables, black coffee and green tea to suppress my appetite and for enwrgy. About 2 weeks later I was used to my current eating habit. Then I started  lexapro 5mg, about 2-3weeks in I would get cravings so I would just eat more of what I was eating but I eventually went away. About the 5th week I started to not feel? Like the things I was worried about before started to go away, like axienty. Now I'm 2.5 weeks in of 10mg, been feeling tired, no energy.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rangers vs. Orioles: A ""Home Run"" for the UNDER? Let’s Go!**

The Texas Rangers (38-40) and Baltimore Orioles (33-44) clash on June 24 in a matchup that’s about as exciting as a spreadsheet—*but hey, spreadsheets have their charms*. The Orioles, favored at -135, will send lefty **Trevor Rogers** (who’s probably still explaining his 2023 tax returns) against the Rangers’ **Patrick Corbin**, who’s 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in his last five starts. Corbin’s already given up 11 home runs this season, and Baltimore’s **Gary Sanchez** (2 HRs in 18 games) is a prop-bet goldmine, especially since he’s 3-for-10 with a dinger in his last two vs. Corbin.

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **Money Line**: Orioles -135, Rangers +120
* **Total Runs**: Over/Under 10.0 (-110 for both)
* **Spreads**: Orioles -1.5 (+110), Rangers +1.5 (-130)

**Why Bet the UNDER?**  
Because these teams are about as explosive as a wet firework. The Rangers scored 3 runs in their last game, and the Orioles? They lost to the Yankees 2-4. Both teams have hit the UNDER in 6 of their last 10 games. If you’re betting the UNDER 10.0, you’re basically predicting a game where the combined score will make your grandma ask, “Is this baseball or naptime?”

**Prop Bet Alert**:

* **Gary Sanchez**: Over 0.5 HR (-150). He’s a free swinger with a .300 ISO (slugging minus batting average) against lefties. Corbin’s ERA vs. LHBs? A friendly 6.23.

**Final Pick**:  
Take the **UNDER 10.0** (-110). It’s a safe bet for those who’d rather not watch a pitching duel that’s more “boring but profitable” than “thrilling but stressful.”

*Remember: If you bet on Sanchez’s HR, you’re betting on a man who’s turned 18 games into a home-run derby. If you bet the UNDER, you’re betting on a game that’ll make you question why you didn’t just watch paint dry.*

*Odds as of June 24, 2025. May your bets be profitable and your coffee strong.* 🎲⚾

Instead of doing a review on a caster I am going to do a review on this subreddit (Better read before it gets deleted, because I am quite certain it's going to be taken down)

I believe their are ""tiers"" or ""levels"" or whatever you want to call it of spell casters. Like how their are teachers for example. Both 2 teachers can get their qualifications but one can suck or another one can be great. Or how one coffee can work for you and another type of coffee makes you feel horrible, just as an example. 

Just to make as an example here are the tiers of casters I have seen on here (making up the tier names):

1. Scammers (Not really a tier): but they are fakers, probably don't even cast spells, and for sure do not work

2. Beginners: They casted some spells and genuinely believe in their work but they just don't have what it takes to cast and affect change for others

3. Apprentice: These casters are genuine as well, but a lot of their spells don't work, maybe they have a lucky break here and there but they need more practicing

4. Intermediate: These casters are like 50/50, sometimes they work sometimes they don't

5. Advanced: These casters are like 60-70% range

etc

Point is levels 2+ they are genuine they want to genuinely help and actually do genuinely help (now whether they should be offering their services online is another convo). Also from my experience, from a customer perspective, your mindset, belief, throughout the spellcasting process is another convo, but even if you take 50 people (with little belief) to an advanced practitioner, I believe the 60-70% range would drop to near 1% if not 0, But that's another convo on its own. 

So my point with this is, yes there are scammers for sure. But there are a ton I mean a ton of legitimate casters that are being mentioned in this subreddit that are being labeled as scams. This is where the gray area is. 

People wonder why this subreddit has ""never came across a real caster""? Have you thought to think that since all there is in this subreddit is just scams being thrown around, that it affects the beliefs and mindsets of others (which affects the spell) and that if some people dont get results, they are labeled as scams, that ofc no ""real caster"" is going to be brought up. 

It also does not help that the moderator of this group ""Larry Levine"", doesn't even believe in spells himself, like make that make sense. If you are the mod of a spellcaster review subreddit and you don't believe in spells, then get rid of it lol. Now the argument can be made, ""well it's to protect others from getting scammed"". Sure, but if it's actually done in a conductive manner where just because some people did not get results they are not labeled as scammers. Their should be other metrics involved. And not to mention but by letting people just openly label genuine casters as scams, you are ruining the image of genuine casters. 

Also something else to mention which can be an entire other topic, but some casters work for some people, situation etc, but not for others. I think that sometimes. you just need to find the right caster for you. It's like a therapist, one therapist might work great for one person, but not for somebody else. Does that make them a scam? No lol 

In the end, this subreddit could be great, it really could.
