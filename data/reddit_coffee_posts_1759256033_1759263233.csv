So far the group consists of young professionals in the age bracket of 25-35 and we're all pretty similar in terms of interests and moral compass. The only rule is to be chill, avoid politics and enjoy the meetups. We usually go for cafes, restaurants but the next one will be a board games interactive event, this coming Saturday. 

The split is 65:35 male/female but anyone is welcome so long as they're friendly and don't judge. 

If anyone's interested in being invited, I'll soft scan/vet your reddit profile in order to get a brief idea of whether you may fit. I've had requests from people who've asked me if drugs are allowed and also seem to be pro groups that are controversial (on their profile). 

The food was pretty average and overpriced. The coffee was ok. 

I wouldn't recommend Qima unless you're looking for atmosphere alone, which amounts to quite an expensive atmospheric experience.

I've had seronegative RA since I was a teenager which was un treated for many years, I'm 30 now and I'm currently on Leflunomide and weekly Enbrel injections \~ recently switched from Humira. In my mid 20's I had a few years where RA didn't really affect me at all, I joined a gym, lost weight, and got into really good shape, I was also really strong. The pain came back with a vengeance over 2 years ago and I slowly lost a lot of my strength and motivation to do anything. I still workout 3-4 days a week but I have nowhere near the stamina I had before, I can't stand for long, can't hold on to things, and feel extremely fatigued.. It's so hard to not be able to do the things that I once could.

I also have a high level job in finance and am studying to be a CPA \~ Using the term studying loosely because I keep procrastinating. I've worked really hard to get to where I'm at and I just find myself lacking the effort to do anything.

Even if you have no suggestions I'd love to hear any stories on how you've overcome or pushed through the hard times.

Here are some things I've tried or considered:

* Creatine - I took creatine in the past but slightly concerned about the liver effect with Leflunomide.
* Coffee - the more coffee I drink the better I feel. I have 2 double shots of espresso a day but sometimes 3 on the weekend. I feel like this is excessive?
* Cryotherapy - Used in the past outside of a flare up, not sure if I should try again?
* Hot tub - Hot baths help some and I want a hot tub but not sure if it's worth it?
* Infrared Sauna - Recently started using, not sure if it's helping.
* Magnesium spray - used a few times, not sure if it did anything.
* Massages - I love massages but haven't been able to justify the cost of monthly, is it worth it?
* Therapist - Helps some with the depression caused by fatigue/lifestyle changes.
* Vitamins - I take many vitamins (B12, COQ10, D, Fish Oil, Magnesium, Multi, Turmeric..)",1,1759262627.0,rheumatoid,1,1.0,False

1nunlss,https://i.redd.it/aew86vyxycsf1.jpeg,Shocked at how many plants I’ve eaten in a week,"I recently learned that eating 30 different plants a week can do wonders for your gut health and microbiome, so I gave it a go.

Didn’t realize how little variety I was actually getting until I started keeping track - turns out it’s way too easy to just rotate the same 5-6 veggies on autopilot. This week I made a conscious effort, and I ended up eating 38 different plants (screenshot attached).

Honestly, counting my plants is fun because it pushes me to grab things I’d normally skip (like lentils, pumpkin seeds, or that random bunch of radishes I walk past while shopping).

And coffee counts as a plant, which is great! 😅

1nunkn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nunkn9/day_7_post_op/,Day 7 - Post Op,"This will be my last post for now unless something new comes up. 

FOOD:
I'm slightly trying to test myself to go beyond the bland diet - oats, banana, whole wheat toast, chicken bone broth, zuchini, eggplant, no fried, no spicy, no nuts, no dairy, no sugar, very minimal sodium, etc. So I tried 1/4 cup of black coffee with no sugar two days ago, and it was good. I also took a small bite of fried chicken (without the breading), and a small piece of choco chip cookies, it was all good, though I did not attempt to eat them again. 

Yesterday, I just had oats with banana and dates, and lentil soup. That's it. 

Today, I made sinigang (filipino soup dish, just vegetables and chicken) and baked dried milkfish, but it's all for my daughter. I just tried a bite or two. That's about it. 

After my ERCP, I'm still gonna stick to veggies, baked and grilled lean meat or fish and fruits. 

RECOVERY:
I'm still walking 5-10 minutes a day outside 1-2 times a day. I'm still doing chores except for lifting heavy stuff. 

I'm still using an ice pack on my tummy. But I don't need the heating pad on my back anymore. 

I'm also hydrating like crazy. It's good for digestion also. 

ERCP (Because of 1 small gallstone that travelled to the CBD, common bile duct):
I'm scheduled and I'm just waiting. 

ANY PAIN?
Yes, but not really painful, it's more of a tingling and slight pressure on the incision near my belly button. Other than that, zero. 

TOILET PROBLEM?
Zero! Maybe because I'm still not eating any super greasy stuff like burger, pizza or deep fried food? Also maybe because I hydrate like a mf

I forgot to mention that I eat pineapple everyday, like 3-4 small chunks each day. 

REGRET ON GETTING IT REMOVED?
Zero! I'm one week post op and I have no problems so far and the anxiety that i'm gonna have an attack is gone.

Snack -  wheaten, Babybels, butter and jam 10/10

Lunch - chicken and ham salad pitta with cottage cheese, wotsits, tomatoes and an apple  8/10

Snack - crumpet with butter and jam, 2 shortbread and an orange 7/10 (a lot of anxiety with this snack I couldn’t decide what to have and didn’t really enjoy it tbh :()

Dinner - chicken, tomatoes, chips!!, cheese and mixed veg with broccoli 9/10 (chips were SO good but my family are pointing out I need to stop overloading veg 🥲)

Dessert - HU chocolates 10/10 

Snack - muesli, honey and yogurt and fruit 8.5/10

I'm not sure how effective the film is in bringing new fans into the fold, but it absolutely supercharged my fandom (I'll no longer forget that, like Grand Funk Railroad, they're an American band). 

Hearing the likes of Adam Buxton and Jason Schwartzman (whom in The Overnight we saw dance to my favourite Sparks track, Tryouts For The Human Race (a song about cum)) was joyous, and I found myself singing under my breath throughout. The breadth of interviewees really brings a fantastic party vibe, especially when it's someone like Jane Wiedlin. 

It's hardly incisive filmmaking, but it DOES get to the heart of why Sparks is your favourite band's favourite band. They're so cool and funny and deep and Ben should reconsider their stuff! 

Plus, thanks to Annette and other successes, the film gets to have a happy ending (rather conveniently, All That sounds like it was written to be the triumphant song for the end of a movie) ❤️ Do what you love, make art for art's sake, and talk music with your mates until you need to go to bed.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Anyways... I was born an evangelical Christian but recently merged to a more pagan approach, namely Hellenism, it spoke to me in ways that felt so absolutely right that it's just something I can't deny. However, Jesus was my first love and I would like to incorporate him and more other christian concepts into my newfound Hellenistic practice. 

Lately, the best interpretation I could come up with was to pray to the Hellenic gods the same Catholics pray for saints, but as I was never Catholic I'm not exactly sure how to do it properly.

I've been making offerings that I think fit each god, like wine to Dionysus, black coffee to Hades, yellow candles and sunflowers to Apollo. And in my prayers I always start or end by praying to the Christian God and Christ himself. 

Yet it doesn't feel like it's enough. I would like to have more practical ways to express my devotion, like rituals, festivals perhaps.  I know that there are some parallels scholars created between Greek and Christian myths, but I don't have a good source. 

Unfortunately I don't know where to start since I never heard of such syncretism between Christianism and Hellenism. So any advice, idea, resource I can look into ?

Loneliness inside marriage is not about distance—it’s about silence, absence, and unspoken words. Today, let’s talk about how to handle loneliness in marriage when work pressure steals away your time with the one you love.""*

""Meet Emily and Ryan, a couple living in Chicago. Ryan works long hours in a corporate job. Emily spends her evenings waiting, scrolling through her phone, staring at the clock. On weekends, she hopes for a dinner date or a walk, but Ryan is too drained. They love each other deeply, but work has created a wall of silence between them. Emily feels lonely… even while lying next to her husband.""

""Loneliness in marriage doesn’t always scream loudly. Sometimes it’s quiet—like sitting next to each other without talking, or scrolling through phones instead of looking into each other’s eyes. For Emily, the loneliness feels heavier every day. She wonders: *Is this what marriage is supposed to be?*""

""One night, Emily finally speaks. ‘Ryan, I miss *us*. I don’t want to be in a marriage where I feel invisible.’ Her voice cracks. Ryan looks at her, shocked. He never realized that his long hours and constant stress had made Emily feel abandoned—while he thought he was securing their future, he was losing their present.""

 

""If you are in Emily or Ryan’s place, know this: loneliness in marriage can be healed. It starts with awareness, conversation, and action. Here are some ways to handle it.""

Talk about your feelings without blame. Instead of saying, ‘You never spend time with me,’ say, ‘I feel lonely when we don’t talk.’ Expressing emotions openly creates space for healing.""

""Even if you don’t have hours, 15 minutes of true presence—sharing coffee, a hug before bed, or a short walk—can fill the emptiness. Quality matters more than quantity.""

""Set boundaries. When work ends, switch off your phone, close the laptop, and remind yourself—your spouse needs your attention as much as your company does.""

""Build little rituals—like Saturday breakfast dates or a no-phone hour every night. Rituals create rhythm, comfort, and togetherness.""

""Remember, marriage is teamwork. Discuss schedules, plan future goals, and create a vision where both career and love have space to breathe.""

""Emily and Ryan made small changes. Ryan promised to be fully present at home. Emily began appreciating the little efforts. Slowly, the silence faded, replaced by laughter and conversation. Their marriage was not perfect—but it was alive again.""

""If you feel lonely in your marriage, remember—you are not alone. Talk, listen, and show up for each other. Love doesn’t need grand gestures—it needs presence. Because in the end, marriage is not about living under the same roof… it’s about building a home in each other’s hearts.""

Like clockwork. 9am, there he is at her desk with a latte and some overpriced breakfast sandwich from the cafe downstairs. And she just eats it up (literally and figuratively). The thing that's really getting under my skin is that Derek is, objectively, not great at his job. He misses deadlines constantly, half-asses his reports, and the rest of us end up picking up his slack. I've had to redo his work more times than I can count. But now he's suddenly besties with the boss because of some breakfast sandwiches? I was playing Apex Legends last night trying to decompress, and I just kept thinking about how unfair this whole situation is. Like, I actually do my job well. I meet my deadlines, I help other people on the team, I don't cause problems. But I'm not out here buying my way into someone's good graces.

And here's what really worries me: there's a promotion coming up in the next couple months. If Derek gets it because he's been sucking up with his little breakfast routine, I'm going to lose it. This dude doesn't deserve a promotion. He deserves a performance review.

I know office politics are a thing and schmoozing matters, but this feels so blatant and gross. Am I overreacting? Should I start bringing her breakfast too? (I really don't want to stoop to that level.) Or do I just accept that hard work doesn't actually matter as much as knowing how to kiss ass?

Hey Maximizame crew,

Been thinking a lot lately about what ""optimization"" really means. It's not about becoming a productivity robot who schedules every single second. It's about creating more space for the things that actually matter.

Here’s a breakdown of what’s been on my mind:

**Optimize Your Day 🚀**

It all starts with small, almost invisible wins. My favorite hack right now is the **""Two-Minute Rule.""** If a task takes less than two minutes, you do it *immediately*.

*   Answer that one quick email.
*   Put your cup in the dishwasher.
*   Hang up your jacket instead of throwing it on a chair.

It's amazing how much mental clutter this one little rule eliminates. You start building momentum instead of a giant, nagging to-do list.

**Boost Your Growth 🌱**

This is less about *what you do* and more about *how you think*. The biggest game-changer for me was reframing ""failure"" as **data**.

Messed up a new habit? That's not a personal failing. It’s just data telling you the approach wasn't quite right. Maybe you tried to do too much at once, or the timing was off. Tweak it and try again. This mindset removes the ego and pressure, turning growth into a fun experiment instead of a pass/fail test.

**Find Your Joy ✨**

And now for the most important part. None of the productivity hacks or growth strategies mean anything if you're not actually enjoying your life. We can get so focused on hitting the next goal that we forget to be present for the journey.

Lately, I’ve been doing simple ""joy check-ins."" Just pausing for 30 seconds to ask, ""What feels good *right now*?"" It could be the warmth of your coffee cup, a song you love on the radio, or the sun hitting your face.

Honestly, the emotional side of self-improvement is often the hardest part to navigate. It's tough to untangle all the ""shoulds"" from what you actually want and need. If you're struggling to find that balance or get a handle on your emotional well-being, I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a personal plan that felt authentic.

We're all optimizing *for* something. For me, that something is joy.

What's one small thing that brought you a little bit of joy today? Let's hear it in the comments.",1,1759261508.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1nun292,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1nun292/wanting_to_send_a_genuine_letter/,Wanting to send a genuine letter,"My ex (A) of 3 years left me just about 4 months ago. 

We had an incredible relationship until I broke her trust by having coffee with my only other ex (B) that I despise. This ex (B) and I only dated for about 6 months and she was terrible to me. We broke up in 2020 and I had never had any longing or missing for her, simply regret that I ever let her in and let her change me for the worst. She lives far away so I never had to worry about seeing her. Anyways she randomly called me from a new number one day saying she was nearby and wanted to get coffee while acknowledging we both were in new relationships. I knew absolutely nothing about her from the last 5 years and like an impulsive idiot I decided just like that to go for coffee so she can see how well I was doing and then leave. I pretty much got there and it clicked within 10 minutes how dumb this was so I left feeling extremely guilty. She then messaged my current partner (A) of 3 years that she saw me and I cheated. My current partner at the time (A) immediately assumed we slept together and left me. Then when I tried to contact (B) to tell her she needed to clarify her wording to (A) she pretty much told me she loved me and wanted to get back together.

So I played myself and really disrespected my partner for absolutely no reason, pretty much an impulsive ego driven decision that made me lose again and lose the one person who planned to be with me forever. But I don’t know if she thinks I slept with this ex or if she believes that I went for coffee. Either way this can be considered cheating but there definitely is a difference. So she left me and asked for me not to contact her, then called me a month later and we had an emotional call for about 3 hours. Then nothing since then. I’ve really put in the work these last months in changing my life habits, anything that could induce impulsivity and am re-wired how I see life and love as a whole. I haven’t talked to any girls since she left me as I really don’t have any desire and also feel this has allowed me to truly reflect on the situation without any distraction. I think part of me is proving to myself I am no longer impulsive and am honouring what we had while healing. 

It’s been almost 4 months now and I haven’t reached out or bothered her in anyway because I framed this as a way I can show I can put her needs above mine. But I have been wanting to write her a letter to go along with a pair of boots I still have of hers. When I say I’ve changed I really have, I look at life and love completely different, and while our relationship was so healthy and pure, I sacrificed it for nothing so I have taken this really seriously. From counselling, journaling, reading, and lifestyle changes. I want to send a low pressure letter that acknowledges my actions, how they affected her, how I really cherish what we had, and that her love has left a lifetime impact on me. I would never include anything that would make her feel pressured to respond or feel any sort of way. I also feel like it could be healthy closure for me because everyday all throughout the day my mind goes over what I’d say to her if I ever got the chance. I feel now I’m at a place where I am emotionally stable and would like for her to know loving me wasn’t a waste and that I am speaking from true clarity. Because our relationship was serious we had lifelong plans and I’m sure she must feel so confused and betrayed by me. ",1,1759261360.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1nun25c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nun25c/they_followed_me_everywhere/,They followed me everywhere,"Mine is a cautionary tale. One that I'm reliving for the benefit of everyone out there. Did you know that stress is one of the biggest killers of men under 40? I did, and I should have paid more attention to that. But I wanted more in my life. I'd done pretty well for myself, I'd been blessed with intelligence and had put it to good use over the years, working my way up through the company to secure a great job. I worked hard and had a good income. I lived in a nice house in a quiet and safe area of town,  great friends and drove my dream car. I was comfortable and had pretty much everything I ever dreamed of, but I wanted more.

That's an unfortunate part of the human condition: we're never satisfied with what we have. We strive for better, bigger, more expensive - just more. And I was no different. I didn't recognise how fortunate I was. I never took the time to look around and actually see what I'd achieved. I wanted to grab everything with both hands. So when a new vacancy came up within the company, a more senior position which paid almost double my already handsome salary, I jumped at the opportunity.

I applied that very same day and sailed through the interview process. I was a hit with all the big wigs and they offered me the job. I started immediately. But with a bigger salary comes more responsibility, and with that comes the stress. Now, I was prepared for the added stress - or at least I thought I was - until the voices started.

I know what you're thinking - I'm crazy right? That's what I started to tell myself, especially since nobody else ever heard the voices . That was my first line of defence: dismiss it, minimise it, explain it away. I tried to rationalise that maybe I was just overhearing snippets of conversations - neighbours, people outside, something on the TV playing in the background - and in my tired state, I attributed it to something more sinister. But the thing that made it harder to ignore was that the voices were always the same.

Three of them stood out. Others came and went, like background chatter bleeding through a wall, but these three were consistent, familiar, and impossible to write off as coincidence. I started calling them by names. Now don't go thinking that naming them meant I was comforted by their presence - quite the opposite. They terrified me. But giving them names made them feel smaller somehow, something I could get a get a handle on instead of something lurking in the dark corners of my mind.

There was Moira, a woman's voice - youngish, sharp, the most aggressive of the three. She never threatened me outright, but the way she spoke... it seethed. Anger, frustration, sometimes even heartbreak. She unsettled me in ways I still can't describe.

The second voice was the least frightening, though no less strange: a little boy I called Max. Max only ever wanted to play. He sounded young - six, maybe seven - and there was a loneliness in his tone that made my chest tighten. He didn't scare me the way Moira did. If anything, I felt sorry for him. The feeling he gave me wasn't dread, but sadness - like he was waiting for someone who'd forgotten him.

The last voice was the one that truly unnerved me. Have you ever been alone in a house and heard a child crying? I don't mean a sniffle or a whine, but real guttural, heart-breaking howling - the kind that rattles your nerves and makes you want to run even if you don't know why. That was her. I called her Bella. She never spoke actual words, just cried and cried, and no amount of talking or ignoring or logic could make it stop. I could be making coffee, brushing my teeth, answering emails at work - it didn't matter. She was there, waiting somewhere just out of sight.

I began to wonder if this was how schizophrenia began, or dissociative identity disorder - some fracture in the mind that started small and then split open. But the more I listened, the more I noticed: they didn't sound like they were coming from inside my head.

They sounded... around me. Behind me. Across the room. Sometimes right next to my ear. That was when the ghost theory crept in. Ridiculous as it sounds, it made a certain kind of sense in the moment. I started thinking of them as my own personal hauntings - spirits that had latched onto me somehow, I found myself talking to them out loud, asking questions into an empty room like an idiot.

""What do you want?"" I remember shouting out one night when Bella's crying had gone on for what felt like hours. Max didn't answer beyond a plaintive ""Play with me?"" in his usual questioning tone. Bella just howled, inconsolable as ever. But Moira? She often replied. ""I want you to see me."" she'd replied once, her voice low and shaking with rage. I remember standing in the kitchen, scanning every corner as if she might flicker into view.

""Then show yourself"" I said. ""I'm right here!"" she snapped back, almost offended. Other times she muttered things I brushed off without much thought back then. ""You're not listening."" ""You're not hearing me."" ""You ignore everything."" When I tried to engage, she got angrier, like I was doing something wrong without knowing what. It was only during the dead of night that the voices ceased. Strange right? Not that that ruled out the ghost theory, but I thought those things were supposed to be more active at night. Sometimes, just as I was falling asleep, I'd feel the mattress shift beside me. The faint impression of weight, like someone was lying down. Once or twice, I even heard a soft ""Goodnight"", barely more than a breath. By the time I opened my eyes, there was no one there. Moments like that bolstered the ghost theory. It was easier than confronting the possibility that my mind was splintering. But I never saw her, never saw any of them, so I lived with them.

My personal ghosts, I called them in my head. Strange how I found that easier to accept than the possibility my mind was slipping. I really did think that's what they were - ghosts - but the truth was worse.

Eventually I made an appointment with my GP. I chalked it up to stress, overwork, exhaustion - whatever label made it sound temporary and fixable. When I really thought about it, the voices had begun around the time I took the new job, around six months earlier. New role, longer hours, heavier workload. Logical connection, right? My doctor seemed to think so. He told me I needed to take some time off work. Get out more. See my family. Relax my brain. See the world. Step away from the social bubble and digital noise. Live in the real world for a while he said. I nodded like I understood, but I didn't really take it the way he meant it. I honestly don't think you would have either, not then.

So I did what he said - sort of. I booked two weeks off. I didn't go travelling; holidays cost too much and I'm more of a homebody. My family? We weren't close. Instead, I saw friends, treated myself to a bit of retail therapy, read books, listened to music and stayed up late watching movies instead of catching up on work. It all sounded healthy enough in my head. No work, no deadlines, no stress. That was the plan. And for a moment I thought I'd cracked it. No voices, right? Wrong. If anything, they got worse. Louder, more persistent. More certain I was supposed to be paying attention to them. I found myself longing to get back to work - anything so I could drown them out a little.

And then there were the times I felt I was living my life like anyone else. Meeting friends, having a laugh, maybe a pint or two. I remember one evening especially. A few mates were joking about their week, someone passed around photos from a recent holiday, someone else telling a story I barely listened to as I slowly consumed more and more alcohol, my head beginning to get fuzzy. A woman caught my eye - pretty, sharp witted. We chatted. A bit of harmless flirting. She laughed at something I said and I felt that old spark of validation. I took her number, but I didn't really intend to see her again. She was just a distraction. Somewhere in the back of my hazy mind, I think Moira muttered something. Nothing outright, nothing you'd notice if you weren't listening for her, and I was always listening. A low, irritated ""Unbelievable,"" or something similar. I brushed it off. Habit, by then.

It had seemed like a normal night out with friends. But it wasn't. I wasn't even dressed to leave the house.

The weekly food shop was the same. I was pushing a trolley down an aisle, comparing prices, being practical. I remember hovering over a head of broccoli, debating whether I'd actually cook it this time. That's when Max piped up: ""I don't like that."" This wasn't his usual ""Play with me?"" and it caught me off-guard. Without thinking, I asked him what he did like. Junk food, of course - crisps, biscuits, the kind of thing any kid would go for. And my mind jumped to the id, ego and superego. I'd studied psychology at college and knew a little on the subject. Was this my id begging to be indulged? The child part of me demanding a say? If so then what the hell was Bella?

I decided to feed the id. The junk went into the trolley. The fruit and vegetables stayed where they belonged - on the shelves. ""Next week,"" I promised myself. ""I'll be healthier next week."" It felt oddly satisfying, like I'd struck a balance between control and surrender. And for a time Max was quiet. Maybe I just had to work out what the other two wanted?

I remember thinking about the voices then - about Moira, Max, and Bella. Were they all parts of me? Ghosts? Hallucinations? I wasn't a hardened sceptic, and I wasn't a blind believer. If they were spirits, they hadn't harmed me. Scared me, sure. But hurt me? No. I figured I could live with them.

Only I wasn't in a supermarket. I was scrolling through an online grocery app. Strange how our minds can play trick like that isn't it? How easily we misremember.

And then, just as suddenly as the had begun, the voices stopped. Two weeks ago, they simply... vanished. Moira's barbed remarks, Max's soft pleas, Bella's endless wailing - gone. I still heard the occasional unfamiliar voice, faint as static, but the main three had disappeared. At first I was elated. The silence was bliss. No more crying from nowhere, no more shadows of conversations lurking just behind my thoughts. That crawling unease that had lived under my skin for months finally eased.

But it didn't take long for the quiet to turn on me. I hadn't realised how used to their presence I'd become. They'd been unsettling, yes, but they'd also been company. Without them, the world felt hollow. Empty. I felt alone in a way I couldn't justify, like something vital had been scooped out of me. Loneliness is a strange thing. You can ignore it when there's noise - when something's filling the gaps. But when the gaps widen, you start to notice the cold.

I made another appointment to see my GP. This feeling wasn't right, it wasn't good and I didn't understand it. And then three days ago, the silence broke - but not in the way I expected. I heard crying again. Bella. I knew that cry immediately, it was carved into my nerves like a groove in brick. For a second I, froze. I couldn't tell where the sound was coming from. Then came Max ""Play with me."" He sounded closer than ever, and I felt an odd rush of excitement. And then - her. Moira. Except she didn't sound angry this time.

""We need to talk,"" she said. Not a shout. Not a snap. Just tired.

It was like the thin membrane between their world and mine stretched, then tore. Vision isn't the right word for what came next. It was more like remembering something I'd never let myself consciously know.

I saw the. Not ghosts. Not figments of my fractured imagination. My family.



A woman sitting at the end of a sofa, face drawn with exhaustion, phone in her hand. A little boy with a tablet abandoned beside him, clutching a bright red toy car, his eyes red from crying. And a baby - my baby - strapped into her high chair, cheeks blotchy, mouth wide in an endless wail.

The room wasn't unfamiliar. It was my living room. The wallpaper we'd chosen together. The blanket she loved draped over the arm of the couch. The dent in the carpet where the coffee table had been before we moved it to make room for a playmat.



And then the most horrifying part: me



I was there in the memory - no, in the truth - sitting in the same room but not *in* it. Laptop open. Headphones on. Phone buzzing with notifications. I wasn't looking at them. I hadn't been looking at them for a long time. They weren't ghosts - I made them ghosts. I pushed them out of my world until all I hear of them were echoes. And now they were gone.

That's when the doorbell rang in the present. I flinched, my heart hammering. It was a delivery driver with a parcel I don't remember ordering. Once I'd signed for it and closed the door I saw the envelope again on my desk. The divorce papers. My name. Her name. Custody terms. Mediation dates. Agreements I had supposedly read. My own signature printed digitally at the bottom from weeks ago. I sat down slowly, my phone still in my hand. I didn't even remember picking it up. The doctor was still talking through the screen, his voice muffled by the ringing in my ears.

""You need to rest,"" he said. ""And support is important right now. Antidepressants can help balance your thinking so you can face what's happening. You can't undo it by pretending it isn't real. I know it'd hard, but you have to face up to reality.""

I don't remember hanging up, but suddenly the call was over. The silence in the room felt huge. My fingers loosened around the phone and it dropped onto the desk with a dull clack.

That's when I heard it.

Music, faint but unmistakable, coming from a playlist I must have left running on the smart speaker behind me.



""***Don't it always seem to go,***

***that you don't know what you got 'til it's gone***...""

""Big yellow taxi"" Joni Mitchell's voice floated through the air like a verdict.

I closed my eyes



My wife - Moira. Not her real name, but the name I'd given to the anger in her voice when she begged me to pay attention. When she said she was right there.

My son - Max. The little boy who wanted to play. Who asked and asked over and over until he stopped asking altogether.

My daughter - Bella. The teething baby whose only language was crying. Who didn't understand why daddy wouldn't look at her.

They were never ghosts. They were never hallucinations. They were moments and memories and pleas filtered through a man who lived more online than in his own house.

They didn't leave because of the stress. They left because of me.

Isn't it funny how your mind can play tricks on you?



So this is my cautionary tale. Not really one of stress - we all have stresses. It's how we respond to it that matters. I urge you to put down your phone, your tablet, close your laptop and engage with the world. Play with your kids. Make memories with them that none of you will ever forget. Spend time in nature, appreciate the beauty around you. Spend time with friends, and talk with them, really talk with them. Sit with your spouse, laugh and be present.

Put down the devices and make time for what's truly important. You can never get that time back.

Follow my advice, and you can have everything you ever dreamed of.



I did.

Until I didn't.

So since I am single now,  I am on the dating apps (Dil Mil, Hinge, Coffee Meets Bagel) and I have been matching with a lot of Fobs (some of them are good looking, seem friendly and all tbh) but how do I get over the fact that they are straight from India. I mean they have been living here for a while and they are Americanized in a way but how do I get over them being Fobs. I feel like Indian American guys are either 1) Dont match with me 2) Aren't cute at all or are weird   3) Are more traditional than even the Indians from India  4) don't even date brown girls or if they do they want a Deepika looking brown girl. How do I get over with hearing the accent and I'm scared about others judging me poorly being with a fob romantically ? Like my other cousins all married Indian American guys ( IDK why I'm having so much trouble finding one) but idk please help. Granted I don't even talk to those cousins but IDK im scared about my other cousins judging me being with a Fob also.

  
I am 32 years old (not getting any younger) im in shape, have a good job. So advice please. Are there any Desi American girls who married men straight from the home country? Does it work? Is it worth it?",0,1759260916.0,SplendidaBrown,3,0.4,False

* Distal Leg - Left: Epidermal nerve fiber density is reduced (1.7 fibers/mm).
* Distal Thigh - Left: Epidermal nerve fiber density is reduced.
* Prox Thigh - Left Epidermal nerve fiber density is reduced (3 fibers/mm). 

But, when I went to see a neuromuscular specialist (different doctor than who ordered the original test - long story, but I moved and changed insurances), I was told to disregard these results because my symptom profile doesn't match the traditional/classic symptom profile for small fiber neuropathy. I don't get burning pain in my hands or feet and my office assessment was otherwise normal.

It's been a year since I went to see that doctor and I basically gave up and have told myself it must be psychosomatic, but I continue to have electric shock-type pain in my legs, pins and needles in my legs and arms, muscle cramping in the same spots, and more. I have a bunch of other weird symptoms too but not sure what's relevant. Fatigue is a big one for me and ongoing pain, always in the same spots, but it's definitely not fibromyalgia.

I did have a positive tilt table test in 2018, (went from 70 bpm laying down to about 130 bpm upright) and was diagnosed with a diagnosis I don't want to type out because I don't want to end up in those search results (P\*O\*T\*S) I wonder if this throws a wrench into things as that's a tricky diagnosis these days. (I'm not on Tiktok, to clarify, and this is a throwaway account - I actually spend very little time on social media). I didn't even ask for that diagnosis - it was given to me by a cardiologist after the tilt table. 

I go for daily walks, have a normal BMI, focus on gentle movement, I go to physical therapy, don’t drink coffee and limit caffeine, I eat fairly well, I've cut out alcohol, I practice decent sleep hygiene (pain makes it difficult to sleep) and I have a fairly active social life outside of work. I feel like I do ""all the right things.""

I'm not seeking medical advice, but I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience at first? Looking for anecdotal evidence, I suppose... I'm making an appointment for a second opinion but should I give up and accept that maybe this is in my head? (if it is, why was my biopsy report abnormal? could I be normal with these results? I thought it had a high specificity?) I hate the idea of going back and being told the same thing.",1,1759260806.0,smallfiberneuropathy,0,1.0,False

I am independent with my own place, have a successful career making good money, and have no kids.  

In terms of appearance - I'm often complimented on how I'm dressed. I'm thin and toned...I'm very into my health and my skin (I don't smoke or drink), and workout multiple times a week.  Both men and women never believe I'm 42 and always assume somewhere in the range of 33-35. 

I have been on dating apps for a while and never have a problem getting matches or being asked out on dates.  I also get approached in the street fairly often as well - whether it be coffee shops, waiting for  public transportation, restaurants, etc.  I also often get approached to/from the gym - when I believe I look my LEAST attractive lol.  

Therefore, I believe I'm fairly attractive - I don't say this with any degree of ego as I don't think of myself as some supermodel by ANY stretch and there are certainly women out there who are far more attractive than I am, but just sharing evidence of my reality.

I'm a kind person who genuinely enjoys helping people. I think I'm pretty smart and well-read, and my friends think I'm funny lol.  I'm definitely not ""difficult"" as I never have an issue with anywhere I go on a date - I'm a very go with the flow kinda person and certainly never look for anything fancy (I love cheap dive bars with good music).

My issue is that I'll have great first dates but they almost never lead to second dates, and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.  If I'm interested in the guy, I will always try to show it by either sitting closer or touching his hand or arm, etc.  The guy often seems to like me while we're on the date - they'll prolong the date by asking to spend more time at different spot or go for a walk, they're super engaged, and often want to drive me home (even though I can very easily just call an Uber).  But when they drop me off at home, that's almost always where it seems to end, and I just don't know why. 

Do any men out there have any theories?  

I really don't think there's an issue with me potentially not looking like my photos because I would absolutely NEVER use a filter on a photo or modify it in any way (and people often tell me I look the same as my photos), and I still get approached often in public - so I feel like it's probably not a looks thing?  

I definitely don't go for men who are out of my league - I prefer ""regular"" guys (I'm not going for GQ models).  I don't care if the guy is bald or a little on the chubbier side (as long as it works for him and he carries it well, I have zero issue). I'm also not someone who cares if the guy is 6 feet (I've gone out with plenty of guys who were well below that height and never cared), so I don't think I have some impossible standard. 

Any theories? Have any men out there ever met a girl who they didn't want to ask out on a second date for reasons that may not be obvious?

Would it be weird or pathetic if I started asking some of these men for feedback just to try and understand what it is I'm putting out there that for some reason turning them off?  I realize they may not be totally honest in their feedback, but maybe it's just worth a shot because I'm at a loss here.  I really want to be able to fix whatever this is, but I can't fix it if I don't know what it is.  

Would you guys be open to providing honest feedback if a woman respectfully sent a text asking for it? ",0,1759260805.0,datingoverforty,20,0.2,False

Easy to wish we'd developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga.

It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do, the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.

But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy.

We can't tell if any of those other versions would have been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on. \~Matt Haig",3,1759260692.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

I here to tell y'all part 8 to this saga! This part is my train-wreck of a 20th birthday party. Note this whole part's events takes place though out a week. Also, Ms. Mal-doll comes back to my life and guess what, the Fatty club never went away. After my birthday is the start of winter semester in my college.

**FIRST! THE PEOPLE!**

**Dizzy:** Me! The trans-man pill-popper turning 20!

**Artlad:** The 19 year old party dude.

**Bestbro and Bestgal:** Both are 19 and the couple who act like parents.

**Salty Sal:** My 60 year old uncle who no time for bullshit. He hosted me and my friends.

**Ms. Mal-doll:** The 20 year old ex-friend of Queenie and ready to uhhh ""confess"" her feelings.

**Goodfella:** My 18 year old ""friend"" who want to be in my birthday

**Sourface:** The 21 year old older brother of Goodfella and the reason he's here comes up later.

**Minor characters: My sister ""books"" 22 years old, Mama in her 50's, Papa in is 60's and my Auntie ""Mellow Mel"" in her 60's and she's the wife of Salty Sal.**

**LET'S START!**

Picture it! Christmas has come and gone and the New Year also has come and gone and I was carrying my suitcase to Artlad's car. My cousin and her family has already left up to NorCal and I was waiting for Artlad to pick me up since this is he's first time going up north. So the plan was me and Artlad staying with my uncle Salty Sal's place for the whole week and everybody was going to meet up on Friday for my party and spend the weekend at a cabin with friends, fishing. My family has a tradition where we spend next coming birthday celebrating someone's first job and/or starting college. I was the only one hitting this milestone so I wanted something fun and simple with a few people. But I only invited Artlad, Bestbro and Bestgal, However only Artlad is staying the whole week. Artlad and I hopped into his car and head out the 210 freeway and do y'all remember the game Bobby Hill play in that one scout episode? Wematanye? We played that at the first hour of our 6 hour drive when we notice a car following us. I was freaking out while Artlad thought we should get off at the next exit to a gas station since we needed to fill up anyway. As we stop at a pump, the car following us was none other then Ms. Mal-doll in the driver sit. Ah FUCK!

I debated this part of the saga but I thought to condense it since this part really isn't important. Long story short, Ms. Mal-doll wanted to talk to us in person and wanted to confess something and she knew what Artlad's car look like since she did help Queenie stalk Artlad. Both Artlad and I firmly said ""NO FUCK OFF WE'RE BUSY"" and I threaten to call the cops on her if she followed us again. With a ""hufftm"" and she sped off. At the time we had no idea why she did that but it well obvious soon. So we went back to the freeway to continue the rest of the five hours to my uncle Salty Sal place in beautiful, quite bliss. As we arrived at my uncle's place, he welcome us with open arms and with his thick accent asked Artlad if he has done any farm work? Of course not but he was no stranger to heavy lifting. You see Salty Sal is a dairy farmer of a small ranch of 10 cows. Every morning, he would wake up milk the cows so it be made into either cheese, butter and any other dairy products. Since I haven't seen him for a couple of years, he wanted to host me and honestly parties in the countryside go hard. After showing us where our rooms and getting settled, that night while laughing at Artlad's low tolerance for spicy food we hear a knock on the door. Salty Sal gets up wondering who the hell is at his door at this hour, upon opening we all see the one knocking was none other then Ms. Mal-doll. Artlad and I look at each other and wondering how the hell she got here, neither us told her where nor did see her following though out the drive.

**Artlad: Ms. Mal-doll! How the Hell?!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I can't believe you!**

Ms. Mal-doll was angry as fuck, this bitch push my uncle aside not even addressing him at all and she walks in as if she own the place. Salty Sal however was no spring chicken, he stepped in front of her with a voice that would make anyone stop.

**Salty Sal: What are you doing! This is my house and you don't walk in here just cause!**

My uncle Salty Sal was a 5' 10"" man with a built only can be created from working on a dairy farm. Salty Sal knows a thing or two about dealing with heifers.

**Ms. Mal-doll: I-I-I just wanted to talk to Artlad.**

**Salty Sal: Then do it outside! It's My house!**

**Me: How the hell you even found us?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I asked around!**

At this point, I push Ms. Mal-doll outside and Artlad follow suit. I only ever given my uncle's location to only Bestbro and Bestgal and they wouldn't give it to anyone right?

**Artlad: Dude! You're freaking us out! You reappear out of nowhere and now you're mad at us?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: This is my only chance to confess!**

**Me: How. Did. You. Get. Here.**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Sourface told me!**

Huh!? How!? I turn to Artlad to see him white as a sheet of paper. Before I could ask what did she mean by that, she run up to Artlad and holds his arms.

**Artlad: Whoa Huh?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Artlad I've always have a huge crush on you! Now since Queenie isn't here, I couldn't stop thinking about you!**

**Artlad: Uhhhhhh...**

does Artlad have some kind of golden dick or something? I swear when ever a girl likes Artlad, they just go koo-koo bananas for him. I step in to say:

**Me: Dude! You can't just come here and do...whatever the fuck but this isn't my home! I don't want to stress my family out!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I'm not leaving until I get an answer!**

**Me: What answer?!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: YOU LOVE ME BACK ARTLAD!? Ever since you join the club, you were the only one I had eyes for! SO?! Do ya!?**

**Artlad: Uhhhh I uhh, I mean, I think, DIZZY HELP!**

**Me: HUH!? Just answer truthfully!**

**Artlad: I DON'T KNOW!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I'M NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU ANSWER!**

That's when my uncle steps in and since we're making a lot of noise he offers an option that both horrifies and amuses me. He offers her to stay, Artlad looks scared, Ms. Mal-doll looks pleased but there's a catch. She can stay as long as she works with us at the farm like me and Artlad had promised. She asked what he meant by that, and Salty Sal was more happy to explain. All of us had to wake up at the crack of dawn, milk all 10 cows, make butter and cheese, sell it, come back, feed the cows and do farm/barn maintenance until sundown. To which Ms. Mal-doll said ""oh hell nah"" and she wasn't doing any of that blah blah blah, so my uncle with his cold-dead stare, pulls out his rifle and with a click, points at her and says ""then get off my property"". To which was my first time seeing a fat girl runs so fast to her car and peel off. We head inside the house and if you're wondering ""where's your auntie Mellow Mel?"" well she wasn't home and when on a day trip with my folks and wouldn't be back until the morning. To give a quick explain to my blood relation to my uncle, well Salty Sal is my mom's older brother. Not important to the story, just in case someone asked.

Salty Sal asked if Artlad could leave me and him alone and he wants to have a word with me. Code for ""leave the room cuz imma scold this dumbass"" and like a true Mexican dad, he did scold me me in old school country Spanish. I told him I haven't plan for any of this so he let me off with a warning. That night I quietly knocked on Artlad's door and I was going to ask questions. As quiet as a church mouse, we talked.

**Me: Dude! What the hell was that?**

**Artlad: I know right.**

**Me: And what she mean by that?**

**Artlad: Who knows.**

**Me: I meant that how did Sourface knew where we were going.**

**Artlad: Ohhhhh. About that. Remember you send your uncle's address so I can put it in google maps right?**

**Me: Yeah?**

**Artlad:** \*takes a deep breath\* **I gave it to Sourface because I told him that you had single family members and I promised I'll hook him up.**

**Me: YOU-** \*covering my mouth as to not yell\* **you asshole. Why the hell would you do that? No one in the party is single but me and my sister.**

**Artlad: Is your sister looking?**

**Me: Fuck you. I don't want Sourface as a brother in law nor will she go for someone like that.**

**Artlad: It was a joke. But yeah, I fucked up. Don't worry, since we're going to the fishing cabins he'll probably get bored and leave.**

**Me: Artlad really?**

**Artlad: Trust me. I know what I'm doing.**

All I said is ""fine whatever"" and leave back to my room. No point of arguing when I needed to sleep for farm work the next day. For some reason I had a nightmare about being a groomsman to Artlad's wedding and marrying Ms. Mal-doll. I still shiver when I think about it for reasons down the road.

Just like Salty Sal said, at the crack of dawn we woke up with the smell of pancakes and really strong coffee, made by my auntie Mellow Mel. Boy did I needed that coffee but as soon as we finish, we headed to the barn, milked the cows, took the milk to be made into cheese and butter, load it up to the truck so that Mellow Mel sells it to the farmers market and worked the fields until sundown. I grew up in the suburbs and my family would visit Salty Sal from time to time and I did do some farm work when I visit but I was surprise Artlad was doing just fine. I'm glad I haven't taken my phone with me that day since I had poor cell-signal but the little did had was mostly in the house where's WIFI was at, because as soon as sundown came, we took turns showering since there's one bathroom and I was getting ready for dinner when I look at my phone to see so many texts from Ms. Mal-doll. I've 100% forgot to block her after I left the club and ""made"" her break her friendship with Queenie. I read some of them but it was mostly she whining how I ""cockblocked from her man"" and ""he still didn't give me an answer"". Yawn, I erase the rest of them and headed to the kitchen for dinner. Sore from that day's work, I ain't got time for that nope, I only have time for classic Mexican food and funny YouTube videos.

Artlad, in-between mouthfuls, asked if I got any weird texts from Ms. Mal-doll. I told him what I got from her and Artlad was a little paved about it but I ease his fear by showing him a funny cat video. That's how most of the week played out. Artlad and I helping my uncle on his dairy farm and seeing random texts from Ms. Mal-doll, all ignored of course. This is where we start the party prep. It's Thursday evening and my auntie is asking how many people are coming to my party. I tell I invited three people and the other two should becoming on Friday and we all fix the little barn where we had my birthday. I then told Artlad to uninvite Sourface cuz I don't want trouble with my family and he gave me a ""I got this! Stop worrying so much"". I rolled my eyes, but at this time my sister ""Books"" finally came and we play Mario party on her N64 that she brought with her to college. God I miss that console. Friday came! My mom and dad pull up at the barn and we set up chairs, tables and just party stuff. At around 3pm everybody showed up, then i saw that familiar red F-150 pull up.

I looked at Artlad and he face-palmed so hard, I realized he forgot to uninvite Sourface, but I was more mortified cuz Ms. Mal-doll AND Goodfella pulled up. Wait GOODFELLA?! I thought how the hell did he knew. To speed run this, Sourface was shocked to see Goodfella and Ms. Mal-doll, Both him and her fight over something, Goodfella admits to over hearing me and Artlad talk about and got the address from Sourface, More fighting causing Salty Sal and me to make a deal with them, They can stay as long as they behave! I wasn't worried about Goodfella (although I've should have \*hint hint\*) but I'm pretty sure Ms. Mal-doll was only here to whoo Artlad and Sourface wanted to whoo any single family member I may have.

**Salty Sal: HEY Young ones!**

**Me: ¿Que paso? {what's up?}**

**Salty Sal: If your friends wants to stay and go to the cabin? Then they should be part of the games!**

**Bestbro: Games? What games?**

**Salty Sal: PIG GAMES!**

Yes my uncle Salty Sal is a dairy farmer, but he's an old-school Mexican who refuses to get a garbage disposal, since he lives in a farm, he has some pigs for disposing scraps. And guess what game my country family members LOVES to play? PIG RIDING! PIG WRESTLING! AND HOG CATCHING! Those are the pig games. As I was explaining this to everybody, my uncle was setting up tracks for HOG RIDING! Since my birthday is in the middle of winter, we can't pig-wrestle nor catch some hogs cuz the water will freeze in the NorCal winter. Artlad was ready to play while Bestbro and Bestgal look at each other with an impish smile, knowing they'll get good pics to laugh at. Goodfella had this look that showed his discomfort but trying to hide it to be polite. Sourface cued his bitching! Saying ""I'm not riding no hogs! I don't want my clothes to get dirty!"" and my uncle, without missing a beat replies ""Don't worry, nobody wants to ride you big boy, just stand and watch!"". My uncle Salty Sal indirectly called him a hog to cut his bullshit! Again to speed run this, my cousins brought out like three pigs and if you ever seen a fully grown pig, they are HUGE, like not the ones you see in county fairs. Hog riding was mostly my cousins falling backwards, get up and try to catch the pigs to start over again, it's really funny and everybody seemed to be having fun including Sourface, everyone except Ms. Mal-doll. The look of displeasure did not leave her face, if anything she looked annoyed.

**Ms. Mal-doll: Ugggh, why would anyone find hillbilly games fun? How low grade!**

**Me: Dude it's funny! Come Ms. Mal-doll lighten up a bit!**

**Artlad: Yeah! It's the same as chasing a chicken to gain speed!**

Ms Mal-doll did lighten up a bit but only Artlad ""convinced"" her. But it's really more like if Artlad likes it then she likes it too. I swear, Artlad must be like catnip to these women. After some more laughing and my auntie bringing out the cake (tres leches FYI, best flavor ever), my mom and uncle handed me the key to the family cabin that we all share. My father then handed me a fishing pole and sneak in a key that I recognized as the key to the liquor cabinet. Thanks dad! The real MVP! I told both Bestbro and Artlad and we got ready to head out, and told Goodfella, Ms Mal-doll and Sourface to follow us to the cabin and the ""real"" party is going to start. It was 5pm and the sun was ready setting but the sooner we leave, the sooner we can start a bonfire.

Let me describe this cabin that has been in my family since the 80's, it's a big-ish cabin, it has like five rooms and a living room that combined a den and the kitchen. Basically behind the nook sat the sofa and about five feet in front sat the chimney and on the side is the five rooms. Outside, in the front was the porch and the dock for fishing and it was middle of the forest. This cabin had no cable tv, no internet and no cell service at all. only a landline but that's for emergencies only. It's pretty old too, built in the 70's and point is to be off the grid. Everybody wasn't too happy about it until I showed them the key to the liquor cabinet, that night instead of a bonfire, we started a fire in the chimney and that's when things got good! I opened a bottle of Jägermeister and all seven of us played ""swig of honesty"" AKA take a drink from the bottle and tell one truth about yourself. At first it was like ""I have brown hair"" and ""We've been dating for two years"" but slowly as we get drunker, the truth slips out like butter on a griddle.

From what I remember:

**Artlad:** \*drinks\* **I only date to have fun! Hence why I'm single** \*passes the bottle\*

**Goodfella:** \*drinks\* **I knew I was gay at 13. But never did anything until 16.** \*passes the bottle\*

**Sourface:** \*drinks\* **I regret messing around with Queenie, I hate her so much!** \*passes the bottle\*

**Bestbro:** \*drinks\* **I feel like a the dad in this fucking group! Y'all need to get your shit together!** \*passes the bottle\*

**Bestgal:**  \*drinks\* **I always knew Dizzy was some kind of gay! Dizzy never talked about crushes to anyone!** \*passes the bottle\*

**Me:** \*drinks\* **I used think Queenie was cute but she's the kind of girl men warned other men to NOT stick your dick into! Some Mexican men love plus size.** \*passes the bottle\*

**Ms. Mal-doll:** \*drinks\* **I only join the HAES club to learn how to convince men into liking me! Queenie promise me that!** \*passes the bottle\*

**Artlad:** \*drinks\* **I join the HAES club to find a fat girl I like to fuck with! I wanted to cross off 'slept with a fat girl' of my Fuck-It-List.** \*passes the bottle\*

**Goodfella:** \*drinks\* **I knew Queenie had pictures of Artlad that she...uhhh...""flick"" her bean to. She told me one night drunk and heartbroken.** \*passes the bottle\*

**Sourface:** \*drinks a big gulp\* **I wish I didn't hear that!** \*mumbles\* **Two timing bitch!** \*passes the bottle\* (when he said that everybody including Goodfella said ""same!"")

You get the idea however, the next truth from Ms. Mal-doll didn't surprise me at all but did confused me.

**Ms. Mal-doll:** \*drinks\* **Since Artlad was the only skinny one, Queenie had eyes on him. But she dating someone new and it wasn't Sourface!**

We all froze that and she sound both mad and honest about what she said, we stop and just listen to rant about while taking swigs.

In her anger, she exposed Queenie big time, telling us she in fact was 'cheating' on Sourface with guy I'll name ""Fred"". When Queenie hang out with Bonbon, Bonbon would help Queenie stalk Artlad but when she would hang out with Ms. Mal-doll, she would help her ""hide her tracks"" from Sourface. I was confused, if you read the Fatty club saga you'll how crazy her actions was but I never knew this other guy. To this day, I'm not sure if this is real or not but Ms. Mal-doll had this look of both anger and annoyance when telling the tale. Goodfella was side-eyeing Ms. Mal-doll while Sourface looks both mad and sad and was staring down on the floor. Bestbro being the one with balls to say:

**Bestbro: Bullshit! There's no way Queenie had a ""man"" while doing all of that!**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I'm telling the truth! She was dating Fred! She met him on a dating app!**

**Bestgal: Even if that was true, why would she be chasing Artlad?**

**Artlad: And fucking Sourface?**

**Sourface: Well Ms. Mal-doll? Talk! Since you know everything.**

Ms. Mal-doll swears up and down what she said is true, she showed us a picture of the guy. The guy in question was an average looking dude and a bit overweight but as much as Sourface nor as much as Goodfella, the one thing I notice is the way he was dressed look a lot like how Artlad dresses. I shrugged and told everyone to forget it since it doesn't matter anymore to which Bestgal ask this:

**Bestgal: Wait...I realized there's five rooms and seven of us. Who's rooming with who?**

In that moment, Goodfella and Sourface yelled they are NOT rooming with each other and there's this long pause and Ms. Mal-doll scoots little closer to Artlad, flattering her eyes saying ""I'm sure someone doesn't mind sharing a room right?""

Artlad being Artlad says this:

**Artlad: OH! Goodfella are you ok sharing a room with Dizzy or Ms. Mal-doll? I tend to toss and turn in my sleep.**

**Goodfella: I don't mind sharing with Dizzy. It's only a couple of nights right?**

I just nod and say ""yeah I don't mind"" before returning back to the bottle. Bestbro and Bestgal are sharing one room (duh) and Goodfella and I share the other which leaves three empty ones. Sourface called dibs on the ""biggest one"", the only one with the window, Ms. Mal-doll being kinda heartbroken chose one room and when in inside, leaving the rest of us to continue to drink. Soon it was getting late and we headed to bed, the one thing about this cabin is that all the beds are king sized so one is really spooning each other. I chose one side and Goodfella chose the other, he looked at me with a devilish smile.

**Goodfella:** \*low voice\* **Wanna cuddle like we used to?**

**Me:** \*low\* **NO! These walls are paper-thin! They can hear us!**

**Goodfella: Fine, maybe next time.**

I just look at him confused before he turned his back to me and turn off the lamp to sleep. I scoot near the edge of the bed, turn off the lamp from my side and fall asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up to something odd. Was I dreaming? IDK if you tend to remember some dreams but I remember this one cuz I woke up the a sleeping Goodfella, dry humping me. I let out a small squeak, hop off, landed on the wooden floor, stand up and turn on a little light. I hover over Goodfella, on my spot, dead asleep, snoring like a big-rig truck, still humping the mattress. I just grab a pillow and the blanket I was using, turn off the light and ""slept"" on the floor. I didn't want to leave cuz one, every fuck door in these cabin creaks LOUDLY and two, the floorboards also creaks loudly so I would be making a lot of noise. I tried to fall back to sleep but I couldn't cuz I end up choosing the room a lot of older relatives used. How I know that? Well like any older Mexican, these room a decored, top and bottom with pictures of Jesus and every saint from Catholicism. Picture a image of Jesus, above the door, looking down at you with that open arms pose as if to judge me. Almost like he's saying ""my child, what the fuck is this shit?"" The worst part is that every saint also had a pose where they seem to look down at you and giving the same judgmental stare. I had an audience I didn't realized I had and they were giving me disapproving looks.

Morning couldn't come any sooner, as soon as I saw my watch that read 7am, I got ass up and headed to the kitchen to set up the two coffee makers cuz god damn I needed some coffee. Around 8am, everyone started to wake up. First was Ms. Mal-doll, looking like she's been crying all night, Bestbro and Bestgal woke up next, wearing matching PJs. I tried not to laugh as Bestbro let out a groggy ""Don't"", Sourface and Goodfella woke up at the same time, and last one was Artlad. With a line forming at the only bathroom, I started making coffee. Artlad and Bestbro were debating about where's the best fishing spot. Since it was middle of winter so I didn't think we'll catch anything but fishing is just an excuse to drink booze while on a boat/dock. I however was some what worried about Ms. Mal-doll, I gave Bestgal the look that every girl knows even though I was transitioning into a boy, those things never leave you. Bestgal sat next to Ms. Mal-doll, asking if she was alright. I came by with a tray of coffee and handed her one before sitting on the other side of Ms. Mal-doll.

**Bestgal: Hey is everything ok? You look like you've been crying.**

**Me: Ms. Mal-doll, did something happen?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: I was hoping Artlad would room with me.**

**Me: Really? Girl, don't waste your time. He's been off the dating market since what Queenie did.**

**Bestgal: He said it's for his mental health.**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Of course, the moment I get the chance to ask him out, he's not willing.**

**Me: maybe if just, I don't know hang out with him more then maybe?**

I was offering the same advice my mom and dad always tells me when to meeting some new, ""hang out with them to see if you actually like spending time with them"" they say. But to be honest, I was just softening the blow cuz knowing Artlad, he might want to stay single since I remember at this point of time he was in his ""hoe"" era. Not to mention, we were about a couple of weeks away from starting the winter semester on my campus. So yeah, Artlad wants to see what the campus ""has to offer"" eww. 

So all us us, sitting in silence, drinking our coffee when Bestbro was the first one to speak up.

**Bestbro: Hey! Did anyone hear loud thud last night?**

**Bestgal: Yeah it scared the day lights out of me and Bestbro!**

**Artlad: Oh you heard it too?**

**Sourface: I didn't.**

**Goodfella: I didn't either.**

I look down sheepishly, slowly rise my head to say ""sorry, I fell last night. Bad dream"" to which Goodfella was shocked to hear. Homeboy really is a heavy sleeper. After a few giggles, we (mostly the men) head out to catch some fish! Since it was middle of winter, we didn't really catch anything but that didn't stop us from getting drunk by the dock. It would have been enjoyable if it weren't for Ms. Mal-doll sighing loudly near Artlad but her lack of man, Sourface getting bored and complaining about it until we told both of them to shut up. Goodfella also got bored but had the brain power to be a Chatty-Cathy with Ms. Mal-doll and Bestgal. Rest of the stay was us getting drunk on the dock (we given up on fishing) and grilling meat my family oh so kindly stocked the fridge with. The last day of the cabin stay what I remember a little too well, why? Well that morning was nice and calm but it was until the night hit when everything has gone to shit. I was setting up the fireplace to start a fire and Bestbro was gathering mixes for cocktails with Bestgal when the corner of my eye, I see Ms. Mal-doll smiling. Was she happy cuz this trip was ending to make her move or was she planning something? I was so focus on the fireplace since this one didn't have a gas line and you have to start a fire the old school way and it doubles as a cooking area when the kitchen is too crowded. I notice that we didn't have enough wood and I needed kindling to start the fire so I told everyone to hold on and I was getting it when Artlad and Bestbro tag along. 

Goodfella and Bestgal was on the porch gossiping about something when we came back, entering the cabin the air felt off. As I was setting down to start the fire I fucking heard it! The cabin walls are paper thin and all of us heard *moaning*. I look to who's here, Artlad was standing next to me, couldn't been Bestbro and Bestgal cuz they were on the couch waiting and Goodfella was at the kitchen getting a drink. So that leaves....OH NO! Bestbro shouted ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?"" to which we all heard Ms. Mal-doll yell back ""Take that Artlad! We're fucking on your bed!"" 

The thing is, they weren't where Artlad was staying. Nope, the only door that was close was the room where me and Goodfella were staying so we both run inside to something I wish haven't done. Picture the biggest and palest moon, jiggling and glitzing with sweat, brighter then my fucking future and the room filled the smell of yeast, seed and sex. Both Goodfella and I yelled to get the fuck out! Long story short, they thought that room is were Artlad was staying and both I and Goodfella run to vomit outdoors. Ms. Mal-doll thought it was a good idea to make Artlad jealous by sleeping with Sourface. Sourface only agreed to see if he ""still got it"". Needless to say, me and Goodfella ended up sleeping on the couch and living room floor for the last night there. I tried to remember more as to why but my brain buried too many details as to protect me. Thank god! All I can remember is two plus-size naked body huffing and puffing, sweating and sounds of moaning echoing throughout the cabin. the worst part I was the one to clean the sheets as to not freak out my family when they do use it. If it feels like I skimming though it is because I don't want to remember all of it but it's important later. 

So we all leave the cabin and return back to our normal day to day lives until it is time for winter semester. this has been one and only birthday that has been kinda crazy. Thanks for reading, this one is not as crazy or as cringe as most my stories but the next part is the ""return"" of the fatty club. Drink lots of fluids ~~not mountain dew~~ and with peace and love, DIZZY OUT! ",1,1759260576.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

1numlfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1numlfo/finally_sending_her_the_birthday_gift_i_never_got/,Finally sending her the birthday gift I never got to give her,"So my ex (20F) broke up with me (22M) 2-3 weeks before her birthday and went back to Uni. We had met at Uni and been seeing each other for two years and officially started dating for 1. I had just graduated Uni and she will be returning for another 2 years.

 She broke up with me over text. Her reasons for breaking up with me is ""everything in my life was more important than her"". While at uni, I was working two jobs. I had landed a great career opportunity but was also working a part-time job just for gas, groceries, and to pay the bills. 

It's sad because I would always talk to her about our future, envisioning us living together, etc. Yet, while I was so focused on the future I had not thought to look up and enjoy what I had right in front of me. She had actually said ""she adores how hard that I work, that I'd probably be successful but the next time I pick my head up from all my work she won't be there waiting for me."" Its not that I didn't take her out. While at school it was easier. During the summer, I was working two jobs, she was also working full time. She lived an hour and a half away from me so we made plans as much we could. We dormed at Uni so it was much easier when I was only 5 minutes from her dorm room.

She said that I don't even know her as a person. That I wasn't her best friend. I didn't confide in her the way I confided in my guy friends and she just wished that I opened up more. She said she didn't want all the gifts that I gave her, like Lululemon sets or Alo sets, or a fancy iPad for school. She wanted emotional intimacy and no amount of nice things could replace that. I wanted to protest but I did not want her to feel invalidated. No matter what at that point, it was over. We took a break to see if she could forgive me for but like Hank in Breaking Bad, while I was caught up speculating whether or not it was over. She had already made up her mind 10 minutes ago (IFYKYK). To be loved is to be known she said. She said I did not know her at all.

I had tried fighting for the relationship but she asked for space. I really tried to fight but there is only so much you can do. I told her she can text me back or not or coffee or not, as she asked to do coffee down the road to catch up or whatever. Weeks passed and I had not heard from her. So when her birthday passed, I said nothing because I had thought that is what she wanted. Space.

Its been two months since the break up. 1 month after her birthday. I had already bought her gift prior to the break up. 

Gold purple sea glass earrings because she only wears gold and she had raved for months about how she wanted to find purple sea glass, being that is was so rare. Sea glass searching is one of her favorite hobbies. She would love showing me her collection. She would show it over facetime or if she had new findings in her bad. She also wears big quirky earrings like big Seashell earrings or Mr. Garrison earrings (yes, like from South Park). So I thought it was perfect.

I know it's over but I can't stand to see them in my possession. I also have a glass baking tray of hers that I had not given back. I will be sending both items to her mom's house with no return label. I know most will don't send it but I have already made up my mind. She will probably just ask her mom to throw them out before ever seeing them and that's okay. To me, this will finally put an end to this chapter. ",1,1759260323.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Aye, you read that right. A 46-year-old Scot, successfully transplanted to the wilds of Pennsylvania. I've traded the lochs and glens for rolling hills and the occasional Wawa run, and I have to say, it's not half bad.

About me:

The accent is 100% authentic. It’s particularly effective for ordering coffee and confusing telemarketers.

I enjoy a good single malt whisky, but I'm quickly developing an appreciation for Pennsylvania's local breweries.

My passions lie somewhere between getting out for a good hike on a crisp autumn day and getting cozy on the sofa with a great film (anything from a tense thriller to a stupidly funny comedy).

I have my life together—stable career, own place, can cook a few decent meals that don't involve haggis (unless you're into that).

My sense of humor is a bit dry, a bit sarcastic, and essential for navigating life. I believe laughing, especially at yourself, is a vital life skill.

Who I'm looking for:

A woman (let's say 35-55ish) who is kind, intelligent, and doesn't take herself too seriously. Someone who can hold a conversation that goes beyond small talk, who is passionate about something, and who believes a good partner is a teammate. A shared sense of humor is a massive plus.

If any of this piques your interest, send me a message. To break the ice, tell me: what's one thing I absolutely have to see or do in Pennsylvania?",2,1759260220.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1numjni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1numjni/does_the_3m_aquapure_dw8090_replacement_water/,Does the 3M Aqua-Pure DW8090 Replacement Water Filter Offer Real Quality? Review Inside!,"Every time I need cleaner, better-tasting water on demand, the **3M 70020002468 Aqua-Pure DW8090 Under Sink Replacement Water Filter**, paired with the Aqua-Pure AP-DWS1000 system, has been a reliable choice. After incorporating it into my home, it didn’t take long to notice the differences in water purity, smell, and taste. However, as with every product, there are highlights and minor areas to consider.

**Sleek and Convenient Design**

The under-sink setup is one of my favorite aspects of this water filter. It tucks away neatly under the kitchen sink and takes up minimal space, so I didn’t have to compromise on cabinet storage. The polished chrome dedicated faucet paired with the system adds an element of style to the kitchen counter—simple, yet classy. The dimensions (4 x 4 x 12 inches) make it compact enough even in smaller kitchens, and at just under 4 pounds, it doesn’t feel cumbersome during initial setup.

[Check 3M 70020002468 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00115r6go/)

**Performance and Filtration Capabilities**

This filter stands out primarily because of its advanced dual-stage carbon-block filtration. The technology behind it significantly reduces particulate, chlorine taste, odor, and even more concerning elements like lead, VOCs, and microbial cysts. I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and the change in flavor is noticeable after brewing with this water—it’s purer and tastes more vibrant. Also, baby formula prep has me feeling reassured as it handles impurities well. Its ability to work with both chlorinated municipal water and well water systems broadens its appeal.  

Switching to water processed with this filter really opened my eyes to how much sediment there was before. I recall filling up a glass of tap water before and comparing it to the filtered version—it was as if someone had turned up the brightness on the ‘clean’ one. Clarity does make a difference!  

**Ease of Installation and Cartridge Changes**

What surprised me the most was how user-friendly this product is. I’m not exactly a pro when it comes to plumbing, but the Sanitary Quick Change (SQC) design made swapping out the cartridges unbelievably simple. No tools, no touching the filter media, and there was no accidental splash—just twist, replace, and twist back in. This feature reduces the intimidation factor for those of us who steer clear of hardware projects.

**Highlights**

- Offers dual-stage carbon-block filtration for improved water taste and reduction in contaminants.
- Compact and under-sink design, providing excellent space efficiency.
- Utilizes an automatic shut-off after reaching a set capacity for added convenience.
- Designed with easy-to-replace cartridge functionality to minimize effort.

**Areas for Improvement**

That isn’t to say the system is perfect. Over months of use, a few aspects became mildly apparent:  

- The faucet could use a sturdier material—it tends to feel slightly lightweight compared to other fixtures in the kitchen.  
- Not everyone will be thrilled about changing cartridges occasionally, even though the process is simple—it’s an additional cost factor to consider.  
- The limited flow rate of 0.6 GPM might feel slow for larger households with heavy water needs. For smaller families, however, it’s just fine.  

**Competing Brands**

In a similar category, other under-sink water filtration systems like the APEC ROES series and iSpring RCC7 also come to mind. While those focus heavily on reverse osmosis, they often need additional components such as remineralization filters, which can add complexity. With the Aqua-Pure filter, minimal adjustments and parts are required. Its edge lies in simplicity and the ability to handle VOCs right out of the box, something not all competitors offer. The filtration capacity (625 gallons) is probably middle-of-the-road when compared to competitors, but for the average household, this longevity suffices.

Comparatively, while the APEC products may deliver superior filtration levels, some users prefer the hassle-free maintenance and space-saving benefits of 3M’s system. On balance, the Aqua-Pure’s convenient cartridge system and universal compatibility make it a versatile contender.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  

I couldn’t help but feel this water filtration system straddles the line between luxury and necessity. The combination of advanced filtration and user-friendly features like the automatic shut-off justifies its price, especially when stacked against lower-grade products. Pricing should always be relative to the value, and considering how much better my homemade iced tea and soups taste, the investment feels worth it. For those on a tight budget, it may cause hesitation initially, but long-term savings on bottled water alone make it seem like a bargain.

Me (34)F  and my best friend, we’ll call her “A” (34)F, have been friends since childhood. We’ve been through so much together. She was there for the birth of my kids and they know her as an aunt. I was at her side at her side during her mother’s illness and passing I have supported her through ups and downs. I have traveled cross country just to visit her and see her face. I have also traveled states to acquire her stuff from her ex with no questions asked..
     now “A” grew up in a family where everything was almost perfect, and they were very involved in church, sports, music, etc. things are very different now, thankfully, but when we were growing up (early 2000s) it was very common to be gay/lesbian and not be able to be open about it or often times feel ashamed to be gay or lesbian. “A” has always struggled with her sexuality and when we were teenagers, I told her I would love her, no matter what she is or what she has done. I told her that she could be herself, and I would love her regardless, and I have done just that.. 
   2 years ago she moved back here from a few states away after a nasty break up with her ex and the ONLY relationship she had ever been in. Hence why I traveled states to retrieve her things she then stayed with me for approximately 10 months rent free bill free no questions asked.. I’m only saying this here never to anyone else about the things I’ve done because I don’t care that I’ve done them. I’m just trying to give a context of how much love I have for this girl. I feel that she is my soul sister and I would have done anything for her. 
    When she started living with me, we also started working at the same place of employment. A restaurant. At this restaurant is where I made a new friend. We will call her “C”(25)F. (10 years younger than me)  Now I am the type of person who is very friendly, but I don’t have a lot of close friends and I never have. I just have the one that I’ve talked about here bc of being burned etc by bad friends. This new friend and I started to hang out slowly, having dinner, going to the movies,  going shopping, all the girly things. We got really close, but I was really cautious to invite someone into my life because to protect my kids’ heart, and even my own heart, in case, our friendship doesn’t pan out.. but about six weeks into the friendship I invited her over for dinner, we had the best time kids loved her, and she came over for dinner quite often after that. After about after about 4 months of friendship, I decided to have a dinner with her and my best friend my kids and my husband. After dinner and after my new friend leaves, “A”  tells me that she’s crushing on my new friend “C” who I know personally has just gotten out of a bad relationship that was five years long. This is the first time she’s met “C” and spent time with her other than seeing her come eat at our work. 
   Having learned a lot about “C” over the time we’ve spent together. I learned a lot about her family life and her personality. She’s a beautiful lady very funny very kind and her energy is very electric. So. I could see how anybody would feel attracted to her because she’s attractive both spiritually and physically, but her family however are not so great. They are very rich, powerful and very high class and they know it. They also are very much in control over “C” in every aspect, finances and her life in general. Even her high paying 6 figure job is through her father, who she portrayed to me as a controlling psychopath who is abusive to both her her mother and her brother. She also was in a, what she described, brief lesbian fling in college during which her family found out and pulled her out of college and locked her in the top of their house. Now, unless she was completely lying to me, these are the facts I have. 
  So with my best friend tells me that she’s crushing on her. I was immediately nervous because not only is my best friend naïve when it comes to relationships I know my new friend is under such control by her family that she cannot be in constructive relationship of any sort unless it’s approved by her parents. I tried to give her a puppy and she couldn’t even commit to a puppy because her mom said no at 25 almost 26 years old.
    I tell my friend that she just got out of a relationship (and a slew of tinder dates and flings after) and I would just continue to hang out and have a good time and not put any expectations on anything because “C” so much younger and at a place where she’s exploring and dating around. So we do that. Over the next two months we hang out, we go to dinner, we watch shows, and movies together, And I felt so blessed to have these two friends of mine.
     Well, my best friend had to move into a new house and she invited my new friend to help her move and didn’t even mention it to me. At first, I was like OK well, maybe she didn’t want to ask me because she knew I would be busy with the kids so I just let it go then the next day came and my best friend calls me and she tells me that “C” came over and help her move, and when they were going to sleep, “A” confessed all of her feelings to her. She told her how she was crushing on her the first night she met her how she’s never met anybody like her and how they should try to work something out. (Now , “A” does not know the extent of everything I know about her family or her past relationships because that was not my business to share.) “C” comes up to my job and eats with me after I get off of the phone and find out all of this new information from “A”. So we sit down and talk and she is crying and I am crying and she tells me “I am kind of crushing but I would’ve sat on that forever so I wouldn’t risk our friendship”
     I was nervous and upset and sad because I cherish the friendship that we share on both ends with my new friend and my old friend and I was terrified to jeopardize that. I was heartbroken. Maybe a small part of me was jealous because I felt like they would spend time together and forget about me but more so I felt heartbroken that the friendship I thought we had was so disposable. Where we all three would hang out every other day see each other every other day. Talk every day. In 2 weeks, It went to nobody talking to me unless I reached out to them and then making plans and not including me so when I got my feelings hurt about not being included, just got my feelings hurt in general, I got iced out by my best friend and my new friend simply because I was so sad..I felt like I was mourning this sisterhood we had.. when we talked I felt sad. I felt like it was hard to stay off of the topic of being so hurt about the situation so eventually my new friend just quit talking to me.

Meanwhile, There was a series of back-and-forth arguments between “A” and I and trying to understand each other, and trying to explain my feelings while understanding her feelings as well. Things were said from her that I never thought she’d say. I’m sure she felt like I was being selfish, and maybe I was being selfish, I don’t know, but I do feel like I have the right to be selfish when it comes to something I cherish and love and want to protect. I didn’t want her to get hurt bc “C”’s family would make their life hell. I wanted her to be in a relationship where she didn’t have to sneak or hide or deal with drama. At the same time I didn’t want or friendship dynamic to change either but that ship had sailed at that point. 

  “A” sent me a message after about after about five days of not talking and asked to meet up for coffee. I looked up the cutest coffee shop I can find I was so excited about it. I got there early. I got us a table I was waiting on her when she got there. She looks so cute. I told her how cute she looked gave her a hug. I was super excited to see her. She sat me down and told me she had a recording she wanted me to listen to. I thought maybe this is one of those processes like when you write a letter to someone versus having a conversation I don’t know everybody’s different anyways I played the recording. In this recording, she tells me that I’m married and I have kids and she’s not and we are in two different places in life. She said that I made her feel ashamed to be gay and by telling her my concerns about our friendship and their relationship that she can’t stop having negative feelings surrounding me therefore she no longer wants to be friends with me and that I’m sorry if that’s not what I need but that’s what she needs.

   I was speechless. Tears were rolling down my face as I was listening to this when I looked across the table she just sat there with a smirk on her face. When the recording was over I asked her why didn’t you just text me this? Why did you bring me all the way here and she said “to look at you in the face” I then saw this person that I’ve never seen before. I started crying because all I could remember, was her being there for my kids’ births, games, movie nights, graduation, birthdays, etc all I could see was her and my youngest on the couch and her teaching her how to play guitar. My heart was breaking because this person who has been there for over half of my life has decided in a matter of months that she doesn’t want to be my friend because I disagreed with the way, she treated our friendship. THERE’S MORE After finding out that “A” did this, “C” called it quits immediately. Same day. 

  It’s now been nine months since we’ve last spoke, since that coffee house conversation that I left not being able to breathe. It’s one of the worst heartbreaks I’ve ever experienced, worse than any boyfriend or man has ever done to me and I really would like to know, Am I the asshole in this situation? If so or not, either way I would like advice! 
I can’t believe I’m 35 posting on Reddit for help but here goes nothing. Thanks in advance if you to the time to read and help 🫶🏼

**PINYA XP Announces Development of Platform to Democratize Cannabis IP Through NFTs and Community-Driven Meme Rewards**

PINYA XP, (OTCID: PNXP), formerly Pineapple Express Cannabis Company, a groundbreaking Web3 blockchain software development marketing company in the cannabis industry, today announced plans for its revolutionary community-driven NFT ecosystem that will fundamentally reimagine the relationship between cannabis consumers and brands. Currently in active development, the platform will grant NFT holders actual commercial licensing rights to create and sell merchandise using strain intellectual property through what the company calls ""democratized IP rights.""  
  
The platform addresses a critical shift in cannabis consumer demographics that the industry has largely ignored: the next generation of consumers, who spend an unprecedented thirty-two percent of their income on health and wellness, don't smoke flower or drink alcohol at traditional rates. They expect participatory economics where purchases become investments, not endpoints. PINYA XP will transform every cannabis purchase into a potential business opportunity through a simple scanning mechanism that rewards participants with both NFTs and PINYA meme tokens.  
  
""We're not creating another Bored Ape novelty project,"" said Kevin Jodrey, CCO of PINYA XP. ""When someone buys cannabis and scans the product, they receive an NFT that serves as a democratized IP license. They can immediately start creating and selling t-shirts, coffee mugs, or even launch entire lifestyle brands around their favorite strains. The original breeders get automatic royalties, brands get organic marketing from thousands of micro-entrepreneurs, and consumers finally get to participate in the value they help create. Everyone wins.""  
  
How the Revolutionary System Will Work  
The platform will operate through an elegantly simple mechanism that hides complex blockchain technology behind an intuitive user experience. When launched, consumers will download the PINYA XP app, scan the UPC code of their cannabis purchase, and immediately receive rewards in multiple forms. First, they will earn PINYA tokens – a community-driven meme token designed for viral growth through social sharing and gamification. Second, they will mint an NFT that contains not just digital art, but a comprehensive bundle of rights and benefits.  
  
Each NFT includes multiple value layers that extend far beyond traditional collectibles. Through a random number generator based on the NFT's unique code, holders can win physical rewards they'll actually value – premium merchandise featuring strain artwork, high-quality cultivation tools, or functional items like insulated containers designed for cannabis storage. Winners might receive exclusive experiences such as virtual sessions with master growers, first access to limited strain releases, or invitations to harvest parties at craft cultivation facilities.  
  
The most revolutionary aspect involves the democratized IP rights granted to NFT holders. ""We're fundamentally democratizing intellectual property that has traditionally been locked within corporate structures,"" explained Frank Yglesias, CEO. ""Smart contracts automatically route royalties back to breeders and brands, creating aligned incentives. A creative entrepreneur in Miami can build a business around California genetics, with everyone in the value chain benefiting from their success.""  
  
ABOUT $PNXP  
Pineapple Express Cannabis Company, operating as Pinya XP (OTCID: $PNXP), provides cannabis product authenticity verification through its GROOVY PaaS 4IR Ecosystem. The platform creates immutable seed-to-sale records via Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and QR-NFT tags, preventing counterfeit products and ensuring consumer safety. The GROOVY Rewards program engages consumers through product verification and educational modules, with participants able to redeem accumulated rewards for PINYA meme tokens from the company's strategic treasury holdings. This redemption mechanism creates a bridge between the secure enterprise blockchain environment and the public Solana trading ecosystem. The Geno-NFT Library protects cannabis genetics intellectual property with automatic royalty distribution, while AI-powered analytics deliver comprehensive business insights.

1numa0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1numa0n/what_fleece_hoodie_is_trending_this_season/,What fleece hoodie is trending this season?,"Hey everyone! I've been obsessing over fleece hoodies lately, and I just had to share my recent discovery that's been a total game-changer for my winter wardrobe. You know how it goes - when the temperature drops, we all start hunting for that perfect cozy hoodie that doesn't make us look like we've given up on life.

After countless hours of research and trying different brands, I stumbled upon this amazing fleece hoodie (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) that's been blowing up on social media. What caught my attention wasn't just the style, but the incredible softness of the material. It's like wearing a cloud, seriously!

The thing about winter fashion is finding that sweet spot between comfort and style. This hoodie nails it with its brushed interior that keeps you warm without making you look bulky. I've worn mine everywhere - from coffee runs to weekend hikes, and it's holding up beautifully.

What really sets it apart is the attention to detail. The stitching is solid, the hood actually fits properly (anyone else hate when hoods are either tiny or enormous?), and the pockets are deep enough for your phone and keys. Plus, it doesn't pill after washing - a huge win in my book!

I've noticed a lot of influencers wearing similar styles, but this specific one (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) is trending for good reason. The color options are on point for this season, and the fit is just right - not too loose, not too tight.

For those wondering about sizing, I'd say it runs pretty true to size. I'm usually a medium, and the medium fits perfectly. The length hits just right at the hips, and the sleeves don't do that annoying thing where they ride up when you move.

The price point is actually reasonable considering the quality. I've paid way more for hoodies that started looking worn after a few washes. This one's been through several laundry cycles and still looks new.

Quick care tip: I've found that washing it inside out in cold water and hanging it to dry helps maintain its softness and shape. Trust me, once you find a good fleece hoodie, you want it to last!

Bottom line: If you're in the market for a new winter staple, this is definitely worth checking out. It's been my go-to for everything from working from home to running errands, and I'm probably going to grab another color soon!

Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more details about my experience with it!",1,1759259594.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

1. Download an app and sign up

Some chains will give you a free drink just for downloading their app and creating an account, including:

Dunkin Donuts

Greggs

And mostly London-based chains Ole & Steen and Watch House

2. Visit a shop

Become a member of Waitrose (it's free) and get a free hot drink from self-service machines. Bring your own cup.

Join My John Lewis (it's free), download the app, visit a branch and you can get a free hot drink and slice of cake. You can get this reward every so often!

Join Ikea Family (free, and you don't need to have children), visit a branch between Monday and Friday and get a free coffee or tea in the cafe.

3. Via products and services you already have

If you're an Octopus Energy customer with a smart meter, its Octoplus reward scheme gives you codes for a free hot drink from Greggs or Cafe Nero.

Vitality Life Insurance also offers its customers a weekly free hot drink at Cafe Nero.

4. When you buy other stuff

Wetherspoons offers free refills of hot drinks with a purchase, as do cafes at Morrisons.

Join Yeo Valley's reward scheme, buy three eligible products, bank three Yeokens and get a free drink at, yes, Cafe Nero. (You can only do this once every six months.)

Obviously, many coffee chains - too many to list - have loyalty schemes where if you buy a certain number of coffees you get one free. Some may offer a free drink on your birthday.

5. Refer a friend

Once you have signed up, some chains offer a free coffee when you refer a friend or are referred, including Black Sheep Coffee and Dunkin Donuts.

Notes: there are often additional terms & conditions and these offers are subject to change.

1num671,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1num671/aita_after_cutting_off_my_sister_after_how_she/,AITA after cutting off my sister after how she behaved during my wedding weekend?,"Hi all!

MoH (27F) here, posting on behalf of the bride (30F). She doesn’t have Reddit but wanted to hear everyone’s perspective on this situation. We spent months talking about how funny it would be to end up here so here we are! 

This is a long one, so buckle up.

For context: bride (30F) and groom (33M) just got married last weekend. They’re now enjoying a no-signal staycation in the UK countryside. I (the MoH) am the bride’s SIL, her original MoH dropped out due to trying (and failing) to steal the spotlight, so I stepped in. The bride’s sister (let’s call her Cat, 27F) was a bridesmaid who the bride only started speaking to again two years ago after being estranged for six years. Cat also has a daughter (we’ll call her Tilly).

The night before the wedding we had a low-key girls’ night, we watched trashy movies, ate pizza, and went over any last-minute wedding prep. It was me, the bride, Cat and Tilly, and the bridesman (Kai).

From the moment she arrived, Cat was… difficult. She came in complaining about someone none of us knew from her work which already dampened the vibe, she then spent the whole night sitting in her coat by the window, glued to her phone and vaping, while the rest of us were chatting and hanging out whilst getting the wedding vibes going.

Later that night, when it was time for showers (so our hair was prepped for the stylist), the water stopped working. The bride’s brother came to the rescue, driving Cat and Tilly to his house so they could shower. When they got back, instead if a “hello,” Cat just announced she’d been invited to stay elsewhere but decided not to, so as not to “annoy the bride.” Mood killer again. Cat then complained that the food had been ordered too late because Tilly needed to go to bed (she’s 9) even though Cat was the one who told us when to have food delivered.

For sleeping arrangements, Cat and Tilly took the bride’s bed. This meant the bride had to sleep on the sofa the night before her own wedding (it’s a one bedroom home so there were no other beds to sleep on). She had originally planned to bunk with her sister and niece but knew the vibes were off and didn’t want extra stress. I offered my pull out bed but she refused because she didn’t want me to be uncomfortable, and she would fight me if I tried lol.

The morning of the wedding things started okay, I ordered pastries and coffee for everyone from a bakery the bride adores in her area. After that, things went a bit downhill:

- Cat couldn’t get Tilly ready. She kept saying she couldn’t paint her nails or that the curling irons weren’t working. The bride ended up doing Tilly’s hair, nails, and outfit. She didn’t complain (because that’s just who she is), but it was a lot for her to deal with on the morning of her wedding when she should have been the one being fussed over.

- Cat was asked to take some food platters to the bride’s brother’s car. She came back saying he was “fuming,” which upset the bride and made her snap. Bride has not been a bridezilla despite the amount of let downs she has faced throughout planning the wedding (family issues, caterers dropping out three weeks before the wedding, multiple dress fittings due to weight loss etc)

From there, Cat sulked. She refused to get dressed with us (missing out on photos), changed in the bathroom, wore the bride’s shoes and later yelled at the bride when she fell down some stairs in them.

Throughout the whole wedding she kept bringing up the bride’s father who refused to attend despite being in contact with the bride. She also focused on the people who didn’t show up at all to the wedding. Cat tried to stir things up by asking guests if they were “uncomfortable” with the bride sitting downstairs (it was cooler down there in her heavy dress), and repeatedly reminded the bride that their family was “broken.”

At one point, when asked to stop, Cat even brought up how their father had paid for Cat’s child’s funeral previously but “couldn’t be bothered to show up for the bride on her special day.” This really upset the bride because not only was she being reminded of how her only family had repeatedly dropped her, she also had to sit there and be ignored on her own wedding day by her own bridesmaid that she had gone out of her way to help.

Meanwhile, the sweetest part of the day was the groom’s dad walking the bride down the aisle, both were crying, and it was incredibly special. The bride felt so loved and welcomed into her new family that she has moulded with so well and I couldn’t be more honoured to a) be her MoH, and b) be able to call her my sister.

As the wedding closed down, Cat approached to say goodbye, she stood behind their aunt and had her back to bride the entire time, and only said a short ‘bye’ over her shoulder before leaving. Again, making the bride feel bad.

The next day, Cat messaged the bride saying she felt “uncomfortable” staying at the house to watch the animals because of how she’d been treated. This nearly ruined the newlyweds’ staycation plans.

She accused the bride of “ass-licking” me (the MoH) since we’d spent most of the wedding together. Bride asked for the house keys back, and Cat refused, saying she’d give them to their estranged (abusive) mother for the bride to pick up amongst a whole string of nasty comments about the brides demeanour which aren’t true.

Cat then demanded to be removed from all wedding photos and social media, demanded that pictures of her or Tilly shared are not shared anywhere, and asked for compensation for money she’d spent on the bride’s birthday (she turned 30 two days before the wedding) and wedding gift.

Bride calmly agreed to the photo/social media removal and reminded Cat that she had already paid for dresses, hair, makeup, and travel (basically everything for the wedding day). Suddenly, Cat backtracked and offered to watch the animals again (probably because she wasn’t getting the reaction she wanted). The bride and groom told Cat they were no longer going away and were staying home due to the situation, hoping to stop Cat from breaking in and stealing anything (which they wouldn’t doubt she would do).

At this point, the bride and groom have now had the locks changed I’m now helping the groom’s mom look after the animals until they’re back.

The bride feels guilty about distancing herself from her sister, but given everything, especially how Cat acted before, during, and after the wedding, and the threats, she wants to know if she wrong for putting distance between them, at least for now until she decides she wants a relationship at all?

1num5v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1num5v0/first_week_report/,First week report,"In advance: yes I know it’s water weight. I’m still excited.

—-

I have been carnivore for one week. Mainly consuming steak, salmon, and heavy cream in morning coffee. I’m 32 years old, weigh 178lbs, 5’5” female, have PCOS and depression and anxiety. Not taking any Rx medicine but taking a lot of supplements including vitamin D, magnesium, iron, and liver capsules.

The good: skin is calmer, smoother, fewer breakouts. Mood is stable, energy is stable throughout day and no more 3pm crash. I swear my BO is reduced, I don’t smell like I normally do. Dropped 6 pounds (!!!) of water, and it really shows in my face, upper arms, and belly. Bags under eyes are reduced, though I still have dark shadows. My knee pain is gone, lower back pain is reduced

The bad: the first 3 days sucked. I did LMNT electrolytes 2-3x per day, and ate as much meat as I wanted. I took advil on day 2 because my headache wouldn’t go away. Very low energy on days 3 and 4 despite sleeping more than usual. 

I’m really enjoying this is now that I’ve gotten past the first few days. I have more energy and for the last couple of days I wake up without my alarm and feel alert and ready to move my body. I have more motivation, better executive functioning, just focusing and getting shit done is easier now. 

I’m excited to keep going and it feels pretty effortless now that I’ve gotten past week 1. I don’t think about food much. Like I don’t have cravings, I don’t look forward to meals as though they are entertainment or pleasure. I don’t really feel as hungry though I am still unable to do OMAD, I need to eat lunch and dinner or I have major hunger pangs. 

My depression and anxiety have lifted though I want to wait a full menstrual cycle to decide for sure that it’s the diet, since my luteal phase is typically when I feel the worst (like borderline suicidal) and I don’t have that for another week. 

I’ve done keto before and in some ways carnivore feels easier than keto because the menu is so limited and because I don’t have to mind my carb count - I just eat what I’m allowed to eat and don’t worry about how many carbs since it’s always low.

The priest explains what certain words mean in the original greek language and how they were used in its historical context. He makes connections to other scripture passages that I had never thought about. I can tell he takes time planning his homilies. Community and fellowship is important for this faith community and because of it they hold coffee hour after mass and hold other events. I have felt welcomed since the first day that I attended.

I’ve seen many posts in this sub and on Reddit in general about how beautiful women can’t make/keep friends. It’s hard reading comments on these type of posts because I’ll resonate so much with certain stories but there’s always the comments like “I know supermodels and they all have tons of friends and they only receive positive attention, the problem is obviously you”. 

My question is, how can I know if I’m genuinely the problem or not?

Almost all of my friendships start with love bombing. They compliment my hair, my outfits, my eyes, whatever. Telling me how unique I am and how they think of me all the time. I’ve had older women in the workplace give me brand new clothes because they said it would look so good on me. I actually think gifts being considered a “pretty privilege” is funny because the only people who go out of their way to give me things just want to attach to me in the easiest way possible. Usually narcissists. Gifts make me uneasy. Anyways. 

I try to be extremely kind, and I’ve been told I’m hilarious. Im able to make friends easily, but almost EVERY friendship I’ve had so far in life I’ve ended because of negging. Or weird reactions to positive news. Or just becoming super interested in my husband. I had a friend that literally said she only wanted to come over if my husband was going to be home because she wanted to hang with him more. And she’s literally shocked and confused as to why I don’t invite her over. No they were not friends before me and her were. 

Some people I feel like only want to hear about the bad parts of my life or the trauma I’ve been through. I cut off a friend recently because the last time I saw him he just would not stop insisting that I had something to get off my chest and that I could open up to him. I just wanted to have coffee and shoot the shit with a friend. Like I was genuinely doing really good and trying to talk about my weekend and he could just not let it go. He tells other people I’m closed off and “sus”. 

Anyways, the conversation I’m trying to start is, how do you know if you’re the one causing the drama? I feel like I twist myself into knots trying to hype others up, just to only be taken down a notch at every turn. I’m one of those ANNOYING feminists, I’ve read all the literature I can get my hands on about the challenges of female friendships under the patriarchy. I know the concept of jealousy is often used to pit women against each other. But I’ve had multiple women admit to treating me poorly out of jealousy. Like heart to heart conversations about how I make them feel small. So am I the one who even needs to be reflecting? When I experience that same weird energy from someone why am I full of myself for naming it and creating distance?

1num4vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1num4vc/espresso_machine_vs_drip_coffee_maker_for_flavor/,Espresso machine vs drip coffee maker for flavor?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey with coffee makers over the years, and I thought I'd share my experience comparing espresso machines and drip coffee makers, specifically focusing on flavor.

I used to be a die-hard drip coffee fan until I got my hands on an espresso machine (I'll link the one I use below). The difference in taste was mind-blowing, and I'll tell you why.

First off, let's talk about what makes espresso special. The high-pressure brewing process extracts intense flavors and creates that gorgeous crema on top. You know, that golden-brown foam that makes espresso look so Instagram-worthy? It's not just for show - it actually adds to the richness of the flavor.

My drip coffee maker served me well for years, don't get me wrong. It's great for making larger batches, and there's something comforting about that traditional coffee taste. But here's the thing - drip coffee can't match the intensity and complexity you get from a good espresso shot.

I found this amazing espresso machine here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. It's been a game-changer for my morning routine. The difference in taste is like comparing a regular burger to a gourmet steakhouse burger - both are good, but one is just on another level.

What really sold me on espresso was the versatility. Want a strong shot? Done. Craving a creamy latte? Just add steamed milk. With my drip maker, I was pretty much limited to regular coffee with cream and sugar.

The pressure factor is huge too. Drip coffee relies on gravity, while espresso machines force hot water through the grounds at high pressure. This extracts more oils and flavors from the beans, giving you that rich, complex taste that good espresso is known for.

Sure, espresso machines require a bit more effort and learning, but trust me, it's worth it. If you're interested in stepping up your coffee game, check out this espresso machine I mentioned earlier: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. It's perfect for beginners but has enough features to satisfy coffee enthusiasts.

Here's my bottom line: if you're serious about coffee flavor, an espresso machine is the way to go. Yes, drip coffee makers are convenient and reliable, but they just can't match the rich, complex flavors you get from a proper espresso shot.

Anyone else made the switch from drip to espresso? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",1,1759259275.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I'm a walking zombie,"I'm 46, perimenopausal, 6 weeks into a second attempt at HRT. I'm on a very small amount of biodential estrogen - 1/4 of an Estrodot 25microgram patch, and 100mg continuous bioidentical progesterone (vaginal route - Cyclogest pessaries). I was put on this combination in order to try and stop my periods - I'm estrogen dominant and have had all the associated conditions, including a history of fibroids, endometriosis and very heavy periods, leading to anaemia (I had gynae surgery in August), and adenomysis (ongoing). I'm taking the progesterone vaginally because during my first attempt at HRT earlier this year oral, cycling progesterone - gave me really intense PMDD symptoms, which stopped as soon as I stopped the oral progesterone. So I'm now 6 weeks into this new regime and I feel awful:

* blank / flat / vague / checked out, like I'm not really here, have lost connection with myself and the things I care about
* heavy / exhausted / low energy - I'm drinking three pots of coffee a day just to have enough energy to do my work
* finding it really hard to focus and make decisions
* Frequently dizzy, and head-swimmy, almost kind of drunk all the time

I often have quite clear signalling dreams when there is something physically wrong with me, and the other night I dreamt about this big pile of Cyclogest pessaries.

I've read posts on here from few different people questioning whether they were taking too much progesterone. Grateful for advice on whether this sounds like that's a possibility. And if so, what do I do? I can try and reduce the dose further, to 50mg daily, although its quite hard cutting up the cyclogest pessaries that small...

But I'm also wondering if all this means that I just can't tolerate progesterone full stop, and if I just need to come off it all together. I've previously had trouble with synthetic progestins, and have read too many horror stories about the mirena coil, and so don't want to risk that option.

Also really interested to hear the experiences of people who came off HRT because they couldn't tolerate it - how long was it before things settled down to some kind of cycle again? How was your cycle after you stopped? And how is it raw-dogging peri from a baseline of estrogen dominance and messed up periods??",1,1759258937.0,Menopause,9,0.67,False

MoH (27F) here, posting on behalf of the bride (30F). She doesn’t have Reddit but wanted to hear everyone’s perspective on this situation.

This is a long one, so buckle up.

For context: bride (30F) and groom (33M) just got married last weekend. They’re now enjoying a no-signal staycation in the countryside. I (the MoH) am the bride’s SIL, her original MoH dropped out due to trying (and failing) to steal the spotlight, so I stepped in. The bride’s sister (let’s call her Cat, 27F) was a bridesmaid who the bride only started speaking to again two years ago after being estranged for six years. Cat also has a daughter (we’ll call her Tilly).

The night before the wedding we had a low-key girls’ night, we watched trashy movies, ate pizza, and went over any last-minute wedding prep. It was me, the bride, Cat and Tilly, and the bridesman (Kai).

From the moment she arrived, Cat was… difficult. She came in complaining about someone none of us knew from her work which already dampened the vibe, she then spent the whole night sitting in her coat by the window, glued to her phone and vaping, while the rest of us were chatting and hanging out.

Later that night, when it was time for showers (so our hair was prepped for the stylist), the water stopped working. The bride’s brother came to the rescue, driving Cat and Tilly to his house so they could shower. When they got back, instead if a“hello,” Cat just announced she’d been invited to stay elsewhere but decided not to, so as not to “annoy the bride.” Mood killer again.

For sleeping arrangements, Cat and Tilly took the bride’s bed. This meant the bride had to sleep on the sofa the night before her own wedding (it’s a one bedroom home so there were no other beds to sleep on). She had originally planned to bunk with her sister and niece but knew the vibes were off and didn’t want extra stress.

The morning of the wedding things started okay, I ordered pastries and coffee for everyone from a bakery the bride adores in her area. After that, things went a bit downhill:

- Cat couldn’t get Tilly ready. She kept saying she couldn’t paint her nails or that the curling irons weren’t working. The bride ended up doing Tilly’s hair, nails, and outfit. She didn’t complain (because that’s just who she is), but it was a lot for her to deal with on the morning of her wedding when she should have been the one being fussed over.

- Cat was asked to take some food platters to the bride’s brother’s car. She came back saying he was “fuming,” which upset the bride and made her snap. Bride has not been a bridezilla despite the amount of let downs she has faced throughout planning the wedding (family, caterers, multiple dress fittings etc)

From there, Cat sulked. She refused to get dressed with us (missing out on photos), changed in the bathroom, wore the bride’s shoes and later yelled at the bride when she fell down some stairs in them.

Throughout the whole wedding she kept bringing up the bride’s father who refused to attend despite being in contact. She also focused on people who didn’t show up at all to the wedding. Cat tried to stir things up by asking guests if they were “uncomfortable” with the bride sitting downstairs (it was cooler there in her heavy dress), and repeatedly reminded the bride that their family was “broken.”

At one point, when asked to stop, Cat even brought up how their father had paid for Cat’s child’s funeral in the past but “couldn’t be bothered to show up for the bride on her wedding day.”

Meanwhile, the sweetest part of the day was the groom’s dad walking the bride down the aisle, both were crying, and it was incredibly special. The bride felt so loved and welcomed into her new family that she has moulded with so well.

As the wedding closed down, Cat approached to say goodbye, she stood behind their aunt and had her back to bride the entire time, and only said a short ‘bye’ over her shoulder before leaving. Again, making the bride feel bad.

The next day, Cat messaged the bride saying she felt “uncomfortable” staying at the house to watch the animals because of how she’d been treated. This nearly ruined the newlyweds’ staycation plans.

She accused the bride of “ass-licking” me (the MoH) since we’d spent most of the wedding together. Bride asked for the house keys back, and Cat refused, saying she’d give them to their estranged (abusive) mother for the bride to pick up amongst a whole string of nasty comments about the brides demeanour which aren’t true.

Cat then demanded to be removed from all wedding photos and social media, demanded that pictures of her or Tilly shared are not shared anywhere, and asked for compensation for money she’d spent on the bride’s birthday (she turned 30 two days before the wedding) and wedding gift.

Bride calmly agreed to the photo/social media removal and reminded Cat that she had already paid for dresses, hair, makeup, and travel (basically everything for the wedding day). Suddenly, Cat backtracked and offered to watch the animals again (probably because she wasn’t getting the reaction she wanted). The bride and groom told Cat they were no longer going away and were staying home due to the situation, hoping to stop Cat from breaking in and stealing anything (which they wouldn’t doubt she would do).

At this point, the bride and groom have now had the locks changed I’m now helping the groom’s mom look after the animals until they’re back.

The bride feels guilty about distancing herself from her sister, but given everything, especially how Cat acted before, during, and after the wedding, and the threats, she wants to know if she wrong for putting distance between them, at least for now until she decides she wants a relationship at all?

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to get all the details in! What do you think? Is she overreacting? ",4,1759258492.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1nulni7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nulni7/do_breaks_actually_work_rantoverthinking/,Do breaks actually work? (Rant/overthinking),"So a little over 2 weeks ago I met up with my gf and we talked about relationship issues. Mainly she was disappointed in my communication. She wanted to call more, wanted to have deeper/meaningful conversations, and was mad that when she brought up these issues I would either change temporarily or I would brush it off. She felt that we were never on the same page. Ultimately there were 3 choices: 1- We split for good, 2- we stay together and work at it together, 3- we take a break and try to work it out in the future. 

After 15 months of being together, she wanted the break and I wanted to try and work it out together. She didn’t want to break contact nor stop seeing each other. A few days after, we also texted about boundaries and seeing other people but we both didn’t plan on seeing anyone else and wanted to be exclusive still. 

I saw her for the first time over this weekend and she got me a few birthday presents. She also suggested going to a coffee shop nearby. We chatted for a while and she told me about her friends and some drama and we caught up. After that we walked around for a bit while she shopped/looked. And we ended up going to my house and watching a movie. I had my arm around her and her legs were leaning towards me though she didn’t lean on me like she usually had. She also asked me to rub her arm which she usually does. We were only together for 3-4 hours but I really enjoyed her presence. I asked if she wanted to hangout again at the end and she said yes but we’d have to plan since she is busy with school. 

I followed up the next day saying I had fun and asked if she wanted to plan something soon and she asked when I was thinking. I asked if she was free this weekend and she said probably not Saturday but idk. She didn’t give any other times though. 


So there are lots of green flags 
1. Still talking/wanting to hangout again 
2. Wanted me to rub her arm 
3. We talked about boundaries 
All good signs at least I think they are but there is one red flag that I’m really in my own head about.
1. She doesn’t reach out first, has dry responses, and I’m on delivered for long periods of time even though I see she is active or was active

Only 2+ weeks is a very small window of time I know. I’m really just in my own head about it and obviously there is something there but will it lead to us growing stronger for each other or just growing separate? I’m not sure if anything changed in boundaries or wanting to get back together still, is it ok for me to ask? Should I text? Should I wait till we are in person? Idk, I’m really over analyzing everything. Any advice?

1nulmil,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nulmil/how_to_dream_again_mild_depression_and_a_big/,How to dream again? Mild depression and a big problem,"Late 30s female here. I scored ""mild depression"" on a depression quiz. My therapist also suggested mild depression.

So here is the deal. I am feeling well when I am in the present moment. I see beauty around me. I admire the colors of the sunset and I indulge in the scent and taste of coffee. I love food. I love animals and there are a lot of humans whose company I love as well. I enjoy listening to music, reading and journaling. I have friends, even though I have never disclosed how shitty I really feel about life to them.

I work out daily, I eat healthy, I enjoy fresh air and nature. I keep up with the basic chores. I keep a healthy weight. Seems like the weight is the only thing I can truly control. I gave up alcohol completely and don't have any other substance-related bad habits. I have never done any physical self-harm, neither have I had any suicidal thoughts. I am in a healthy committed relationship.

But self-harm in a broader sense? Bad habits? Sure, plenty of that. I have an extreme case of procrastination. I am self-employed and I can't motivate myself to do anything. And I mean, anything, nothing at all, for work. Every day I miss opportunities to earn, advance and do better. I spend my days reading, working out, cooking, cleaning and lately browsing this sub. Knowing that I must work, or study something new and useful, or network... I am doing nothing. I am scared to look at my bank account as a result of that. Even though I am extremely frugal, I am destroying my savings, slowly, but surely.

I go to therapy. My therapist suggested imaging an ideal life. I got stuck. I have no idea what an ideal life would be for me. Literally, none. Nada. Zero.

I have always had a dream or two that were a beacon for me, they kept me going, moving forward. Move to a bigger city. Graduate. Grow at work and get promoted. Take a gamble and quit and start a self-employed journey. Be with the human you love. I met a person who I fell in love with, and we worked hard to be together, overcoming long-distance relationship challenge and moving in together a few years back. You get the idea: I always had a dream. Some of them did not come true, but the point is I worked towards them and had goals based on my dreams.

However, now I have no dreams, no goals, no aspirations. Thinking about the future gives me anxiety that sometimes manifests in a physical form of a panic attack. I don't know what I want to do or be, but also I know perfectly that doing nothing will result in even worse places than I am in now.

Another problem is that the world nowadays is such an ugly place. I feel betrayed by it. Recent developments, a sharp turn towards ignorance, hate, greed... that's now what I imagined it when I was younger. I hoped for a more inclusive, kinder place to live.

I wish there was a reset button that will bring the old me back. One that had that zest for life, that drive. I miss old me so much. Another option will be a button that would bring a world of, say, 2019 back. Hell, I will even take summer of 2024. I will take either button, please

How to dream again? How to make yourself work? How to develop discipline that is not about cleaning your house or working out, but about actually working? How to not give up?

How to live in the world that is so cruel and is getting worse?

1nulmet,https://www.reddit.com/r/eventmarketer/comments/1nulmet/how_to_make_your_event_feel_bigger_even_on_a/,How to Make Your Event Feel Bigger (Even on a Tight Budget),"One of the biggest challenges in event marketing is perception. You might have a great lineup, solid venue, and good content but if the event *feels small or underwhelming*, it’s harder to generate buzz, repeat attendance, and that “can’t-miss” reputation.

Here are some low-cost strategies that have worked for me and others:

**1. Name it strategically**

* “Meetup” -> “Summit”
* “Workshop” -> “Masterclass”
* Add urgency with “Exclusive” or “One Night Only”

Names frame expectations before someone even buys a ticket.

**2. Partner up**

* Team up with complementary businesses (coffee shop + bookstore = “Taste & Tales Festival”).
* Add credibility with known brands or institutions.
* Cross-promotion stretches reach without stretching budget.

**3. Create a VIP feel**

* Even a roped-off section, different wristband, or early access perks make attendees feel special.
* Small exclusivity cues can sell out first.

**4. Use lighting to transform the space**

* Uplighting, string lights, or simple gels change the vibe dramatically.
* $200 in rentals can make a community center feel like an “immersive gallery.”

**5. Structure for scale**

* Offer multiple “tracks” or staggered programming.
* Build in peak shared moments that feel big, even if attendance is modest.

**6. Smart marketing for FOMO**

* Share ticket counts (“70% Sold Out”).
* Showcase testimonials and prep behind-the-scenes.
* Highlight notable participants (even local micro-influencers).

**7. Invest in impact areas**

* Sound > anything else.
* Stage lighting, poster design, and a smooth entry experience make people feel like they’re at a high-quality event.

**Case in point:**  
I once booked a small singer-songwriter expecting 5–10 attendees. By reframing it as a **“Songwriting Showcase”** and partnering with an art gallery, attendance hit 50+ and the night felt like a landmark community event. All without extra spend.

**Key takeaway:** Perception matters more than perfection. You don’t need a massive budget—you need to be intentional about framing, partnerships, and atmosphere.

1nulk1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nulk1p/delve_into_whether_the_best_coffee_maker_is_the/,Delve Into Whether the Best Coffee Maker is the Technivorm Moccamaster,"I’ve been using the Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 for a while now, and let me tell you, it’s quite an experience. As someone who adores a fresh, single-serving cup of coffee every morning, this coffee maker hits so many right notes. I was initially drawn to its polished silver exterior. It doesn’t just make coffee—it’s a piece of kitchen art. Compact enough to fit on any countertop, this one-cup drip coffee maker has a stylishly metallic finish that screams premium without being too obtrusive. Measuring 6.5 inches deep, 10.2 inches wide, and 11.7 inches high, it fits perfectly into tight spaces, which is a huge plus if you’re battling a cluttered setup like mine.  

**Ease of Use Speaks Volumes**  
From a usability standpoint, this coffee maker has been a breeze. The fully-automatic operation takes the guesswork out of brewing, and the specially designed brew basket is a small but mighty feature. It’s optimized to steep coffee, producing rich flavors consistently in under four minutes. If you’re someone like me who values both speed and quality in coffee preparation, this machine is a complete lifesaver on busy mornings. What’s even better is the removable cup holder, which allows for flexibility when switching between cups of various sizes.

**Benefits**  
- Sleek, compact polished silver design gives a premium feel  
- Brew basket steeping delivers consistently rich, flavorful coffee  
- One-cup servings mean no wasted coffee or pods  
- Removable cup holder accommodates different mug sizes  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b014i5owco/)

**Eye-Catching Perks**  
What I personally appreciated was its pod-free mechanism. We’ve all seen the tragedies of single-use pods piling up, right? This coffee maker eliminates that guilt entirely while maintaining convenience. The inclusion of 240 paper filters (size #1) with the brewer was a thoughtful touch—it’s like they knew I’d forget to buy filters ahead of time. Adding to the appeal, its automatic shutoff feature prevents energy wastage, which has reassured me on those days when I’ve dashed out the door in a hurry.  

**Negatives**  
- A bit pricey for a one-cup machine considering other offerings in the market  
- Paper filters add a recurring cost  
- No programmable timer features for morning automation  
- A minor learning curve, particularly to fine-tune coffee strength  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this coffee maker to fellows in the industry like the Keurig K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach Scoop, I could see both strengths and weaknesses. The Keurig K-Mini, while slightly more cost-effective and featuring a similar compact design, relies heavily on pods, which doesn’t sit well with eco-conscious users. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach Scoop offers a pod-free experience like the Moccamaster, but its build quality doesn’t quite match the sturdy craftsmanship of the polished silver model here. In terms of pure coffee quality, I’ve found the Moccamaster to be superior, thanks to its steeping capability, delivering a more robust and flavorful cup.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This is definitely a higher-end product, so it makes you consider whether it’s worth the spend. The quality of the materials and the fact that it’s handmade in the Netherlands instill a lot of trust in the brand’s craftsmanship. Given its five-year warranty, it feels like a long-term investment for coffee lovers who prioritize quality and sustainability. For me personally, the ease of operation, premium build, and pod-less design make it a justifiable choice despite its higher price point. That said, I can understand if someone hesitates due to its cost, as there are cheaper alternatives with similar functions.

Anyways I would love some feedback on this piece, just please be respectful. :)

I can’t wait to tell Brittney. I hate running, but I’m running anyway, that’s how excited I am to tell her about Finn. This is the only part of town I feel comfortable on foot. The sleek, all white modern houses line both sides of the street with newly trimmed trees and cars so shiny they’re blinding. The cleanliness and sharpness of the houses is taken away a little with all the security cameras that line all corners of the houses, but it’s also the reason I feel safe here.  
As I run further down the street I hear the faint sounds of sirens, people are slowly walking outside in their smooth silky robes, desperately looking for gossip like a detective trying to solve a case. A sudden uneasiness washes over my body and I pick up the pace. Something must’ve happened, maybe Britney knows. I turn the final corner and see her house at the end of the street. It's the biggest of them all, three floors, giant windows and a lawn that could nearly be a soccer field. It’s the perfect place for a perfect family, but something isn’t perfect. Multiple police cars are lined outside her house and another passes me. All I can think about is whether or not Brittney and her family are okay. They’re all I’ve ever known and are the nicest people on earth. They deserve their entire fortune. If somebody did something to them I swear to god I’ll find them and put them in their place.  
I approach just outside the line of police cars when a cop stops me dead in my tracks.  
“Sorry ma’am, no one is on or off the property at this time.”  
“Please sir, I need to make sure they’re all okay!” I begged. The cop looked me up and down, his expression curious yet hesitant.  
“Name?”  
“Lilith Lenore.”  
He mumbles into his radio. “\[Radio code\], I have a teenage girl here, who says she knows the family.” A sharp crackle comes from the other side of the radio but it’s too distorted for me to understand.  
“She’s dressed like it’s Halloween and says her name is Lilith Lenore.” More crackling comes from the other side. “Alright ma’am you may head inside. We may need your statement.”  
Statement? Why would they need my statement? I ran past the cop car barricade and into the house. Police are running around left and right, some with K-9s. Everyone is talking over one another and I can’t hear myself think. It isn’t until a small set of arms wrap around my legs that breaks me out of this overstimulating mess. I look down at the blonde, blue eyed kid who I’ve always seen as a little brother. Weston. I pick Weston up and he latches onto my body. His salt stained cheeks break my heart.  
“Where are your parents Weston?” I ask as I wipe his face. He continues to cry but points me in the direction of the family room across the hall. The door is shut so I gently twist the doorknob and let myself in. Mrs and Mr \[name ill find later\] are sitting on the couch with two police men standing near them. Mrs \[name\] is crying into a handkerchief and Mr \[name\] looks like he’s about to murder someone. Mr \[name\] notices me first and he gives me the smallest, saddest smile known to man. He taps Mrs \[name\]s shoulder and she turns her head.  
“Lilith!” She cries. She gestured for me to sit on their white couch. Weston continues to cry as we sit down on the couch. Mrs \[name\] rubs his back.  
“It’s okay honey, shh, shh.” Weston slowly calms down and lets go of me. His poor little face is covered in tears, saliva and snot. All this commotion must be awful for him and his little brain. He’s only eight years old. Mrs \[name\] hands me a handkerchief and I wipe Weston’s face until he’s all clean. Tears continue to stream down his face but he’s doing better than he was before, I hand him over onto his moms lap and she caresses his golden hair. It isn’t until one of the cops clears their throat that I remember I don’t know what’s happening.  
“Where’s Brittney?” I ask. Mr and Mrs \[name\] look away from me.   
“Miss Lenore, would you be willing to answer some questions for us.”  
“Yes of course.” Why won’t they tell me where she is? The cop places a tape recorder on the white and gold marble coffee table.  
“Do you consent to being recorded?”  
“Yes sir.”  
“Alright, let’s begin.” He flips to the next page of his notebook and scribbles a few things. “When was the last time you saw Ms Brittney \[last name\]?”  
“This morning and afternoon. We got some coffee after school and parted ways. We were supposed to hang out here tonight.” I shift awkwardly in my seat  
.“What time would you say it was when you parted ways?  
”“Three thirty, maybe three forty five?”  
He scribbles in his notebook again. “And what were you guys planning on doing?”  
“Watch some movies, eat snacks. Maybe stay the night.”  
He nods. “Are you aware Brittney had a stalker?”  
“A stalker?”  
“Yes ma’am, given what we’ve found here tonight it’s clear that someone has been stalking her.”  
My heart skips a beat. Did she know? If she did, why didn’t she tell me? Where is she?!  
“Where is Brittney?” I ask. The cop sits down in the chair on the other side of us and takes a deep breath. His dark brown eyes have sunken into his skull. Patches of grey appear around his hairline.

So I’m sure a lot of you have heard the saying “no disease can exist in an oxygenated environment”. This is true to an extent, but here’s the real breakdown.

Oxygen is just another tool the body uses to of course keep us alive, but to also support the body’s natural detox and repair systems. Higher oxygen dissolved in plasma, better delivery to tissues, repair your cells, etc. Oxygen is a high vibrational frequency. It’s just as important as the sun and water - it’s a crucial source of all life.

I think incorporating oxygenation by using a hyperbaric oxygen chamber could be beneficial. Now these things are expensive, so of course none of us can just go out and spend $50,000 on a nice one lmao. So find a spa near you that has one to use. I found a couple near me and can buy a membership for only $300 a month. Can use the chamber every single day if I want too each month!

Remember, we’re trying to include as many things as we can to “speed up” the healing process. Proper diet, lifestyle, fasting, grounding, and oxygenation is the perfect bundle pack to overall  wellness, and of course healing. We all want the fastest route, that’s human nature. And there are certain shortcuts in life, but it depends on how disciplined you are.

Just to mention, but yes “The One Minute Cure” (ingesting food grade hydrogen peroxide) is a form of oxygenation. I did the whole 50 day protocol and it didn’t work. I think the hyperbaric oxygen chamber or even ozone therapy (another form of oxygenation but super expensive) can be more beneficial. 

I’d be lying if I said I was excited to be doing this all over again it feels like. No coffee, sugar, alcohol, nicotine, fake dopamine lmao, etc. Just an insane strict lifestyle each day for the next several months. Hell maybe even until next summer. But oh well gotta do what it takes. Gotta be willing to do what 99.99% of people will never do or accomplish. 

Let go of your ego and temptations. Find peace. Start your journey if you haven’t yet. Do this all for yourself. Stay strict and disciplined. Fight.

Won’t be posting for a while after this. Will keep you all updated soon. A part of me feels like I let you all down. I could have potentially been cured by now if I wasn’t a bitch and caved into my emotions and bad habits again all of last winter.

So I do preschool cases in NY. For those who don’t know, I travel around to different daycares, preschools, homes etc seeing kids. I’m lucky and work in one small geographical area close to home. I used to work for NYC but needed to be more available for my kids. 

I’ve always been terrible at communicating with parents. Working full time is schools there wasn’t an expectation that you would send an update after every session. Still I always felt like my parent communication could be better. Now that I’m essentially doing home health, there is an expectation of parent communication more frequently. Maybe I have ADHD. Maybe it’s just me being lazy. I don’t know. But grabbing a notebook at the end of a session is not natural to me. 

Long story short. A parent that I totally acknowledge that I dropped the ball with called the owner of my agency to say that they are going with another agency. Apparently the daycare didn’t like how I handled a situation and the parent didn’t like that I didn’t get in contact with them until after few weeks into the school year. Yes I know. Bad. Last year this parent was pretty noncommunicative and I just forgot on top of my newer cases and some issues with my own kids. September for me is always just a lot. Also I’m realizing my mind doesn’t work as well with this type of work. I actually hate making my own schedule. I get way too hung up on making the ‘perfect’ schedule and worrying about what the schools I’m going to will think about the schedules. 

Thank you if read this. I’ll consider you my honorary work lunch buddies. Or walk and get coffee partner. Or just I’ll walk into your office and complain to you. ",21,1759257591.0,slp,8,1.0,False
1nulds8,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1nulds8/will_i_suceed_or_fail_again/,Will I suceed or fail again?,"

I’m 25 years old. I recently quit college and broke up with my girlfriend. We ended things on good terms, which makes it even harder because we still love each other — but I’m not in the best place mentally. This summer, everything fell apart. We broke up, I couldn’t study in peace, and I started having panic attacks even when I was alone in my room. Suicidal thoughts were very strong, but I couldn’t go through with it.

So, I made a plan. I want to study dental medicine (I know is crazy hard, but I find it very interesting). I’ll take the next two year to prepare for the entrance exams and learning language, by going to private classes (I'm starting next week), while saving as much money as possible. In country I eant to go, I will take the cheapest student room and try to not spend money. I used to study CS, but because of depression I lost all passion for it. Over time, I even became resentful toward it, despite originally liking the field. Medicine, however, was always my true dream — but I couldn’t pursue it before because of my family’s financial situation, and I had to stay in my hometown.

Now I’m determined to change that. I’ll start working tomorrow and go to the gym on my free days. I’ve quit coffee and plan to quit cigarettes by the end of the month. I’ll continue therapy and start SSRIs to get my brain functioning again as soon as possible.

I’ve already contacted the university I want to attend and arranged for some passive income through state benefits — something I’d been avoiding out of embarrassment about my disability status (I had many operations as a child and still struggle both mentally and physically).

No one knows about my plan except my best friend, my sister, and my father. I don’t live with them. My sister supports me, but my father insulted me and called me stupid, saying I don’t deserve a second chance.

If I prepare everything, I will be 27 when I start and 33 when I finish (in hope that I will do everything right). 

Am I still young enough to do this? Even if it’s a crazy idea, should I go all in, succeed, and turn my life around 180°? I’m so angry at myself, but I want to do this and prove to everyone — and to myself — that I can make something out of my life.

TL;DR: I’m 25, battling depression and anxiety, and everything fell apart this summer. But I’ve made a plan to rebuild: I’ll prepare for dental medicine for two years, save money, move into a student room, keep therapy, quit bad habits, and work on myself. I want to know if it’s still possible to turn my life around and finally chase the dream I couldn’t before.

1nuldla,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1nuldla/does_leather_master_leather_odor_remover_actually/,Does Leather Master leather odor remover actually eliminate smells?,"Leather Master Leather Odor Remover has been a recent addition to my cleaning arsenal, and using it daily has given me the chance to put it through its paces. With its promise to eliminate tough odors from leather surfaces, I was intrigued, especially since I have a few leather pieces in my home that tend to absorb smells like they're on a mission. For anyone who's struggled with lingering odors in leather furniture, jackets, or even car interiors, this product presents an interesting solution worth exploring.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
I have to admit, the compact design of the Leather Master Leather Odor Remover spray bottle instantly struck me as practical. At 200 milliliters, the bottle is small enough to fit tidily on a shelf without hogging space yet still packs enough product to tackle numerous cleaning sessions. The lightweight nature (just 8.4 ounces) makes it easy on the hands, which I appreciated during long cleaning sessions. The product comes with clear instructions: shake, apply to the sponge, and work it into the leather using circular motions. This simplicity works wonders for someone like me who hates cleaning rituals that feel like solving a puzzle.

**Gentle Yet Effective Cleaning**  
As a leather-safe spray, one of its biggest promises is its ability to neutralize odors without affecting the texture or finish of delicate leather pieces. I tested it on my leather office chair, which had borne the brunt of morning coffee spills and late-night snacks—I won't lie; it was starting to smell a little funky. Astonishingly, after working the product onto the surface, the smell vanished without leaving any residue or altering the leather's texture, keeping the chair as supple as before.

**Perks**  
- The water-based formula meant there were no harsh chemicals eating through the leather or triggering sensitivities in my family members.  
- Application felt straightforward—with the included sponge, it was easy to create a uniform layer of the product across the leather's surface.
- It worked beyond leather. On recommendation, I tried it on some faux leather kitchen stools, and the results held steady. Those odd food odors disappeared, leaving the room feeling fresher.  

**Caveats**  
- While easy to work with, the product doesn't cover large surfaces as rapidly as I wished. For my sizable couch, the process was admittedly tedious.  
- I noticed it needed a few reapplications on deeply ingrained smells, like lingering pet odors.  
- The sponge that comes with the kit isn't as robust as I'd like and started to show wear after a couple of uses.  

**Pros**  
- Non-toxic and free from dyes or harsh soaps  
- Works on various leather-like materials, adding versatility  
- Compact size yet efficient in removing stubborn smells  

**Cons**  
- Could offer a better applicator sponge  
- Requires several applications for tougher, set-in odors  
- Not designed for supersized cleaning tasks  

**Alternative Products**  
When I compare Leather Master Leather Odor Remover with others in the market, a notable competitor is the Chemical Guys Leather Cleaner and Conditioner. While it also provides odor elimination features, it doubles as a conditioner, which some might see as added value. However, whereas the Leather Master product focuses laser-sharp on tackling odors with precision, the competitor may dilute its specialty. For strictly neutralizing smells, I found this product more effective and less greasy compared to all-in-one solutions. Still, if conditioning is a high priority, combining both tools might be the ultimate fix.

**Smart Spending**  
Given its targeted use, this isn't your typical go-to cleaner for everyday spills. Instead, think of it as a lifesaver for otherwise perfect leather goods that suffer from challenging odors you can't seem to shift. Considering the niche problem it tackles so well, the price feels justified. However, if you're seeking multipurpose cleaners that also treat leather while eliminating odors, you might want to weigh your options. For what it does—odor removal, pure and simple—it does the job excellently.

1nulceq,https://i.redd.it/i3d3pylojcsf1.jpeg,"Anyone know the title or where I can read this? Madsen and Emily, an MC Romance.","The man I built a home and family with, the MC president I followed…and now the monster breaking me to pieces—He betrayed me for the club bimbo.
""Sugar, and I can't tell you how grateful knowing you're here for me."" My husband Madsen's voice voice filtered through the door, a shard straight to my heart.
""Twenty years next months with Emily. A long time."" He supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart. 
""A tip. Don't let yourself be locked down with just one person.""
My chest ached with the breath I was holding, but it released in a hiss. Rage coiled through me, and I slammed the door open. ""Liar!""
He jolted up from the sofa, eyes wide.
""No, Em—wait, that’s not what it sounded like!"" His voice cracked, raw with fear. ""I never crossed the line with Sarah, never!""
""You ever been tempted to sleep with her?"" I locked eyes with him—the man I’d loved for decades.
He hesitated.
In that pause, all the read but unanswered texts, all the nights with the empty bed and even emptier promises came flooding back—Now I knew where he’d been.
I wiped the tears from my cheeks, and swallowed down my sobs.
""You make me sick.""
——
Emily Flowers braced one hand against the wall, tried to catch her breath, and failed.
Her lungs refused to drag in air because her heart was no longer beating.
Because it had just shattered into a million jagged pieces, covered in blood and bits of shredded, gory flesh.
She should have kept walking. She should have never even come to the clubhouse in the first place. But she was a good wife, a g0dd@mn wifey rock star, and she wanted to make sure her husband, the love of her life, had his favorite pair of jeans—she'd even repaired the hole in the waistband for him. All she planned to do was leave them in his bedroom upstairs, pop her head into his office to tell them they were there...maybe get one of those beautiful crooked smiles from him for the first time in too long, a smile that she was so freaking needy for. That same smile that had won her adolescent heart that summer day long ago. That same smile that turned her inside out on their wedding day, as she stood before him, sliding a ring on his finger, and pledging her life to him.
It was that ring, that pledge that had brought her to the clubhouse, her loyalty despite the chilly, steel walls thickening between them. She missed him, so freaking much, so she told herself that even a glimpse of him, the rumbling sound of his voice, the whiff of his familiar leather and bourbon scent would be enough to hold her over until they could figure things out.
And they would figure things out, because they were end game, they were forever. They were one and only.
But she shouldn't have bothered.
She shouldn't have given in to the desperate urge to see her husband, a man she hadn't set eyes on in over a week. A man who had clothes in her closet, coffee mugs in her cupboards, and a cold, empty spot on the other side of her bed, but hadn't set foot in their home of fifteen years in over seven days.
She should have known something was wrong; he never went that long without at least coming to grab a change of clothes. When they'd first married, for those first few months before he'd enlisted and shipped off to Fort Drum, he'd been a homebody, only ever leaving their tiny single-wide trailer to go to work at the grocery store, stocking the shelves. After work, he'd come home, stay home, and they'd spend all their time together. They had no money for fun and extras, so they made do with cable they stole from the next-door neighbors, cheap meals, a comfortable bed, and the person they loved. But now...he was an MC president and former American warrior, so she was used to long absences in the name of duty.
But lately....
Her ears, the tips burning, locked in on a voice that wasn't the smoky rumble of her husband's.
""Frost...you know I'm here for you....""
It wasn't ""duty"" her husband, the love of her life, was chatting with behind a closed door in his office in the middle of the day. A sliver of a crack between the door and the frame allowed the voices to carry into the suddenly suffocating emptiness of the corridor.
Thankfully, the clubhouse was empty; the brothers and who-res all busy doing whatever the he1l they did during the day.
At least they aren't here to see me fall apart...their ""queen"".
What a freaking joke.
I should have kept walking.... Her breath caught as her husband's voice caught her ear.
""I know you are, sugar, and I can't tell you how grateful I am,"" Frost replied in a tone, soft and warm, that Emily had only ever heard him use with her and their children. His family. Their family. His and hers. A family they'd built from nothing but adolescent hopes and dreams.
And sugar? When did he start calling other women pet names?
Something inside of her twisted painfully, making her bite back a groan.
He called their daughter, Sorsha, ""Princess"", and he called—used to call Emily, his wife, his ""Bloom."" Even as a kid, she'd been fascinated by flowers and plants, so much so that her dream had always been to ""do something"" with flowers. And he always said he loved that about her, that she loved pretty, living things, and that she was so good at growing things that made people smile. She always preened when she'd said things like that, his words filling her up, like she'd inhaled a lungful of the most beautiful fragrance, then held it there to memorize every separate scent.
A scent that meant everything to her.
But now...the scent on that bloom no longer pleased...it stank like it had been cut from the bush and left to rot in the dirt.
Sugar...he'd never called any other woman anything other than their name.
That wasn't true now.
Her heart jerked in her chest, pushing jolts of energy into her limbs, urging her to keep moving, to walk away, to escape so she wouldn't have to hear the other half of her soul give a piece of himself to another woman.
I should have kept walking.... Because then she would be blissfully ignorant. That was better than the pain, right? Than the realization that what she'd feared the most in the whole world was playing out just on the other side of an office door.
But she hadn't kept walking, didn't pas-s by his office to drop his jeans in his room as she'd planned when she'd first arrived; she stopped...because she'd heard her name...and the rest of what she heard turned her feet to stone.
""I know Emily hasn't been around in a while,"" a voice Emily was starting to really hate remarked, the tone slimy with false empathy.
She easily recognized her husband's grunt, which was an answer all on its own.
The other woman gave out a heavy sigh, like she had anything heavy other than those ti ts which were as fake as the diamond in the first engagement ring her husband gave her, back when all he could afford was the plastic ring he bought from the dispenser at Chuck E. Cheese for a quarter on his twenty-first birthday, and she was just shy of eighteen...and two months pregnant with their twins.
Their romance was somewhat controversial in that he was a legal adult when they'd first had se-x, but they'd been careful to follow Pennsylvania's Romeo & Juliet laws. People could curl their lips in disgust, but they weren't doing anything wrong. So, when he was drinking age, and she was still in high school, he put a ring on it.
But that ring from the cheap machine meant more to her than the authentic diamond ring he bought her five years later, after his first deployment.
Emily dropped her gaze to the ring, still encircling her finger, a finger wrapped in a Band-Aid because she'd been distracted and had gotten her finger caught in the wire she was using to create a funeral wreath.
""Are things okay between you two—I only ask because I worry about you."" The words sounded genuine, delivered with a soft cooing that made Em's teeth grind, but Emily knew the utterances of manipulation when she heard them. And Mads should, too.
Right?
""Everyone wants what you have, Frost...even me,"" that voice simpered, a pout obvious in her tone.
She wanted what Frost had, did she? Or did she simply want Frost?
Acrid saliva built in the back of Em's throat, but she swallowed it back.
Forcing the sudden buzzing from her ears, she held her breath once more to listen through the sliver in the doorway.
""You don't understand,"" the voice of her husband, Madsen Flowers, her heart and soul, said softly, gently, pleadingly, ""you are too young to be stuck—you have a full life ahead of you. You cannot let yourself be locked down with just one person.""
""Like you did?"" that freaking voice asked, a little too interested, though it was skillfully hidden behind empathetic cooing.
Like you did? Sarah, the slinky club b1tch, was asking Frost if he was stuck—as in...with his wife? What the he1l?
Em's chest ached with the breath she was holding, but it released in a hiss.
Please, please say ""no"" that you aren't talking about yourself—about us....
""Twenty years next month,"" Madsen supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart. ""Started dating at twenty, but...I'd known her for years before that. Best friends."" There was a speaking silence, one that whispered ""enduring"" and ""everlasting."" He sighed, the sound like a gunshot in an empty stadium. ""Long time.""
Yes, a long time—from the time she turned sixteen and he was twenty, but they waited to have se-x until she was seventeen, almost eighteen, because he wanted to make sure she was truly ready.
And she had been. They'd both been.
There was a shuffling, like feet moving across the industrial carpeting, and then the tell-tale sound of creaking leather as someone sat down.
The sliver in the door didn't allow for her to see inside, so she had no idea what was happening. Did she want to know what was happening? Were they sitting together on that old leather couch? Were they sitting close? Were their arms touching, their legs? Were they leaning into each other, staring into each other's eyes even now, in the silence?
God, she couldn't get enough air.
He wouldn't cheat...he isn't a cheater... That wasn't the man she fell in love with eighteen years ago, and married nineteen years ago; her husband was fiercely loyal, dedicated, loving, and honorable.
But then...he wasn't exactly that same man she'd married; the man sitting in that office was the same man who'd ordered one of this trusted club brothers to target and seduce an innocent woman. Locust and Nadia were still healing from that treachery.
No...the man sitting in that office, the one who could order that...she didn't know him.
And now uncertainty morphed into a slithering, slimy fear.
""I get it, Frost, I do,"" the young woman's voice filled with silence, the tone placating and a little 'see me, I'm right here, lean on me.' ""I'm sorry your life has been like that, but...it doesn't have to be that way anymore. You're se-xy, amazing, and you're still young. You have options.""
Mads gave a tight laugh, then offered, ""Yeah...I do...."" There was a flatness to his voice that made Em blink; she'd never heard him like that before. But it wasn't the tone that had ripped out a piece of her soul, it was that he agreed with Sarah.
He had options?
Like Sarah—the club skank with the perfect rack, peachy as-s, long legs, flawless skin, and not a single ounce of fat? Sarah, who didn't have that same pooch from nineteen years ago from carrying twins. Sarah, who hadn't breastfed to babies for over a year. Sarah, who didn't stress eat, then diet in a vicious cycle until her skin was a hormonal mess, complete with miles of stretch marks from all the yo-yoing. Sarah, who's hair was soft and golden and didn't have a single split end, because she had the time and effort to do whatever bullsh-it hair routine TikTok was raving about. Em's hair was just there, blonde but the dull kind, the kind that was washed in Target brand shampoo and left to dry in a ponytail because Em had sh-it to do and didn't have time to do more than that.
Sarah was young, skinny, beautiful, and took care of herself.
But she wasn't Sarah, and apparently, Mads had noticed.
How long? How long have I not been good enough that he now needs options?
Sucking in a breath to stop the spots from dancing in her eyes, Em tried to take a step back but couldn't. The pair of jeans in her hands were leaving marks in her skin from where she was squeezing them so tightly in her fists, her fingers ached from the force.
Sarah, not knowing she was tearing apart a marriage word-by-word, cooed, ""Hey, how 'bout we grab some food from Lowry's and head to that spot by the lake you showed me. It's beautiful there, and that big red tree is the perfect place for a picnic.""
Spot by the lake...big red tree....
Em gasped, quickly pressing her hand against her mouth to muffle the sound.
No. Sarah, the club who-re, the young, buxom, blonde release dumpster, couldn't be talking about the overlook on the lake on Mads's grandpa's property, the land the old man had gifted to Em and Madsen on their wedding day, the land where she had always hoped to build their dream home, but Mads kept putting it off, with one excuse after another. The land with the big red maple tree, the one Mads had carved their initials into twenty years ago when he'd made the promise to love her forever. Their spot. Their special place. For the two of them.
He'd taken her to their spot?
After a moment of weighty silence, her husband replied, ""Sure, yeah, that sounds good.""
And he was taking her there again. To their spot. On their land...where their dreams of a future, family, and forever had been etched into that same red maple tree.
The red maple tree she and Mads hand planted, by hand, when she was twelve and he was sixteen. It had symbolized their—then—budding friendship that had quickly turned to young love when she'd turned sixteen, and then forever love when she'd married him at eighteen, pregnant with their twins. That tree was them, their story, their timeline—roots, trunk, branches, and leaves.
And he was taking another woman to sit beneath those branches, to be shaded by the leaves, to settle against the trunk, and picnic on the soil nurturing those roots.
Tainted. Diseased. Withering. Dying. That tree was no longer a testament to the growth, strength, vitality, and longevity of their marriage...it was a carcas-s, still standing, but in need of culling.
He took her to our spot...is taking her again....
Had he...had he made l0ve to Sarah under the tree...as he had with Em all those years ago when she'd gifted him her virgin1ty...and he'd gifted her his. They were each other's first...under that red maple tree.
Had her husband, her one and only, taken another woman and given himself to her at the base of that tree, with only fallen leaves as a soft blanket beneath them? Had he slowly undressed her, or was it a desperate shedding of clothes fueled by raging desire for one another? Had he looked down at her n@ked body and compared it to his wife's, a body that had wear and tear, and stretch and sag? Had his eyes burned with lust and his body grow hot and hard with need for her, for the body that was perfect—unlike the worn, lumpy, not so shiny body of his wife?
Em's mouth flooded, bile rising to coat her tongue and teeth with sour acid, the need to vomit rising with it.
Trembling, Em finally found the strength to push away from the wall, to stumble down the corridor, back toward the door leading to the rear parking lot where she'd parked. Sliding into her 2024 Dodge Durango, she didn't remember anything after hitting the start button, but she had to have known where she needed to go because in a blink she was parked in the two-car garage of their home just outside of Wilkes-Barre, the one they'd bought when their family of four had outgrown the tiny apartment they'd rented right before Mads's first deployment. This house, with its two thousand five hundred square feet was only meant to be a stopover, a place to rest until their forever home on Granddad's land was built. But year after year, they remained, and year after year, Mads spent less and less time there, and now that the twins were off to college, it sat empty a lot of the time. She worked long hours as the owner and manager of Flower's Blooms, and Mads spent more and more time at the clubhouse. So the home that she'd painstakingly built over the years, the resting place, the safe haven, the heart and soul that she'd seeded, planted, and nurtured over the last fifteen years was now simply a cold, desiccated husk.
Sliding out of the driver's seat, Em set to work. She dropped the jeans she'd meant to give her husband on the kitchen counter beside her purse, then she headed to the smart home hub located on the wall in her home office. Mads had demanded they upgrade the house because he was tired of losing and then having to beg her to find his keys. Also, the home was wired with exterior cameras, window sensors, and all the bells and security whistles an MC president required in his home.
It's going to bite him in the as-s how, aint it?
Unlocking the system, Em proceeded to change the key code for the front and back doors. The interior garage door, leading into the kitchen, didn't have a key, since they only ever locked it once everyone was in for the night, so no one ever needed a key for it.
That, too, would bite Mads in the as-s.
The Flowers' home lockdown complete, her legs trembling, her chest aching as her heart attempted to lurch from it, she collapsed onto the floor just inside the back door, her limp and yet frozen body slumped against it.
Hands shaking, she took out her phone, sending a text she never thought she'd ever have to send.
QueenEm: CODE RED.
Sitting on the cold tile floor, in the kitchen of the home she'd built with the man she loved, the man who betrayed her, she promptly fell apart.
Frost groaned, throwing his head back, his throat working, his eyes closed tight, his body vibrating with unspent tension.
Fuuuuuck....
Ten days. It had been ten fu-cking days since he'd been home, since he'd seen his wife. It had been three days since he'd spoken with his wife, and that was three fu-cking days too long.
He ached with the absence of her.
And whose fu-cking fault is that?
Scrubbing his hand down his face, he heaved a sigh and leaned back in his desk chair, the aged leather creaking and the metal base squeaking with the movement. He could buy a new one, but this one was worn in, comfortable, fitting him perfectly.
Just like his marriage. Best friends for twenty-three years. A couple for twenty years. Married for nineteen years, two kids, six deployments from Fort Drum, two moves—from their tiny apartment to the house they currently lived in, and years of stress, drama, and other ups and downs with the Unchained MC.... Their relationship was older than some of the prospects looking to patch into the club, but that was one of the best things about it.
Right?
That his marriage was strong, uncomplicated...and...well, he was content.
At least he had been before the kids left for college, creating a vacuum where all-consuming chaos and noise once reigned. Now...there was silence, there was peace, there was...an emptiness he couldn't quite fill, especially now that Em wasn't there as often as she'd once been. Now...he had no idea what the fu-ck was going on.
Em, his Em, was his rock, his home, his reason. Em, his Em, his Bloom, had been with him from the very beginning, through all of his deployments in the Army, then all his long weeks away during road trips or long nights dealing with club business. His Em was used to long absences, some without contact for days or weeks at a time. But not once since he'd been discharged from the US Army had he and his wife gone so long without at least texting.
Yeah, he should have noticed on day one that she hadn't texted, called, or had one of the brothers check in on him—she was a good wife like that. Truth was, he could have reached out to her too, checked in on her, told her he missed her and wished he could be home with her, wished he could lay next to her in their bed, make l0ve to her. But...well...he didn't have an excuse. He'd been letting the bullsh-it with the Bone Dogz patch over, drama with the brothers and their women, and the upcoming Cool Hands costume party and fundraiser keep his head occupied.
He was jerked from his thoughts when his cell chimed with a text from his desk, where a pile of invoices still sat untouched. sh-it, he was never going to be out from under that pile of bullsh-it.
Maybe I should just let Patriot handle it...then maybe I can see my fu-cking wife again....
His phone chimed again, and he checked it.
Sarah: Thank you for lunch on Tuesday and yesterday. I can't believe how beautiful that place is.
Sarah: Do you think we can go there again tomorrow? Weather is supposed to be perfect.
A hot poker covered in acid impaled him.
fu-ck....
He scrubbed a hand down his face and pinched his eyes shut.
The moment he'd first set foot beneath that red maple tree with a woman who was not his wife, he'd known he'd done something irreparable. But...that day, he'd needed a moment, and Sarah had been vocally upset about something with her family back in New York, and he'd stupidly thought she could come with him, find peace and solace in the beauty and quiet of the back mountain property he and Em had owned for decades. He'd taken the truck, and Sarah had sat beside him, chatting about her issues with her mother, her hand reaching for his when she needed his strength, and once they'd parked at the fence line and gotten out of the truck, a weight had settled over him. An oppressive sense of wrongness that only added to his agitation over all the other bullsh-it he was dealing with. Rather than give in to it, to allow the stress of duty and obligation conquer him, he'd pushed forward, taking Sarah's hand to help her over the old log fence, and then leading her to the spot overlooking the small lake at the back of the property. He hadn't even noticed he was still holding her hand until she curled into him, sighing, at the sight of ""the spot."" The spot beneath the red maple tree he and Em had planted so long ago; a symbol of them, their growth, their relationship.
For fu-ck's sake, he carved their names into the bark of that tree the same night they'd taken each other's virginities.
Her voice soft, warm, filled with that sweetness he loved, she asked, ""What're you doin', Mads?""
He turned his head to look over his shoulder at her where she was laying, n@ked, her skin glowing in the moonlight, beneath a thin blanket on top of a sleeping bag he'd spread out to keep the chill of the ground away.
He couldn't stop the unrepentant and ravenous grin that lifted the corners of his mouth at the sight of her, his woman, his everything.
""I'm making a record of us, claiming this spot, this moment...for us,"" he replied, a feeling unlike anything he'd ever felt before filling him from his toes to this scalp.
With one last deep groove, Mads stepped back, the knife now loose in his aching fingers.
He felt her move, not needing to see her to know she was there, now standing behind him, the blanket wrapped around her beautiful body, a body he'd worshipped for hours that night.
Her breath against the back of his neck, he groaned when she pressed herself against his back, then wrapped her arms around his waist, holding him there, as though she were his anchor, and him her pillar.
""Wow, Mads...,"" she whispered, awe in her soft voice, ""it's amazing.""
He nodded silently, unable to tear his gaze from the permanent mark he'd left in the tree they'd planted three years ago. Red maples were fast growing, but they'd had no idea, when they'd planted it during Arbor Day when she was twelve and he was sixteen, that the tree would become a symbol of them. Em and Mads. And now it always would be.
""Mads loves Em 4-Ever,"" Em read, sighing.
His gaze, still riveted to the heart he'd etched deeply into the rough, gray bark of the tree, he barely heard her next words.
""Do you mean it?""
His heart slammed against his ribs as a warmth so like the heat of the sun overflowed from it. Turning, finally tearing his gaze from the tree, he looked down at the girl who'd owned that very same heart for as long as he could remember. Pulling her into his arms, he embraced her...and the bright, beautiful future they were going to have together.
Pressing a ki-ss to her head, he drew in a deep breath, and vowed, ""Until the day I die.""
That moment, twenty years ago, was still as fresh a memory as any he'd made that morning, and it was why he always returned to that tree, that spot, every time life became too fu-cking much.
Sarah had oohed and awwed at the sight, her issues with her family seemingly gone in an instant, and he was left with more internal upheaval than he'd had before he'd gotten in the truck. He knew he shouldn't have taken Sarah there the first time, but she when she'd asked again yesterday, he'd been...preoccupied, his mind a mine field of information, data, missed calls, missed texts, a cold, lonely bed, a cold, lonely heart, and when Sarah started talking about Em, like she seemed to do every time they were together...every mine in that mental mine field exploded at once. So, when she'd asked to go back, he didn't say no—she'd already been there before, what was the harm in taking her again? And, fu-ck, did he need at least that much, that moment under the tree where he'd once been happy with Em. She wasn't talking to him, wasn't checking in on him, wasn't being the wife and best friend he needed, so he'd take whatever the fu-ck he could from just sitting beneath the tree that meant something to the both of them.
And Sarah came along. They'd stopped for Chik-Fil-A, and sat beneath the branches of the tree. He ate, Sarah talked as he leaned against the bark of the tree, trying to absorb whatever energy he could from something Em touched, loved, cherished.
Like she'd once did him.
And whose fault is it that she doesn't give you the fu-cking time of day?
A ding of a text pulled him from his thoughts.
Sarah: I'm going to WNS. You want anything? I know you're out of Jack. You want the apple kind?
He almost smiled at that last question, because she knew d@mn well he thought apples belonged in pies not booze. He'd made a big deal about it at the last club BBQ when Cilla brought hard apple cider and tried to get him to try one. He'd been less than impressed.
Now, Sarah was going to the state-owned Wine & Spirits store, which meant she was on a run for one of the brothers and was asking if she could grab something for him while she was there.
Huh, that's thoughtful of her.... But that was Sarah; thoughtful. She was sweet as pie, always checking in on him, offering to get him things, showing she cared in a lot of little ways...like Em used to, back before she got busy being the boss lady. Now, it felt like he was an afterthought, something Em remembered when it suited her, and he was left puttering around in the periphery of her new life, one she obviously had no problem living without him.
When had they become like this; two separate people, living two separate lives?
When you became the as-shole who put more effort into the Bone Dogz than he did his own marriage?
fu-ck! That voice didn't know what the fu-ck it was talking about. His marriage had always been his priority, it was Em who started pulling away once the kids left for college.
Right?
Feeling his face pinch in a grimace, he reread Sarah's text, his thumbs hovering over the screen.
But he didn't message her back; he couldn't, not with the way he was feeling.
Confused. Charmed. Captivated. Contorted—like he was being twisted and pulled and bent in too many directions. How much longer before he gave out and simply...broke?
Sarah Yates. Twenty-two, high school dropout, child of a broken marriage, beautiful, and still sunny and hopeful despite all that life had thrown at her. She was new to his club, a club who-re that had moved to Unchained MC from the Bone Dogz previous clubhouse. When Frost had offered a home for the members and those under their protection, he knew the club would bring a few of their girls with them. Sarah was the only club who-re who'd made the move, though, stating that there was nothing keeping her in New York, and that she wasn't close with her family any longer, because they'd pretty much abandoned her when she'd moved in with the club. So, she'd moved from New York to Wilkes-Barre, and she'd quickly become a favorite among the single members of the Unchained. But it wasn't unhe1ltil she'd slunk over to sit next to him at the bar one night, months ago, that he'd actually talked to her.
She was intelligent, charming, witty, caring, and sensual. She'd used every trick in the club who-re manual to try and get into his bed that night, but he'd turned her down, reminding her that club who-res kept their hands off the brothers with old ladies. She'd blushed, seemed contrite, then asked if they could be friends. That was the problem, though, being friends with a club who-re was all kinds of awkward, but...she hadn't done anything wrong, and she was a breath of fresh air, and talking to her had stirred things in him that he hadn't felt in a long, long time. Since that first night, he'd found himself seeking her out, talking with her for long hours, sitting beside her, laying his head on her shoulder when the weight of his responsibilities became too heavy.
Yes, he knew he was using Sarah for what he should be giving to Em, but Em, well...she was busy being the badas-s boss b1tch at her business, a business she'd been dreaming about since she was thirteen. She was building success, and now that the kids were in college, she had more time to devote to her dream of being a professional florist. But where did that leave him?
Ignored. Forgotten. Pissed. Discontent. Out of sorts. Aching like a phantom limb.
It didn't help that she found out about you sending Locust on that fu-cked up mission to seduce an innocent woman.
Yeah, that had been one of the worst things he'd done in his life—he freely admitted that—and he could blame all the stress of the Bone Dogz patch over, but there was more to it...he just couldn't put his finger on it.
A knock on the doorjamb made him raise his head, and his gaze slammed into the hard, wary eyes of his VP.
""Need you in the conference room,"" Patriot said, his voice giving nothing away.
Heaving a sigh, Frost leaned back in his desk chair, and crossed his arms. ""Can't it wait? I've got sh-it to do."" Like figure out how to get out of taking Sarah to ""the spot"" again. Twice was already too many times, and if Em found out....
He couldn't stop the full body shudder even if he were made of stone.
Patriot's lips thinned, his eyes narrowing, he answered, ""No.""
That was it, that single word, and yet it carried a whole other meaning, one that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
fu-ck.
Standing, his bones like jelly, his heart like cement, he followed his VP from the room, knowing that he wouldn't return to his office the same man who'd left.",1,1759257469.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I remember the first time I hit play. Honestly, I didn’t expect much. Another track, another promise. But what happened next surprised me—it was like someone reached into the clutter of my brain, turned down the static, and let me breathe for the first time in months.

I’d been buried under deadlines, fighting brain fog that coffee couldn’t touch, and stuck in a cycle of distraction. Focus felt impossible. Clarity was a memory. And my creativity? It was like trying to start a car with no gas in the tank.

That first session flipped a switch. Within minutes, I felt a calm focus I hadn’t felt in years. The noise in my head went quiet. Ideas started flowing like water, and instead of forcing productivity, it felt effortless. That same week, I closed two projects I’d been procrastinating on for over a month.

The real magic came when I made it a daily ritual.

* **My concentration sharpened**—tasks that took hours suddenly took half the time.
* **My memory improved**—I stopped forgetting small details that used to cost me credibility.
* **My stress dropped**—I felt lighter, more centered, like I finally had control instead of spinning out.

The most shocking part? People around me started noticing before I even told them. A colleague said, “You seem different. More dialed in.” And they were right—I wasn’t just more productive, I was showing up differently in every area of my life.

I used to think breakthroughs had to come from grinding harder. Turns out, they come from accessing the right state of mind. That’s what this gave me—the ability to unlock focus, clarity, memory, and calm on command.

If you’re skeptical, I get it. I was too. But I can tell you this: the day I pressed play, everything changed. What started as curiosity became the edge I’d been chasing for years. It gave me the focus to finish faster, the clarity to think bigger, and the confidence to move forward without hesitation.

And when you stack that day after day, week after week, the results compound. Looking back, I can draw a straight line between where I was stuck…and the moment things started moving forward. That line begins here.

At first, I thought it was just placebo. But the deeper I went, the more undeniable the shifts became. This wasn’t about “feeling good” for a few minutes. It was about real, measurable change in how I worked, thought, and showed up every day.

Here’s what happened when I committed:

The audio works on what I’d call a reset switch for the brain. You press play, close your eyes, and within minutes your thoughts slow down, your breathing evens out, and it feels like you’ve tuned into a different frequency. I’d come out of each session not just relaxed, but re-wired.

The first breakthrough was in my **focus**. Before, I’d sit at my desk, open my laptop, and instantly lose twenty minutes bouncing between tabs. With this, it was like blinders came on. I could lock into one task for hours, uninterrupted. My productivity doubled without adding a single extra ounce of effort.

Then came the **clarity**. That foggy, scattered feeling that used to drag me down started lifting. It was as if my mind finally had space to breathe. Problem-solving became sharper. Creative ideas that felt out of reach started flowing again. I didn’t have to “push” to think—I could just let thoughts come, and they did.

The third shift was **stress**. I used to carry tension like a backpack full of bricks—tight shoulders, racing thoughts, never able to switch off. After regular sessions, I felt a calm I couldn’t fake. That calm followed me into meetings, conversations, even tough decisions. It wasn’t just about being relaxed; it was about having a centered presence that people could feel.

And then there was **memory**. I noticed little things: remembering names, recalling details from meetings, staying sharp without notes. Over time, this became one of the biggest advantages. It gave me confidence. I could trust my mind to hold onto what mattered instead of letting it slip away.

All of this stacked into momentum I hadn’t experienced in years. More focus meant faster results. More clarity meant smarter moves. Less stress meant better energy. Better memory meant stronger impact. One area of life after another began leveling up because the foundation—my mental state—was finally optimized.

What struck me most is how simple it was. No complicated routines. No hours of practice. Just pressing play and letting it work. The hardest part wasn’t the process—it was believing that something this simple could actually shift everything.

Looking back now, it’s clear: this became my edge. The quiet, invisible advantage that no one else saw, but everyone felt. And the deeper I went, the more undeniable it became that this wasn’t just another tool—it was the missing link I’d been chasing all along.

**What exactly is Edison Wave?**  
It’s a short audio program designed to activate alpha brainwaves. In plain terms, it’s a soundtrack you listen to that helps you unlock focus, reduce stress, improve memory, and boost mental clarity without pills or stimulants.

**How long does it take to work?**  
For me, the shift was almost instant. Within the first session, I felt calmer and more focused. Most people notice results within minutes because the audio is designed to guide your brain into the alpha state quickly.

**How often should I use it?**  
I made it part of my daily routine—just once a day was enough. Some days I’d listen in the morning to set the tone, and other days I’d use it in the afternoon when I needed a productivity boost.

**Does Edison Wave really help with focus and memory?**  
Yes. My ability to concentrate for long stretches skyrocketed. And the little things—like recalling details, remembering conversations, and staying mentally sharp—became noticeable wins. It’s not magic; it’s science-backed brainwave entrainment.

**Can it reduce stress naturally?**  
Absolutely. One of the biggest shifts for me was stress relief. The constant mental tension eased, and I could step into challenges with a calm, centered mindset instead of feeling overwhelmed.

**Is it safe?**  
Yes. It’s non-invasive, drug-free, and doesn’t require any special equipment beyond headphones. It’s simply audio frequencies designed to sync with your brain’s natural rhythms.

**What makes Edison Wave different from other meditation or focus apps?**  
The difference is speed and effectiveness. Traditional meditation can take months to master. With Edison Wave, I just pressed play, and within minutes I was in the zone—no training, no trial and error.

**Is there a guarantee?**  
Yes. There’s a 365-day money-back guarantee, which gave me the confidence to try it. For me, it quickly became one of the most valuable tools I’ve ever invested in.",1,1759257014.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

I was recently invited for the Robinhood Gold card, but I don't see a use case when I have my Coinbase one card. Maybe I would get it if the Paypal Debit stops getting 5% back at Costco, but that is barely a benefit over the CFU 1.5x UR. Really wish Costco could just accept Amex.

Gas is an obvious gap but I drive an EV and my supercharging expense is incredibly low, almost all charging is done at home. Curious if there are any cards that fit a long-term strategy that I might not be familiar with.

Here’s what I’ve got (and how I use each):

# Core Cards

* **Amex Gold ($325 AF)** – 4× dining + 4× U.S. supermarkets (up to $25k/yr). Also stack $120 Uber, $120 dining, $100 Resy, $84 Dunkin.
* **Amex Platinum ($895 AF, +$195 AU for wife)** – 5× flights and prepaid Amex Travel hotels. Credits: $600 hotels (semiannual $300), $400 Resy, $300 Lululemon, $200 Oura, $200 airline incidental, $200 Uber, $100 Saks, $300 digital entertainment, CLEAR, Walmart+, Equinox. Lounges + trip protections. We probably use the lounge >20 times per year so it's very worth it even without the credits.
* **Coinbase One Amex (no AF, Coinbase One sub required)** – 4% back in BTC on all purchases up to $10k/mo, then 2%. Can sell immediately for fiat if I don’t want exposure. My catch-all for general spend. I already had coinbase one before this card came out so the subscription expense is moot.

# Chase Ecosystem

* **Chase Freedom Unlimited (no AF)** – 1.5× UR everywhere, 3× drugstores/dining, 5× travel portal. Pairs with CSP for Hyatt. Was my first card ever, and still get value out of it since I can transfer to my wife's CSP.
* **Chase Sapphire Preferred (wife, $95 AF)** – Enables UR transfers (esp. Hyatt), $50 hotel credit, free DashPass + $10/mo convenience, 10% anniversary bonus.

# Store & Niche Cards

* **REI Capital One (no AF, no FTF)** – 5% REI, 1.5% everywhere else. Only non-Amex card with no foreign transaction fee, so this is my abroad fallback. Also my only Capital One card which has allowed me to get some presale perks.
* **Alaska Atmos Rewards Ascent Visa (wife, $95 AF)** – Companion fare, free bag, Alaska Mileage Plan for Oneworld partner redemptions. 2 points per dollar on EV charging might be used. Considering cancelling if we don't get value out of the companion fare, but we're based in Seattle and Alaska goes a lot of places.
* **Amazon Store (no AF)** – 5% Amazon.

2. Yes you had projects in school. No they don’t each need their own paragraphs. Title of project, and impact/result. Group them together if you have a lot you want to showcase. We’ll ask about it in the interview. Chances are we have an idea of what you did just by the title.

3. STAR method for everything. Situation, Task, Action, Result. 
S: I saw a lot of posts for graduates asking for advice. 
T: I want to give them advice that is practical.
A: So I wrote a reddit post with quick and dirty tips.
R: Resulting in me getting downvoted to Valhalla.

4. *Edna Mode voice*: No intros!
At least not a paragraph. You and every other grad are enthusiastic about data and AI. At most if you have a passion (non-profit, specific industry niche) you can put at max a sentence as a subheader).

5. *Edna returns*: No Colors! 
Use the blandest most corporate template. Minimize use of fancy formatting features, they confuse some computer resume readers (and human ones too). Very few exceptions here, and those are very industry or even role specific. For 99% of jobs, boring is best. (No smaller than 10pt and even that is pushing it. 10.5pt font is my preferred limit)

6. Use sections. Education should come first as a recent grad. Then any work experience you have. 

7. You have 20 seconds of a recruiters time if it gets through the Matrix. Give your resume to a friend for 1 minute and then ask what they can recall about you. 

8. Network. 
Its a pain, it sucks, but it will get you a job. Go to industry events, LinkedIn, whatever. Key thing is to not be desperate, its just like dating. If you walk up to Tim Cook saying “gib me job”, you’re gonna be on the blacklist. Talk to people and learn about people. Ask if you can follow up for coffee.

well i’m 23 now and my heartburn/ chest pains have not been a problem for the last 4 or so years, i went back to drinking coffee, red sauces, everything, with no negative effects. 

but i think it’s coming back, for the last three days i’ve had insane chest pains after eating or drinking. i can recognize that good old chest and throat burn from anywhere. it gets worse and worse until i can hardly breathe and it genuinely feels like my throat is closing up. i know it sounds insane but my gerd had always been this intense. but i haven’t felt this pain in 4 years  and now that is coming back i feel it ruining my life all over again. i’m at work trying to differentiate between gerd and a heart attack in damn near tears because it’s been so long since i’ve felt this bad. 

i can’t remember any of my old tricks to alleviate the pain, how to eat or drink, how to not let it take over my life again. 

can anyone who has had their gerd leave and come back years later, and successfully managed to get rid of it again, please please please tell me what i need to do to feel better.",2,1759256432.0,GERD,3,0.76,False

I’m super confused about it all myself. I did the 2 hour glucose tolerance test (fasting was 5.2, 1 hour was 10.3, and 2 hr was 6.8) and on my online portal it says “in range.” My prenatal doctor called that same day and told me I have gestational diabetes and that she would refer me to the diabetic clinic. I started regularly testing my sugars, fasting first thing in the morning, before meals, 1 and 2 hours after each meal and before bed as requested. All my numbers have come back completely fine, never higher than 7 after meals. I even decided to have one last Starbucks coffee because it’s always been my little treat to myself so Sunday I got a venti caramel macchiato (42 grams of sugar!) and an hour later my sugar was 4.9. When I met with the diabetic clinic yesterday she said she couldn’t remove my diagnosis but didn’t think I had gestational diabetes after looking through all my records. So now I’m still being treated as though I have it, still have to record all my meals and sugars and attend the extra appointments. I’m almost 29 weeks and I know it can peak around the 32 week mark. Has anyone else had it where they were fine until then? I’m just wondering if maybe I should expect that my sugars will be harder to manage soon. My doctor also gave me a prescription for Metformin but the nurse at the diabetic clinic told me not to take that because I don’t need it but to keep it on hand in case things change.

My first roommates threw this at me years ago, basically said I must have been spoiled because I did a bad job of remembering to tidy up... but in reality it was the exact opposite of that. I grew up in a messy house, I was used to living in a cluttered space, I was used to people leaving cups on the coffee table and forgetting to put them in the dishwasher, putting keys and wallets on the kitchen table, etc etc... I grew up with people who weren't bothered by it, and neither was I. I honestly don't know if this is a thing other folks have heard, but when I was told I must have been spoiled because I was a messy person, I was so upset about the entitlement behind the assumption. Both of my parents were public school teachers and were incredibly busy, I had multiple siblings, we all were busy with sports and school, and no one was on our backs to keep the house tidy and cleaned... Whereas the people making the assumption/accusation DID have a stay at home parent who did the major cleaning tasks on a regular basis. 

Its been well over a decade since then, I've lived with a bunch of other people and learned to be better about keeping a clean house... I don't know why this hit me out of nowhere this morning, but it immediately made me upset.
