I'll start at the beginning:

About 8 years ago I was at a party and met there such a wonderful girl, we had a blast of a time together, danced, talked, laughed it was just great, I would say literally she turned my head. Before I had to go home I asked her about her phone number, so we could see again but she said no, she doesn't want this, which I respected like a gentleman, hugged goodbye and left.
Since we really had fun and everything I asked myself what the reason was, but like said, I respected her decision.
Time passed by and I talked to a friend about a tattoo I was planning to make. She said with this particular I should go to studio XY.
I googled and guess who's studio it was?!
Sooo somehow I never made an appointment with her. At the time I signed in for military service and later on I was in a very toxic relationship. (Wich is gladly over now)
And to be honest, yes I was in a relationship, but I thought every single day about this girl...
Now my old tattoo came in my mind again and I felt now is the time.
So i texted her on instagram about an appointment, and as soon she read my message she followed me and I mean yeah, we just texted about her business and I'm out of the game for too long, so maybe I make something up, but she texts things like ""hihihi"", tons of emojis and stuff and, well... I don't know.
Thats the story so far.
Now what I just want to ask her is:
Does she recognise me after all the years?!
Or am I completeley forgotten by her?
Also, the appointment is next year, there are months between... 
Should I ask her if we can get a coffee one day? Should I wait? Or should I just act like I don't know her? Should I mention anything?
Am I just a creep who's obsessed with a girl for so long for only spending one evening with her?! (I think this is the most important question)

I'm curious about your answers, and since english isn't my mother tongue I hope I didn't made up any misconseptions.

Oh and if you are the girl and somehow recognise me because of this post, please let me just act as if I'm dead.",1,1761675449.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Eve assumed everything would be okay. Eva assumed she needed to pray consistently to prepare for temptations. All throughout the day, at least once every ten minutes, Eva prayed:

‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation.‚Äù

She made it one of her top three priorities in life to ‚ÄúMake doing that a habit.‚Äù

Second, satan came slithering over, and he heard nothing coming from Eve's mouth. Her mind was on auto drive. She was open to suggestions. He explained to her how great the apple would be. She ate it. Disaster, destruction, the end of the era.

Third, Eva's habit is drinking. At the end of her work day she knew she had to go to a location right next to her old favorite club. As she drove closer and closer, she started praying her prayer over and over again.

Then, as the workday ended, the man she had her eye on came over to her.

‚ÄúDo you want to go next door and get a drink,‚Äù he asked.

She prayed again, ‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation,‚Äù continuing her habit.

‚ÄúI would love to get a drink, but I need to stay clear of anything hard right now. I am open to coffee, or a soft drink. Can we go to the place down the street?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be great,‚Äù he said.

Fourth, we need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù when temptation is about to rise up. We need to pray our prayers fanatically in those times.

Fifth, fast forward to the next day. Eva's date did not go well. As she was driving home, she was frustrated and depressed. Thoughts of going to the club were swirling in her mind. She began to pray her prayer, but the thoughts continued. She then began quoting her to quitting verses. She quoted them over, and over, and over again. After ten minutes of quoting key scriptures, it was like the Holy Spirit was right there with her. She now knew... she had the option to slip up, and she definitely had the option to say no!!!! Well... she wanted to say no, so she said no. She did not go.

Sixth, we need to have key verses about our habit memorized. When temptation overwhelms, we need to stamp it out with scriptures.

Seventh, when I get to heaven, I would love it if Eva would find me and say, ‚ÄúI searched ‚ÄúVerses drinking‚Äù so often on my phone, that it started auto filling the whole search even when I just put in the V.

Eighth, what if you were driving and were overwhelmed with temptation? What do you think God would think of you if you pulled your car into a parking lot to search for key scriptures when overwhelmed?

1oigxab,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CaterpillarSpare1212/comments/1oigxab/tell_me_what_you_eat/,Tell Me What You Eat,"It had been a week since the bear had left its den in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The sky in the east was flushed by rosy-colored dawn when the commanding animal let out a big yawn and began trotting downhill, towards Interstate 81. She knew she wasn‚Äôt supposed to be awake, but the winter had been mild, and pangs of hunger had interrupted her melancholy dreams. She knew all kinds of food were to be had down in the plain, close to where the sea of lights was just now beginning to ebb. She had made the trek twice before, once with her cubs, who had long since moved higher into the mountains. The hunting grounds she had in mind were unlike any others she used to prowl; when she finally reached their outskirts, it was beginning to snow. She held her nose into the wind and immediately picked up a scent.



Susan watched as the battered Corolla pulled into the sloping driveway. Rich, golden flakes drifted through the headlights, reminding her that it was still snowing. It would be much too dark for them to see her waving, but she did it anyway. ""A good hostess never misses an opportunity to oblige, even if some of her finer attempts at giving pleasure are bound to go unnoticed."" Now, where exactly had she read that? It must have been in one of those Southern magazines that sometimes absorbed her so completely that she could barely make any sense of them at all. Much later then, when she least expected it, some ominous passage would rise up in her mind, carrying in its wake some high-minded idea about how to be a better lover, mother, host, or a better woman altogether. The little lessons about motherhood felt particularly weird. After all, she and Win didn't even have kids.



As she watched the Corolla laboring against the incline, coughing up dirty bits of snow and rotten leaves, Susan remembered that moment from ‚Äì was it three years ago? ‚Äì when she had turned her husband into the creature from the swamp. At least that's how she phrased it whenever she permitted herself ‚Äì often against her better judgment ‚Äì to make a public performance of this, her favorite anecdote. Which, incidentally, happened quite often: at Sunday brunches; during coffee breaks in the lab; even, if only just once, at a bus stop, in the presence of strangers. ‚ÄúOne night,‚Äù she would say, lowering her voice to a bare whisper, ‚ÄúI turned my husband into the creature from the swamp.‚Äù It had happened a few winters ago. She and Win had just come back from some university event ‚Äì a reception for new faculty members, or something like that. The unpaved section of their little cul-de-sac had dissolved into mud, and before they knew it, they had found themselves stuck ‚Äì ""stuck,"" as Win had magisterially pointed out, ""in your own fucking driveway."" He seemed to think that getting stuck in one's own driveway was even more humiliating than getting stuck anywhere else.



Maybe if he hadn't been so angry, she would have simply let it go. But she had been driving, and she felt vaguely guilty about the whole damn thing. That's why, when Win got out to get some cardboard to place under the wheels, she had decided that the situation called for one more try. She was convinced that, stepping on the accelerator, she had actually started screaming ‚Äì out of frustration perhaps, or maybe to drown out the noise of the engine revving up. Incredibly, the car had started to move ‚Äì in fits, at first, but as she kept at it, it had suddenly jolted free. She had been so triumphant. Lowering the window, she was about to give a little victory speech when she caught sight of Win, cardboard still in hand, covered in mud from head to toe, treating her to a perfect Mona Lisa smile. Apparently, he had come up behind the car just moments before her great escape. Later he would claim that he had actually been struck by the fender, but Susan didn't think that was possible. He had simply been splattered with all the mud that her desperate attempt at getting unstuck had brought up. And now he was standing there, dripping wet, just like the creature from the swamp. It had really been a sight for the gods.



Clearly, her plan wasn‚Äôt working.



Win had just served the first course, a sort of bean pur√©e with orange and saffron, topped with caramelized Belgian endive. It was not a great dish ‚Äì the combination of flavors felt arbitrary, and the whole concoction had ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù written all over it. Susan noticed that Win was looking over to Rachel ‚Äì he called her ‚Äúthe animal lover‚Äù ‚Äì, waiting for some kind of acknowledgment. But how on earth was Rachel to know that Win ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do‚Äù vegetarian, that he hated the whole idea, that he would have never cooked for someone like her if Susan‚Äôs career hadn‚Äôt been on the line? When the small woman gave no sign that the food meant anything to her, Win‚Äôs face darkened, slowly settling into the sullen expression that Susan knew all too well. She had to look away.



Seated at her right-hand side, John kept a dull silence, his face as expressionless as ever. Wasn‚Äôt it astonishing that so many of her colleagues ‚Äì even those who could argue with grace and hold their own in packed lecture halls ‚Äì were so inept at talking about anything else than their research? What did that say about her, who prepared a list of possible conversation topics every time she had people over? Oh, damn them all. She would sit here, listlessly picking at her food like some sulky child, making herself at home in the deepening silence until it became all but intolerable. Just like them. They wouldn‚Äôt like that. They wouldn‚Äôt like that one bit.



Instead she said:



‚ÄúSo, John, Rachel tells me you have an entire room full of toy soldiers.‚Äù



He looked up, his eyes unalive.



‚ÄúWe actually prefer the term ‚Äòmodel figure.‚Äô‚Äù



‚ÄòHe must be retarded,‚Äô Susan thought. ‚ÄòHe must be autistic or something.‚Äô



‚ÄúWhat do you do with them?‚Äù



‚ÄúBull Run, Wilderness. That kind of stuff.‚Äù



It took her a second to comprehend. ‚ÄúYou reenact battles?‚Äù



Rachel chipped in, all mock indignation. ‚ÄúThe whole Civil War campaign,‚Äù she said, prolonging the ‚Äòo.‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd not just soldiers. Horses, wagons, tents, and what have you. Livestock, too. And prostitutes. Did you know there were prostitutes in the Civil War?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Susan tried to sound intrigued.



‚ÄúWell, there were. And he paints them all, with the tiniest brush. Don‚Äôt you, darling?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Civil War was not a campaign, my dear. Jackson‚Äôs Valley Campaign was a campaign. The Civil War was a war.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut you paint them, don‚Äôt you? With a tiny, tiny brush.‚Äù



John said nothing.



Susan was still wondering whether the situation needed defusing when Justin beat her to it. Justin was the fifth element ‚Äì an unobtrusive neighbor, and also Win‚Äôs best friend.



‚ÄúI once went to the Chancellorsville battlefield,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut couldn‚Äôt make any sense of it. I suppose it helps to have it all laid out in front of you.‚Äù



John nodded.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs there to be made sense of?‚Äù Susan wanted to know. Justin gave her a smile.



‚ÄúThe troop movements. The deployment of the various corps and regiments. Artillery positions. Terrain features: hills, rivers, and the like. Earthworks and entrenchments. Battle lines. Whether the flanks of the defending army are anchored, or not. Vulnerabilities, such as salients. Paths of reinforcement. General headquarters: good decisions, bad decisions. Bayonet charges ‚Äì not very common at that time, but still. Muskets versus rifles. The Spencer carbine. Gunboats, floating down the Mississippi. The Vicksburg campaign. Grant cutting loose from his supply train to envelop Vicksburg from the south. And then, of course, Gettysburg...‚Äù



He seemed to lose his thread. ‚ÄúYou know, that kind of stuff.‚Äù



Susan looked at John, questioningly. John shrugged his shoulders.



‚ÄúWhat he said,‚Äù he said.



Susan had to think of the monkeys in her laboratory.



She was still not convinced that she had done anything wrong. Maybe she had been sloppy labeling those videotapes, but she had simply been so tired. Months of teaching classes, writing grant proposals, conducting the experiment, and videoconferencing with her co-authors had left her in a state of near-insanity. When she finally got around to reviewing the videos, the article had already been written and submitted for publication. She had barely glanced at them, relying instead on her memory of the actual experiment. There was no doubt in her mind that her findings were accurate. And yet, it wasn‚Äôt long before two of her graduate students wrote her a letter stating that they saw ‚Äúlittle to no connection‚Äù between the content of the videos and their labeling. They called the labeling ‚Äúcapricious‚Äù ‚Äì those smug little rats. She couldn‚Äôt let that stand. Thus, the ugly scene in the graduate student lounge (of all places); the letter to the department head (John); the ridiculous claims of ‚Äúcoercion‚Äù and ‚Äúintimidation‚Äù; and, finally, the threat of an internal investigation into her data collecting and documentation methods.



How could she not have seen this coming?



Suddenly, everything was at stake: her reputation as a scholar, the good name of her field of research (animal cognition) ‚Äì even her tenure at this Southern university, bestowed upon her only recently, and only after the provost had intervened on her behalf. Even if found guilty only of sloppiness, her colleagues would lose confidence in her work, and everything she had ever done would be treated with suspicion. And then what? More investigations, stoic denials, frantic attempts at replication? Halting admissions, conciliatory mea culpas, paper retractions, and indefinite suspension? Impossible. Not after fighting an uphill battle for so long. She had to convince John that the investigation must never take place. But how to reason with a grown man who spent his spare time playing with toy soldiers?



‚ÄúSo John, do you ever ‚Ä¶ judge them? Your soldiers, I mean. Do you admire their courage, or blame them for their shortcomings? Or is it more like a game of chess, where every figure is expendable and can be sacrificed for the greater good?‚Äù



She smiled her most disarming smile.



John stared at her blankly, which only added to her sinking feeling.



‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt bite at that‚Ä¶,‚Äù she thought.



Once again, it was Justin who kept the ball rolling.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give offense,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut isn‚Äôt there something very human about it? War, I mean. About the way it transforms people? Take Grant, for example. Before the war broke out, Grant was a bum, pretty much. A failure. In his cups, more often than not. When he built a log cabin for his wife, she called it 'unattractive.' That would drive any man to drink now, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Justin laughed. ‚ÄúIt was the war that redeemed him. The war was his element.‚Äù

Nobody knew what to say. Rachel's revulsion was particularly plain. She looked down into her lap and began folding her napkin.



Finally, Win got up and started collecting their plates.



""Bullshit,"" he said. Clearly, his mood hadn't improved. ""So you're... what? A fucking war hero? Great. Good for you. But it's not because you have this ‚Äì this secret inner strength, this..."" He scooped up the butter dish, whose contents had turned yellow, glistening, and slightly runny. ""That nobody knows about. Because you don't. That's not who you are. What you are, is, you know, a fucking mess. A mess. You're always at war ‚Äì with God, with yourself, with everything around you. That's why you succeed at war. Because you're always at war.""

And with that, he withdrew into the kitchen.



The kitchen was gorgeous ‚Äì a wide-open U dotted by a massive island. Win was busy handling an artichoke, trimming the scales with a pair of kitchen shears.

‚ÄúArtichokes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always hated artichokes. I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs like chewing on wood. Did you know that dentures used to be made of wood? It‚Äôs disgusting. I always imagine them rotten, somehow, like those rotten tree stumps you sometimes see out in the country. Saturated with saliva. Mushrooms growing on them. It‚Äôs like having a whole fucking decomposing forest in your mouth. It‚Äôs making me sick, is what it does.‚Äù



Justin, who had gone after his friend, was sniffing the bluish-black contents of an aluminum bowl. Win grabbed the bowl and set it back on the counter. ""Chile ancho,"" he said. ""I'm making Paella. With artichokes, god damn it. Of all things. Just because that lady yonder has no stomach for meat. Marriage really changes you, my friend, it really does.""

Justin lifted a small burlap sack and weighed it in his hand. On the label was a happy-looking man wearing a poncho. ""Arroz bomba,"" it said. This time, Win didn't intervene and kept on talking.



""Don't you give me that sympathetic kind of look, as if you knew what I'm talking about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause you don't. I'm not giving you some can't-live-with-them-can't-live-without-them bullshit here. This is serious. Let me give you an example. I've lived in big cities before. New York, New Orleans... That's where we met, Susan and I, did you know that? In New Orleans. We were both students at Tulane at the time. I had a car, and she didn't. I would drive her around town. I had no trouble finding my way around town back then, no trouble at all. Never had to think twice, back then, about that great American river and its serpentine course around the Garden District. That great river guided me well, my friend. But then we moved up here, and everything changed. All of a sudden, I couldn't even make it to the grocery store. Let's go shopping, she says. OK, I say, let's go shopping. The moment she gets into the passenger seat, my mind goes, boom. Blank. Slack. Sapped of all energy. I'm talking all-out, stage-four tabula rasa. I could just as easily sit there drooling. I have to take directions from her like some kind of mule. You see, I simply can't think straight when she is around. It's hard to explain. I know it's not her fault. Maybe it's because we moved here for her sake, when they offered her that great position in the animal lab. I know it was the right thing to do. She would have done the same thing for me. But I'm hurting out here, man, I really am. I keep wondering, where did I go wrong? Where the hell did I go wrong? ‚Äì Would you pass me the rice?‚Äù



Justin gave it to him.



‚ÄúI suppose I should just get over it. Move on, put it out of my mind. Whatever 'it' is. But here's the thing: I can't get over it. In fact ‚Äì now, listen very carefully ‚Äì I'm getting less and less over it.‚Äù



Win started pressing the artichokes into the rice, which was itself submerged in the dark-colored liquid that Justin had examined earlier.



‚ÄúWait here,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI have to take out the trash.‚Äù



The mixture inside the pan smelled rich and smoky and was slowly beginning to bubble.



When Susan looked up, she saw Win standing behind John‚Äôs chair, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. She recognized the old, oversized winter coat that he had worn that fateful night when she had splattered him with mud. Frequently relegated to the Salvation Army bin, the coat had just as frequently made it back into her husband‚Äôs closet, mud stains and all. (He had refused to have it cleaned.) Now he was wearing it, proudly it seemed, while the boyish expression on his face told her that he was burning to get something off his chest. But John, oblivious of the other man's presence, was for once engaged in a lively conversation with his wife. That was so Win, she thought ‚Äì always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Never afraid of making a fool of himself.



The scene reminded her of something she had witnessed about a year ago, at a conference on animal altruism. The keynote speaker, an expert in primate social behavior, had been impressed with one of Susan‚Äôs graduate students, even inviting her to spend a year with him and his research team up north. At the end of the day, the student ‚Äì one of those, incidentally, who would later accuse Susan of academic fraud ‚Äì apparently felt she couldn‚Äôt take her leave without the blessings of her new benefactor. By that time, the conference had moved on into the faculty dining hall, a neo-Gothic nave whose stained glass windows depicted the Stations of the Cross. The student, one of those pretty yet awkward wallflowers that often blossom in all-male environments, was wearing an enormous raincoat that completely obscured her figure. She approached the keynote speaker‚Äôs seat from behind, waiting for him to turn so she could say her goodbyes. Unluckily for her, the jovial old man was busy telling an anecdote, flushed with excitement, celebrating his position as a grizzled patriarch in this pack of academics. He kept talking and talking, encouraged by a humble audience spellbound by his booming voice, his roaring laughter, his curious tick of tapping his chest whenever his story took yet another unexpected turn. The student kept waiting, hands behind her back, a dark, shapeless silhouette in a radiant room, a center of stillness in the constant ebb and flow of voices, shuffling feet and clinking wine glasses, trapped like a fly in amber, unable to leave quietly now that she had been spotted from the other end of the table, while the man who could mean so much for her, for her career, for her future life as she envisioned it slowly scaled the heights of his never-ending story, lazily approaching the climax ‚Äì



Susan felt sorry for her. But what really stayed with her, afterwards, was the strangely portentous nature of the scene, the image of a somber, ominous figure entering the orbit of a man so fully, splendidly, dizzyingly in the midst of life. 'Death and the Maiden,' she thought, 'only in reverse.' And now, Win was acting the very same part behind John, John the Redeemer, John the Sphinx, the man who would decide her fate. How did that make her feel? Well, one thing was for sure: she refused to sacrifice herself simply because the men in her life decided to have themselves a little charade. If one of them were to fall, she wouldn‚Äôt intervene. She wouldn‚Äôt cover for them. And if she was to go, she wouldn‚Äôt beg. She was a darkness in her own right, simple, perfect, and serene. Maybe Win was right when he called her ‚Äúlittle death.‚Äù Win, who now, finally, had found an opening to say what he had to say. There was a brief moment of silence when all eyes were on him, John having been made aware of the looming presence in his back. Even someone like Win couldn‚Äôt miss this opportunity. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bear on the front porch,‚Äù he said.



The bear had expertly removed the lid from the outdoor garbage can and was now gorging itself on a mush of meat and bones, in which Susan recognized the discarded solids of Win‚Äôs homemade chicken stock. Having claimed the veranda by marking one of the porch posts upon its arrival, it took little heed of the small group of spectators that had filed into the adjacent winter garden. Susan watched in silence as the bear momentarily raised its head, questioningly, perhaps waiting for its own heartbeat to slowly make its way through the intensive stillness of its thick-set body. When it went back to cracking bones, she felt closer to it than she had ever felt to any other living being. For a moment, she was seeing through the eyes of this great predator, who had roamed the American wild since the beginning of time. Turning towards John, she felt the urge to lick the wet patches that the melting snow had left in her thick, tangled fur. Tomorrow, she would go to him and, if necessary, offer her resignation. After tonight, there would be no harm in doing so. Because tonight, she had understood, once and for all, that she was a huntress stalking her prey.",1,1761675201.0,u_CaterpillarSpare1212,0,1.0,False

I left a fifteen-year relationship a couple years ago, where I had been partnered with an extremely introverted man who did not use social media at all and who pretty much didn't go out unless I was with him. 

I started dating ""Jason"" about eight months ago via Tinder, who is extroverted and very active on social media. We're in an odd place relationship-wise because we both are really busy in our careers and have different plans for our lives so we aren't ""officially"" a couple, but we agreed to be exclusive with each other in July while we try to figure things out and see each other a couple days a week.  Jason has tons of friends, many of whom are women, which I usually see as a green flag in men. But then there's ""Tessa.""

I've never met Tessa, but I have met some of Jason's other female friends, and I've seen them posted on his social media when they go out and I get nothing but good vibes.  But Tessa really bothers me. 

She sends him multi-minute voicenotes every day talking about how her day is going (which he has played in my presence while saying he's ""not listening to all that""). She is constantly texting/calling him. When I first became aware of her, it was because of this behavior and my initial anxiety was that she was actually his girlfriend, and he swore up and down that she's ""needy"" and ""neurodivergent"" and comes off as clingy.

Every time they hang out Tessa will post multiple selfies with him with captions like ""I don't know what I'd do w/o this guy!"" or ""he's my shadow, where I am, so is he!"" or ""look at my emotional support bestie!"" and then he'll repost these selfies anytime he's tagged in them. 

Things came to a head for me over the weekend when Jason told me he and Tessa were going to a restaurant Jason had mentioned wanting to take me to the week before. I made a comment about him taking her on my date and he said something about how we can also go if it's good. The next morning he had reposted her posts about how great the dinner/his company was, but also a post of the two of them of walking to coffee together the next day. 

I texted him telling him that to me it looks like he had Tessa overnight and that it felt hurtful to me. He is adamant that she went home the night before, and that she goes to a gym near him and went to get coffee with him after her workout. He swore up and down that they aren't dating and have never been a couple. 

Again, my previous partner was so intoverted that I've maybe lost touch of what is ""typical"" these days, but I feel really uncomfortale with Tessa's interactions to the point that I feel like walking away because I hate feeling like this. AIO?",1,1761675187.0,u_Plane_Needleworker37,0,1.0,False

Eve assumed everything would be okay. Eva assumed she needed to pray consistently to prepare for temptations. All throughout the day, at least once every ten minutes, Eva prayed:

‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation.‚Äù

She made it one of her top three priorities in life to ‚ÄúMake doing that a habit.‚Äù

Second, satan came slithering over, and he heard nothing coming from Eve's mouth. Her mind was on auto drive. She was open to suggestions. He explained to her how great the apple would be. She ate it. Disaster, destruction, the end of the era.

Third, Eva's habit is drinking. At the end of her work day she knew she had to go to a location right next to her old favorite club. As she drove closer and closer, she started praying her prayer over and over again.

Then, as the workday ended, the man she had her eye on came over to her.

‚ÄúDo you want to go next door and get a drink,‚Äù he asked.

She prayed again, ‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation,‚Äù continuing her habit.

‚ÄúI would love to get a drink, but I need to stay clear of anything hard right now. I am open to coffee, or a soft drink. Can we go to the place down the street?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be great,‚Äù he said.

Fourth, we need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù when temptation is about to rise up. We need to pray our prayers fanatically in those times.

Fifth, fast forward to the next day. Eva's date did not go well. As she was driving home, she was frustrated and depressed. Thoughts of going to the club were swirling in her mind. She began to pray her prayer, but the thoughts continued. She then began quoting her to quitting verses. She quoted them over, and over, and over again. After ten minutes of quoting key scriptures, it was like the Holy Spirit was right there with her. She now knew... she had the option to slip up, and she definitely had the option to say no!!!! Well... she wanted to say no, so she said no. She did not go.

Sixth, we need to have key verses about our habit memorized. When temptation overwhelms, we need to stamp it out with scriptures. Consider searching, ‚ÄúVerses \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.‚Äù Fill in the blank with your habit. In my searches, I look for Open Bible which often has the top 100 verses for our habits.

Seventh, when I get to heaven, I would love it if Eva would find me and say, ‚ÄúI searched ‚ÄúVerses drinking‚Äù so often on my phone, that it started auto filling the whole search even when I just put in the V.

Eighth, what if you were driving and were overwhelmed with temptation? What do you think God would think of you if you pulled your car into a parking lot to search for key scriptures when overwhelmed?

I think that God would send His Holy Spirit to give you a full option to say ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Finally, consider working on these habits as often as possible. The more you work on them, the more you will think about ‚ÄúNew habits‚Äù instead of the old one.",1,1761675165.0,QuitHabitsChristian,0,1.0,False

1oigq61,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oigq61/the_birthday_funeral/,The Birthday Funeral,"Six years have passed, but every November feels like walking through fog. My birthday comes, and with it, a dull ache that never quite leaves.

When Grandma died, I thought the hardest part would be saying goodbye. But then Aunt announced the funeral date ‚Äî my birthday. I remember the silence that fell over the room, the quick glances no one wanted to meet. I said nothing, because what could I say? It felt selfish to protest, even though a part of me screamed inside.

That day, people hugged me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù meaning for Grandma, not for me. I stood in black clothes instead of a birthday dress. The smell of lilies and coffee replaced cake and candles. No one said ‚ÄúHappy Birthday.‚Äù I told myself it didn‚Äôt matter. I told myself funerals couldn‚Äôt wait. But somewhere deep down, a small part of me‚Äîchildish, hurt‚Äîbegan to associate celebration with loss.

Every year since, my birthday arrives with two shadows: grief and guilt. I try to reclaim it ‚Äî dinner with friends, a quiet walk, a cake with too many candles ‚Äî but there‚Äôs always a moment when I drift back to that church pew, listening to hymns instead of laughter.

I‚Äôve realized my grief became complicated not just because Grandma died, but because the timing blurred the boundaries between mourning and living. I never had space to separate them. Part of me still blames my aunt, though I know she didn‚Äôt mean harm. She was grieving too, trying to hold the family together.

This year, I lit a candle for Grandma in the morning, and in the evening, I lit another one for myself. Two flames side by side ‚Äî one for remembrance, one for reclaiming. It felt like permission. Permission to miss her, and permission to still celebrate that I‚Äôm here.

Maybe healing isn‚Äôt about untangling the two days anymore, but learning how to let them coexist.",1,1761674755.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1oigpi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1oigpi8/advice_but_also_maybe_just_venting/,Advice  but also maybe just venting,"TLDR: my partner snaps at me when she is stressed / overwhelmed and I need advice - we talk it out but it keeps happening 

Basically, when my partner is overworked or very tired she snaps at me about little things, we have talked about it so many times that she can tell from my face then playing back her own words that I am upset by what she just said. She apologises, I need a minute, sometimes we talk it out right away sometimes we talk it out a bit later (ie: we are leaving for work) but I feel like we keep get caught in this loop of reactively talking about this instead of proactively talking about what is stressing her so I understand and can maybe be supportive in some way (making the coffee, taking out the dog, hanging out the laundry, etc). Any suggestions on better ways to address this that will encourage her besides going around in the same circle of ""please let me know when you are feeling overwhelmed so I can try and be there for you"". 

  
I have directly addressed the snapping/tone multiple times now. For the record, our relationship is otherwise strong and when we talk things out we both listen. Even though I am the one hurt I listen to her and I am imperfect. I just struggle with the fact I went through a rough two months personally and unfortunately was very bad about snapping at her. She lost it one night and would barely speak to me, comparing me to past bad exes and saying she wants to figure a way through this but she can't let it become a habit. And I was so scared (frankly) that I shaped up, thought before I spoke, and sought out my therapist (much to my wallet's demise) a TON so that I could figure out why I was defaulting to snapping/getting agitated at her when she did nothing wrong / I was placing ridiculous levels of anger about my life on a small thing she had done. 

  
I guess what I want to know is what the public opinion is here, and moreover, how do I get her to actually make a change... it makes me really sad to get snapped at and draws out past triggers from exes and family members that used me as a punching bag. I've explained all of this to her, but she doesn't see her actions that way, and always says ""I'm sorry, but know I am never mad at you I'm mad at my (\_\_\_) situation."" That is exactly using me as a punching bag, isn't? 

Anyways, I'm trying to figure out if we just go to counselling or if there is another way to address this?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oigh6t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oigh6t,Captivating characters wasted in a 5/10 plot [From a Knight to a Lady],"[REPOSTING]

I've just binged From Knight to lady and, as the title implies, I think it's such a shame that characters this interesting, with captivating dynamics had to be wasted in a poor plot like this one.

**Let me start with the positive point:**

The main leads chemistry is phenomenal. They've tension, banter, mutual understanding. They're funny! Everything that makes up a captivating couple and I love this story for that. If I read this much, it's definitely because of them.

I specially appreciate how be acknowledges her capabilities despite still wanting to protect her. He doesn't see her as a fragile vase and doesn't treat her as a fool who can't take her own decisions.

Tbh he did that in the beginning, but she ate him with black coffee and he apologised.

Anyways, it's a nice and healthy enemies to lovers development and I like that.

Another great quality of this work is the female friendships: OH BOY HOW I LOVE HER FRIENDSHIP WITH LADY LOERüò≠üò≠ they're the cutest ship I swear.

I love the growing sorority from a woman who was once free of the social chains, but so locked up in her own prejudices that she, herself, didn't realise how women high society were struggling as well and they aren't cowards for being unable to break free from the system.

This was GOLD.

*One line of appreciation to the 2nd prince who's everywhere and somehow knows everything. He's an entity, I swear.*

**Now the roastingüçñ**

The plot is weak, the villains aren't even one dimensional, that would still mean they have one well built trait of personality. They don't.

The crown prince's only emotion is anger. The red haired lady hate her for no reason at all and would put her own position at risk for trying to harm this one girl from which she would have NOTHING to win. Plain stupid.

Khalid's only goal in life is being an yandere. He doesn't want anything else other than the fl, which makes one wonder why would he kill her in the first place if he loved her so badly?

To end the war? Oh please, is she a knight or the superman? As good as she might have been, she was just a poor commoner, take her sword away and she wouldn't even have the money to buy another. How killing someone like this is enough to stop the wat, not killing the damn king?

If he hated his ruler so much, he himself could have killed him and ascent to the throne.

And the possibilities are infinite! Not to talk about how he killed her BEFORE even trying to convince her. His characters is full of flaws and this plot is full of holes.

Even Zed should have killed her when she was in prison. He was merciless, kept chit chatting with the enemy instead of killing her? Stupid. Not him, the plot.

Finally, while I love this story's takes on society and women rights, I DESPISE how they treat war.

It's an awful representation of war, yes our rulers are bad, so why not just lose our independence instead? Makes me wonder: did the author skip history lessons? Did they forget what a foreigner occupation looks like living in KOREA of all places?

There's no such a thing as good wars. No such things as wars where only militaries are harmed, no such a thing as honour and digno for defeated women. It's well recorded in history what happens to women from a defeated country, specially one as sexist as that.

I don't want to make this a gore post, but you know what I'm talking about.

Not to mention how the women of (I forgot the country's name) would eventually lose their rights after the conquest. Zed himself mentions it in passing.

HOW IS THIS POSITIVE?

I don't have the time to discuss more on it now, so let me get to the last point. SPOILERS AHEAD:

SHE LET KHALID LIVE so her knight friends who have already killed thousands of people wouldn't dirt their hands with blood!! Are you fucking kidding me? What did dhe think, that he would sit and watch while she's happy with Zed??

That's when I decided to drop it (ch 135) before I started hating the female lead too.

I have more to talk about it, but I have to get ready to work, so let's discuss in the comments ü´∂üèΩ

1oigg23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1oigg23/aio_for_using_my_husbands_cup_before_he_was_done/,AIO for using my husband‚Äôs cup before he was done with it?,"I spit a piece of cucumber into an empty cup because my daughter drooled all over it and I could tell the second I took a bite. It was gross, I was going to gag, so I reactively spit it out into a cup sitting on the table. I was planning on standing up immediately afterwards, throwing the bite of cucumber away and rinsing out the cup. 

My husband snatched the cup up before I could even think about my next action, slammed it on the table, stood up abruptly and started saying things like ‚Äúwhat the fuck dude are you kidding me?‚Äù He started in on me from the kitchen about how he was still using the cup and was raising his voice about it- not talking to me maturely whatsoever, just throwing a fucking fit over this stupid fucking cup. We got into it and it ended with me really emphasizing not to speak to me that way and then walking away, because he was still trying to argue his point. I needed to remove myself because I started getting angry and I‚Äôm still learning how to regulate myself with intense feelings.

This morning he also woke me up to ask me if I smoked all of our weed and didn‚Äôt believe me at first (I honestly didn‚Äôt), criticized me for having doors and windows open (I‚Äôm ‚Äúletting the heat out‚Äù yet he is partially driving up the electricity bill because he never turns ANYTHING off). Made a comment about my breakfast habits (out of concern, but still). I have only been awake for 2 hours as I type this. 

He leaves dishes and his shit EVERYWHERE for me to seek out and wash myself. I have told him to pick up after himself multiple times, and he only does when I start to freak out because I can‚Äôt keep up with the house. It is nowhere near unreasonable for me to assume the cup sitting on the coffee table today, identical to all of our other cups, was not actively in use.

He and I have a child, he‚Äôs seen me do worse things than spitting a bite of cucumber out of my mouth. I really didn‚Äôt think this was a big deal- it‚Äôs not our one and only cup and his was completely empty. I hadn‚Äôt seen him drink out of it at all.

Am I overreacting because I‚Äôm not interested in having any kind of interaction with him moving forward this afternoon? I don‚Äôt even care for an apology. Aside from this fuckass cup issue he never yells at me, is HE overreacting? Are we BOTH? wtf even happened here? Like I feel crazy that we got into an actual fight over one of our 20 identical plastic cups. That‚Äôs crazy, right?? ",4,1761674147.0,AIO,4,1.0,False
1oigfsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SessionSkateSim/comments/1oigfsk/searching_final_end_of_all_knowledges_here_is_the/,"searching final end of all knowledges ? here is the ultimate perfection of life, by Nisidhyamanah","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761674129.0,SessionSkateSim,3,1.0,False

1 week ago, I started to get discomfort right under my breast bone. Gastric surgeon put in referral for gallbladder u/s.

Before I could make an appt, the following happened over the weekend:

Right before bed, I became extremely dizzy and shaky

I made a protein shake using zero protein, full fat fairlife milk, decaf instant coffee, and Splenda

Within 10 minutes of sipping on the shake, I started getting extreme stomach cramps in waves. These were relieved some by passing gas.

About 5 minutes later, I began vomiting uncontrollably. This lasted about 10 minutes and was further accompanied by severe intestinal cramping.

I also became extremely congested/ runny nose and started wheezing. I needed to use my rescue inhaler to open my airways.

Shortly after, I broke out in hives and began itching. The itching was most severe on my palms and soles, and on my torso. 

I took 2 Benadryl

The vomiting continued in waves and my stomach cramps culminated in about 15 minutes of uninterrupted diarrhea.

At the end of this episode, I was extremely flushed and sweaty. Stomach cramps went from 10/10 to about 4/10 at this time

At the ER, I was given fluids and got labs. Bilirubin, ketones, and protein were all elevated.

WBC was high, Gran# was high, Gran% was high, and Lymph% was low.

They confirmed gallstones with u/s.

The Dr suggested that the vomiting and diarrhea may be related to pregnancy *and/or* gallstones. He seemed to suggest that pregnancy exacerbated my gallstone symptoms. He had no explanation for the hives, itching or congestion.

I‚Äôve contacted my surgeon and OB but wasn‚Äôt able to secure an appt with either until later in the week.

I tell him, apologetically, ‚ÄúHey, sorry, your card got declined.‚Äù He looks confused, tries again. Same thing. He checks his banking app, balance looks fine. Third attempt, same issue.

He sighs, pulls out cash instead, and leaves. Two minutes later, the payment terminal reconnects to Wi-Fi and processes all three charges.

The dude was charged $27 for one coffee and a muffin. I spent the next hour trying to track him down using security footage and receipt timestamps like I was solving a crime. Luckily, he came back, and I refunded him but now my boss calls me ‚ÄúDecline McSwipeface.‚Äù

Nessie- buttery shortbread on opening, joined by the steam of black tea and heather. The shortbread and heather are dominant. A whiff of what I assume is the lake water note comes through about 20 mins in.. it‚Äôs like humidity or dew to my nose. Like a lakeside tea & shortbread picnic after it‚Äôs rained endlessly. The peat smoke after it‚Äôs dried and settled is my favorite part, which was a surprise to me. Like a damp, mossy green fire. Lingering scent is mostly shortbread and heather. Interesting and well executed, but not for me (6.5/10)


Solar Witch - love the opening of this one. A hint of coffee & apple cider donut, a rush of crisp autumn air. Like walking down a street in fall and passing someone enjoying a cup of coffee and an apple cider donut. There‚Äôs a stand on the corner selling a ton of sunflowers, and someone further down the street has lit a fire. It‚Äôs not too earthy, too gourmand or too floral for the first half hour or so, but sits somewhere between all 3. Dry down is a pretty fall woodsy floral with a hint of the donut lingering. I wish the coffee and crisp autumn air lasted a little longer. The lingering scent is mostly sunflower to my nose. Probably won‚Äôt FS though I do like it! (7/10)


Black Cat Cuddles - ooo the opening of this one is interestingggg. I get sweet coconut milk with a little clove at first, then the pepper & incense dusted fur come in. The dusting of incense is literal - it‚Äôs so softly done it‚Äôs beautiful. There‚Äôs just the faintest whisper of cinnamon and the black vanilla bean plays peekaboo- I catch whiffs of it but sometimes it hides behind the other notes. Finally, a breeze of pine from faraway. I think this one is perfect for winter instead of Halloween and will probably FS. It‚Äôs so pretty, but in an interesting way. It reminds me of my pre-Christmas bake sessions at my mom‚Äôs. Her favorite Christmas candle is burning and she‚Äôs heating sweet condensed milk on the stove for one of her creations- a whiff of spice and vanilla bean in the air. This would be a daily driver in winter for me if it were in EDP form! As it is, it‚Äôs beautifully blended. Slightly milky, slightly sweet, slightly wintry with the pine and incense-dusted fur. Cozy and yummy, I love it. It is definitely more of a skin scent though but in the soft, ethereal way not in the disappointing way! (10/10)
Update: I applied more generously on second sampling to see if that helped with projection and made it less skin-scent. It does a little! But overall, I think this scent is just meant to be worn close. Like black cat cuddles üòù


Jersey Devil - opening leaned a little masculine for my tastes - heavy on the pine, cedar and pine needles. As it starts to dry it softens a bit and I get the dragons blood incense and moss. Then a faint air of black tea starts to come through. Like I‚Äôve got a hot cup in my hand, steam wafting up, walking through the forest. Once completely dry I get some of that coastal mist and the forest fades to the background. I quite like the dry down and lingering scent - like you‚Äôre cliffside with a forest at your back- well done, but it‚Äôs not one I‚Äôd reach for often. More projection to this one than Black Cat Cuddles, a little less than Solar Witch (7/10)

Eve assumed everything would be okay. Eva assumed she needed to pray consistently to prepare for temptations. All throughout the day, at least once every ten minutes, Eva prayed:

‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation.‚Äù

She made it one of her top three priorities in life to ‚ÄúMake doing that a habit.‚Äù

Second, satan came slithering over, and he heard nothing coming from Eve's mouth. Her mind was on auto drive. She was open to suggestions. He explained to her how great the apple would be. She ate it. Disaster, destruction, the end of the era.

Third, Eva's habit is drinking. At the end of her work day she knew she had to go to a location right next to her old favorite club. As she drove closer and closer, she started praying her prayer over and over again.

Then, as the workday ended, the man she had her eye on came over to her.

‚ÄúDo you want to go next door and get a drink,‚Äù he asked.

She prayed again, ‚ÄúFather, keep me from temptation,‚Äù continuing her habit.

‚ÄúI would love to get a drink, but I need to stay clear of anything hard right now. I am open to coffee, or a soft drink. Can we go to the place down the street?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be great,‚Äù he said.

Fourth, we need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù when temptation is about to rise up. We need to pray our prayers fanatically in those times.

Fifth, fast forward to the next day. Eva's date did not go well. As she was driving home, she was frustrated and depressed. Thoughts of going to the club were swirling in her mind. She began to pray her prayer, but the thoughts continued. She then began quoting her to quitting verses. She quoted them over, and over, and over again. After ten minutes of quoting key scriptures, it was like the Holy Spirit was right there with her. She now knew... she had the option to slip up, and she definitely had the option to say no!!!! Well... she wanted to say no, so she said no. She did not go.

Sixth, we need to have key verses about our habit memorized. When temptation overwhelms, we need to stamp it out with scriptures. Consider searching, ‚ÄúVerses \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.‚Äù Fill in the blank with your habit. In my searches, I look for Open Bible which often has the top 100 verses for our habits.

Seventh, when I get to heaven, I would love it if Eva would find me and say, ‚ÄúI searched ‚ÄúVerses drinking‚Äù so often on my phone, that it started auto filling the whole search even when I just put in the V.

Eighth, what if you were driving and were overwhelmed with temptation? What do you think God would think of you if you pulled your car into a parking lot to search for key scriptures when overwhelmed?

I think that God would send His Holy Spirit to give you a full option to say ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I think Blake will challenge Magnus to a 1v1 under orders from Ragnar and make a wall of flames to keep out anyone who tries to interfere. At a certain point though, he will probably snap from Magnus saying a bunch of stupid shit and then reveal stuff about Ragnar. That being that Ragnar's plan is for Magnus to kill him, but he needs to be powerful enough first. Blake would then proceed to say something like, ""I'm tired of working under that idiot, I let you escape under Ragnar's orders all those years ago, I don't care anymore, I'll kill you and then die facing Ragnar."" Should give the NPCs time to avoid being within a fireball blast radius or for Kai to deal with any blue blood syringe.

**November**

November's fruit is really good. In addition to offense, he has a lot of mobility. He can fly and control the speed of ships. If Branch 101 was going to attack him, they would have to make sure that he couldn't escape. Other than that, Damian might try to kill him more than Kai because November did cross him and use his armor for bad purposes.

Clementine would probably face them within the territory, where she would have more backup. Also probably pools of coffee to use. She will be crying because of the way her life went.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm looking for a machine that can make coffee, espresso and lattes. Iced coffee/cold brew would be a bonus if it's possible for the price point. I want a machine that handles everything for me, with only adjustments for slight preference changes. I think this essentially refers to the term superautomatic, which I didn't realize till today until I found this subreddit. I don't want to pack coffee grounds, or grind them myself every time I want a coffee. I want to go hit a button or two and have my drink shortly after.

I was originally looking at a breville barista, but that was before I learned about superautomatics. I was turned off by this machine because the community felt that the built in grinder sucks. They said to just get a breville without a grinder and buy a separate $400 grinder. I don't want to do that. I want a machine that is all in one and all the parts are quality.

Usually subreddits have a post for ""the best machine at every price point"", and I think that's essentially what I'm looking for, but I didn't see one pinned anywhere.

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch ‚Äî he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn‚Äôt waste time with friends; when he‚Äôs not at the office or out working, he‚Äôs home with us, but he‚Äôs either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. And we were fighting one evening because he spankd our toddler. He was having a meeting with his subordinates and our son kept pulling his arm to give him milk from the fridge. Husband kept pushing him away and told him he is busy. My kid started crying, husband had to mute his mic and his image for him is everything and he said that because of this, he looked bad. And he spankd him. However he says he did not push him to the floor. It was a tantrum

And we had an argument one night and he wanted to become intimate with me after it to make up and I didnt want and he kinda forced himself on me. He did not go until the end, he let me go though when I started screaming. He said he was not aware I dont want.",1,1761672101.0,Marriage,4,0.67,False

This is my first post here after becoming absolutely obsessed with making espresso at home in the past year. I have been an avid researcher in this community and feel like I am at a point where there is so much mixed information on the best prosumer espresso machine I need direct answers.

My set up is currently the Bambino Plus + Baratza Encore Esp. It has been great to get into this hobby, but I have been very frustrated with dialing in. It just is so unforgiving and has made the process of dialing in extremley unenjoyable\*\*. I am looking for a set up that is high quality, forgiving, and preferably aesthetic (after all I will be looking at it every day).\*\*

I just ordered a **Eureka Mignon Libra**, but I am truly stuck on which espresso machine to buy. I keep landing on the **LELIT Bianca** as it seems to have the most consistent positive reviews for my price range.

**Is it worth it to spend more to on my first upgrade, or do I just commit and buy the LELIT? Is there a better option around the same price point?** I am open to different options, I have never upgraded before and am in decision paralysis!

My dream is of course the Linea Marzocco Mini, but as it is my first upgrade + a very expensive machine, I am assuming that would be overkill and not necessary.

EDIT: I feel it is important to note I am a grad student and truly do this as a hobby and love for making new coffees. I am by no means an espresso nerd or coffee snob (although I'd love to be). I typically make lattes, but would love to be able to make espressos that are enjoyable on their own as I feel like I haven't been able to with my current set up.",1,1761671573.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm also trying to gain weight while quitting and throwing up feels very defeating for me. I know for a majority people are more concerned about weight gain than weight loss but I just want to keep some food down and coffee n sugar tastes like literal poison right now too.

1oif9uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oif9uy/how_deep_work_made_me_realize_i_wasnt_tired_from/,How ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù made me realize I wasn‚Äôt tired from working too much - I was tired from never truly focusing.,"for years, i thought i was exhausted because i worked too hard.
turns out, i was just constantly half-working - never really present, never fully off.
notifications , messages, little dopamine hits from social media‚Ä¶ my brain was always scattered.

then i read **Deep Work by Cal Newport.**
and i don‚Äôt say this lightly - it changed how i see effort, attention, and even meaning itself.




**üí≠ the idea that hit me**

> ‚ÄúSpend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.‚Äù



we think distraction just wastes a few minutes.
but Newport shows it‚Äôs deeper - every time you give in to a notification or tab-hop mid-task, you train your brain to crave distraction.
your focus muscle literally atrophies.

that realization hurt - because it explained why my mind felt so tired even when i didn‚Äôt do much.
i wasn‚Äôt overworked, i was overstimulated.




** what deep work actually means as per the book**

deep work isn‚Äôt about grinding harder - it‚Äôs about going all-in on one meaningful thing at a time.
it‚Äôs the opposite of multitasking and ‚Äúbusy for the sake of being busy.‚Äù
it‚Äôs how **Mark Twain** wrote **The Adventures of Tom Sawyer** in a secluded shed.
it‚Äôs how programmers, writers, and creators produce work that lasts decades.

in a distracted world, the ability to focus deeply is a superpower.
Newport says people who master this will thrive - because learning hard things fast and producing exceptional results both depend on that skill.




** the shift it caused in me**

i stopped glorifying ‚Äúbusyness.‚Äù
before, i used to brag about having 15 tabs open. now, if i can do one deep session a day, that‚Äôs a win.

after two weeks of trying this, weird things started happening:

my brain stopped fighting me.

i stopped reaching for my phone every 5 minutes.

my work stopped feeling like a blur.


and strangely‚Ä¶ i started feeling fulfilled.
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls this the ‚Äúflow‚Äù state - where challenge meets focus and time disappears.
turns out, happiness doesn‚Äôt come from doing nothing - it comes from doing something deeply.




**rules that rewired how i work (and live)**

not tips - principles i now live by:

**schedule distraction, not focus.** i don‚Äôt ‚Äúfind time to focus‚Äù anymore - i find time to scroll. distractions get time slots now, not my whole day.

**build rituals.** every deep session starts the same way: one coffee, phone in another room, headphones on. it‚Äôs like telling my brain ‚Äúwe‚Äôre entering the arena.‚Äù

**shutdown ritual.** at 6:30 pm, i literally say ‚Äúshutdown complete.‚Äù (yes, out loud). it sounds silly, but it helps me mentally detach.

**fixed-schedule productivity.** i don‚Äôt extend my day. i compress my effort. if it doesn‚Äôt fit in 8 hours, it doesn‚Äôt fit in my life.

**digital minimalism.** if an app doesn‚Äôt give 10x value to my goals, it‚Äôs gone. i‚Äôd rather read a book that rewires my mind than refresh a feed that drains it.



---

** the quiet benefit no one talks about**

deep work didn‚Äôt just make me more productive - it made me peaceful.
because when your mind gets used to stillness and single-tasking, you stop needing constant stimulation.
you start enjoying walks again. silence feels good again.

> ‚ÄúA deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.‚Äù



and that‚Äôs the real self-improvement lesson:
it‚Äôs not about doing more with your time - it‚Äôs about doing more with your attention.

Coffee in hand. Ten tabs open. Orders to fulfill. A half-finished email campaign from last week. You tell yourself: *I need help.*

But hiring someone right now? Too expensive. Too much onboarding. Too risky.

That‚Äôs the reality for a lot of small-business owners and solo founders: You‚Äôre doing everything, but can‚Äôt quite justify a full-time team.

What if instead of hiring, you could *automate* the most time-consuming parts of your work? That‚Äôs the idea behind **Elsie AI**, which I've been working on in stealth (Public beta coming in November)**.** It's a tool built to act like a small team that already knows your store, what‚Äôs selling (or slipping), and what needs your attention next.

Instead of juggling freelancers or dashboards, you get insights and actions in one place.

The goal isn‚Äôt to replace people, it‚Äôs to help small businesses get leverage without adding headcount.

2) His role is mainly Investments and Acquisitions related. What should i ask that wouldnt make it look like im trying to extract confidential deal info from him?

3) KEY QUESTION: ive already applied for this role througj the company's typical HR website, but im hoping i can get him to bump up my resume and hopefully help ""fasttrack"" me into an interview stage.

I‚Äôd love some advice. I was drinking about two cups of coffee a day, and over the last two months, I got it down gradually. Every time I reduced it, my anxiety improved dramatically. Now I‚Äôm at about a quarter teaspoon of instant coffee, or half of a half capsule (Nespresso-style). It works out to around 17.5 mg of caffeine.

I have that in the morning, and then a green tea with mint a little later that supposedly has about 10 mg of caffeine (it‚Äôs the Traditional Medicinals one, which is pretty low for green tea). Then I still have a decaf iced Americano at a nearby coffee shop around noon or before I work out. I feel very little stimulation from it.

But now that I‚Äôve reached this new baseline, I still notice the anxiety‚Äîjust at a lower level. It‚Äôs much less intense than before, but it‚Äôs still there. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar, where you have to go all the way to zero to really feel the difference.

I‚Äôd really hate to give up the decaf iced Americano‚Äîit‚Äôs such a nice ritual‚Äîbut I‚Äôm thinking of maybe dropping the initial 17.5 mg coffee and just keeping the green tea and decaf.

My two best friends got divorced last year. Both of them. And honestly, watching them felt like watching people finally breathe after holding their breath for years. They'd post pictures at bars, concerts, spontaneous road trips. Meanwhile I was doing laundry and meal planning and pretending I was happy about it. My husband is a good man. That's what everyone always says. He works hard, pays the bills on time, never yells. But good doesn't mean exciting. Good doesn't make you feel alive.

I ran into my ex at a coffee shop six weeks ago. We dated before I got married, back when I was 23 and stupid and thought passion mattered more than stability. He looked the same. Same messy hair, same crooked smile. We talked for maybe twenty minutes and I felt something I hadn't felt in years. That flutter. That electricity.

We started texting. Nothing serious at first. Just catching up, remember when, that kind of thing. Then it got flirtier. Then he asked if I wanted to grab dinner sometime. I said yes before I could stop myself.

I didn't tell anyone. Not my friends, not my sister. I just kept the texts hidden and told myself I wasn't doing anything wrong yet. Just dinner. Just talking. But deep down I knew where this was headed and part of me wanted it.

My sister dropped by my house last Friday unannounced. She does that sometimes, just shows up with coffee or whatever. I was in the shower and left my phone on the kitchen counter. Unlocked. I never lock my phone at home because why would I?

When I came downstairs she was sitting at the table with this look on her face. Not angry. Worse. Disappointed.

""You need to see something,"" she said.

My stomach dropped. I knew before she even turned my phone around. There it was. A text from my ex. The one from that morning. The one that said ""can't wait to have you all to myself this weekend.""

""What is this?"" my sister asked.

I tried to play it off. ""It's not what it looks like.""

""So you're not planning to cheat on your husband?""

""I haven't done anything yet.""

""Yet."" She stood up. ""Do you hear yourself?""

I got defensive. Started saying things I didn't mean. That she wouldn't understand because she's single. That marriage is harder than it looks. That I deserve to feel wanted. She just stared at me like I was a stranger.

""I'm telling him,"" she said.

""You can't.""

""Watch me.""

She walked out before I could stop her. I called her probably fifteen times. Texted her begging her not to say anything. She didn't respond. I thought maybe she'd cool off. Maybe she'd realize it wasn't her place. I was wrong.

She went straight to my husband's office. Showed him the text. Showed him other texts too because apparently she'd scrolled through everything before I got out of the shower. My husband called me an hour later. His voice was flat.

""Come home.""

That's all he said. I drove home shaking. When I walked in he was sitting on the couch with his laptop open. He'd already called a lawyer. Already started looking at apartments. I tried to explain but what was there to explain? The texts said everything.

""I want a divorce,"" he said.

""We can work through this.""

""You took off your ring."" He pointed at my hand. I'd forgotten I'd taken it off. Forgot it was still in my purse. ""You were planning to sleep with someone else. There's nothing to work through.""

I begged. I cried. I promised it was a moment of weakness, that I'd never actually go through with it. He didn't believe me. Why would he? I barely believed myself.

He moved out that weekend. Filed the paperwork Monday. My parents found out from my sister. They called me sobbing, asking how I could do this. My dad said he was ashamed of me. My mom said I threw away a good man for nothing. My friends, the divorced ones I'd been so jealous of, they didn't even take my calls when they found out what happened.

My ex texted me asking what was going on. I told him my marriage was over. He said ""damn that sucks"" and then stopped responding. Guess he wasn't looking for anything serious after all. Just a weekend hookup with a married woman.

Now I'm living in a one bedroom apartment that smells like mildew and eating frozen dinners alone while my soon to be ex husband is already seeing someone new according to mutual friends. My sister won't talk to me. My parents barely acknowledge me. I lost my marriage, my family, and apparently my self respect all because I wanted to feel like my divorced friends looked on social media.

Except now I realize they probably weren't as happy as they seemed. Nobody posts the lonely nights or the regret. They just post the highlight reel. And I fell for it.

So am I the one who messed up here, or did my sister have no right to blow up my life like that?

Coincidentally, I came across a copy of Made to Be She üòè and aren't we all excited for a new episode of GD rewriting history and making wild claims about feminism?! 

Without further ado, my notes for Part 1 

Apparently this time Nancy DeMoss Wohlgemuth didn't find them worthy of an endorsement anymore 

Chapter 1 

Kristen and Bethany find very big high heels in a thrift store and learn that cross-dressing exists 

They claim a lot has changed since 1997. Sweetie, cross-dressing wasn't invented in the 90ies

Women today are increasingly medicated because not living out their feminine design makes them sad. But the housewives in the fifties were not medicated or what. Had to be high as a kite to be able to endure their fate. 

They act as if COSMO single-handedly invented feminism and mix faux empowerment sold by capitalism with genuine women's rights movements. Because feminism has never ever criticized the white girl boss feminism or how women's bodies are objectified in the media and mainstream culture AT ALL 

Chapter 2

Now Kristen and Bethany were national baseball champions two years in a row

They played against boys for fun and won, which shows they've bought into a feminist mindset 

They claim Kate Millett invented the term patriarchy and then held group meetings where women chanted that they wanted to promote prostitution and homosexuality 
Of course, they never directly quote the feminists, but instead a conservative talking about them 

They say a lot of feminists experienced real hurt by (mostly) men, but act as if blaming men and the patriarchy for their hurt is entirely absurd

Getting angry over how men treat you and ask for equal rights is sin and ""adding to the pile of brokenness, hopelessness and pain"" 

""The society we live in has been so completely transformed by feminist philosophy that we don't even realize the change."" (I wish. I wish I could see the change you claim happened! The domestic violence gone, women being really free.)

Most women rejected woman's suffrage because it was not about women, but about shifting from household votes to individual votes and individualism is bad 

If men couldn't call the shots about their wives and children, they would stop assuming responsibility for the common good of the household (because before every man measured up to that totally)

""The caf√© culture of Paris was a favorite hangout spot for the woman who would soon become credited with the rise of second-wave feminism"" (regarding Simone de Beauvoir. But totally right, it's all the free time and coffee that caused her feminism, had she had a husband and kids, she wouldn't have hung out in these caf√©s in the first place!)

Betty Friedan was not speaking for the majority of women 

Wow, a direct quote of a feminist (Germaine Greer) 

Chapter 3

Bethany has now had a boyfriend who crossed boundaries (but never kissed her and had sex with her, in case ANYONE thought that) and this breakup caused her to evaluate her relationship to purity and how she based her whole identity in it (reminder: this was years before Dav. And nobody has seen that change in content back then üò¨üò¨üò¨ we all know the 1,000,000 first kiss purity reels after she got married) 

They also talk about the burden of having been regarded as the perfect Christian girls and that this also made them prideful (some self-awareness finally? Of course not, because THEY were able to free themselves of that and so should you by following their example, which, isn't that the same thing all over again?) 

They claim that both being legalistic and progressive is wrong and that all progressives reduce Jesus to one teacher among others and shouldn't even be allowed to call themselves Christian really 

They recommend Biblical counseling if you have questions regarding what a woman is allowed to do and to set your heart straight 

Also they claim that megachurches don't answer real life questions and that feminism made women more anxious

My friend of 5 years blocked me on socmed because I asked her ""Are you sick? You're so pale and thin na. Pacheck ka na kaya?"". I need an advice on how to navigate this. Should I reach out or should i just let things be?

Context: I have this friend who lives alone in another town kaya lagi ko siya kinukumusta lalo ngayong flu season. Knowing how workaholic she is, I often message her to remind her to eat, drink her vitamins, etc. Medyo may soft spot ako sa kanya kasi I see her as a little sister kahit same age lang kami since malayo talaga siya sa family niya. 

Last week, I was in her town for work kaya I invited her to meet for coffee pero sabi niya hindi niya kaya kasi masakit ang ulo niya. So I volunteered to go to her place na lang nung Sunday before ako lumuwas pauwi. I bought food and fruits kasi sabi niya baka dehydrated lang siya. 

When I got to her place, grabe sobra akong nagulat kasi ang laki ng ipinayat niya! Parang nangalahati yung weight niya since the last time I saw her eh around a month ago lang yun. Sobra akong nagworry kaya after greeting each other, I said, ""Are you sick? You're so pale and thin na. Pacheck ka na kaya? Sasamahan kita I can take a day off. "" She said she's fine and pagod lang raw siya. I'm sure she's not kasi ang OA talaga ng weight loss niya im not exaggerating pero I let it go na lang and tumambay na lang ako for a while before going home. So nagchat ulit ako sa kanya when I got home to remind her to rest rin kasi I'm really worried. 

Then kanina, I needed to ask her something and kukumustahin ko na rin siya since hindi siya nagreply since Sunday. Hala blocked ako?? Gulat ako kasi bakit? Hahahahahaha. So I asked our close friend and apparently, she's mad raw because I ""body shamed"" her kasi hindi naman raw siya sick. Siyempre nagulat ako kasi that wasn't my intention. Pero I get why she might think that kasi baka harsh delivery ko? I'm not sure. 

I'm ready to apologize naman pero I've just found out na ang dami niya palang sinabihan na friends namin na I triggered her body dysmorphia raw and that was the "" last straw"" of our friendship. Napa HUHHHHHH ako kasi wtf? Ang dami niya palang problems sa'kin but never niya sinabi. Now I'm being painted as this body shaming friend eh concerned lang ako sa kanya. Pero yung concern and worry nagsstart nang maging hurt,  annoyance, and galit. Alam kong sensitive siya pero clear naman na health niya yung concern ko. Literally malapit na siyang maging skin and bones tapos ang pale and dry niya. Idk anymore. 

Previous attempts: I tried calling her pero no answer. Even sa telegram and Viber. Sobrang hurt ako sa situation na to and while I know I might have came across as harsh, I think the half a decade of friendship should've been enough for her to know na I'm not coming from a place of malice. I am especially hurt kasi may secret galit pala siya sakin through the years na now lang nalabas one by one eh sobrang open namab namin (or so i thought) sa each other.

For years, Starbucks sold itself as more than just coffee ‚Äî it was a lifestyle, a third place between home and work, a brand that cared. But when the company showed its true colors on worker rights and geopolitical conflicts, customers didn‚Äôt just notice. They acted.

# The Official Story (And Why It‚Äôs Incomplete)

Starbucks will tell you the closures are about business fundamentals. [Six consecutive quarters of declining same-store sales](https://blog.boycat.io/posts/starbucks-store-closures-900-layoffs-boycott-impact). Foot traffic evaporating. Urban locations hemorrhaging money. The company announced [900 job cuts](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/25/starbucks-store-closures-lay-offs) alongside the store closures, citing underperformance and the need to focus on high-performing locations.

But numbers don‚Äôt tell the whole story. They never do.

The company is spinning this as strategic optimization, a pivot toward drive-thrus and digital orders. They‚Äôre not wrong about the strategy. They‚Äôre just conveniently ignoring *why* the strategy became necessary in the first place.

# When Workers Asked for Dignity, Starbucks Hired Lawyers

Let‚Äôs talk about Starbucks Workers United. When baristas ‚Äî the people who actually make the drinks, who memorize your order, who smile through understaffing and impossible rushes ‚Äî decided to organize, Starbucks didn‚Äôt sit down to negotiate. They sued.

The flashpoint? [Union social media posts expressing solidarity with Palestine](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/09/26/3408623/starbucks-announces-layoffs-closures-amid-global-criticism-over-israel-stance). Starbucks claimed trademark infringement, arguing that the union couldn‚Äôt use their logo while making political statements. The legal battle became emblematic of the company‚Äôs hardline approach to organized labor.

Workers weren‚Äôt asking for the moon. They wanted livable wages, predictable schedules, and the dignity of collective bargaining. In response, they got legal threats and [store closures in areas with the highest union activity](https://blog.boycat.io/posts/starbucks-store-closures-900-layoffs-boycott-impact).

With this new system, I keep getting stationed at the worst stow stations. Yesterday, for the first two hours I was getting nothing but big items, literally one item per tote, most of them Gatorade or Water Bottles or Stuff like Coffee Makers. Half of the pods were already full, and the ones that weren‚Äôt had one open slot. My rate was under 100 the entire time, and I was so frustrated.

Then a PA comes up and says, ‚ÄúHey, I see you‚Äôre struggling.‚Äù  
Sir‚Ä¶ I am not struggling.

1. I‚Äôm not Superman. I can‚Äôt realistically carry these heavy items back and forth while also doing the perfect body mechanics they want.
2. Do you see my items and the pods I keep getting??

I tried explaining that my items just didn‚Äôt fit anywhere, but he kept giving me ‚Äútips.‚Äù Stuff like, ‚ÄúTry to stow more items before sending the pod away.‚Äù Bro, do you see any items that actually fit?! And if I scan something else, I get magenta lights everywhere. It‚Äôs so demoralizing.

Then today was even worse. I already wasn‚Äôt in a good place mentally... personal life‚Äôs been heavy. I managed to get a bit better stow rate (I believe on average I‚Äôm around 265 with a good mix of items), but then a learning ambassador comes over and tells me he‚Äôs been watching me for 5 minutes and wants to ‚Äútrain me better.‚Äù

Except three of those five minutes were literally me waiting for a pod. He told me my cases weren't organized well and I needed more cases staged, but they were all huge fking boxes and there was no room for anything else. Then he just kept watching me, and honestly, that makes it 10x harder for me to function. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm on the spectrum, but being watched or crowded like that really overwhelms me. Especially when he would step in, take the item and stow it literally where I was aiming to put it at. 

Then a PA comes by asking if I‚Äôm okay, and I can‚Äôt even make eye contact. I just say ‚Äúmhm‚Äù but then I completely break down crying because it‚Äôs all just too much. I hate feeling like I‚Äôm disappointing people, but I‚Äôve been trying so hard and it feels like no one actually sees that. I‚Äôve only been here a month, and I already feel defeated.

She told me to let her know if there‚Äôs anything she can do to help, but I‚Äôd had enough. I ended up using my intermittent leave to take the rest of the day off.

Honestly, they really need to reevaluate stow expectations. If someone‚Äôs rate is low and they walk by and see what kind of items you‚Äôre getting or the situation you‚Äôre in, they should just leave you alone. Not everything can be fixed with ‚Äútips‚Äù or ‚Äújust go faster.‚Äù Sometimes, the system itself is the problem.

She‚Äôs definitely not at 100% capacity but am I the only one who thinks that she‚Äôs going to be able to keep this up for much longer?

It took me nearly 18 months to find a great job and we agreed at the 6 month mark we will look for our own place (after passing probation) and she wished me luck for my probation review and I passed but then the next day she ended the relationship.

Her father is very hot and cold and sometimes can wake up in a good mood then other days he won't speak to anyone so it's clear where she got this from... Unfortunately only just learnt about attachment styles and my ex massively points towards being a mix of FA / DA...

* Hot and cold - one day she will be happy and the next not so much, it wouldn't always be fixated on me and it could be on friends / family too.
* Stonewalling - even very small disagreements I would get the silent treatment for 24 hours
* No communication - always felt like I was the one initiating deeper conversation, she didn't like talking too much about anything other than daily life
* Conflict - every conflict similarly to the stonewalling I would need to give hours of space before she would even think about talking
* Emotions push her away - two weeks before breaking up with me my dog who I have had for 15 years since I was a kid passed away and I became emotional and insecure over the phone to her and asked her 'are we still going to be together' and she pushed me away and said 'I can't deal with your emotions' and wanted to hang up the phone before I calmed her down
* Eggshells - she was very fiery and seemingly always ready for a fight which made me walk on eggshells.
* Magnifying conflict - small disagreements would be 10x for no reason which then lead her to run away and throw tantrums and I would need to give her space
* Zero compromise - everything her way, a week after my dog passed away I was very low and wanted to get another one and mentioned a specific dog breed and she got mad and actually said that was the reason for the breakup. We had to get a house less than a mile radius from her parents even though I was the one to move 100 miles from my family, the house, car, dog everything her decision
* Control - I guess similarly to the compromise but everything had to be her own way, I even had to have a tracker on my phone when I was with friends and 'why is it a problem if you have nothing to hide'
* Sabotage - she sometimes created conflict when she had to do something she didn't like such as visit my parents and then once the weekend was over she would come back like normal
* Good times then cold - nice weekend away and then she would be very blunt over text and ghost for a few days thinking she was never coming back
* Low libido - always me initiating and if I didn't we would go months without sex, then when we did do it apparently it was hurting so we would only do 10 minutes max

I wish I had realised the red flags from the start but clearly I didn't, when she said about breaking up I fully agreed and thought it would be a good idea as I was clearly hurting inside without knowing but then the next day I was upset as it would obviously be the last time with her, she dropped me off at the train station and I said 'is this it?' she said 'I don't have anything to say' so I left the car crying - she then rang me crying saying 'I don't want you to hate me' and I said 'I don't hate you it's life' and that was that.

I needed to pick my stuff up from hers so I left it two weeks NC and in that period she wished my Mum happy birthday (even though they weren't close and she probably visited 3x a year) so I thought she might be having second thoughts. I then got my stuff from hers and I said maybe we can have coffee and look at dating again and try to revive the relationship and she kept saying 'I don't know' and 'I'm not sure' and wouldn't give me a definite answer so I just left.

As an anxious the lack of intimacy made me pull away massively which could of led to the death of the relationship but I can't help but blame myself even though I realise it wasn't fully my fault.

Don't expect to leverage the market with ""coffee money""‚Äîset aside at least $1,000 to plan your business with confidence.



When dealing with suppliers, don't let on that you're a novice. Maintaining a professional demeanor will help you secure more favorable terms.



All knowledge can be learned for free. Don't rush into expensive courses‚Äîthe internet is your free business school.



Connections are invisible assets. Actively make new friends; opportunities often come from weak ties.



Invest at least four hours a day, or don't start lightly‚Äîtime and focus are your true cost.



Tough battles require mentors and partners. Find experienced people to connect with (though it's not easy, it's definitely worth it).



Failure is part of testing; even experts will make mistakes. Be mentally prepared to maintain a steady pace.



Be wary of scams and data risks. I've received numerous phishing emails masquerading as Shopify‚Äîand you might too. Protect your information; these pitfalls are everywhere.

I was chilling with my (almost) max regen golg, bright pink, as it should be, sort of just watching it.
It isn't long, however before two koras spawn and start killing everyone.
Now, as literally the hardest thing to kill in the game, I March forward on my stubby little legs, my coffee table with teeth ready to chip away their hp until they die.
One, the teensy tiny hiccup, though.
These koras turn out to both be double red, double void.
Now, a regular kora is easy.
A single max damage is a challenge.
Two max damage koras? Is a problem.
I am forced to retreat into oasis pond (not before leaving the koras with a plenty broken femur, mind you), but this struggle has distracted the koras, giving precious time.
One so more than the other.
See, well one attempts to catch teir 3s with their grand total of 40 speed, the other is diligently biting into the pond, shuffling around every few seconds to try and do more than 10% of my health.
Of course any injury he tries to heal off is swiftly met with me wriggling out of the water to remind him what he's doing.
Now, this goes on for a few minutes, until my main man joins in, my brother in arms, (and also brother quite literally) has come to help.
And with the simple work of a baby chisudo, one of the koras gets ground into meat paste under Mt stone body.
The other one, being at least mildly competent, fights of my brother first things first, who is also now dealing with some flyers attacking the both of us.
Once again, I am forced to retreat back into the water as corrosion stackers make themselves known.
That's when I see it in chat.
People are trying to make fun of me for beating their asses.
And those somebodies... have clan tags.
Now I don't remember what clan this was, as that would be something i remembered if i cared, but suddenly, the, like, 2 color schemes these guys had made alot more sense.
This is around when I have my first of 2 close calls.
See, the other kora did log eventually, so I crawled out of hiding, and decided, since I was but ven 4, to do some mud rolling, as that was all that was left.
Ladies and gentlemen, when I tell you that as soon as I un-hunkered the kora dropped on me from the roof so fast I almost paniced.
*almost*.
I luckily turn my hunker on before the bastard even gets me below half, and slither smugly back into the water, launching a few quips in chat.
When i tell you this pissed them off to high heaven.
The koras are back, all efforts on me.
I got fliers all over, some daring enough to enter the Pond, only to do the equivalent of shaking as stick at my golg with a resounding 20-30 dmg.
Then, the second close call.
These people have started just throwing max growths on base slots, because now there are base skin creatures running around with the clan tags.
Unfortunately, one of these clannies rubbed two neurons together and remembered golg can be killed with disease, so they slap a max growth on a trusty ori ori to take me down
Unfortunately *for them*, they forgot my friend is still in the server, and he has a very hungry kohikii itching to get its teeth around a teir 3.
So close, yet so very, very far.
Eventually they just take out a venu with the koras to keep me down while some other clannies try killing other people, but while they have they Been doing nothing but attempt to kill a singular golg for the past 30 minutes, all but me and a few popcorn-munching low teirs have gone into hiding.
So after another few attempts, including the venu taking some swimming lessons with broken ankles,
They just... pack up and leave.
Me existing literally annoyed them out of the server.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Pizza is my hobby and I take a lot of pride and enjoy what I do. The company I worked for recently went out of business so I've been applying to a few local places that caught my attention. But today's experience has left me baffled.

Long story short. I was told to arrive at 11:30 I did and then I got told to wait an extra 30 mins for them to finish opening (no biggie been there)

I come in and the owner of the place is gone. So it's literally just me the head chef and a foh.

Head chef just says to me: get ur uniform 
(I wasn't given an uniform but it's ok I brought my apron and hat from home)

I was expecting an interview of sorts.

Head chef tells me to stretch a dough ball. I do it within 20 or 30 seconds trying to pay attention to detail despite the dough being cold and being a type that I wasn't accustomed of.

The head chef literally says his third sentence to me: ""u can't take 5 mins to do it"" (it's been 20 secs or so. But ok dude)

then the guy just vanishes. Leaving me and the foh in charge of the place for 15 mins.

He comes back with a coffee that he proceeds to spill over the marketable ingredients and gets even offended when I ask him where the refills are ( he just wiped the coffee of the pepperoni and called it a day)

He then tells me to cut some onions (I do it despite been given a knife more dull than the side of my index finger) then the guy comes back saying ohh nooo I did it wrong. Then he tells me I needed to use a mandolin (I'm already questioning my own sanity by then). Fine. I cut the rest with the mandolin. I find a mushy rotten onion and I did tell the guy I was gonna bin it cause it was rotten. Dude tells me to just cut it. 

Then he proceeds to tell me to wash some of the dough trays. I ask where the soap is. He tells me to just scrape the bits off and use water (wtf is this dude even doing)

He comes back and rolls a cigarette over the make table.

By this point I'm mentally done. Thankfully he sends me away and tells me they will contact me if they think I'm a good candidate. All in all. Quite the experience. The crazy thing is they have 4.7 in Google reviews. Crazy..",112,1761670065.0,KitchenConfidential,25,0.99,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

By twelve, I had a corner. Not a physical one, but a network. I also had the bruised knuckles from boxing lessons my father insisted on‚Äî‚Äúa man must know how to fall, and how to make the other man fall harder.‚Äù I had torn socks from street soccer, moped grease on my calves from tinkering with a broken-down machine, and a new, bewildering fascination with girls that ruined my concentration for entire afternoons and, paradoxically, improved my posture.

School was a separate theater of war. On paper, I was crowned. Advanced mathematics, top marks in literature. I could solve a quadratic equation faster than the teacher could write it on the chalkboard. But I couldn't solve the equation of my own identity. My surname, my faintly Eurasian features, the whispered word Zhid that followed me like a ghost‚Äîthese were variables that refused to balance in any system the school could offer.

Some equations are unsolvable because the system itself is flawed. I learned that early. You don't solve them; you learn to operate outside of them.

June 1975. The kitchen in our apartment was always the room where the truth was whispered first. The air was thick with the smell of sunflower oil and anxiety. My father sat at the small table, a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. My mother stood by the sink, her back straight, her hands gripping the chipped porcelain.

New legal trouble. A former associate, caught in a bigger net, was singing to the KGB. My father's name was in the song.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù my father said, his voice a low rumble. ‚ÄúA gust of wind. It will pass.‚Äù

My mother turned. Her face was calm, but her eyes were the same as the day she‚Äôd flicked her switchblade. ‚ÄúNo, Sasha. This time, it will not pass. I am not losing my son to their prisons or to this mafia culture. I won't allow it.‚Äù

The word ‚Äúson‚Äù hung in the air. It was the chain he had vowed never to wear, and the anchor she would use to save us all.

My father took a long drag from his cigarette, watching the smoke draw lazy, complicated maps in the still air. Maps of escape, maps of regret. He looked at me, sitting silently in the corner, trying to be invisible. He saw the algebra in my eyes‚Äîthe risk of staying, the appetite for something more.

Minutes stretched. The only sound was the ticking of the clock and the distant cry of a gull.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù he said at last, the words seeming to cost him something profound. ‚ÄúThere is no future for us here. Not for him.‚Äù He stubbed out the cigarette. ‚ÄúWe'll go to New York. We have friends there. We'll chase our piece of American pie.‚Äù

The leaving was a blur of quiet goodbyes and suppressed tears. Odessa-Mama, with her beautiful, corrupt heart, slipped under the clouds of the Aeroflot jet. I pressed my face to the cold glass, a strange grief and a stranger excitement warring in my chest. The young hustler, his inventory left behind, took a window seat toward a new equation.

PART 5/15: FEEDBACK

New York didn't welcome you; it tested you. It hit like amplifier feedback‚Äîa shrieking, painful, electrifying noise that demanded you either turn down or play louder. We landed at JFK in July 1975, and the heat was a physical presence, thick with the smells of exhaust, roasted nuts, and the faint, salty decay of the ocean.

Brighton Beach was a simulation of home, a theater piece performed for homesick actors. The signs were in Cyrillic, the conversations a chorus of samovars and survival strategies. But beneath the familiar sounds was a new tension, a competitive desperation that Odessa's communal suffering had lacked. Here, everyone was racing for their piece, and the finish line kept moving.

We lived in a railroad apartment that seemed to sweat in the summer heat. My father set up a small shoe repair stand on the boardwalk, his skilled hands‚Äîcapable of picking locks and crafting perfect wire-laced soles‚Äînow just hammering heels and polishing leather. My mother cleaned apartments for the marginally more successful, her switchblade smile hidden behind a mask of domestic deference. They wore their humiliation like a new skin.

My battlefield was Junior High School 88. It was a cold, chaotic ocean called the English language. The sounds were a jumble of harsh consonants and lazy vowels. I felt like I was underwater, watching mouths move and only catching fragments of meaning.

On my first day, the homeroom teacher, a woman with a kind face and tired eyes, called roll.
""Name?"" she asked, her pen poised.
""Igor,"" I said, the hard 'g' rolling from the back of my throat the way it had my whole life.
""Eye-gore?"" she repeated, stretching the syllables into something flat and monstrous, as if naming a creature from a folktale.

The class laughed. It wasn't cruel, not really. It was the laughter of those who fit, directed at something that did not. I smiled, the same tight, defensive smile I'd used in the Odessa schoolyards. But inside, a different engine turned over. I would make them remember my name for the right reasons. I would make them say it with respect.

America was a lesson in volume. Everything was louder, brighter, faster. I learned to curse in English by lunchtime and to dream in a fractured mix of both languages by midnight. The rules of the algebra had changed. The numbers were bigger, the variables more complex.

After school, I haunted the Brighton Beach boardwalk. I watched American boys trade baseball cards with the solemn intensity of monks exchanging blessings. They discussed statistics, conditions, future value. I watched, fascinated and disdainful. The goods were out in the open, the transactions were peaceful, and the profit margins were nonexistent. No risk, all reward? It made no sense. Amateurs.

Within a month, I was back in business. I found a thrift store in Coney Island with a cache of forgotten Big Band records. I polished the vinyl until it shone, sold them to nostalgic immigrants for triple the price. I found a guy in Sheepshead Bay who sold cheap, flashy digital watches from Hong Kong and flipped them to kids who wanted to look like they had money. I was rediscovering the only math that ever truly mattered: buy low, sell higher, don't fall in love with inventory.

[The story continues in Part 6: The Birth of Punk]

PART 6/15: THE BROKEN GLASS

Then, in 1977, the city began to bleed a new kind of sound. It was raw, angry, and beautiful. Punk rock. It was oxygen for kids who, like me, didn't believe in permission. It was the sound of feedback given a melody.

I was fifteen, all sharp edges and unfocused intention. I bought a cheap used guitar from a pawn shop, its neck warped but its pickups still hot. My voice, shaped by Odessa's ship horns and New York's sirens, found its purpose in a shout.

We found each other in the basements and back alleys of Brighton Beach‚Äîa Lithuanian drummer, a Polish bassist, and me, the Russian Jew with the rhythm of the black market in his veins. We called ourselves The Broken Glass because that's what we were. Shards of the old world, reassembled into something dangerous and sharp, still capable of catching the light.

CBGB was our temple. It smelled like destiny and piss. The first time we played there, the feedback from my amp was a weapon I wielded with joy. The crowd, a sea of leather, denim, and safety pins, didn't understand every word of my English-Russian rants about freedom and fraud, but they understood all the wounds. They recognized the geometry of alienation.

During our last song, I gripped the mic stand, my knuckles white, and screamed a line that came from a place deeper than thought, a truth that felt more real than anything I'd learned in a textbook: ""You can't kill a dream! You can only sell it!""

The room erupted. The noise was a physical force, a validation. In that moment, I was a king again, a monarch of the mangled margins. I didn't know that the line was a prophecy, a road map of my own damnation that I wouldn't understand until it was too late.

We lived on a diet of beer, noise, and arguments about art and anarchy that lasted until sunrise. We were purists, and purity is a fragile state. By 1982, the movement was collapsing under the weight of its own egos, heroin habits, and simple fatigue. The adrenaline wasn't enough to fuel the machine anymore.

Our last show was at a squat on Avenue A. The electricity was cut halfway through, so we played acoustic in the dark, shouting into the void. It ended not with a bang, but with a scuffle‚Äîour bassist and a skinhead arguing over something meaningless. It was a fitting end: not a revolution, but a petty dispute.

Afterwards, I walked alone to the corner of 4th and B. My guitar felt like a corpse on my shoulder. I saw a dumpster, its mouth open and hungry. I un-slung the guitar, looked at it for a long moment‚Äîthe scratches, the stickers, the worn frets‚Äîand tossed it in. It landed with a dull, final thud. Like a bad habit. Like a past life.

I walked away with calluses on my fingers, a permanent ringing in my ears, and no plan beyond the next sunrise. Velocity without direction. I was twenty, and already a ghost of my former selves.

[What happens when punk rock ends? Find out in Part 7...]

PART 7/15: WEAR YOUR ATTITUDE

Plans, I discovered, often arrive disguised as friends from a past you thought you'd buried.

1. The phone rang in my shared, cockroach-infested apartment on the Lower East Side. It was Sergei, an old punk from the scene, a man who could scream obscenities in three languages. Now his voice was clean, clipped, coming through a landline from a place with carpeting.

""Wall Street,"" he said. ""It's the same adrenaline, Igoresha. Better shoes.""
""I don't own a tie,"" I told him, the phone cord wrapped tight around my finger.
""Good,"" he laughed. ""Wear your attitude. That's the real currency there.""

He got me an interview at Lehman Brothers. I walked into the towering lobby, my punk-rock sneakers silent on the marble floor. I was led to the trading floor.

It was a stage. A beautiful, terrifying stage. A thousand phones screamed in unison. Numbers wept green and red across a galaxy of screens. Young men in expensive shirts prayed, swore, and pleaded in the universal language of profit. The air hummed with a high-voltage panic that felt like home.

The interview was with a man named Davies, who had eyes like frozen dollars. He looked at my resume, a thin document of failure and punk bands.
""You've never sold a bond in your life,"" he stated.
""I've sold American rock albums to Russians and Russian watches to Americans,"" I replied. ""I can sell anything. I can talk fast, I can smile when someone is screaming in my face, and I know how to close with rhythm.""

Davies stared at me for a long moment, then a slow smile spread across his face. It wasn't a warm smile. It was the smile of a predator recognizing a kindred spirit. ""Welcome to Lehman Brothers,"" he said.

I was good. Then I was very good. The skills were the same: reading the room, sensing fear and greed, talking faster than the other guy could think, closing the deal with the satisfying click of finality. The trading floor was just another CBGB, the ticker tape was our punk fanzine, and the profits were our applause.

But the suit felt like a costume, the silk tie a noose. The etiquette was a choreography for a dance I refused to learn. I learned the steps, but I never felt the music. I spoke the language of profit, but my accent‚Äîthe accent of the alley, of the stage‚Äînever quite left.

I made money. More money than I could have imagined in my Odessa days. I bought a better apartment, better shoes. But late at night, staring out the window of my high-rise, the city laid out like a circuit board of desire, I felt the silence gathering. The boy from Odessa was watching me from the reflection in the glass, his eyes asking a question I couldn't answer.

[The rise continues in Part 8: The Dark Side of Wall Street]

---

PART 8/15: THE DARK SIDE

By 1992, the slow, dignified waltz of blue-chip stocks felt like a prison. I was bored. The margins were too small, the theater too subdued. I craved the high-voltage chaos of my youth.

I crossed to the dark side of the street: penny stocks. The wild west of finance, where hope was the instrument and greed was the metronome. I joined a small, aggressive promotion shop off Wall Street. We traded in dreams. Oil strikes in fields that were mostly dirt, biotech miracles that existed in press releases, mining claims that gleamed far brighter in four-color brochures than they ever could in the earth.

It didn't matter. I could sell weather to the sky. I could make a ticker symbol sing a siren's song to the desperate and the greedy. I learned the art of the ""pump and dump,"" painting a masterpiece of speculation with one hand while quietly shorting it with the other.

In short order, I was running my own boiler room. It was a beautiful, brutal symphony of avarice. A line of hungry kids in cheap suits, headsets clamped to their ears, their voices a chorus line dialing the endless appetite of America. I was the conductor, pacing behind them, feeding them lines, stoking their ambition.

""Sell them the dream!"" I'd shout over the din. ""They're not buying stock, they're buying a new life! Make them see it!""

By 1994, I was thirty-two. I was rich beyond the dreams of the Odessa alleyways. Velocity had become my religion, and the offerings were immense. I didn't just have a car; I had a fleet. A fire-red Ferrari Testarossa for the Hamptons, a black Ferrari 348 for the city, and a third, a pristine 308 GTS, just because I could. For when I needed to be chauffeured, a silver Rolls-Royce Silver Spur glided through Manhattan, its interior a tomb of silence, isolating me from the city's chaos. And for sunny days with the top down, a Mercedes SL 600, its V12 a whisper of effortless power.

My home was a penthouse on Fifth Avenue, facing Central Park. The windows were vast, imperious sheets of glass that framed the world as my personal diorama. The furniture was austere and modern, a deliberate contrast to the opulence, as if I could buy my way into minimalism. Docked at a marina in the Hamptons was the Odessa Dream, a 245-foot cabin cruiser. It was a floating fortress of white steel and teak, a place to entertain clients and escape a city I already dominated. On its deck, holding a glass of chilled vodka, I would look back at the glittering skyline and feel nothing but the hum of the generators.

I wore the American Dream in an Italian-cut suit, but I had built a museum around myself. The Ferraris were sculptures of speed I never truly unleashed on public roads. The Rolls was a mobile isolation chamber. The yacht was a party venue for people I despised. The penthouse was a viewing platform. Success had polished everything except the silence. Late at night, the glass windows turned into mirrors, and a boy from Odessa looked back at me from the corner of his multi-million-dollar cage. My father's tired eyes, my mother's switchblade smile; the arithmetic of loss humming beneath the deafening symphony of gain. I raised a glass of expensive vodka to the skyline and kept moving, faster, always faster.

[The crash is coming in Part 9...]

---

PART 9/15: THE CRACKS

Cracks announce themselves quietly, in the spaces between the noise. In 1996, the air in my office changed temperature. It was subtle. A junior broker I'd given a massive bonus to suddenly avoided my eyes at the coffee machine. A reliable partner in a mining venture called in ""sick"" for a week, his phone rolling directly to voicemail.

Headlines in the Wall Street Journal and the Post began to slouch closer to our door. Words like ""fraud"" and ""investigation"" appeared in paragraphs about smaller firms, then about associates. A partner who used to laugh like a drain suddenly only communicated through a terse, expensive lawyer.

I told myself we were too clever, too connected, too essential to the market's ecosystem to drown. I soothed my nerves with the logic of the alley: everyone was doing it. We were just better. I hosted a party on the Odessa Dream, the champagne flowing, the Ferraris gleaming on the dock, a performance of invincibility for my guests and for myself.

In 1997, the regulators arrived. They didn't come with sirens, but with badges that looked like pre-written verdicts. Their voices were soft, weathered by experience, their suits cheaper than mine but worn with a different kind of authority. They called it a ""routine investigation."" They asked to see files. They used words like ""securities fraud"" and ""mail fraud"" and ""racketeering.""

I greeted them with a smile, offered them coffee, my heart a drum solo in my chest. I called my lawyer, a man who cost $800 an hour and smelled of old money and fear. We held meetings in my pristine penthouse, the park looking deceptively peaceful below.

""I can't sell this weather,"" I joked to my lawyer, trying on my old bravado. He didn't laugh. He just closed his leather-bound notebook with a soft click that sounded like a cell door locking.

The crash is never cinematic from the inside. There is no single, dramatic moment. It's a slow-motion erosion. It's paperwork‚Äîsubpoenas, discovery requests, depositions. It's phone calls from ""friends"" that go straight to voicemail. It's an account that freezes, the digital numbers that represented a life suddenly inert.

1998 was the year of the great unraveling. It took the Ferraris first, repossessed from the garage with quiet efficiency. The Mercedes and the Rolls followed. The Odessa Dream was sold at auction for pennies on the dollar to a German shipping magnate who didn't even change its name.

The gravitational pull that kept a universe of satellites in my orbit‚Äîbrokers, sycophants, women, ""friends""‚Äîvanished. They evaporated like morning mist off the park. The penthouse, once a symbol of conquest, became an empty, echoing space. The furniture was taken by the creditors. I slept on a mattress on the floor, the vast windows now feeling like a televised display of my failure.

I wasn't haunted by the loss of the money. I was haunted by the quiet. The absence of the phones, the constant hum of deals being made, the engine roar of the cars. I walked the city at night, a ghost in a worn-out coat, and looked up at the windows of my old penthouse, now dark, and remembered the man who used to laugh there, convinced he was a king.

[The rebirth begins in Part 10...]

---

PART 10/15: THE QUIET

Winter 1999 rewired me. I found a small, unheated room in a walk-up in Hell's Kitchen. The noise was gone. For the first time since I was a child, I could hear the hum beneath everything‚Äîfear, yes, a constant, low-grade tremor. But beneath that, something else. Something like mercy. When you strip away all the applause, you learn whether you can live without clapping.

I had nothing left to sell. And in that void, I found everything left to understand.

I began to write because it was the only thing that didn't cost money and the only activity that seemed to generate heat. Notes at first, scribbled on scraps of paper. Then pages in a cheap notebook.

The words were a different kind of currency. They didn't counterfeit. I wrote about my father, hungry at eight and dangerous at sixteen, stealing tires for shoe soles. I wrote about my mother, playing guitar with hands that could steal and soothe, her switchblade a promise of protection. I wrote about Odessa's alleys, arguing now with New York's avenues in my head.

The voices returned, not as ghosts, but as collaborators. I wrote about the thieves and the poets, the hustlers and the kings. The punk stages and the trading desks were just different theaters for the same performance. I was no longer selling; I was testifying. The margins were smaller, but the profit was steadier, accumulating as interest in the soul.

By 2000, the resurrection was not spectacular. It was honest. I had traded in truth. It paid differently, in a currency that couldn't be repossessed.

I moved to Miami. The salt in the air was the first thing that felt familiar, a taste of the Black Sea. I stood on rooftops that were humble compared to my penthouse, but the view of the ocean was wider. I thought of the three cities that had taught me their dialects of survival: Odessa with its salt and stone, New York with its steam and ambition, Miami with its heat and dissolution.

I got a job writing for a small, gritty local paper. The readers were tougher than any investor. They didn't want returns; they could smell a lie from a mile away. They demanded redemption, or at least the honest pursuit of it.

[The final reflections begin in Part 11...]

---

PART 11/15: THE INVENTORY APPRECIATES

Sometimes I still dream of Odessa. The gulls, the slick stones after rain, a childhood that tasted like danger and sugar. In the dream, my grandfather's name survives the bullet. My father never steals tires because rubber is plentiful. My mother's switchblade stays folded because the world is just. Dreams are generous like that.

Waking is better. It keeps the scars where I can see them. The scars are a map. Regret is just a map of places you no longer need to visit.

People ask if I miss it. The Ferraris? The yacht? The power? I miss the velocity sometimes, the drug of it. But I no longer mistake it for purpose. Walking teaches you about distance. Writing teaches you about time.

My inventory now is the truth. And I've discovered that some inventory appreciates when exposed to air.

I still hear Odessa in my voice. You can't sand an accent off bone. You can't launder a childhood out of blood. You can only decide what story the stain tells.

Mine is simple: I didn't choose this life. I was born into it. But I learned to rewrite it.

If you listen closely, you'll hear the chorus, the people who wrote the lines of my life: a sailor holding an American record like a scripture; a teacher mispronouncing my name; a bouncer waving me through because money sounds the same in any language; a regulator closing a folder with a sigh not of triumph, but of fatigue; a father who taught me letters like lockpicks; a mother who carved a space in the world with a blade and a love that didn't blink.

Freedom is not doing whatever you want. Freedom is learning to live with what you've done‚Äîand finding a way to sing.

I sold rebellion once. Now I write it down. The margins are smaller and the profit steadier.

[The final chapter continues in Part 12...]

PART 12/15: ODESSA TO ETERNITY

Odessa to eternity: a line on a map that isn't geography, it's persistence. The boy in the alley sold gum and vinyl; the man at the mic sold thunder; the broker sold weather; the writer sells the truth.

You can't kill a dream. You can only sell it.
I tried. I sold it for three Ferraris, a Rolls, a yacht, and a view of the park.
Now I prefer to keep a share. The rest‚ÄîI give away, sentence by sentence, interest paid in breath.

If there's a legacy, let it be this: survival with style, honesty with humor, and a stubborn refusal to let the past write the last line.

Fade to black.

And then‚Äîbecause life refuses to end on cue‚Äîfade back in.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

As we navigate 2025, humanity faces several existential threats, from climate change and nuclear risks to pandemics and AI advancements. By being aware of these issues, we can work together to build a safer, more sustainable future.

# Understanding Existential Threats to Humanity in 2025

  
As we venture through 2025, it‚Äôs important to recognize the existential threats that could put a damper on our collective plans for world domination, or at least a good brunch on Sunday. Here‚Äôs a lighthearted look at some of the key threats we face, with relatable examples sprinkled in for good measure.

1. **Climate Change** Climate change is like that friend who always shows up uninvited and makes everything awkward. Rising global temperatures lead to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. Imagine a summer so hot that your ice cream melts before you even get the chance to take a lick. Not exactly the kind of summer fun we had in mind.
2. **Nuclear Threats** The risk of nuclear conflict is the adult version of playing with matches. Geopolitical tensions are like a game of Jenga‚Äîone wrong move could lead to disaster. Think of it this way: if countries were in a high-stakes poker game, we‚Äôd all be sweating every time someone bluffs.
3. **Pandemics** The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call, like finding out your favorite snack has been discontinued. In 2025, the threat of new pandemics looms. Picture a new virus emerging from a wildlife market, and suddenly everyone is back to hoarding toilet paper and debating the merits of various masks.
4. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** AI is advancing faster than you can say ‚Äúrobot uprising.‚Äù While it can be handy, it also raises concerns. Imagine a future where autonomous drones are flying around, and you can't even blame your neighbor‚Äôs cat for knocking over your trash anymore. Plus, job losses due to AI could leave many of us wondering what to do with our lives‚Äîmaybe become professional cat influencers.
5. **Biotechnology** Biotechnology is like playing with Lego sets, but instead of building castles, we might accidentally create a synthetic virus. Picture scientists in lab coats trying to contain a ‚Äúoops, my bad‚Äù scenario while we all panic. It‚Äôs a little too much like a sci-fi movie plot for comfort.
6. **Cybersecurity** As we go more digital, the risk of cyberattacks increases. Imagine waking up to find your toaster has taken control of your home and is demanding a ransom in burnt toast. A major city losing power due to a cyberattack could lead to chaos‚Äîthink of a world without Wi-Fi. The horror.
7. **Resource Scarcity** With the world‚Äôs population booming, we‚Äôre facing resource scarcity like a group of friends fighting over the last slice of pizza. Fresh water could become as rare as a unicorn, and nations might start eyeing each other suspiciously over dwindling supplies. The next big conflict might just involve who gets to use the last drop of water.
8. **Social and Political Instability** Inequality and political polarization can lead to social unrest. Imagine a family Thanksgiving dinner where everyone is arguing over politics, but on a much larger scale. When frustration boils over, you might find yourself dodging literal flying mashed potatoes.
9. **Space Threats** Space threats sound like something out of a sci-fi thriller, but they‚Äôre real. Picture an asteroid hurtling toward Earth while you‚Äôre just trying to finish your coffee. Or consider solar flares disrupting communication systems‚Äîyour phone might finally get a break from constant notifications, but so would your social life.
10. **Technological Misuse** Finally, there‚Äôs the potential for technological misuse. Deepfake technology can create convincing but fake videos, making it hard to trust anything you see online. Imagine a world where you can‚Äôt even believe a simple cat video; it‚Äôs the stuff of nightmares.

**Taking Action**  
Recognizing these existential threats is just the beginning. It requires teamwork, creativity, and maybe a bit of humor to get through it all. By being aware and discussing these issues, we can work together to build a safer, more sustainable future. After all, if we can laugh through the chaos, we might just find a way to navigate it.",2,1761669607.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

A few months ago I caught myself rushing through Fajr, coffee in hand, mind already in traffic.  
I realised I was living on autopilot and autopilot doesn‚Äôt write hasanat.

So I began attaching four quiet words to every small act:  
‚ÄúThis is for Allah.‚Äù
The first week felt awkward.  
The second week felt lighter.  
By the fourth week the same dishes, spreadsheets and dad-jokes were landing on the good scale and I could *feel* the difference.

I sat down and wrote the four questions I ask myself before I open the laptop, before I stir the pot, before I scroll.  
I never planned to sell it I just wanted a fridge-note for my family.

But friends kept asking for copies, so I tidied the pages, added a few stories from the Prophet Ô∑∫ and the early scholars, and placed it online.  
I priced it at the cost of a latte not because it‚Äôs worth so little, but because knowledge should never be locked behind a price that keeps anyone out.

If you‚Äôre struggling to find barakah in the mundane, if you want every breath to count but don‚Äôt have hours to spare, this may help.  
Not sure if I'm allowed to post links here, so if anyone wants to check it out just DM me and I'll send it over.
If you download it, make du øƒÅ æ that it becomes ·π£adaqah jƒÅriyah for both of us.  
If you don‚Äôt, I still love you for reading this far may Allah count your scroll as worship.",2,1761669600.0,MuslimUK,0,1.0,False

1oiearz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1oiearz/my_mom_passed_when_i_was_14_and_she_still_talks/,My Mom Passed When I Was 14 and She Still Talks to me,"My mom passed from cancer when I was 14(f). She was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer in January of 2016 and then passed in October that same year. The night she passed, I had a dream where I was sitting in my grandma's kitchen and saw her walk past the entrance closest to the front door. When I saw this, I jumped up and shouted, ""I knew you weren't gone."" which was then followed by me chasing after her. I never caught her. 

In the moment, it was traumatizing. Now, that I am older (23) I think it was her soul leaving. Since then, I have had many dreams concerning her, some just containing a made-up person that resembled her, others it felt like what I could only describe as heaven/spiritual realm. There is a very huge distinction in the way dreams feel when I am just dreaming vs. when I think she is visiting me. 

Most of my dreams are surreal, dark, usually disturbing, and rarely happy. However, my most vivid dream I had with my mom felt entirely different. I was probably about 19, and the dream started with me and my mom sitting in a beautiful garden. I could only describe it as Eden. I was drinking tea; she was drinking coffee over a metal garden table. And we just talked, we caught up and she said she loved me. The light in the garden was so bright and vivid it felt like sunlight and very real. I have not had another divine dream like this. Only the night she passed and that time she visited. I have had dreams where she is in them, but it's not the same. 

  
I started therapy a few months ago and since then we are essentially scraping off the beginning layers of my grief and other life trauma, so I have had increased nightmares/disturbing dreams, it's been two a night for about two weeks currently. But the night before last was different, it wasn't the divine feeling I had previously. But one of my reoccurring, ""I knew you weren't dead"", dreams where I find out she is still alive. The typical she got sick, faked her death, and reached out to me as I got older trope. My brain loves to torment me. Because of that dream, yesterday I reached out to my childhood friend, V, and shared my frustrations about my dream. **Which then she told me..**. SHE had a dream about my mom 12 days ago, Oct. 16th. 

  
I need help, I have always found comfort in my singular dreams. But I am Christian (Non-Denominational), and the bible doesn't exactly support this idea nor deny it. Because of my trauma resurfacing I am having increased dreams. But I have NOT shared these nightmares or my previous vivid dream with my childhood friend. we in fact even lost connection for about 5 years and are just now becoming close again. 

I would not be as shocked if her dream was a normal one, but it wasn't. My friend sent me a voice message describing it, I have listened to it over and over. 

She sat with my mom, in a bright room that had a huge window overlooking an ""ethereal"" landscape (her words not mine). My mom sat in a rocking chair, and she sat on the bed. They talked about me, caught up, and then my mom looked at her, sat crocheted booties down, (I had those) and told her. ""Wow, it sounds like she is living a great life. tell her that I'm proud of her and that I love her. And I'm sorry that I can't be there where she is. In moments that she needs me, I'm grateful that she at least has you. Thank you for taking care of my daughter"" And then she woke up. 

My friend is 10 years older than me, and I have always seen her as a parental/older sister figure. I reach out to her in times of needing adult guidance since I am not close with my father.

I have no words and no explanation for the idea that my mom would not only talk to me, but to my friend in a divine way. does anybody have any advice or ideas about this? I can explain my dreams, but hers?

My mom has given me other messages before; I was having a really bad breakdown about her just last year, until a photo image popped in my mind of a wallet picture I had of her. I went searching through all my photo books, pulled out the one I forgot I had, but had seen in my thoughts. Turned it over, and it said ""I love you, Mom' on the back of it. I am not sure how to feel. It doesn't feel real. should I be posting this to another thread for any answers? 

I still have other strange and complex ""coincidences"" on top of this too. I am just blown away, my brother passed from a drug overdose in 2015, the year before my mom. Yet, I have not had a single dream about him. I loved him too; he was very close to me. But no messages or dreams. Thank you to anyone who read this.",3,1761669400.0,Dreams,3,1.0,False

>**CM:**¬†We looked at a ton, a¬†*ton*¬†of people, then met with a bunch of candidates. Then Aaron and Damon Lindelof and I all went and just had coffee here Warner Brothers. He's a quiet guy by nature. But when you get him one-on-one, he has such a warmth. On a TV show, you need the people you're working with to be good at their jobs, but you're also going to live together for a long time, so it helps if we all like each other too! And I just instantly liked him.

>**MH: What made Aaron the right person to play John?**

>**CM:**¬†It's a tricky role because there's a physicality to believing that someone is a superhero, and then there's a physicality to the character of John Stewart. He was a Marine sniper, which requires a certain kind of focus and diligence. After the Marines, he becomes an architect, so there's an artistic side to him. Those are a lot of elements that an actor has got to be able to project. And Aaron is someone who understands that physicality as a trained theater actor. We talked a lot about that how being a Marine is John's job, but it's not his entire personality. He's as much an artist as he is a Marine. There's a real balance of the physical and the artistic that's just innately inside of Aaron, and I think it's essential. If we're doing our jobs well as writers, we're not stating all this stuff out loud. We're trusting that our actors can fulfill that role. The audience has to believe that he could take a guy down with one punch, and also believe that he could sketch intricate portraits of his family and birds and all these beautiful things.

>**MH:¬†Were you guys looking for a certain kind of interplay between John and Hal that you found in Aaron and Kyle?**

>**CM:**¬†We wanted it to be as much of a buddy cop show as a superhero show. Kyle's character has kind of a throwback Chuck Yeager vibe to him. He's the kind of guy who you meet, and you don't know whether you like him or you want to punch him. Then there's Aaron, who has a quiet authority about him, and I think that's important to their dynamic, to the story we're telling. And literally from day one, Kyle started giving Aaron shit for being young and inexperienced. And then Aaron started giving Kyle shit for being an old man. You'd see it in between takes too‚Äîthey'd start messing with each other would just keep sitting there playing with that dynamic in the best way. And because all the dialog is supposed to be in a very back-and-forth, style they were into that rhythm before they even got into those scenes.

>**MH: An essential part of John and Hal's comic lore includes that they butt heads when they first met. They had different philosophies. Different ways of doing things. Is that part of the story you want to tell?**

>**CM:**¬†Our show is in a lot of ways about replacement‚Äîwhen should someone step aside and when is it time for the next person to take the reins? That push and pull between those two characters is really important. So much of the power that John has is by not taking the bait, understanding that you lose your power if you‚Äôre yelling and screaming. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to convey: that he knows he belongs, so he doesn‚Äôt have to overcompensate. There‚Äôs a real balance there that‚Äôs just innately inside of Aaron. He‚Äôs big. He‚Äôs an intimidating presence just physically. But there‚Äôs a softness to him too. There‚Äôs a thoughtfulness. You can‚Äôt teach that.

>**MH: Did you give Aaron and Kyle any homework‚Äîa comic book syllabus or anything like that?**

>**CM:**¬†Everybody did varying degrees of comic book homework on their own, and we \[including co-creators Lindelof and Tom King\] were there to answer any questions. But we aren't telling one specific chapter that's already existed in the comics. Our characters are true to the comics, but we're putting them in a new story. So the actors didn't have to dig into a specific period in the comic books. It was more about understanding who John is and understanding who Hal is.

>**MH: Was there anything that Aaron did during filming‚Äîany choices he made or characterizations he expanded‚Äîthat reinforced for you that this was definitely John Stewart?**

>**CM:**¬†Our story takes place in a couple of different time periods and so the challenge was for the characters be consistent at their core. John's sort of a different person in one of them than he is in another. And I do think the physicality and magnetism that Aaron brings to the role brought that all together. That theater training, that wanting to be in the minutia of the work and the craft, it really added to John's character from all sides. It added dimension to the more physical side of the role, and to the more emotional, creative part of the role.

>**MH: John Stewart is known in the comics for manifesting meticulous, intricate constructs. So it makes sense that creativity is an essential factor to the character.**

>**CM:**¬†One thing we attacked from the beginning was that the Green Lantern powers, a lot of it is based in creativity. To manifest things from the Lantern rings, you've got to manifest something from your brain‚Äîbut also kind of from your soul. What does that look like? What does it feel like? I imagine it's not much different than being a sculptor or a painter. And Aaron had to be able to sell that John could have that ability. And that's what he did. He understood that John would appreciate that aspect of their powers. We always joked that Hal just wants to hit everything with a big, green first.

>**MH: Aaron is playing a really important and meaningful character in the DCU‚Äîone that multiple generations of readers feel a deep connection to and ownership of. How did you see Aaron handle that pressure?**

>**CM:**¬†Aaron felt a responsibility, especially as a Black man playing this particular role, to make sure he really understood him and brought him to life. I think fans will see the reverence he has for it, and that goes a long way.

Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post (from my other account I cannot access)

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch ‚Äî he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn‚Äôt waste time with friends; when he‚Äôs not at the office or out working, he‚Äôs home with us, but he‚Äôs either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.",0,1761669237.0,WhatShouldIDo,7,0.35,False

I'm finally upgrading from my mid 2012 13"" MacBook pro. I have a good pc and unraid server at home so I have only been using it for note-taking and writing but I'm going to school and need to go online with it now. 

I'm considering keeping it and trying to switch to Linux, I've heard this helps ""breathe new life"" into things, but it's still over a decade old and I'm not the best with computers.

I'm also considering ordering an e14 gen7 i7 or t14 gen6 ultra 5 with the minimum memory and storage available. 

My plan is to see how the minimal ram treats me and upgrade as needed, and harvest a 1tb m.2 from my pc for storage. I like the thought of an IdeaPad just so I can upgrade as I need to like with my old MacBook pro. 

My questions are:

If the laptop spends most of its life in my backpack moving between home/ work/ coffee shops, is it worthwhile to invest in the t14? 

I want to get as good of a processor as I can because my goal is to keep it limping along as long as possible like I did with the MacBook. Will it matter much between the ultra 5 cpu and the i7?

I've seen people passionately mention that the ntsc screen sucks and to get the srgb, since I'm not going to be gaming or really watching many movies on it I'm not too worried. Am I committing some grave offense against the subreddit by not getting the screen upgrade?

I was really hoping to avoid buying a new laptop, but I can't really put it off much longer. I would prefer the e14 because it can be so much cheaper, but like I said I'm mostly worried about the longevity.

1oie021,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oie021,pourover caf√© au laits,"I haven't seen a lot of love regarding caf√© au laits on this forum. I am not that surprised; I assume this is mostly due to current trends of valueing high acidity/fruitiness and experimentation in processes (co-ferments, natural processes) in coffee, flavors that usually are either 1) only accessed to their full potential as black coffee and 2) contain flavors that are at odds with those that the addition of milk brings in (usually med/darker roasts are preferred to balance our the natural sweetness of milk and dairy alternatives).

However, I find the caf√© au lait to be one of the most pleasurable coffee beverages! I find that with even more lightly roasted beans, caf√© au laits deliver a clarity and evenness across whatever qualities a particular bean possesses that I find lacking in an espresso-based drink like a flat white. Some coffees, like a recent anaroebic natural pacamara from Honduras I bought, have flopped with the addition of steamed milk, but I still find these experiements enjoying, or at the very least, interesting. 

For context, all of my caf√© au laits I make at home involve ~200mL of coffee resulting from a 15g:225mL pourover (V60 or Origami), then diluted by ~150mL of steamed milk (I use a stovetop Bellman). I like using a Sibarist Fast filter along with a slightly finer grind size to allow tor increased AEY to contrast with the milk dilution. Using an alternative brew method, such as an Aeropress or a Moka pot, would probably result in a stronger overall milk drink, but I don't mind the strength of my drinks at all. Photos are attached of my au laits with some mediocre latte art, which IMO is half the fun of making/drinking these. I will say, usually if a cafe does serve caf√© au laits on their menu, they will use their batch brew as the base, so I usually stick with ordering a hand pour, or flat white if I do want something milky. 

Anyways, curious to know of anyone else's experience with and/or opinions about caf√© au laits! ",5,1761668747.0,pourover,1,0.73,False

For Mr. Dark's and Dust Witch's alike. Frankincense, amber, sweet apples and pumpkins, black tea, vanilla, graveyard moss and patchouli.*

This scent is heavy on the graveyard atmosphere. I get oodles of moss and a touch of cologney resins (the frankincense is very present), very little of the gourmand notes except the tannic tang of the black tea. This smells like a decrepit manor house lost in the fog, where withered greenery covers crumbling headstones. Great for fans of gothic horror.

**Ochre and Fire:** *Cozy, sweet, with a touch of the outside autumn breeze, and tree branches scraping at a sunshine flooded window. A faint ghosting of wildflowers and a hint of balsam dance atop heady patchouli and the sweet scent of wood. Clove, caramel, and jasmine create a warm, inviting feeling, like being wrapped in your favorite sweater protected from a cold wind.*

This oddly reminds me of cozying up in front of a fireplace at Christmas time. It must be the balsam, even though I don't smell any fir/tree notes. The rest of the notes magically combine to create such a comfy cashmere scent. This is so comforting and lovely. If you are looking for low-key cold weather scents, this is a great one to try.¬†

**October 31st:** *The burning candle within a pumpkin's shell, candy corn, gingerbread cookies, hayrides, plastic pumpkin pails, and the magic of Halloween night.*

Wet, my first impression is just ""sweet."" I can smell candy corn mixed with other hard candies. As it dries I get some pumpkin and spice with a whiff of candle smoke. I like the dry phase significantly more than the wet. It's sweetly nostalgic, more of an idealized atmospheric than something hyperrealistic, but nicely cozy.

**Old Burial Hill:** *Inspired by the graveyard of the same name in Marblehead Massachusetts. Vetiver, moss, nettle, mint, honeysuckle and clove.*

Right out of the gate, the mint is certainly the strongest note-- a garden mint, not peppermint or spearmint. As it dries, a mossy, aquatic green emerges. I can only find the clove if I really search for it. I bought this because I've visited the graveyard in the name, so I expected something more overgrown smelling, but this stays really nicely fresh and would even be a good summer scent.

**We'll Be Younger in the Morning:** *Inspired by the film Hocus Pocus. Apple cider donuts, hot lattes, ginger, caramel and clove.*

Bang-on apple cider donut with a photorealistic mug of coffee. The coffee note is stronger than expected-- I typically am not one for coffee scents, but I love this! I might have to upsize it for next year. It reminds me of going to the pumpkin patch. :)

I recently wrote my ex a letter. I don't imagine she'll ever reply, so for my own closure, I drafted this little story about what might be happening on her side. I tried to encapsulate the thoughts and feelings of someone with a light Anxious Avoidant attachment without being explicit about it or overdoing it. It's not perfectly aligned with most of our experiences with an avoidant, some of it is just heartbreak fiction. I tried to write something that was both emotional and quiet, angry and accepting. 

I'm still sad about everything that happened, but drafting this certainly lifted my spirits in the moment. If I never get a reply, at least I crafted my own and closed the loop.

This is closure fantasy and it's definitely a rough draft. Tenses, hyphens, all could use some polishing. I'm posting this from my mobile, so I'll try to fix up some of the formatting to get the italics and line breaks right throughout the day.

Bandages. (drafted 10/17/25)

The letter arrived unexpectedly. She hadn‚Äôt received mail in months, aside from the barrage of Amazon packages stacked against her porch from her many admirers. There, on the envelope, was her name plainly written in handwriting that used to appear on greeting cards and small notes around the house, instantly recognizable. It stood out, impossible to ignore among the odd bills and non-profit solicitations for ASPCA, advertisements for home upgrades and mail order catalogs. She took it from the mail slot and carried it home like a lit stick of dynamite. 

Once inside, she walked steadily to her open-air kitchen and mixed a Tito‚Äôs and water. She moved to her couch, chased by afterimages she had spent weeks outrunning. She sat, her faithful dachshund beside her - its skinny brown head and floppy ears pressed against her knee, the envelope resting on the coffee table like it could explode. Her fingers hesitated before opening it.

She read it once - quick - like ripping off a bandage. Then again, slower the second time.
By the third read, the tears stopped threatening.

The words didn‚Äôt ask for anything. No aspersions, no anger. To her, they didn‚Äôt even sound like the man she‚Äôd once called too much. They were steady, soft, respectful, concise. *No bad blood. Hope you‚Äôre doing well.* She traced the edges of the paper like she could feel the intent behind each syllable, and the weight slowly lowered onto her shoulders.

In the quiet that followed, her brain flipped through a thousand stored sounds: a pair of voices singing bluegrass songs, the clink of wine glasses in the kitchen over that last weekend, an acoustic guitar faithfully recreating Blind Melon‚Äôs rendition of *'Candy Says‚Äô*. She searched for a power button, something to silence the flood of sound - before realizing it was nothing but memory.

That evening, she poured herself another drink and put on an album in which she had always found solace, Fiona Apple's *The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do*. Halfway through the disc, she was yanked back to the words of the letter. Shutting her eyes, she laughed through a dull ache that built in her chest. Lyrics pierced through the wall she erected around her anamneses: *‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm butter, if I‚Äôm butter, then he‚Äôs a hot knife, he makes my heart a cinemascope screen, showing the dancing bird of paradise‚Ä¶‚Äù* she whispered, and felt the past breathe through her ribs.

She grabbed the letter, still staring back at her from her square coffee table, folded it neatly along the creases, and threw it into the same drawer where she kept old take out menus and printed recipes, as if paper and cabinets could bury a feeling. She stared at her phone for a moment, opened her Messages app and considered reaching out for the first time in fifty days. No, she thought to herself, not yet. She turned her memory off like a light switch and went to sleep rigid, half proud of her restraint, half hollow, the old world surrounding her bed like an exorcism.

In the morning, armor clicked into place. She pushed a mantra at herself: *Forget it. I‚Äôm fine. It was kind. I don‚Äôt owe him anything.*

The letter sat in the drawer for half a day before another reread, during which she rebuilt her story to stay upright. *Fuck that, he's manipulating me. He always wanted more. I needed space. He didn‚Äôt listen.* That logic held for a while, until the dam holding back the echoes cracked a little. Then a deluge of small images - the cabin in the mountains, the hotel in Chicago, his eyes staring down at her as they fucked on her living room couch, the text she shouldn‚Äôt have sent. She shook her head, muttering that she‚Äôd already decided - she had already said enough.

But the mind doesn‚Äôt always obey decisions. Sometimes, it replays loops.

She considered burying the letter further, in the box of his old stuff that she kept underneath the bed, but before she could even reach under her bedframe, she was reminded of the old printed photos. It was something he did, he sent real old-fashioned photographs in the mail after each one of their adventures. She could still remember one, taken at an show after dancing to Grateful Dead for hours into the early morning - his suit shirt halfway unbuttoned, tie loose and akimbo, her leaning up against his shoulder, all smiles.

By the third day, she finally picked up a pen. Journaling was something she had always done intermittently, not enough to keep a faithful record but enough to have a disorganized stream of fragments. Her version of dipping a toe back into the river. She wrote out all of her inner noise, every detail of the narrative she had constructed, but the words already seemed less sharp, and the recreation felt a little hollow on the page. 

To escape, she threw herself into motion: errands, music in the kitchen, an extra glass of chardonnay when the silence got loud again. By this point, Fiona was getting more plays than usual, the album spinning like a ritual she pretended not to notice. It didn‚Äôt sting anymore. It sounded like something she survived. Her body was tired in a way coffee cannot fix. She blended herbs to brew herself a glass of tea, posted something light to her Instagram account, and stared at reruns of Futurama on the TV. 

On day five, curiosity arrived sideways in silent streams, nothing dramatic. She wondered what his days looked like now. Did he continue going to the gym? Was he still smoking? Writing? Hanging with Kellen? Making dinners for his elderly nextdoor neighbor Harry? Was he still crying for comfort against the fur of his cat?

When the sun set, she decided to cook for the first time in a month, Garlic Butter Chicken. The enticing aroma of sauteed smashed garlic and diced onions pervaded the entire house. Spinning around the kitchen, she hummed gently without realizing it, *‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm butter, if I‚Äôm butter‚Ä¶‚Äù* She stopped mid-note. ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù she said aloud, irritated, setting her first gently a on the counter. Her dachshund stood there on the wood floor, tilting its head as if she knew. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that,‚Äù she muttered playfully.

At Wednesday night drinks, she sighed into her glass and looked over at her friend. 

‚ÄúGot a letter - first I‚Äôve heard from him in weeks‚Ä¶no drama though.‚Äù 

The friend raised an eyebrow; she shrugged, changed the subject, put another bill in the video poker machine and took another sip of her beer. 

After the bars closed and everyone went home, she pulled the letter out of the drawer again and analyzed the few lines on the page. His handwriting looked steadier than she remembered. She hated this observation, why does it even matter. It‚Äôs a closed chapter like so many others drafted before. She reread the final line - wishing you the best out there - and it sounded like the opposite of manipulation, like love stripped of demand.

Without intending to, she reopened her messaging app and drafted another two-line reply: *‚ÄúGot your letter. Thank you, it was very kind.‚Äù* before deleting it once more. If memory was a room, she was standing in the doorway, hand on the frame, not crossing the threshold.

It was a week after the correspondence arrived before she sent the message. Something neutral, something brief, mirroring what she received. Something harmless. She deleted it, and drafted again:

>Hey - just wanted to say thanks for the letter.
It was kind of you to send. I hope you‚Äôre doing okay.

*It‚Äôs just a nothing text, why does this matter at all?* The pulse in her throat gave away her true feelings no matter how much she tried to obfuscate them. She hesitated five more minutes, then hit send.  The text under the message bubble read Delivered and her chest filled with adrenaline and regret. Texts and letters are similar that way, once you‚Äôve dropped them in the mailbox, there‚Äôs no turning back. In an act of anxiety, she dropped her phone on the table like a pulled pin grenade.

Hours later, she received a response: 

>Hey you - glad it made it and good to hear you‚Äôre doing well.Things have been steady on my end. I appreciate hearing from you.

And then nothing more. No follow up, no litigation, no poet pouring his soul onto the digital notebook. No chasing, no flirting, no wound-licking. Part of her wished that he had, part of her wondered why. Instead, there was just empty distance, almost eerie in its peacefulness. She exhaled a little too loudly, causing her dachshund to look up, alarmed. She scratched the dog‚Äôs ears and whispered, ‚ÄúSee? Not a game.‚Äù 

When she woke up around ten, she scrolled her phone half-expecting another ping. None was there. Things seemed different this time. 

It reminded her of when he could be so confident, back when they danced under the lights at the Tuscany, sweating through their shirts, rubbing ice on each other‚Äôs foreheads, stumbling back to their hotel room to wax philosophical and play footsie under the covers. It was natural, organic, beautiful. She thought about how long it‚Äôs been since anyone spoke to her without trying to fix her or win her over. In their past, he tried hard and eventually had, *‚Äòhe always had other intentions‚Äô* was where she hid their history. But this, this felt different. 

Two days passed before she found herself staring at the reply once more. *""Am I really going to send another text?‚Äù* she asked herself. Just a month beforehand, she hated this man, hated how suffocated he made her feel, how frozen she was by anger and anxiety. It wasn‚Äôt so much what he had done, but more so what he made her feel. Frustrated, afraid. And yet, here she was, punching the digital keyboard on her iPhone.

>Was thinking of a song we used to overplay. You still listen to Fiona?

She stared at it. Deleted ‚ÄúFiona.‚Äù Rewrote:

>Heard a song that reminded me of you. Saw you got a dog - hope the new pup is keeping you busy.

She kept the message in her drafts, unsent, for another twenty four hours, hoping he‚Äôd rebreak the silence. Nothing came.

‚ÄúFuck it,‚Äù she thought, and pressed the send button. She leashed up her dachshund and took it for a walk around the gated neighborhood. The air smelled like dust, asthma and allergies accompanied her anxiety. She didn‚Äôt expect a reply.

But by morning, there it was:

>Ha - probably Fions, right? The doggo is great. Steals more than half the bed every night. Hope you and the ween are doing good too.

He always called Fiona Apple ‚ÄòFions‚Äô. It used to irritate the shit out of her. Now, it made her smile.  Not big, but real.

There were more messages over the next few days, brief flickers. A meme. Exchanges of photos of their puppies mid-yawn. A text about new music, half inside joke, half olive branch. They didn‚Äôt relitigate the past, no heavy subjects. Like the slow movement of tectonic plates, under the surface, something shifted - trust began to breathe again, one small, ordinary exchange at a time. There was no rekindling the fire, just tending the embers.

The next week, back at Wasted Wednesdays, her friend asked about ‚Äúhow everything is going with that situation‚Äù. She said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just being nice.‚Äù But when she scrolled back through the messages before bed, she knew that‚Äôs wasn't quite true. *Nice* isn‚Äôt the right word. Familiar is.

Two whole months after its arrival, the letter had found a new home between the covers of a notebook in her desk drawer. She‚Äôd re-read it less often. Sometimes - not every day - they‚Äôd exchange little messages back and forth, slowly slowly adding another layer of concrete to that foundation of trust again. 

She‚Äôd journal more frequently, letting Spotify on random, and her thoughts, couple together and stream endlessly onward, the songs surrounding her mind in the sweetest serenade. Until those ruminations were caught by a familiar refrain: *‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm butter‚Ä¶if I‚Äôm butter, if I'm butter than he's a hot knife‚Äù*, reappearing for the first time in over a week. This time, she didn‚Äôt consider skipping or silencing it. The lyrics didn't pierce, they passed through, harmless. She sang every word as loud as possible, like the way he used to in the shower, like the way they did in the living room of the cabin near Alma.

When the song ended, she smiled at her dachshund and said,  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough butter talk for one lifetime.‚Äù
Then she closed her journal, leaned back, and for the first time since August, she didn't need to rewrite the story. Just let it be what it was - brief, intense, messy, beautiful, and finally, done.

She poured herself a cup of tea.

Somewhere across the state line, a man walked a dog in the wet autumn rain. It was cold, and his jacket smelled like old cigarettes and cedar, though he no longer smoked. In the back of his mind, for just a moment, there was the faint hum of connection, an old radio picking up a familiar station after miles of static.

1oidwph,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oidwph/hg1_prime_initial_impressions/,HG-1 Prime: Initial Impressions,"There's not a ton of information out there for the HG-1 Prime, and most of it surrounds its use as an espresso grinder. So I thought I would document my experience as I begin using it with a series of introductory posts, starting with why I went this route and what my initial impressions are right out of the box. Pics will be at the end.

# Why the HG-1 Prime?

Celebrating a milestone in life, I was able to justify splurging a little and bought myself an HG-1 Prime manual grinder from Craig Lyn. For anyone not familiar with the HG-1 Prime (probably almost everyone), Craig Lyn helped design the original HG-1 from WW before separating from Weber Workshops for their own reasons. Both sides continued the HG-1 legacy and made their own improvements and changes, with WW eventually motorizing the design with the Key. And CL continued with the manual operation, adding gear reduction to make grinding easier and modifying the design to make it more compact.

I decided to go with the HG-1 Prime based on multiple factors:

* I like the idea of a manual grinder. It keeps me engaged with the workflow and brewing process, providing tactile feedback that just feels...good to me. It's not ideal for everyone, but manual, tactile processes just draw me in.
* I have a mechanical engineering background, so the precision engineering and manufacturing really appeals to me, as well. It's a beatiful piece of mechanical hardware that will look good in my coffee station.
* I've wanted a larger burr set to see what the fuss is all about. The HG-1, HG-2, HG-1 Prime, and Key all use Mazzer Robur 83mm conical burrs usually only found in the 3-phase Mazzer Robur commercial grinder models in cafes.
* I prefer brews with more body over ultra-clarity. Unimodal flat burrs just didn't call to me because of this.
* The HG-1 Prime is more compact than the WW HG-1 and HG-2.
* The HG-1 Prime is easier to operate with the 2.5;1 gear reduction.
* The WW HG-2 is considerably more expensive than the HG-1 Prime. And the WW HG-1 is discontinued, so I'd have to locate a used model.
* Lastly, while WW does have a reputation for quality products, I've also notices multiple comments regarding their customer service and quality control that concerned me enough to go with Craig Lyn.

The HG-1 Prime has been out of stock for a little bit, but I was able to snag a blemished model at a discount. There are a few tiny scuffs or scratches, but they don't affect function in even the smallest way. And I was just itching to get my hands on one, so I jumped on it. Craig was helpful and answered my questions before and during my order. It was neat to be able to directly interact with the owner and creator of a product.

# Initial Impressions

Taking this grinder out of the shipping box had me very excited. I've been wanting the HG-1 Prime for a while, and I couldn't wait to get it assembled and dialed in. The grinder weighs in at 5kg (11lbs) and consists of mostly steel parts with black coating. I believe the burr holder and surrounding parts are anodized aluminum. The exit funnel is held on with magnets and it protects a plastic wiper that helps prevent grinds from sticking to the burrs as well as funneling them into a cup or blind shaker.

I love the look of this thing. It's simple, sleek, and the bright aluminum and stainless parts give it some nice accents. It's all business and no faff. And it comes with an instruction packet and mounting template that are very nicely designed and clear to read and understand. Instructions are often overlooked, so it's nice to see someone put so much thought and care into them for a change.

Adjustment is done by lifting the adjustment ring and turning the ring to the desired number. This also adjusts the height of the outer burr, I believe. You can ""zero"" the grinder to a degree by lifting the adjustment ring all the way off the burr carrier and rotating it until the slots line up with the adjustment ring. It likely won't line directly up at 0 on the ring, but it'll be close. But you don't really set a zero point with touching burrs like you would on other grinders. You set your zero where your desired grind size is and make relative adjustments from there. I found that once I dialed in for espresso, rotating around from 0 to 12.0 was just about right for pourover. Not even a full rotation gets you between both settings. But there are quite a few tick marks in between, giving you good adjustment range. And each tick mark equates to 0.013mm or 13 microns of burr movement. While I don't have measurement capability for actual grind size, assuming espresso is roughly 300 microns, adjusting to 12.0 moves the burrs 780 microns to nearly 1100 microns in the vertical direction. So, I guess, take that however you will, assuming you're familiar with other grinders that mention micron adjustments.

Adjustment is fairly smooth, yet stiff enough that it won't slide easily on its own.

Grinding is actually a bit more work than I had expected with the gear reduction. It's still not difficult until you get down into espresso range, but you do need to use the handle and hold the grinder down with your other hand or it will jump around the counter. Any dust or coffee grounds will also let it slide around on the counter. For espresso, I had to really focus more on holding the grinder down as I was cranking. I think I'm going to mount the grinder to a heavy cutting board or clamp it to the counter somehow down the road. But it'll work fine as-is for now. And once you get the grinder going, it's fairly easy to grind at a consistent speed.

The grinder does generate static. Testing out RDT with a spritz or two of water before loading up the grinder nearly eliminated any static retention. I think RDT will be a must with this grinder.

The included CL Blind Shaker I is very nice quality. I need to learn the proper technique, though, as I could not get the grinds to distribute evenly when making espresso. That's fine, though, as I'd WDT the grinds anyway. It's a very nice catch cup, though, and I do plan to continue using it for both espresso and pourover. To compare grind size with my Ode 2, I actually just ground a small amount of beans right onto the shaker lid and spread the grounds around with my finger. It was really convenient!

# Wrap-up

So... do I think this grinder will compete for pourover? I need to do some actual coffee brewing to find out. But so far I'm impressed with the build quality, design, style, and customer service. I'll definitely follow this up with some more posts comparing cup quality with my Ode 2 and ZP6. I'll leave you with a few photos to end things here.

1oidwax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1oidwax/the_silent_power_of_quiet_progress_why_small/,The Silent Power of Quiet Progress: Why Small Changes Matter,"Hey Empowish fam! üëã You know that feeling, right? That burning desire to grow, to achieve, to truly transform... but sometimes, the mountain ahead looks daunting. We see grand successes, monumental leaps, and it's easy to feel like our own efforts are just a whisper in the wind. But what if I told you that whisper is actually your superpower? ‚ú®

For over a decade, I've seen countless individuals in communities like ours struggle with the ""all or nothing"" mentality. We set huge goals, get overwhelmed, and then get stuck. The truth is, the most profound changes often come not from giant leaps, but from the consistent, almost invisible power of quiet progress. It‚Äôs about understanding that small changes aren't just *easier*; they're often *more effective* for long-term growth and happiness. Let's dive into how you can harness this silent power!

---

**Embrace the ""1% Better"" Mentality Every Single Day** üöÄ

Forget the huge leaps. What if you just aimed to be 1% better today than yesterday? It sounds minuscule, right? But that tiny, consistent improvement compounds over time like magic. Think about it: reading just 5 pages of a book every day. That's a full book in a month! üìö Or spending 2 minutes meditating. Or doing one extra push-up. It's not about being perfect; it's about being persistent. Small, almost imperceptible steps remove the pressure and build an unstoppable habit. This approach respects your current capacity while gently stretching it, making growth feel sustainable and exciting. It's the ultimate anti-overwhelm strategy!

---

**Track Your Micro-Victories (They're More Powerful Than You Think!)** üèÜ

Here‚Äôs a secret: quiet progress can sometimes feel invisible. You're putting in the work, but are you *seeing* the results? It's crucial to acknowledge your micro-victories. Whether it's ticking off a task in a simple journal ‚úçÔ∏è, using a habit tracking app, or simply telling yourself 'I did that!' ‚Äì make your progress visible. Did you resist that sugary snack? Win! Did you send that difficult email? Win! Did you take that 15-minute walk even when you didn't feel like it? HUGE win! Every tiny step forward deserves a little internal cheer, because these small wins are the bricks building your empire. üè∞ Seeing your progress, no matter how small, fuels your motivation for the next step.

---

**Automate Consistency with the Power of Habit Stacking** üîó

Want to make those small changes stick without thinking too much? Try habit stacking. This is where you connect a new, desired small habit to an existing, well-established one. For instance, after you brush your teeth every morning ü¶∑ (existing habit), immediately do 10 squats or read one page of that book (new habit). After pouring your morning coffee ‚òï, write down three things you're grateful for. By piggybacking on routines you already have, you drastically increase your chances of consistency because the trigger is already there. It's like putting your new habit on autopilot! This simple strategy removes decision fatigue and makes building powerful new routines almost effortless.

---

**Shift Your Focus to the Process, Not Just the Outcome** üòä

Often, we're so fixated on the grand outcome ‚Äì the finished novel, the dream job, the toned physique ‚Äì that we forget the magic happens in the daily grind. Shift your focus from *what* you want to achieve to *who* you want to become through the process. Instead of ""I need to write a book,"" try ""I will write for 30 minutes every day."" Instead of ""I want to be fit,"" focus on ""I will move my body for 20 minutes daily."" When you fall in love with the process, the small, consistent actions become their own reward, making the journey sustainable and far more joyful. The outcome will follow, almost effortlessly, when you commit to the daily doing.

---

Empowish community, remember this: your journey of self-improvement isn't always about thunderous applause and dramatic reveals. More often, it‚Äôs about the quiet discipline, the consistent effort, and the gentle unfolding of your potential, one small step at a time. This 'silent power of quiet progress' is how true transformation happens. üí™

does anyone else feel this way and are other fastfood companies any better? im thinking subway wouldnt be so bad becuase they tell u what they want or a coffee place since its litearlly making coffee instead of learning 15 burgers and 7 wraps within a week and being yelled at for using gloves when i was told to use gloves.",1,1761668433.0,McLounge,5,0.6,False

I injected last night and woke up queasy at 1am. Drank a nuun tablet and ate some saltines.  Nausea gone! This morning I drank a liquid IV before even starting with the coffee.  No nausea.  I have tried everything: pressure point bracelet, ginger, peppermint, emetrol. Zofran made me feel worse.  I‚Äôm hoping that I solved the problem because that has been my only significant side effect. üôèüò¨ ",2,1761668395.0,Zepbound,1,0.75,False
