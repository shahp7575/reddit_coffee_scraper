1ignpr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RevengeBooth/comments/1ignpr9/my_brothers_wife_destroyed_my_life/,My brother's Wife Destroyed my Life,"I was super happy when I found out that my brother, John, was coming back from the UK with his wife. He had moved there for his graduate studies, and while he was there, he met Allison. She’s originally American, but this was her first time in the U.S.

John had built a house for himself, but it still needed a few finishing touches before he and his wife could move in. So, while they waited for everything to be done, they decided to stay with us. We set up a beautiful room for them—something special for newlyweds.

Everything was going great. Every morning, John would head to the university to teach, while his wife went for a jog in the park. We’d all meet up for lunch, and in the evenings, they usually went out. But I couldn’t help worrying about Allison—she didn’t know anyone here except us, and she spent most of her time alone in her room.

One morning, I suggested going for a run together. She hesitated a little but eventually agreed. I threw on my workout clothes, and we headed out. As we ran, I noticed she kept looking around, like she was searching for someone. That’s when I spotted a man following us. Every time we stopped for a break, he stopped too. I didn’t say anything to Allison so she wouldn’t freak out, but I kept an eye on him.

The next morning, as I stood by the door ready to head out for another run, the plan suddenly changed! Allison said she wanted to go shopping instead.

""Great!"" I thought. ""I need to buy some clothes anyway. Let’s make a fun day of it!""

But for some reason, she didn’t seem too excited about it. Still, she didn’t say anything. We walked around, went into different stores, and I bought a bunch of clothes. But she didn’t buy a single thing. She seemed uneasy, so I figured I’d lighten the mood and invited her for a coffee.

We joked around, and I reassured her that she wasn’t alone—I was like a sister to her, and she could always count on me for fun plans and activities. But her response wasn’t what I expected.

""Listen, Sonia,"" she said, ""I really appreciate everything you’re saying and doing for me, but I’m just not used to this much attention. I prefer having a little more space. In the U.S., we live a bit differently. I love you, but I just need some time to adjust. And when I’m ready, you’ll be the first to know.""

She said that, kissed me on the cheek, and smiled.

""Alright,"" I said, ""I’ll give you your space. But if you ever need a friend, I’m here. Let’s head home.""

Just then, her phone rang. She looked at me hesitantly before answering.

""No, ma’am, you’ve got the wrong number… No problem!""

She kept surprising me. I had clearly heard a man’s voice—so why did she pretend it was a woman? Was it the guy from the park? Allison was definitely hiding something, but what?

We walked back home in silence. She went straight to her room and shut the door, while I sat in the living room, trying to piece together the mystery surrounding my brother’s wife. What should I do? Should I tell my parents and John, or wait?

The answer came two days later…

John and Allison had gone to visit a relative when I suddenly heard her phone ringing in the house. She had forgotten to take it with her! By the time I found it, the call had stopped, but a text popped up almost immediately:

**""Why aren’t you answering? Is he with you? I’ll be waiting for you tomorrow at the park, sweetheart. Kisses!""**

Allison had a lover!

That’s why she didn’t want me running with her! I scrolled through her messages and found more just like this one—some were even more intimate and shockingly bold. I put the phone back exactly where I found it and waited for my brother and his wife to return.

The moment Allison walked in, she immediately started searching frantically for her phone. I kept my tone as casual as possible and said,

""I just heard it ring.""

""Oh… yeah, that must’ve been my friend!"" she said quickly.

""Aha! So you have friends now? That’s great! Who is she?""

""Just someone I met while jogging,"" she replied.

""What’s her name?""

John cut me off.

""Why all these questions, Sonia? Just leave Allison alone. Come on, babe, let’s go to bed.""

I wanted to expose her right then and there, but I decided to gather clearer evidence first.

The next day, I followed her to the park, camera in hand. I wanted to catch her red-handed. When I got close, I saw a man meet her. They were too far for me to see his face clearly. They talked for a bit, then walked further into the park. That’s when I saw the man hand Allison a piece of paper, which she quickly slipped into her pocket. I snapped a photo. Now I had proof.

That evening, I invited my brother and his wife to dinner. At the restaurant, I got straight to the point.

""What I’m about to say will hurt you, John, but you need to know—your wife is cheating on you.""

John looked shocked, and Allison immediately tried to interrupt me, but I didn’t let her.

""Let me finish. There’s no point in denying it. I saw you with that man today at the park. I read the love messages on your phone. Just admit it and let’s be done with this.""

I pulled out the pictures and handed them to my brother. But instead of panicking, Allison started laughing. Then she turned to John and said,

""Honey, that man runs a pastry shop. I met him a few days ago, and he gave me his number so I could order a cake for our anniversary tomorrow. Did you forget? And as for my phone, go ahead and check—those messages only exist in your sister’s wild imagination.""

She had deleted all the messages! And the man she met today wasn’t the same one from before. She must’ve told her lover not to show up, afraid I’d catch them!

John looked at me sadly and said,

""I don’t know why you did this, Sonia. Is it because I’m married and you’re not? Or do you just hate me so much that you can’t stand to see me happy? You’ve changed… You used to be so kind. Just leave us alone.""

Allison shot me a victorious smirk, her lips curling into a mocking smile. She had won.

The next morning, they packed up their things and left without saying a word to our parents. I was devastated—not just for myself, but for my brother. I was afraid of what would happen to him. I spent most of my time crying. I had lost both my brother and the sister I thought I had finally found.

Three months passed without a word from John. Then, one day, there was a knock at the door.

When I opened it, there he was—looking defeated.

""I'm so sorry, Sonia… I should’ve trusted you.""

""Come in and tell me everything,"" I said.

John sat down on the couch in the living room and took a deep breath.

""When we moved into our new house, everything seemed perfect. But I couldn’t shake off what you told me that night. I know you, Sonia—I know you wouldn’t try to hurt me for no reason. So, I decided to stay alert. I started paying attention to all the little details, and I could just feel that something was off. There was nothing obvious, but Allison wasn’t always completely honest.

Then, one day, I decided to come home early from work. I wasn’t expecting to see what I saw… She was in **our bed**—with her lover.

I have no idea how I managed to stay calm, but what really got me was what she said next. Instead of apologizing, Allison just looked at me and said, ‘I don’t love you. I never did. I only married you because the man I actually loved was already taken. But now he’s finally back.’

When I asked her why she didn’t just tell me the truth so I could divorce her and be done with it, she simply shrugged and said she was waiting to get her hands on the house and my money.

You can imagine what happened next—I threw both of them out without a second thought.

Sonia, I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. I forgot that **family** is stronger than anything else in this world.""",1,1738584891.0,RevengeBooth,0,1.0,False

First, let me start that English is not my first language and I apologize if some stuff do not make sense or if there are many grammatical errors. 
I am a Mechanical Engineer that enjoys doing CAD design + 3D printing. I’ve been out of it for a while, but I’ve been getting some ideas to do at home that would be good DIY projects. At the same time, I’ve been interested in going back to relearn programming (taking courses and what not). 
I currently own a gaming PC and sure it meets my needs when it comes to performance and gaming. The problem is that sometimes I do not want to work on my desk every time.
My current work is completely CAD design and I do not get to work on many places other than my office desk. Back when I was in school I used to go public libraries and coffee shops and I kind of miss that. 
I was considering the following laptops based on my needs and what I have:
-T14 Gen 2 AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U 
     I think is a good option to do basic CAD, using the 3D slicer and basic programming. If needed to do heavy stuff then my PC would take its place.
- T14 GEN 5 AMD Ryzen 7 
     Is pricey (not my favorite option), now since it has 2 Thunderbolt 4 I was considering selling my PC and later making an eGPU if the iGPU does not give me enough for what I need?
Maybe the eGPU is too much? But Idk that is why I am making this post.

I’ve seen A LOT of Thinkpad with Intel CPU’s on ebay, but they seem to be dislike within the community. Please tell me the reasons of why is this?
I chose AMD because my gaming PC has it and it has never given me any problems. 

Thank you for the help in advance!",1,1738584727.0,thinkpad,0,1.0,False

So, this movie was suggested to me on this sub. It sounded interesting enough, maybe there was a spooky cursed coffee table or something. It seemed a bit like Hereditary, with the movie being scary because of a dying relationship. 


Spoilers ahead:

I was enjoying the performances, with Estefanía de los Santos kind of blowing me away. But then.. the camera focused on the glass of the coffee table. Focused on how wobbly the glass was.

Then the camera focused on the baby. I knew exactly what was going to happen. I looked it up, and I was completely right. I can't do it. I'm sorry for all the ""bleak"" and ""pitch black horror comedy"" enjoyers, but even reading what happened made me sick to my stomach.

Maybe some needed context: I have just gained two new baby family members. I just can't see babies get hurt. So, if you're like me, I can't recommend you to check it out. 

Moral of the story: Don't watch a movie just because it's popular. If you don't think you can handle something, then it's okay not to watch it. ",0,1738584659.0,horror,4,0.25,False

I’ve had some trouble over the last few years remaining in potential relationships. From long-term multiple-years through to casual+ - I’ve really struggled. It’s not a subject that I think can be broached too easily, and I’ve hummed and haah’d about breaking this because it is a source of some immense personal shame.

—

I’ve experienced it twice, as what was at the time a CisHet (Now CisPan) man that was maybe quite macho in how I acted. Rugby League player, can-do attitude, lifted and was strong at the gym - the gladiator mindset when it came to sports and to life. There was nothing that I couldn’t do and I got really good at maintaining that image as time went on.

One of the times I didnt even realise it was SA until after the fact. The first one was on a work trip whilst I was working at festivals up and down the country. This one was Royal Ascot - a race meeting at a pretty beautiful venue, I was working on coffee stands. As festival work oft leads to, off-shift we were in tents in a field drinking. A few drinks too many, I head to my tent to turn in for the night, I wake up with my clothes off, my tent door open and the next morning to stories that a woman I worked with had followed me in after I had clearly ‘had too many.’

Damaging for a few reasons - but this didnt hit me in the moment because I couldn’t remember it, I was shaky that day but then I wrote that off to being drunk and whilst I didnt realise it at the time, I internalised it and said well - I was drunk and I’m a man so obviously I didnt mind it.

Ah. Yeah.

The 2nd time (this one is more openly damaging to me), I realised what was happening in the moment, as I was sober. I had met a woman on Tinder, we had agreed to meet and at the time we were attracted to each other sexually - but I had very recently torn my ACL playing rugby. I was actually on crutches.

The vibes werent there for me in the evening to take things to an advanced stage because I was in a bit of pain, and so we went for some heavy petting and retired to bed. My crutches across from the bed, not quite in reach but like - there.

I wake to a strange feeling - I’m not 100% on what’s happening but I’m in that period of wakefulness where you’re kinda there, kinda not. I realise with a bit of shock that she’s down there performing oral on me whilst I’m asleep and my blood ran cold. I remember grunting and rolling onto my side to try and blag that I’m just rolling in my sleep and in this way moving myself away from her face. She grabbed my hip gently and pulled me back over and I freeze.

Like I’m a big guy. I’m bigger now but I was big and strong then, easily enough to physically remove them, but I’m absolutely unable to move. To this day I dont know why I reacted the way that I did - I’m not violent but I would jump in if there was a fight with rugby, right? I still cant fathom why I didnt go right ahead and remove her from me.

After the fact, I ‘woke up’ and excused myself to the shower. I ended up leaving the flat quite quickly afterwards, with her actually going so far as to walk me to a bus stop in the area. Upon getting home I texted her and said that what happened was not okay and that I didn’t want to see her again.

She responded with (to paraphrase, there was more to it): ‘You should have just said something, I thought you wanted it, you seemed to like it” and I was gobsmacked.

—

Im saying this now because I feel like I need to almost justify to myself that I oughtn’t feel anymore shame, or I at least ought to try not to. I want to shout my truth and be open with the world and myself that this is a problem that therapy is yet to solve. It was several years ago and I’m nowhere near done with it impacting my life. I thought that at one point I would have healed - as all emotional trauma heals but it’s different and I do carry the fear that maybe I’ll never actually be okay.

I’ve self-sabotaged things potentially starting for me over the last 2 years in particular because something - it can be a tone of voice, a hand motion, a phrase will set me off and not even consciously I’ll be done and it’s horrible. I love love, I love sex - it’s real fun but so many times over the last while I’ve just been absolutely hopeless at maintaining my relationships and friendships and whilst I probably oughtn’t - I then go on to carry around a lot of grief and guilt about it. It affects my socials - as much as I love the idea of it, KD is terrifying for me. It affects my friendships and I dont think I was ever really appreciative way back when of how it would affect me and continue to affect me through life.

There's been a lot of things like the UK Women's March in my area recently, I consider myself an intersectional feminist but I feel like modern feminism would exclude me if I were to try to lend my voice to the conversation around SA - because a big part of intersectional feminism is combatting the toxic masculinity that stopped me for years and years from admitting this even to myself, let alone anyone else. But if I were to bring it up, I'm taking feminism and making it about me which runs contrary to the whole point and I've honestly tied myself up in knots trying to figure out whether or not opening up about this serves me any purpose, or if it detracts from other important conversations.

Thank you for reading this far if you’ve managed to wade through my ramblings. Maybe say something nice below - I could probably use it in lieu of my next appointment. At the very least, this is catharsis - and however temporary it is my truth is up there, loudly.",1,1738584255.0,Survivors,0,1.0,False
1igniti,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1igniti/got_ghosteddid_i_deserve_it/,Got ghosted-did I deserve it?,"So this is a but long. But I seriously need a 3rd party to tell me if I did something wrong or if it was him. Or maybe a bit of both??

So I match with this guy in hinge back in October 15th ish. We hit it off. He’s currently in another state just about to move and he’s moving to the area that I am in.
 First month- is us just chatting on hinge. And the texting is long in-depth 1-2 paragraph messages from both of us. Maybe once or twice a day from both of us. We find we have a lot of the same likes and dislikes, values and morals and its great right. 

 Nov 11th ish-he finally moves in to the area I’m in and we actually go on a date that night he moved in. We went for dinner, explored his apartment, and just chatted for about 5hrs it was going to well. That week we go on 2 more dates that go just as well. 

Then I had to go out of town for 2 weeks. But get back, and have another amazing date and a couple hang outs after work with him. More chatting about what we both want, and like and he even suggests we take some trips together as we are both now relatively new to the area. He initiated it, was even looking at booking tickets. He even initiates some more intimacy. And I personally didn’t want to have sex so soon, I wanted to wait and clearly told him that to which he agreed he wanted to as well. It was all very openly discussed. 

So in my mind, I’m ready for him to ask me to be his gf, make a commitment. I know we are on the same page about values/morals/religion/finances even/and future plans like family and lifestyle. 

Dec5- texting him
Me: I asked if we are official? (I should have just asked what we are) 
Him: responded he wanted to wait and not rush things, that a couple months of dating would do us no harm. But was “100% interested in me and exclusively so, no on hinge, not planning on changing that. A couple months of dating won’t hurt us if we are in it for the long haul(which I definitely am) “
And I guess I was taken aback because he was doing all the boyfriend things and me all the girlfriend things. He was literally planning his work schedule to see what fits mine so we can do trips up through March of this year. But I did reflect, we’d only really been seeing each other for not even a month, he was probably right. And I said so, that thats a good idea. Then called me, he wanted to have the discussion over a call(which I really did appreciate). And the convo went something like this. 
Him: are you ok do you agree with what I said
Me: yea, I think I just misread some things, but agree with what you said. I think I just need to step back from some of the intimacy stuff (all we’d done was touchy stuff not actual sex as we both communicated we wanted to wait). 
Him: oh I wasn’t thinking that, but ok. 
Me: yea its ok. I think we just take a step back and focus on our friendship like you said, and  date for awhile longer. 
Him: *thinks for a bit* I guess I can’t really think of a reason why we shouldn’t be together though. 
Me: *half crying because I feel rejected and just wanting to do the right thing*Lets just focus on dating and getting to know each other, as you said and go from there. 
So he says ok, and then asks if I want to come over that night to which I do. 

That night I’m a little off, which I feel is normal, I just basically threw myself at a guy I had known for a month in person and was told I needed to slow down. But he then asks me if I want to be his gf. And I think I may have totally fuck this up, but also feel like I made the logical right decision. When he asked I told him: you dan’t really ask me now..I mean..I do..but I don’t want to make you ask me to be your gf. 
And then he says nothing and the convo just ended. And I’m fully aware that he could have felt offended by this but i just wanted to do the right thing. I didn’t want him feeling pressured to commit, since that morning he seemed pretty sure about dating longer before slapping a label on it.  

So the day after he tells me he's sick with a bug vomiting, which proceed to go on Dec 6,7,8. He sounded miserable and I hadn’t heard from him, though I understand he was sleeping and just resting up. Anyway I offered to bring him soup and did so that Monday Dec 9th. I put so much work into it and dropped it off, and he invited me in, and one thing led to the next and we almost had sex, but I stopped it. And then I left, but there were no bad vibes when I left. 

Throughout that week we just kinda hung out after work, and watched movies. It was still nice and he’d even drop by after his late night shifts for about 30mins or so before going home. 

Dec 12th I go to my door and he’s left me flowers. It was very sweet and I called and chatted with him a couple time that week too since we weren’t seeing each other. We are also texting a couple times a day, very lightly, nothing crazy and not really small talk.  Well then he asks and plans for us to go on an iceskating date Dec 14. I’m to stay at his place Dec 13th, get coffee with him Dec 14 morning and go ice skating. Mind he is a nurse so he works long hrs. 

Dec13-he cancels me staying over b/c work has been long but suggest stopping by later that night instead. He then doesn’t and I don’t here from him. -I’m no bothered I get that he’s tired I get it work was long and rough. 

Dec 14. Its 11:00 and still haven’t heard from him about time and plans for our date, so I text him to see how its going. Don’t hear back until 2:00pm. Then ask if we are still on for ice skating. Its now 3:00 and no answer. I already had a prior commitment at 6:00 that he knew about that evening so this date was not happening and I hate waiting for the guy who made the plans to let me know what was happening and just told him that I wasn’t feeling it. He was happy, said I was the best because he didn’t want to cancel it thinking I’d be let down. Well I was infact very much let down, he should have just told me when he got up that morning to tell me plans were canceled not waiting until mid afternoon. I played it off and just said its fine, we’ll reschedule

The next 2 days he doesn’t reach out or text so I message him to check in. He then suggests coming and visiting me Dec 17 

Dec 17-he visits, is exhausted from work and sleep for awhile then starts making out and tries having sex again, to which I told him no. We’d discussed it. But I did ask-“Are we going to have sex?”. 
Him: We shouldn’t

And I really wanted to ask if sex was a deal breaker for him. Because despite communicating and agreeing with me about not having sex. He was still initiating it. And I’m ok with all the external stuff, and touching but he’d keep going to where I thought we were actually going to do it. 
I’m also leaving Dec 23rd to go home for the holidays so I ask if I can see him again, he’s off Dec 11th, but says he can’t he has a report to write (he had this a week ago and was working on it). 

So later he leaves after just chatting. And then I heard nothing from him the next couple days. I had sent him an instagram reel a few days ago-unopened, same with a snapchat,both of which we were consistently sending, but nothing excessive. Like one or 2 a day. 
Come Friday I ask if he wanted to hang out, but he’s working everyday that week. 12hr shifts every day so I know he’s tired. And he makes no effort to see me that I guess thats that. 

I text him I’m leaving and then ghosted the entire Christmas week. I accept that he’s lost interest. But he still has my pot I made the soup I made him. That pot is expensive so I just ask if I can get it back. And he drops it off after work. (Dec 30). He takes no move to try to knock on the door and talk to me just walks away. And he knows I’m home. I watched him walk away and it hurt so much. 

2 weeks later Jan 12. I text him. (Maybe I shouldn’t have but I couldn’t figure out what happened. 
Me: What happened between up
Him: Idk i think some bad communicating habits on my part. I’m watching lord of the rings if you want to join. 
Me: hmmmm
Him: that sounds like a loaded “hmm”. Considerate it a belated birthday. (His bday)
Me: No. 

I tried keeping it short and sweet. I feel like all the advise you get here is “silence is the best communication” and I just couldn’t believe he’d ghost me after what felt like love bombing, and then when I reached out he asks to hang out, but in a non intentional like “i want to see you” way. And also request it as a bday present. Like wtf. I had also checked his hinge profile and one of his pictures had changed. 


Anyway its been a month since he dropped off the pot. I think I actually loved the guy. And it just hurts so much. And its ridiculous. I knew the guy for such a short time. 

I just need to know what you all think. What did I do wrong? Or was it really just him being an asshole or a player. Idk. I can’t figure it out. I keep replaying every-bit in my mind.  I just need some peace. 

I feel like I should have just said yes when he asked me to be his gf, maybe saying no made it worse? Maybe the soup was too much? Maybe I should have said yes to seeing him and watching lord of the rings? I wanted to soo badly. But all the evidence told me that he didn’t care about me.

Its difficult to tell all the specifics but in hindsight i think she knew that he was dangerous and didnt want me to protect myself. 

And now im at a point in my life that i finally want to be free from her influence but how? 

Ive been suffering from chronic fatigue for almost 20 years and i think its because of her treatment. She ruined every phase in my life that was supposed to be good. Like i remember how i was happy when i was 20 and moving out from my parents to study. She called me all the time and asked ridiculous questions like if i have brushed my teeth. 
One day i was sleeping in my university dorm and then she called during day when i didnt have classes. I told her that i had been sleeping. Then she yelled through the phone that next time i come home she will take me to a doctor and i will have to do a drug test. She accused me of taking drugs and thats why being tired during the day. To this day i have never taken drugs other than cigarettes (and coffee of you will).

 These are just rather small incidents compared to everything she did, but they just resurface now. She really ruined so much. And now after the abuse last year i really dont want to deal with her anymore as much as possible. But: like many people with cptsd i have very few social contacts. I depend for many things on my parents (not financially) for example when i have a serious flu and i cant take care of myself. Or the holidays like Christmas, i just dont want to be alone all the time. And sometimes its even ok or even good to spend time with her but often it comes with a cost.

1igni2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/grittytruth/comments/1igni2j/the_mourning_sunshine/,The Mourning Sunshine,"Grief woke up with me again,
pulled the sheets off my shoulders,
let the cold creep in.

The sun poured through the window—
too bright, too yellow,
like it hadn’t read the obituary,
like it didn’t know
today wasn’t a day for shining.

But grief doesn’t negotiate with the weather.
It doesn’t care if the birds are singing
or if the sky looks like a goddamn Monet.
It just sits there,
settled in my bones,
waiting for the next reason to stay.

I drink my coffee slow,
watch the steam rise,
watch the light crawl across the floor,
and wonder—

Will mourning
and morning
ever mean
two different things again?

They tell me sunshine is hope,
that warmth is a promise,
that time will do its work
like some patient sculptor
chiseling away the ache.

But I have learned—
light doesn’t erase shadows.
It only makes them sharper.

So I sit in the glow of the day,
in the ghost of something golden,
and pour grief a cup too.

1igngps,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1igngps/aitah_for_letting_a_girl_pay_for_the_date_before/,AITAH for letting a girl pay for the date before breaking up with her?,"So just to be very upfront about this, this happened many years ago. I'm happily married so there aren't gonna be updates or anything. I just had an argument about this with my wife, since I say this was me being an AH in my youth, while she claims it's not that bad. 

So this happened when I was 23. I was a student at uni, and to be blunt - I thought I was deeply broken and was going to die alone. I was ugly as sin (still am), but I was charming, funny, friendly and overall thought I wasn't a bad catch. Still - I was often being rejected for dates & my confidence was kinda shot. 

Then my friend approached me - apparatly he and this girl decided to set eaxh other up, so they showed each other pics of their single friends on Facebook, and for some ungodly reason she chose me. My friend showed me pics of her and went ""would you like to go on a date with her?"" And he shows me a pic of this girl, and she seemed absolutely lovely. So I said ""Yes! Hell yes! God yes! OMFG yes!""
The one caveat was that she lived in a bit of a shithole 2 hours away by car. Not something that was gonna deter someone as desperate...errr... I mean as determined as me. 

So we talked on the phone and we kind of hit it off. We were going to meet that Friday night and we'd spend hours on the phone every day. Literally hours. This was before unlimited phone plans so that stuff was hella expensive too. The one red flag I noticed was that she insisteted we keep talking way past the point I'd hint I needed to go. 

Friday came, and I rented a car, or rather my parents rented it for me since I was broke AF. I drove the 2 hours and since I didn't really know the town, I let her pick the spot. She took me to a bar where we drank some cocktails (mocktails for me since I had to drive), and had an overall nice time. It was around midnight when we asked for the check. Then shit went sideways.

I offered to pay, and she insisted we split the bill, since in her words - if she let me pay, she'd feel she owed me sex. I told her no problem and we can split the bill. Except then - it turned out the bar didn't accept credit because of some internet issue or something, and she didn't have cash. I again offered to pay, because I didn't want to make a thing out of it, but she was insistent, so we convinced the bartender to let us leave to find an ATM. We walked for an hour until we did. Then it turned out that in her tipsy state she didn't remember her PIN. She tried. She tried again. Finally she was sure she had it... only for the ATM to swallow her card.

We walked an hour back. It was past 2am, the bar was closing and I paid for us both. I drove her home and then went off on my own 2 hour drive home - arriving at almost 5 in the morning. I crashed into bed, only to have to get up at 7 to return the rental car. By the time I got back from THAT it was 9am and again, I crashed into my bed, only to be woken up at 10, because she called to tell me she had a wonderful time. Again we kept talking for 2 hours, and she wouldn't let me hang up, so much so that at noon, when I had plans to meet friends for lunch (and report on the date), she actually had the nerve to passive-aggresively say ""well fine, if you'd rather go hang with your friends than talk to ME. Have fun!"" And it wasn't a joke either. 

As I told my friends I was getting a kinda bad vibe, and thought I should break it off, one said ""the way I see it - her only issue is that she likes you too much. You owe her at least a second date."" Again, that entire week we kept talking for HOURS on the phone, where she refused to let me hang up. I was volunteering at a women's shelter at the time, which caused her to go on a jealous rant about me ""prioritizing other women over her"". Still, we set up a date for that Friday. The plan was that she'd drive over to my city, we'd have coffee, then she'd go for family dinner & meet back up with me after. I did the math. This meant sex. 

As she picked me up I knew I had to break it off. She was far too intense for me, and having sex with her at that point would just feel like taking advantage of her. But also - she took me to an isolated place to some coffee she swore was amazing and I was basically trapped there with her. I wanted to get coffee and bail. She insisted they served the best roast beef sandwich ever and I HAD to order it. So she ordered it for me. In her defense - It was a pretty good sandwich. I offered to pay since I knew there wasn't going to be a 3rd daye, but she insisted on paying, so I let her to avoid the argument. So we ate and I was hoping she'd just take me home, but no. There was a couch there, so she pushed me unto it and began aggressively cuddling with me. It was kinda uncomfortable. 

Eventually she did take me home. At that point I knew I had to break up with her, so as I was getting out of the car I told her ""look, this isn't really working. You're lovely but I don't feel like this is IT."" And left.

She called me a few minutes later, and I made the mistake of picking up. She said she was still sitting in her car under my apartment. I owe her to at least come down and ""talk it out"". I again made the mistake of agreeing.

She spent the next two hours yelling at me. She told me she didn't understand how I could feel rgis wasn't it when I spent HOURS talking to her. I told her ""well... I'm a pretty good conversationalist"". She did not much like that.
She told me my relationship with my mom was unhealthy (Fair)
She told me I'm pushing her away because I always push away the people who love me the most, to which I replied that we went on 2 dates and what the hell is she on about.
She told me I was the most virginal virgin to ever virgin into her life (ouch).
She finished by saying me she wanted to slap me. To which I, at this point feeling like shit, told her ""okay. Do you want to just slap me? Would it help you feel better?"" To which she replied ""no, I want to kiss you.""

At that point I exited the vehicle because honestly this stopped feeling like a conversation between adults and started feeling like some insane teen drama. I haven't heard from her since, but months later the friend who introduced us said I ""caused her to lose faith in men"".

Still, it wasn't all bad - having her be THIS into me actually helped boost my confidence quite a bit, which eventually led to me asking out the woman who became my wife. And to the best of my knowledge that women is married as well. 

Still - to me I was something of an AH because I feel like if I had been more clear & assertive all throughout, she probably wouldn't have had such a terrible experience. My wife, meanwhile, says SHE was the AH, and I was just overwhelmed and I didn't really do anything wrong.

Eight years ago, I was at a Norwood 3, but my beautiful wife suggested I just buzz cut it at a 2 blade and that she found it very attractive.  So I did.  Three years later, she was involved in a catastrophic car accident that left her paralyzed from the neck down, and I had to transition quickly into the role of caregiver.  I quickly began to loose my hair, very likely due to the stress.  My wife succumbed to her injuries about 18 months ago and she passed away.  As I recovered from the devastation, I decided to begin a self care regiment to improve my health.  I had gained 35 pounds due to the sedentary lifestyle of being a caretaker and I wanted to return to my ideal weight and to feel better.  One manner of doing this was to incorporate MCT oil into my morning coffee to produce ketones to improve my weight loss.  I've also improved my diet.  I have lost 27 pounds and need another 8 more to reach my ideal weight.  However, an interesting thing I noticed was that my hair started to return.  After some research, I found out that MCT oils, especially lauric acid, have been shown to block the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.   And of course, DHT is a leading cause of male pattern baldness.  Additionally, my 3 teen-age sons noticed that my hair was returning as well and challenged me to try to regrow my hair.

So, I accepted the challenge, and I started the Hims combination chewable tablet course four weeks ago.  I do the daily chewable, and I also micro-needle at 0.7 mm twice a week with a derma-stamp.  I noticed a difference in my scalp and I started to feel a peach fuzz on the baldest parts of my head, the crown.  I took a picture and noticed small hairs protruding.

I don't want to be disillusioned, so I'm asking for honest opinions on whether this is the beginning of regrowth or if it is just normal status quo.  My intent was to keep the Hims regiment for six months and then consider a hair transplantation procedure to complete my hair restoration.  I didn't experience much shedding and I believe that this may have happened earlier due to the MCT effect earlier, which I seem to remember briefly.

Achieving a brighter, more radiant smile through teeth whitening is an exciting experience that can boost your confidence and transform your appearance. However, the hours and days immediately following a teeth whitening treatment require careful consideration of your diet to maintain those stunning results and prevent sensitivity. Many people are unsure about what foods are safe to consume after this cosmetic dental procedure, which can lead to accidental staining or discomfort. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about post-teeth whitening nutrition, ensuring you protect your newly brightened smile while satisfying your hunger.

What to Know About Post-Teeth Whitening Diet

After a professional teeth whitening treatment, your tooth enamel becomes temporarily more porous and susceptible to staining. This means you'll need to be extra cautious about your food and drink choices to maintain your brilliant white smile. The first 48 hours are crucial in preventing new stains and managing potential sensitivity.

Safe Foods to Eat After Teeth Whitening

1. White and Neutral-Colored Foods
The key to your post-whitening diet is to stick to **white and light-colored foods** that won't transfer color to your teeth. These include:
- White rice
- Chicken
- Turkey
- Plain yogurt
- Egg whites
- Tofu
- Cauliflower
- Mashed potatoes

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

2. Soft Foods for Minimal Sensitivity
If you're experiencing tooth sensitivity, opt for soft foods that require minimal chewing:
- Smoothies
- Applesauce
- Pudding
- Cottage cheese
- Soft-cooked vegetables
- Oatmeal

Understanding the ""White Diet"" Principle

The **white diet** is a crucial concept for maintaining your teeth whitening results. This approach involves consuming foods and beverages that are white or very light in color to prevent potential staining. Think of it as a temporary eating strategy that protects your investment in a brighter smile.

Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening

To ensure the best possible results, steer clear of:
- Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine, cola)
- Colored sauces (tomato sauce, soy sauce)
- Dark fruits (berries, pomegranates)
- Chocolate
- Colored condiments
- Heavily spiced foods

Hydration and Teeth Whitening Recovery

Water is your best friend during the post-whitening recovery period. **Drink plenty of clear, room-temperature water** to help:
- Rinse away potential staining particles
- Reduce sensitivity
- Support overall oral health
- Prevent dehydration

Nutritional Tips for Teeth Whitening Aftercare

1. Choose Light-Colored Proteins
- Chicken breast
- White fish
- Egg whites
- Tofu

2. Opt for Mild Dairy Products
- Plain yogurt
- Cottage cheese
- Vanilla pudding
- White cheese

Managing Sensitivity Through Diet

Some individuals experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening. To manage this:
- Consume room-temperature foods
- Avoid extremely hot or cold items
- Choose soft, easily chewable foods
- Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers if recommended by your dentist

Professional Recommendations

Dental professionals typically suggest following the white diet for at least 48 hours after treatment. However, the longer you can maintain these dietary guidelines, the better your results will be.

Timeline for Dietary Restrictions

- First 24 hours: Most restrictive white diet
- 24-48 hours: Gradually introduce light-colored foods
- After 48 hours: Slowly return to normal diet

When to Consult Your Dentist

If you experience:
- Prolonged sensitivity
- Unexpected pain
- Unusual reactions to foods
- Concerns about your whitening results

Always reach out to your dental professional for personalized advice.

1ign8pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1ign8pe/build_a_fully_extensible_agent_into_your_slack_in/,Build a fully extensible agent into your Slack in under 5 minutes,"I've spent the last two years building agents full time with a team of fellow AI engineers. One of the first things our team built in early 2023 was a multi-agent platform built to tackle workflows via inter agent collaboration. Suffice to say, we've been at this long enough to have a perspective on what's hype and what's substance... and one of the more powerful agent formats we've come across during our time is simply having an agent in Slack.    
  
Here's why we like this agent format (documentation on how to build one yourself in the comments) - 

**Accessibility Drives Adoption.** 

While, you may have built a powerful agentic workflow, if it's slow or cumbersome to access, then reaping the benefits will be slow and cumbersome. Love it or hate it, messaging someone on Slack is fast, intuitive, and slots neatly into many people's day to day workflows. Minimizing the need to update behaviors to get real benefits is a big win! Plus the agent is accessible via mobile out of the box. 

**Excellent Asynchronous UX.**

One of the most practical advantages is the ability to initiate tasks and retrieve results asynchronously. The ability to simply message your agent(then go get coffee) and have it perform research for you in the background and message you when done is downright...addicting.   
  
**Instant Team Integration.**

If it's useful to you, it'll probably be useful to your team. You can build the agent to be collaborative by design or have a siloed experience for each user. Either way, teammates can invite the agent to their slack instantly. It's quite a bit more work to create secure collaborative environment to access to an agent outside of Slack, so it's nice that it comes free out of the box. 

The coolest part though is that you can spin up your own Slack agent, with your own models, logic, etc. in under 5 minutes.  I know Slack (Salesforce) has their own agents, but they aren't 'your agent'. This is your code, your logic, your model choices... truly your agent. Extend it to the moon and back.

This feels like supporting those who have naturally more revenue than mine.

I have been having chest/sternum pain for 6 months daily. I have had an endoscopy in September 2024 and diagnosed grade a reflux esophagitis and small hiatal hernia. Dr said hernia should not cause me these symptoms. Was prescribed omeprazole + famotidine for 1 month, but 12 days in the omeprazole gave me severe chest pains so I stopped, and went back to what I was eating. My chest hurts when moving, sometimes if I press on it, it sometimes pops/clicks with movement, and just generally feels sore.

I was diagnosed with costochondritis at the hospital a few weeks later, took naproxen for 12 days but this did not solve the issue. Had an ECG and chest x ray which came back normal. The chest pains are my only symptom, **no heartburn or reflux at all**, sometimes I find myself burping after meals. So I get confused if it's reflux related or stress.

I did a lansoprazole + famotidine 2 week course in january, then went to omeprazole for the past 11 days. No coffee for 2 months. No fizzy drinks, chocolate, fried food for 1 month. Chamomile tea, water and oats with non acidic healthy dinners.

I have anxiety/depression am under a lot of stress the past 6 months which I feel has made things worse. Im in therapy which helps. Tried an SSRI for 7 weeks but it did not help my chest pains apart from the first few days. I walk daily.

There is no improvement, the PPI helps for the first few days then it starts to cause me chest pain in the morning, why could this be?

I am really not sure what to do, nothing helps, doctors do not know what to do. I have been to urgent care twice.

The chest pains are my only symptom, no heartburn or reflux, sometimes I find myself burping after meals. So I get confused i

I did a lansoprazole + famotidine 2 week course in january, then went to omeprazole for the past 11 days. No coffee for 2 months. No fizzy drinks, chocolate, fried food for 1 month. Chamomile tea, water and oats with non acidic healthy dinners. 

  
I have anxiety/depression am under a lot of stress the past 6 months which I feel has made things worse. Im in therapy which helps. Tried an SSRI for 7 weeks but it did not help my chest pains apart from the first few days. I walk daily.

There is no improvement, the PPI helps for the first few days then it starts to cause me chest pain in the morning, why could this be?

I am really not sure what to do, nothing helps, doctors dont know what to do. I have been to urgent care twice.

I went to the dentist, and before even trying he just said, ‘I won’t be able to remove that, it’ll be there for life’ essentially.

Well I have a scale and polish, and I can see where there are now scraping lines etc over the stain. So I feel like he maybe just didn’t try particularly hard?

Online it says these stains should really be able to be removed, I’m fairly young and my teeth are decent enough.

Just didn’t know if anyone could maybe recommend me a second opinion?

1igmtly,https://www.reddit.com/r/DovesSocials/comments/1igmtly/aita_for_reconnecting_with_my_high_school/,AITA for Reconnecting with My High School Sweetheart After 10 Years and Confusing My Current Partner?,"So, a bit of a backstory: I (30F) met my high school sweetheart, James (30M), when I was 15. We were absolutely inseparable during our **high school** years. You know that kind of **love** that feels like it’s going to last forever? That was us. We made all sorts of future plans—college, careers, kids, the whole shebang. Then, right before we were supposed to graduate, he broke up with me. Out of nowhere. No explanation, just “I think we’re better off as friends.”

To say I was devastated would be an understatement. I had no idea what went wrong, and I spent years overanalyzing that moment, trying to figure out what I did or what changed. James moved to another state for college, and we lost touch completely.

Fast forward 10 years. I’ve had a few **relationships** since then, but none of them lasted. I’d been living with my boyfriend, Tom (32M), for the past three years. Tom is everything you’d want in a partner—steady, dependable, kind, and caring. He’s always been supportive, and I’ll admit, I thought I was in a comfortable, safe relationship. But there’s always been a little part of me that felt like something was missing.

Then, out of the blue, James reached out to me on Facebook. My **heart** skipped a beat when I saw his name pop up in my **notifications**. He messaged, saying he’d been thinking about me and hoped we could catch up after all these years. I didn’t know what to do at first, but after some internal debate, I agreed. I mean, who wouldn’t be curious about their first love after all this time, right?

We started texting, and before I knew it, we were having long conversations about everything that had happened in our lives since high school. He told me that he never **stopped** thinking about me, that he regretted how things ended between us, and that life hadn’t been the same without me. He apologized profusely for how he ended things. It turns out, he had some personal issues back then and didn’t know how to deal with them, so he **pushed** me away. I understood, but at the same time, it felt like my heart was doing somersaults.

A couple of weeks later, we arranged to meet in person. I thought it would be a quick **catch-up**, a ""hello"" and ""goodbye,"" but it turned into something much more intense. We met at a coffee shop, and it felt like no time had passed. When we talked, it was like we had never been apart. I felt that old spark I hadn’t felt in years. The **chemistry** was still there—stronger than I’d remembered.

Now, here's where things get messy. I’ve been going back and forth between the two men. James and I have been talking more frequently, and honestly, it feels like we’ve picked up right where we left off. There’s this **undeniable** pull toward him, and part of me feels like I never really got closure from what we had. We’ve been texting about meeting up again soon, and I can tell that James wants to explore the possibility of us rekindling things.

But I’m with Tom. And I love him—at least, I think I do. He’s my rock, my stability, but it’s hard to ignore this intense **connection** I’m feeling with James. Tom has no idea that I’m reconnecting with my ex. He knows about our history, and he’s always been supportive of my past, but I can’t help but feel **guilty** every time I talk to James. It feels like I’m lying to Tom, even though we haven’t done anything physical. But emotionally? I can’t deny it, I’m torn.

I don’t want to hurt Tom, but at the same time, I’m wondering if I’m missing something deeper with James. I don’t want to go down a path of regret. I don’t know if I should tell Tom about James, or if I should just let things unfold and see where it goes.

So, AITA for even considering reconnecting with my high school **sweetheart** and potentially jeopardizing my relationship with Tom? Should I be upfront with Tom, or am I just being selfish and acting on nostalgia?

I genuinely don’t know what to do here, and I need some advice.

1igms8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1igms8o/could_colombian_cannabis_become_the_next_big/,Could Colombian Cannabis Become the Next Big Thing in Europe?,"Colombia’s cannabis market has had a tumultuous journey to date, with just a fraction of its potential as a global cultivation powerhouse being fulfilled.

Flawed regulation, bureaucracy and the negative perception of its cannabis exports have hampered its development, despite regulation for legal cannabis production being introduced in 2016.

However, as discussed in *Prohibition Partners’* new[ Global Cannabis Report: 5th Edition](https://prohibitionpartners.com/reports/the-global-cannabis-report-5th-edition/?__hstc=4138415.4cb3e07bab06d167344b1086fb90107a.1730470615972.1738324847688.1738580931954.17&__hssc=4138415.1.1738580931954&__hsfp=978121169), recent regulatory changes and export growth have renewed hope for Colombian businesses and farmers.

One such business, [Cansultancy](https://cansultancy.com/), is hoping to capitalise on this renewed hope and show the world what Colombian cannabis can offer.

“We know Colombian genetics and cultivars are phenomenal—unique products that the world hasn’t seen before. Our goal is to make Colombia the first choice for large-scale purchasers in Europe,” they told *Business of Cannabis.* 

# Colombia’s market

After regulations for cannabis cultivation were introduced in 2016, some 2500 licences were awarded, covering some 10,000 hectares of farmland.

Despite this, by 2023, just 40 of these licensed companies were operational, and just 15 hectares were being actively farmed.

Consultancy’s Eduardo Munoz, who grew up in Colombia, explained: “At the beginning of the cannabis process in Colombia, growers were primarily preparing for what was expected to be a strong internal market. Unfortunately, due to bureaucracy and political misunderstandings, the internal market hasn’t gained much traction.”

New regulatory shifts aim to revitalise the domestic industry. In September 2024, Decree 821 was amended to permit the sale of cannabis flowers for medical treatments within Colombia, a move expected to benefit local producers.

However, most producers have already turned towards international markets, which promise both greater demand and greater margins.

In 2021, the country lifted its ban on the export of dried cannabis flower. But, following initial optimism, the growth in exported Colombian cannabis has slowed over the last few years.

In 2023, Colombia reported over US$10.8 million in exports, an increase from US$8.4 million in 2022 and US$4.2 million in 2021.

Of the total exports from 2023, 32% went to Brazil, 25% to Australia, and 14% to Germany, with those three countries therefore totalling 71% of Colombian cannabis exports.

# Making Colombian cannabis the ‘first choice’ for Europe

Cansultancy, a cannabis brokerage firm based in Canada, recently acquired Colombia’s Farmadiol with a view to establish a presence and build relationships with local growers in the market.

Its Canadian founder, Michael Athill, who has been brokering deals and facilitating transactions in Canada for a number of years, told us: “In Canada, based on my experience, the market tends to focus internally first, then externally. Unfortunately, what often happens is second-rate products are sent overseas, while the best products stay in Canada.”

His partner, Eduardo, continued: “The dynamic in Colombia is different. We don’t have an internal market for cannabis. It’s like our coffee: Colombia produces some of the best coffee in the world, but we can’t afford to consume the best ourselves, so it’s exported. With cannabis, there is no domestic market at all, so exporting the best is our only option.”

Recognising the opportunity of the country’s ‘globally untapped cultivars,’ the pair are working to build a trusted network of local craft producers in the country, with a view to exporting cannabis into Europe.

This requires producers to meet the stringent GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practices) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) expected by European buyers.

“When we first entered Colombia, one of our key mandates was to figure out how to truly support these farmers. Historically, buyers—referred to as “buccaneers”—would take products from farmers without respect, sometimes paying late or not at all. This created a sense of mistrust and instability,” Michael explained.

“Our approach is different. Eduardo, being Colombian himself, and our local team have worked to build a trust network with these growers. We’re not just buyers—we’re partners.”



The bridges built between the growers and the company were based on Cansultancy’s efforts to guide them through the process of obtaining these certifications.

Eduardo said: “We’ve helped growers adopt GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practices) certifications, which are now more common and better understood in Colombia. Additionally, we’re collaborating with two labs in Colombia that are working towards achieving EU GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certification, aiming to eventually have the first EU GMP-certified facilities in the country.

“These labs are also partnering with GMP-certified labs in Europe to streamline the process, ensuring that the final packaging meets European standards.”

Growers, he continued, are now starting to recognise the importance of formalising their operations to access international markets.

“The techniques and genetics have always been there—it was just about raising standards and preparing for export.”

With this network now in place, the pair are looking to take their first steps into Europe, hoping to showcase not only Colombia’s unique cultivars but the farmers’ ‘deep knowledge and exceptional ability to produce high-quality cannabis products’.

“We want to help export not only their flowers but also their genetics and cultivars to Europe. We aim to expose the world to these incredible Colombian genetics, cultivars, and growers—people whose work has often gone unnoticed. We are fortunate to have exclusive access to some of these hidden gems, and we’re excited to share their potential with the world.”

Naturally, we all hang out quite often (lunch breaks etc.). In my case, I got quite close to a certain friend (31 M). Over time, we became quite attached - texting every day, hanging out, inside jokes, talking about our issues (he shared some very sensitive and personal stuff about his life with me, things our other friends do not know about)... to a point where I developed a crush on him. I texted him this before Christmas, saying that I ofc will get rid of the crush during the winter break - yes, I know, bad move. He reacted neutrally and said he was glad I felt comfy enough to tell him this. It got slightly awkward afterwards, but only for 3 days. Then we picked up where we left it and chatted every day (sometimes till 3 AM). Once we returned to the country we work in, we met and it was... slightly flirty. Then our texts shifted to a rather spicy vibe. And a week after that, we slept with each other. I had some ONS before that so I know the difference between a casual s\*x and something deeper (and in this case, it was the latter). All seemed good till the moment he was leaving: that's when the mood shifted to something more reserved. 

The next day, our usual chats stopped significantly. I tried approaching carefully, sending a meme he reacted to \*12\* hours later. The next day, I noticed he was avoiding me at work. I wrote to him in the evening, asking if he is okay. He replied later, saying a lot is going on in his life. When I offered to meet for a casual ""venting"" coffee, he declined - the next day -, saying he was busy. So - I gave him a total space for the next week, being very hurt. Then I decided to approach him and ask him for a reason for his actions and nothing more. I had to do it through texts cus again, he was actively avoiding me. I specifically mentioned how hurt I am especially over the fact that I considered him to be a great friend for many months. Long story short, he still views me as a great friend too. But admitted he felt very bad after sleeping with me, that he broke up with his ex two months prior (I did not know that) and that it made him spiral mentally. He supposedly did not reach out because he felt anxious and was overthinking. I did not dig deeper, only said he broke my trust and I want nothing to do with him anymore. He was very apologetic throughout the whole conversation and said to reach out if I changed my mind. 

Now, I want to move on but still wonder whether the reason he gave me is legit, or if he really just played me (as some of my friends think so). What else could play the role tho? And was there anything I could have done to salvage the friendship? Or did I make the right move? Is there any way back? Thx. :)

TLDR: Had a great friend, developed a crush on him, we eventually slept with each other, he started avoiding me, said he was anxious and not over his previous relationship, and I broke things off.

Then at the end of the first night I took her at her home with taxi 
A kiss but not French kiss

When after 5’ she said this guy as I was waiting for you talked to me he was from uk and told me I have good accent and my English is good . And I said I’m proud my woman has admirers who love her English 
She liked it but I didn’t like it as she was waiting for me so .. anyways 

So she wants me to come again in 14 February because she cannot trust me soon , and she cannot come to my country if she does not see I’m serious . 
I accepted because I wnat her and want to get laid with her

Also about video calls she has not WiFi and cannot go to balcony in such weather to talk. 

Aren’t these red flags 🚩 like dating others ? Because she told me she likes it that I don’t make her feel jealous as I look deep in her eyes and only her when we are out so she feels unsafe because it’s unreal

I don’t know 
How to handle it ? I think in hidden I will keep my options open and also keep dating other women too

Creative Ideas for Designing a Valentine's Candy Bouquet
--------------------------------------------------------

When Valentine's Day rolls around, gifting something special becomes a delightful adventure. One of the most popular options is a Valentine’s candy bouquet. This unique gift combines the sweet treats lovers adore with an artistic presentation. Here are some creative ideas to help you design a stunning candy bouquet that will make anyone swoon!

### Choosing the Right Container

Your first step is selecting an eye-catching container for your candy bouquet. Here are some choices:

- **Decorative Vase:** A classic option that can be personalized with paint or embellishments.
- **Flower Pot:** Use a terra cotta pot and decorate it with ribbon or hearts to fit the theme.
- **Basket:** Baskets give a rustic feel that can also be adorned with flowers or fabric.
- **Heart-Shaped Containers:** These add an extra romantic touch and can enhance the Valentine's theme.

### Selecting the Candy

Next, the right candy selection is essential. Think about your loved one's preferences. Here are some tasty options:

- **Chocolate Bars:** A classic choice, you can use various types like milk, dark, or even gourmet selections.
- **Gummy Candies:** Fun and colorful, these add a playful touch to your bouquet.
- **Heart-Shaped Lollipops:** These are perfect for the occasion and can serve as decoration and treat.
- **Small Boxes of Chocolates:** These can act as focal points in your arrangement.

### Creating the Structure

Now, it’s time to build the structure of your candy bouquet. To ensure a balanced and appealing arrangement, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Base Material:** Start with floral foam or a block of Styrofoam to hold the candy in place securely.
2. **Height Variation:** Insert candies at varying heights for an eye-catching visual effect.
3. **Greenery:** Add greenery, such as fake leaves or flowers, to break up the candy and add a touch of nature.
4. **Cluster Candies:** Group similar candies together to create clusters, making it easier for your gift to stand out.

### Personal Touches

Adding personal touches can elevate your candy bouquet even more. Here are some ideas:

- **Photos:** Mini photos of you and your loved one can be added to lollipop sticks around the bouquet.
- **Messages:** Write sweet love notes on small cards and attach them to the candies.
- **Decorative Ribbons:** Use ribbons to tie sections together or create bows, enhancing the bouquet’s charm.
- **Themed Decor:** Incorporate hearts, glitter, or themed stickers to match the Valentine’s vibe.

### Strategic Placement

Placement is key to presenting your Valentine’s candy bouquet beautifully. Consider these options:

- **Gift Package:** Wrap the bouquet in cellophane for a presentable look.
- **Table Centerpiece:** Position it on a dining or coffee table to create an inviting atmosphere.
- **Gift Alongside Other Treats:** Pair your bouquet with a box of chocolates or wine for a lovely surprise.

### Making It Last

To make the candy bouquet last longer, here are a few quick tips:

- **Seal the Edges:** If possible, seal any openings with tape or glue to maintain freshness.
- **Enjoy Soon:** Remind your loved one to enjoy the treats within a reasonable time to avoid spoilage.

With these creative ideas for designing a Valentine’s candy bouquet, you can impress your special someone. Each thoughtful detail shows how much you care, making your gift not just a sweet treat, but also a memorable experience that they’ll cherish. Whether it's for a partner, a friend, or family, a candy bouquet can make anyone feel loved and appreciated on Valentine’s Day.

Candy bouquets have become a delightful gift option, merging the joy of sweets with the creativity of floral arrangements. Their rich history and growing popularity speak to both the emotional resonance of gifting and the innovative approaches we take in celebrating special occasions.

The concept of gifting candy dates back to ancient civilizations. Historically, candy was made primarily from honey and fruits. These sugary treats were often reserved for important figures and gods. As civilizations evolved, so did the method of creating candies, leading to the wide array of confections that we see today. Candy bouquets tap into this long-standing tradition, transforming sweets into a visually striking gift.

During the mid-20th century, the art of creating candy bouquets began to gain traction. Florists and bakers combined their talents, creating arrangements that featured chocolates, gummy bears, and lollipops—all elegantly designed to resemble floral bouquets. These edible displays provided a unique gift option, especially for occasions like Valentine's Day, birthdays, and even anniversaries.

Here are some reasons why candy bouquets have exploded in popularity:

- **Personalization:** Candy bouquets can be customized to fit the recipient's favorite candies or colors. This personal touch adds a layer of thoughtfulness that traditional gifts might lack.
- **Visual Appeal:** The vibrant colors and fun shapes of candies make these bouquets a feast for the eyes. They create a sense of excitement and joy, making them perfect for celebrations.
- **Edible Treat:** Unlike traditional flower bouquets that wilt over time, candy bouquets are entirely consumable, ensuring that your gift will be enjoyed rather than merely admired.
- **Versatile for Occasions:** Candy bouquets are suitable for various occasions—from romantic evenings to children's parties—making them a versatile option for anyone looking to make a sweet gesture.

Moreover, the rise of social media platforms has played a significant role in bringing candy bouquets into the spotlight. Users often share images of these stunning edible arrangements, inspiring others to seek out similar gifts. It’s not uncommon to see hashtag campaigns focusing on creativity and personalization amplifying the popularity of DIY candy bouquets.

Besides their aesthetic qualities, candy bouquets also cater to a wide range of tastes. Whether it's chocolate lovers, sour candy enthusiasts, or those who adore gummy treats, there is a candy bouquet for everyone. This ability to cater to various preferences further solidifies their status as a beloved gift choice.

A significant benefit of candy bouquets is the ease with which they can be assembled at home. For those seeking a budget-friendly or truly personalized option, creating a DIY candy bouquet can be a fun project. With just a few supplies including a decorative vase or container, skewers, and a selection of candies, anyone can make a charming candy bouquet that speaks to the recipient's taste.

For tips on creating your own, consider these key steps:

1. **Select a Base:** Choose a container that complements the candies. You might use a mason jar, a decorative basket, or even a colorful tin.
2. **Gather Your Candies:** Pick an assortment of candies that the recipient loves. Mixing textures and colors makes for an eye-catching arrangement.
3. **Arrange and Secure:** Stick the candies onto skewers. Then, arrange and secure them in the container, layering for a fuller look.
4. **Add Decorative Touches:** Enhance the bouquet with ribbons, tissue paper, or other decorations to add fillers and flair.

In recent years, the trend of candy bouquets has expanded to include variety options like 'themed' bouquets, which might highlight a specific color scheme or occasion, and even healthy alternatives, incorporating fruits and snacks instead of traditional candies.

Ultimately, the joy of a candy bouquet lies not only in the sweet treats but also in the intention behind the gift. It symbolizes affection, celebration, and creativity, making every candy bouquet a memorable experience for both the giver and the receiver.

### Conclusion

Bringing together creativity and thoughtfulness, a Valentine's candy bouquet serves as a unique expression of affection. With various design ideas, you can craft a personalized bouquet that reflects your loved one's tastes and interests. Consider using their favorite candies, vibrant colors, and even themed decorations to make the bouquet truly special. Whether it’s a mix of classic heart-shaped chocolates or a selection of colorful gummies, the options are limitless.

Understanding the history and popularity of candy bouquets enriches this gift's appeal. Emerging from traditional flower arrangements, candy bouquets have evolved into delightful alternatives, gathering fans across all ages. Their versatility makes them suitable for different occasions beyond just Valentine’s Day, ensuring they remain a cherished choice for expressing love and appreciation.

So, when you design your Valentine's candy bouquet, remember that it’s more than just a thoughtful gift—it's a beautiful gesture filled with creativity and affection. By blending personal touches with historical charm, your candy bouquet will undoubtedly be a sweet surprise that your special someone will treasure. Enjoy the process of creating something unique, and let your imagination run wild as you build a memorable gift that showcases your love in the most delicious way.

I've turned it off and unplugged everything attached, left it on tent position for good 30 mins. Sadly whenever you press any key, mac turns on so it was bit hard to clean it up on first + couldnt remove keycaps since they are different than other macs. I've tried to soak leftover(if there was any) coffee with paper by sticking it under keys.   
  
First, "",1,2 and tab keys were sticky. They they became normal after 1-2 hours.  
Now my left side type-c ports stopped working completely. On last friday one of them working completely fine.

I've also let our IT know about the situation quickly after it happened. They said, it was an accident and possibly the liquid will slowly corrupt the pc, can be in a year or in a week. They kinda assured me that there is nothing to worry about since it was accident and keep backing up my projects on daily basis in case. But eh, still...

A dimly lit room does not cut it if your goal is to stay awake. Neither does studying in your bed. Fill your environment with light! 

Consider studying in a common area or library. An unfamiliar setting can keep you more alert than your cozy room. 

# Caffeine is a double-edged sword! ☕

Don't overdo coffee or energy drinks. Excessive caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleep issues, and jitters. The FDA recommends no more than 400 mg of caffeine daily (roughly 4-5 cups of coffee or 2 energy drinks). 

# Hydrate for brain power 💧

Dehydration will cause headaches and lost focus. Keep a water bottle next to you and sip frequently. Avoid sugary drinks – they'll lead to a crash, not a focus boost.

# Snack but avoid sugar 🍎

Skip the greasy fast food. Opt for healthy snacks that provide sustained energy like fruits, vegetables, nuts, or yogurt with a sprinkle of granola.

# Move around regularly 🚶

To get your blood flowing, move around! Get up every 30 minutes or so and take a brisk walk, do some jumping, or stretch.  Physical activity helps combat fatigue and refocuses your mind.

# Invite a friend to study with you 👥

There are many benefits of studying with a friend, besides having company. You can discuss study topics, quiz each other, and review topics that are a bit unclear.  

If this isn’t an option, talking the material out loud to yourself can boost retention.

# Use the Pomodoro technique 🍅

The Pomodoro technique is a popular learning method that breaks work into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes long. These intervals are separated by short breaks to keep you focused. 

After four sessions, you take a longer break — perfect to move around a bit or have a snack.**‍**

‍**➕ Bonus tip:** **Try flashcards! 📱**

Reading long chapters from a textbook at night is a great way to fall asleep. Try to make studying a more enjoyable experience. Digital flashcards keep you engaged and motivated for several hours.

Grew up poor,  don't have any aim / dream or motivation in life and failed at too many things (I don't think I ever finished anything I started other than video games). Feels like everyone went ahead in life and im still here, same old same old.

I struggle with being hungry ( or be in calorie deficit to be exact) and been out of shape all my life. When I'm bored, sad or lonely or in pain or something bothering me I just start stuffing food or something with sugar (mostly instant coffee) even im not hungry (probably emotional dysregulation has something do with it) to feel better. Im doing this since childhood.

Mom and Dad are both obese (100kg) and all they eat is CARBS and that's what they feed me throughout my life. For last few years I started eating somewhat better, started working out, lost some weight plus job gave me a structure and was too tired to do anything at the end of the day.

Needed:
- ~30cm of wire 1.5-2mm
- 2 crimping connectors 6.3mm (female)
- (optional) heatshrink insulation

Steps:
0. crimp both ends of the wire
1. remove top panel & face plate (under grouphead) panel - those with external philips screws
2. disconnect white wire from 3-way valve & coffee brew switch
3. bridge spade connectors of 3-way valve & coffee brew switch

Effect:
- coffee switch engages the 3 way valve
- to make coffee hit water switch, then coffee switch (water will flow through grouphead only when both button are pressed in, disengaging the water switch keeps the grouphead pressurized)
- preinfusion is achived by cycling water switch with a delay after hitting the coffe switch

We have washed hot milk frother parts as per instructions, including milk tube in dishwasher (3 times so far). Yesterday, I have prepared a milk coffee which I wasn't able to drink since it tasted like soap. My partner had an Espresso and didn't notice anything. We have then disassembled the milk frother and washed it with clean warm water. Then noticed the milk tube smells like dishwasher detergent. 
I haven't run accross anybody with the same problem. Do you wash this part in a dishwasher and don't have any problems? 
Currently I am working on removing the smell with vinegar and baking soda but it seems that we will have to buy a new tube. 

As a second question, I have noticed that when warming up and shutting down, Rivelia expells some water, which is not clear but has a coffee residue. Is this normal?

I’m moving back to Belfast after seven years away **(eeeek!)**, and so much has changed since I left for uni. I’d love to **re-explore the city and meet new people!**

As we get older, life moves on—people relocate, have kids, get busy with work—and suddenly, making new friends isn’t as easy as it used to be. So I’m thinking about organising **casual social events for women in Belfast. N**othing awkward, nothing corporate — just an easy way to meet new people.

A few ideas so far:

* **A laid-back meetup in a bar or café**—somewhere easygoing where everyone feels welcome.
* **A creative night out**, like paint & sip or cocktail-making—something fun and a bit different.
* **A relaxed coffee morning** for those who prefer a quieter way to meet new people.
* **A casual group walk**—a great way to explore Belfast while chatting along the way.

Would this be something you’d be interested in? And if so, what kind of events actually appeal to you? If anyone **would like to help me get this going**, I’d love to hear from you!

1igmef5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1igmef5/tips_to_not_crash_at_all/,Tips to not crash at all,"Hey everyone, here are some personal tips I use to avoid crashes when taking my stimulant. I’m from Germany and I use Elvanse Adult—which is basically the same as Vyvanse in the US, just with different branding and packaging here.

1.	⁠⁠Stay Hydrated: I drink plenty of water throughout the day and snack on one or two bananas to help replenish electrolytes. Staying hydrated and getting enough potassium can really help keep energy levels steady.

2.	⁠⁠Electrolyte Drinks: I also have an electrolyte drink in the morning and one in the evening. In Germany, these are easy to grab at any local pharmacy, and they help maintain a good mineral balance, especially on active days.

3.	⁠⁠Skip the Coffee: I avoid coffee because mixing caffeine with my stimulant can sometimes lead to jitters or worsen the crash later on.

4.	⁠⁠Protein Shake Timing: About 50 minutes after my first pill, I down a protein shake. This little routine seems to help keep my blood sugar stable and smooth out my energy levels throughout the day.

5.	⁠⁠Food: I stick with a clean, plant-based diet loaded with protein-rich foods like lentils, chickpeas, nuts, and even some lupin products after work. This kind of diet helps me get the nutrients I need without any extra junk.

6.	⁠⁠Dark Chocolate Treat: In the evening, I enjoy a piece of dark chocolate. It gives me a nice antioxidant boost and a bit of a mood lift without overdoing it.

7.	⁠⁠Supplement What You’re Low On: I make sure to cover any nutritional gaps by taking supplements—specifically choline and magnesium, which I tend to be low on. Keeping these levels in check helps me stay balanced.

8.	⁠⁠Take Breaks: I give my body regular breaks from the stimulant by not taking it on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. These “off days” help prevent my body from getting worn out by constant stimulation.

9.	⁠⁠Keep Moving: Even though I only hit the gym once a week, I make up for it with long daily walks with my dog. Staying active—even in small doses—really boosts my mood and energy.

I usually take my medication about 3–4 times a week and then take a couple of days off. These are just my personal tips based on what’s worked for me, so feel free to try them out and tweak them as needed. ",4,1738579711.0,VyvanseADHD,2,0.84,False

the whole story is that i woke up on snowdrop, collected from all helpers except the healer, cooked breakfast (crit for 61k), snorlax upgrade animation played but it only showed Basic 2 and i was like damn i guess snowdrop really is that harsh... and then i tapped jigglypuff and snorlax ate 1 (one) pecha berry and then the upgrade animation played again but this time saying i was at Great 1 so i figured just server lag.

went back to collecting ingredients from my pokemon (my bag was full before cooking so i could only get their berries the first time) and then checked inventory and saw i was low on coffee so i switched in 2 grubbins (took me a few minutes to decide which) and when i exited back to the game, it said i was only on basic 5 with 74k strength... again i thought it was just a desync like ive seen mentioned here so many times so i restarted the app. nope. still basic 5. restarted my phone. nothing.

how could it have made the miscalculation that i was at great 1 (which im kicking myself for not screenshotting, but yes im **positive** both the notif and my subsequent ball badge reflected it) if i was only at basic 5? it was my understanding that even in the case of a collection desync, the consumed strength would not get reverted. plus, i know it didnt put my pokemons inventories back because i collected them a second time and they had no berries, meaning snorlax definitely already ate them. apologies if this has already been asked a million times, but whats the consensus here?",0,1738579554.0,PokemonSleep,8,0.33,False

I replied “so I can eat and not feel faint”. They just said “if you feel faint just tell us” and walked off

How about letting us eat?! I had breakfast at the crack of dawn before coming in, we haven’t even stopped for water let alone a coffee and then you just wanna round until everyone’s seen? Literally nothing was urgent enough that we couldn’t have stopped for 10 mins to take care of basic bodily functions. This patient cohort isn’t exactly going anywhere under their own steam. 

I was seeing stars by the time we got to eat at 3:30pm…while doing jobs, so not actually a break. I could get by missing coffee or lunch but not both - not that I should have to miss either. We get told to not work for more than 6 hours without a break and have to justify it if we do so. The patient acuity was not high enough to justify working 9 hours straight!

My recipe is as follows:
15g coffee and 240g water @ 90°C
ZP6 @ 6.0 (calibrated so the handle stops moving under its own weight at -0.3)
Pour to 45g and bloom for 1:30
Single high pour until the stream is nearly breaking, to 240g ( I think this took until ~1:50 so 10g/s)
One gentle swirl to settle bed and integrate any high and dry
Final brew time 2:50

It's not the worst cup I ever had and it's quite smooth with no astringency. If I really really concentrate on it I get some mango, but all in all it's very weak, watery and hollow. How do I increase the intensity of the cup whilst maintaining clarity and not introducing astringency?

I am using Norwegian tap water which is very high quality with no chlorine etc. The water hardness according to the water company is between 35 and 55 general hardness.

Why am I sharing this? I know many of you have already achieved this goal, but I believe it can be useful for two reasons:

1.	It can help those following behind me to try to reach M20.
2.	I can receive feedback from the community to fine-tune my strategy.

First of all, I want to clarify a few points:

1.	I am a F2P who started playing in week 2 of the game (yes, maybe I'm late to reach M20, but I never really thought I would get there before).
2.	For the Valentine’s week, I will use a Good Camp Ticket.
3.	The GG Area bonus is 70%.

So, let’s go with the plan. For now, I won’t dive too deep into all the steps, I’ll just go into detail on the current one.


WEEK BEFORE VALENTINE’S DAY


STEP 1 (CURRENT): INGREDIENT STORAGE

The goal is to cook “Zing Zap” Spiced Cola throughout the week. Currently, this recipe is at level 44 (37,262). 

Quick calculation of doing 21 Spiced Cola:
Let’s assume:

Strength dish: 37,262
Area Bonus: 70%
Valentine’s Day Bonus: 50%
Critical chance: 20% (10% base + increase of 10% gived by Dedenne, estimated)

With all of that, I expect 2.394 milions at the end of the week, only cooking (Maybe a little bit more because the dish level will increase). Will see how it ends! 

Therefore, I’ll detail the needs for 1 serving, 21 servings (3 servings/day x 7 days), and the storage target (with the 700 limit). (IMAGE 2)

Clarifications on the ingredients:

• Large Leek (113 stored right now): I’ve set the goal to store 100% because it’s the hardest ingredient for me to obtain.
• Rousing Coffee (140): Goal to store for 4 days of food.
• Warming Ginger (1): Goal to store for 1 day of food.
• Fancy Apple (47): Goal to store for 2 servings of food. An ingredient specialist will join the team that week.


STEP 1: STORAGE TEAM

Here are all the Pokémon that will be involved until the storage goals are achieved. (IMAGE 3)

I’ve already assigned 3 specialists for Large Leek because I know that’s what will cause me the most problems. Until I get at level 60 to unlock the third slot, it’ll be tricky.

The goal is to complete STEP 1 as quickly as possible to move on to the next phase of the plan, which I’ll give a brief TEASER for now, but I’ll explain in another post once I’ve completed the first goal.


STEP 2: ELECTRIC BERRY BOMB

The next step will be to make a small Berry Bomb with Raikou. The problem will be the lack of time and that I don’t have a decent Raikou, but any extra gains will be welcome.

SECONDARY MISSION

Capture Dedennes.

Why? At the moment, I have one that could be considered above average, but it’s not a great Dedenne.

What if I don’t capture a better one? In that case, I’ll abandon the search for Dedennes and invest in mine.


VALENTINE’S WEEK: TEAM

Here’s the team I plan to use. (IMAGE 5).

Due to the strong electric component, I’ll try to get Grepa Berry with tickets.

On the other hand, I’ve chosen Raichu due to the apples and ginger it will provide (which will be helpful), as well as the fact that I’m looking for Grepa Berry (Ampharos and Dedenne).

I’ll keep you updated! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",33,1738579153.0,PokemonSleep,10,0.97,False

Combining [rattan serving trolley](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/serving-trolley) and [metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) can add a unique balance of warmth and modern sophistication to your interiors. Whether you’re refreshing your [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) or upgrading your living room, these pieces blend seamlessly into any space.

**Why Rattan and Metal Make the Perfect Pair**

The mix of [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) like rattan and sleek, industrial-inspired metal creates a visually appealing contrast that works well in both contemporary and bohemian interiors. Rattan offers warmth, texture, and an organic feel, while metal adds a modern edge and durability. When styled together, they create a harmonious and stylish setting that feels both inviting and chic.

**Rattan Serving Trolleys: Functional Elegance**

A rattan serving trolley is more than just a decorative piece; it is a versatile addition to your home. Whether you use it as a tea station, or extra storage for décor, it adds charm to any room.

**How to Style a Rattan Serving Trolley:**

* **In the Dining Room:** Use it as a side serving station for plates, glasses, or even a chic coffee setup.
* **In the Living Room:** Display candles, books, or indoor plants to create a cozy ambiance.
* **On the Balcony:** A rattan serving trolley makes the perfect addition to balcony furniture, offering a stylish way to store drinks and snacks for outdoor relaxation.

**Metal Coffee Tables: A Statement of Strength and Style**

A metal coffee table is an excellent focal point for any living space. Its sleek and sturdy design adds a touch of modern sophistication while providing durability for daily use.

**Best Ways to Incorporate a Metal Coffee Table:**

* **Pair It with Soft Elements:** Balance the industrial feel of metal with cozy throws, plush sofas, or a woven rug.
* **Mix with Natural Accents:** Complement your metal coffee table with rattan chairs or a wooden centerpiece for a striking contrast.
* **Use in Small Spaces:** The minimalist structure of metal coffee tables works well in compact areas, keeping the space open and airy.

**Blending Rattan and Metal for a Cohesive Look**

To ensure a seamless blend of natural furniture and industrial elements, consider the following tips:

* **Stick to Neutral Tones:** Warm, earthy colors from rattan pieces complement the sleek finish of metal tables.
* **Incorporate Greenery:** Indoor plants soften the look of both materials and add freshness to the space.
* **Maintain a Balanced Layout:** Arrange furniture in a way that allows both materials to shine without overpowering the room.

**Final Thoughts**

A well-curated home reflects personality, function, and style. By combining rattan serving trolleys with metal coffee tables, you can achieve an effortlessly chic and timeless look. Whether you’re enhancing your balcony furniture or redesigning your living space, this pairing creates the perfect balance of nature and modernity.

1igm8mu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1igm8mu,New kittens❤️ and a UTI 😭,"Hi meezer parents. A while ago I asked about advice to evaluate a breeder and promised to pay cat tax later. So here are some photos of our new babies😻. They‘re in their 16 th week, so sweet and so mischievous!!! We already love them dearly. Their names are Ivy (Ivy Rose) and Gino (short for Raktajino - for you non- nerds: a type of Star Trek coffee).

Unfortunately on the 4th day of having them here we had to see the vet because Ivy was straining to pee and had blood in her urine (I was watching them so closely but from one minute to the next we went from „everything is fine“ to „we need to see the vet NOW“). This has me worried. I am currently home a lot but will have to leave the house for work in the near future…I am hoping it was just the stress of the move (also the breeder had floor heating, which we don‘t 🤷🏻‍♀️)

With pain medication ( no antibiotics needed) she is really doing well generally but we‘re going for another check up tomorrow. Has anyone had issues with idiopathic cystitis in their Siamese cat? I read they were prone to such things . Then again what are they not prone to (the breeder did extensive genetic testing on the parents)?
Sorry for the long text, it‘s just not the start Iwas hoping for (after having lost a senior soul cat) and I am quite anxious…she‘s getting all the heating pads and fluids she needs❤️

Anyway here are the little trouble puffs!

I'M PRETTY SURE THIS HAPPENED TO YOU TOO (and you probably don't even know it): my buddy and I were hanging out last night, comparing war stories from online dating on Bumble and other dating apps. He tells me last week he met this beautiful Swiss girl named X of age Y with multiple nationalities etc. As he shares more info I realise I know that girl! I slept with her just two days before! Then we realized we’d both gone on many dates with the same girls, MANY TIMES, two of them IN THE SAME LAST WEEK.

Thinking it was just a bizarre coincidence, I dug a little deeper. So I made a fake account, bought a weekly premium, and with a few lines of JavaScript, I wrote a basic program that collects all data from Bubmle and auto-swipes profiles left and right. I launched the script last night thinking it would finish in a few days. Surprise as I woke up it already swiped all girls (or women, whatever) from the whole Zurich within 20km from the center in an age range of 18-30, IN A SINGLE NIGHT:

**there are just 500 girls below age 25 in the range of 10 km from the center**

If we exclude 'ghost'(inactive) accounts, accounts of girls just seeking attention, and if we only count girls you find attractive and if we also count only the ones that will find you attractive, and finally only pick the ones that will not ghost you and the ones that will actually go on a date with you, huhh man you see where this is going

(we should also consider the fact that the girls-guys ratio is probably 1-10 on Bumble)

In conclusion, while I and my friend (both handsome and hot guys in their twenties) are figuring out ways how to not sleep with the same girls accidentally, if your grand plan for love is “just keep swiping on Bumble,” you might want to add a backup plan

The complicated part! I also love to dress as a girl! I've been doing this for so long, and it provides me with such a level of comfort within myself I cannot match!

I don't know if I'm gender fluid, trans, non binary, I haven't labeled myself! I'm just me and that's that! 🫣😌

What type of person am I hoping for?

Look, to be honest I'm pretty open, but there's a couple of things I'd certainly prefer you meet one of these criteria.
- if you're from Australia! 🇦🇺 local is always preferable for Timezones

—

Lahi lahi man tag preference so maybe u wont like what i like. But still posting this anyway because maybe itl help especially feel nako ako ang target market sa coffee shops diri sa cdo.

I drink coffee a lot. 7days a week siguro. I do my own coffee but most of the time sometimes 7days a week gyud, i buy from coffee shops.



What i like: arabica, medium roast. Fresh fresh fresh beans! Makabalo ko if 3mos ago na ang giserve sakoa hahaha

Kindle coffee - 4.5 stars. The best but closed na now
They serve from triad coffee roasters which i like

Daily Dose (triad gyapon mao ganahan ko)- 4 stars lang kay one time giservan ko nilag old beans na ang lasa sa americano

Bean stoked - tried drip adtong bag o pa sila nag open, old beans ila gamit so wa nako gibalik. Wont rate yet kay wa pako kabalik

H proper- 4 stars. Tried milk based and americano then drip. Ok sakoa but havent been there now that they turned into restaurant

Milestone- 3.5 stars. Tried both americano and milk based. Ok americano. Milk based tend to be very sweet if bigger size imo paliton. Quality is better if kadtong smaller size ra. But 3.5 only bec its too sweet sometimes and usahay kay halang ra kaayo ang beans murag dili gaka calibrate ug tarong

Kape dionisio -3.5 stars. Hit or miss. Usahay lasyaw ang ilang milk. Usahay halang ang beans. -americano is also ok

Fukuro-4 stars because its more consistent than others. Naay sometimes halang ang beans or old beans ang gamit but not every time. Rare lang. -americano here for me is 4.5stars

Bowerbird- 4.5 stars. But this is a recent review lang kay sauna lasyawan ko sa ila gatas. Nakatry sad ko diri na klaro kaayo old beans gamit. Wa nako nibalik. Recently nitry ko balik and ok na the milk. So ober all ok na sako.

Mc coffee- 4 stars. Very competitive coffee. I think they roast their own beans also. Sometimes its sweet but havent bought coffee from them that much to say na dili siya consistent

Permiro- 3.5 stars. Ok na siya sakoa but naay weird taste ilang milk. Kanang mura btaw sya ug alaska na lahi sya sa ubang gamit na milk. Pero pwede na gyapon ni sya id give it 4 stars if dili lang tam is ra kaayo ang ilang bigger sizes like sa milestone. Stick to small size lang mo diri if di mo ganahan tonsilon.

Cafe bali- 4.5 stars. Stick to small sizes also but their big sizes are better than milestone and permiro. Tam is usahay ang big sizes but not as sweet as m and p. Ayaw mo panara ha. Pero ayoha inyo aircon kay igang kaayo

Grae-3stars. Gimolds ilang revel bar pag palit nako. Good cs they apologized and gave me freebies nuon that time idunno now.

Mimo- 4 stars for coffee but im not sure if consistent kay 5x pako nakatry sa ila and not regularly kay dili duol sa places nga ako gaadtoan

Jose - 3.5 stars sa akoa. Ok sya esp kadtong naa sila sa centrio(4stars to sakoa). Ambot why kadto nag buy nako from their store sa bulua, so-so nAlang sya na demote na noon

Apostrophe- 3 stars. Lasyawan ko. Daghan ga hype pero ambot uy. Tho i dont buy consistently sa ila kay di nako bet anh first few buys nako.

Paiks- 3 stars. Mas lami ila branch sa manila. For some reason commercialized kaayo ang lasa diri. Di nako bet

Un&franc - 3.5 stars for americano. Di ko ga try sa ila milk based kay mahadlok ko way lami. Makahunahuna ko na mag fukuro nalang ko dool rman sila. Di ko ganahan mag tambay diri kay init kaayo ang glare sa hayag kay glass ilang wall

Ashley cafe- 2 stars. Way lami doh. Unsa inyo gamit na espresso machine uy? Salaan? Murag way sipa na unsa ba. Nag milk tea ko?

Maison alessa -2.5 stars. Soso ra. Sa soc med kay mura jud daghan kaayu naa sa menu. Pag abot didto dili available. Basin influencer ra ila baligyaan ana para nice sa pictures. Nyahaha

Daves beanery- sarado na yata sila now. 2.5stars. Murag nag milk tea. Or need siguro silag updated recipe. Murag na stuck sila atong era bitaw na milk tea or kadtong tam is kaayo na drink murag naka 100% sugar level pirmi

Curio-4 stars. Could be 4.5 if consistent ko nag buy. But i havent bought enough to up the score. Inaccessible for me

Caffeneited - ok na for me but not into cold brew kaayo ko. Ok ok na for price. 3 stars lang kay leaning gyud ko sa espresso

Sharmaines - surprisingly 4 stars for me. But not consistent kay usahay lasyaw ilang milk. Unya if cold drinks ako paliton usahay kay malasahan pa nako ang ininit

Portavitta - 4 stars. Close na sila now. Kadtong hapit na sila mag close kay na poor ilang quality. Lasyaw na sya. Sad. I hope na hype ni sya pag ayu para naretain ila quality and wala nag close

Bai coffee -4 stars. Could be 4.5 siguro if pirmi ko gapalit. Mga 3timss pako kapalit and out of 3x ok ako experience. So if palpak pud sila wa ko kabalo kay 3x rajud ko kapalit 

Aurora sa elsalvador - 4 stars but could go low. 3x rasad ko ka palit. Ok ako experience but for some reason feel nako kay if always ko magpalit didto nako makita ang cons nya.

Elysee -3.5 stars but need more time to try para maka ingon ko ok. Food ok ra sad but could be lower siguro feel nako dili ok other days nyahaha

August-3.5 stars same sa elysee but i feel like ma 4 ni if always ko gaadto kay so far okhan ko sa sipa sa ilang coffee. Food wise di ko ganahan kay murag highblaron ko pag uli maybe because coffee and fatty food ang combi. Walay coke diha dzai? Lisod kaayo itulon ug sparkling drink or kape ang paris.

Higalaay - 3.5 stars. Ok baya but need more time to up this if ok gyud sya always

Coffee cartel -4 stars ni sakoa pero taod taod nako wa ka adto. Ambot open pa ba ni

Belean - 3.5 stars. Delonghi ila gamit. Ok ra sya pero naay one time na milk based ako gipalit ang supposedly mejo sweet to sya pero murag nalimtan nila ang tam is ug butang. Di man sad nila specialty so pasang awa na sya sakoa kay croissant man dapat ila specialty haha

Bean park- 3 stars. I dont get the hype. Igang ilang place pag uli nako subawan ko. Kape lasyaw dugay pajud maserve usahay.

Messy kitchen - 4 stars but not tried americano pa sa ila. Daghan lang ga tambay na estudyante diri unya dili maka tone down sa ila voice. If mag sungog sungog sila kay saba kaayo mao not good tambayan diri ug di ka gusto saba

Fat chef -4 stars. Oo nangape ko sa fatchef. Ug lami kaayo ila coffee pero grabe ka mahal murag close to 200 or 200 na. Ngyeh. Pero lami ra sad sya. More on the sweeter side but sipa sa kape and beans quality ok sya

Modesto- 4 stars for their americano but not tried ila milk based. Fresh beans and bet ang roast. But only tried there 5x siguro so not sure if its always like that

Cafe leone-3 stars very generic almost like the taste sa portavitta like kadtong manarahay na sila hehe sakto lang pwede na but dili nako icrave

—


What i dont like: coffee like don mac, always coffee, etc etc kay like i said i prefer espresso. Usually mga inani kay cold brew. Id never buy. Katry rako sa caffeneited kay libre sa kasal ug bunyag nga ako naapilan wahaha wont buy from coffee project, dear joe, starbucks, etc,

Kulang pa siguro ni pero mao ra ni ako ma remember for now

Mga dili nako bet balikan: kanang igang or grabe ang glare sa sun like un&franc. Please pag butang mog blinds. Kabalo ko estetik ang glass walls pero igang ug sulaw sya.

Dili nako bet ang lonewolf ug kana iya sister company kay murag lamukon ang vibe. Or anything na pareha ana ug style na coffee shop, pass lang.

With that being said, menusan unta sa bowerbird ila flowers. Hahaha lainan ko sa baho. Take out nalang ko.

1igm26d,https://i.redd.it/80mcor4lhwge1.jpeg,Last grind of coffee beans from Bali,"I tried coffee from 20ml Coffee Roasters in Bali, and it was delightfully aromatic and tasty. It was a blend of Orange Bourbon and Wanagiri. While I'm still perfecting my brewing technique and couldn't extract all the flavor notes, I was pleased with the ones I managed to get.

The whole kitchen filled with the wonderful aroma of freshly ground coffee. ☕️✨

I recently accepted a part-time barista job at Peet’s Coffee, signed the papers, and have my training scheduled.

They gave me only 9 hours of training for my first week (about 3 days total). Is that normal for new hires? I was expecting more hours.

I also want to ask—is this job worth it in the long run? Will I eventually get more hours, especially since I’m in San Francisco? For those who have worked at Peet’s or similar coffee shops, how stable is the scheduling?

Also, I’ve heard that part-time employees don’t get many benefits. What kind of perks (if any) should I expect?

Would love to hear from those with experience! Thanks!",1,1738578149.0,barista,0,1.0,False
