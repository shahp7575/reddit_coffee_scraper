I might have to forsake this damned profession.  

I’m reviewing a first-year associate’s draft last week, and I notice something that nearly made me drop my coffee. The page numbers are on the top right corner. Top right! I couldn’t believe it. I had to ask, “Why are the page numbers at the top?” And do you know what they said? “I thought it looked more professional.” Professional? If by professional you mean a violation of every basic formatting rule we’ve ever been taught, then sure, maybe! I said, “Page numbers go at the bottom, center. It’s not a fashion choice, it’s a law school basic.” And they said, “Oh, I just thought it was... more... modern.” Modern? What are we, drafting a TikTok? I’m this close to starting a support group for associates who don’t understand that the page numbers go on the bottom, like, everyone learned in legal writing class. This is how I know BigLaw is doomed — we’ve got junior associates who think they’re reinventing the wheel with page number placement.",0,1736489377.0,biglaw,2,0.5,False

1hxy0ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hxy0ch/my_first_day_on_vyvanse/,My first day on Vyvanse,"Hi everyone, I'm 35F starting my journey with ADHD meds and I wanted to document how I feel each day. My first prescription is Vyvanse at 20mg. I will try to document each day and to be adamant about this because I forget my symptoms constantly and struggle to advocate for myself when my psychiatrist asks how things are going. This is my experience alone and may be different for others.

Day 1:

Got out of bed at 6:30am to eat a high protein and fat breakfast: avocado toast and boiled egg. Took Vyvanse at 7:15

Begun feeling the effects at 8:00am. I was really groggy from lack of sleep for many days before but I began feeling like I had a cup of black tea (I don't drink caffeine so this would be like a feeling of waking up.) I felt like I didn't need sleep although my body was tired.

Peak effects came about at 10am. I felt a bit wired like you do with coffee but gentler than that. It was without the jitteriness. I drank a lot of water thinking that might mellow out the feeling of high energy. But it wasn't just energy. I felt as though I could finally do something, anything without feeling like it would be mentally too much. I organised my closet, I made my husband breakfast, I took a much needed shower, did skincare, hair, and makeup. I dressed up and looked and felt clean. I went for a walk. I felt the need to be clean and organised which is what I craved but couldn't manage before. Things I needed to do did not feel overwhelming. I was able to make decisions in real time, not needing to set aside time to make them because they required so much brain space or would completely leave me if I was trying to make basic decisions like deciding whether to cook eggplant today or tomorrow. 

I slowly began coming down at around 1:30, and by 6pm I felt tired. I'm typing this out at 9:50 pm so I'm really tired but needed to document this before I forgot.

Pros:

I have the power to do things I want to do.

I felt happier and could maintain conversations without feeling tired of holding on to what was said.

I ate healthier because having intention wasn't draining.

Cons:

I clench my teeth more and feel soreness in my jaw 

I still forget some things. For example, I went to the store and they said they didn't have it but recommended another store. I got home and forgot what store they mentioned and my husband laughed saying you don't remember what they told you? You even repeated what they said!

Although I can do a lot of things I want, I like the feeling of doing things with visceral action. For example, I needed to apply to university but did not prioritise that, I prioritised cleaning and organising the house because the thought of sitting down at a laptop made me feel gross. I think I'll need to plan what I need to do the night before. Not tonight though I'm exhausted.

Lastly, taking this medication makes me feel limitless which I already feel if I'm exercising without meds. I've grown up mastering the act of disassociating my mind from my body so I can really mess up my body when going to the gym and going too far with my workouts. I think this medication will increase that likelihood.

Ok I'm exhausted, going to sleep, goodnight all.

(TW: very violent death, drugs)","Just what the title says. I'm (genderfluid, 20) getting snappy and mean, and I'm breaking down over the smallest of things. Last October, my dad had gotten in a workplace accident where a four ton mobile home crushed his spine. During the visit to the hospital, they found cancer that had already spread to his brain. My mother and I prepared for a quiet death in his sleep. We lived in an old trailer that had no heating, so I slept in my mother's room that night, January 14, 2024. My father slept on the couch (Mom had restless leg syndrome and kicked him a lot). My mom told me I was taking up space and to go take a nap on the loveseat. I walked into the living room, pillow in hand, around 1am. My father sat up, looked at me with glazed eyes, and vomited. I was initially calm because I was used to him vomiting...Then I saw the blood. Next thing I know, his entire body slammed through the glass coffee table, my mother and I were screaming, and I frantically started CPR as my mother tried to clear his airway by pulling out all of the blood and meat coming out of his nose and throat. He choked out his last words, ""Mama, I'm dyin'."" He was a southern man, and his mother (my grandma) had died in 2012 of brain cancer as well. It took paramedics over an hour to get to my house because they 'got lost'. My mother couldn't get up off the floor due to shock, so I had to go to the hospital and tell the doctor to cut my dad's life support off. I'm only 20, and I have severe PTSD from the event. My mother has since died from a methamphetamine overdose, she fell back into it from a 25-year sober streak. She was abusive, and my dad was my safe haven. I'm devastated and my boyfriend can only do so much when I start to panic. What can I do? I'm so lost and empty. I really miss my dad.",1,1736489300.0,DadForAMinute,0,1.0,False
1hxxyfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1hxxyfi/1_week_see_my_thoughts/,"1 Week, see my thoughts","My journey thus far, 21 y/o, addicted for 5 years.

Day 1: cravings moderate-severe, wondered if it was worth quitting. Sleep 4/10. 
Day 2: cravings mild, did research/heard others stories. Sleep, basically none lol. 
Day 3: cravings mild, kept doing research, hearing stories. Sleep, basically none lol.
Day 4: cravings severe. Moody/anxious x10. Sleep 6/10. 
Day 5: cravings moderate. Moody/anxious x8. Sleep 7/10. 
Day 6: cravings mild-moderate. Moody/anxious x10. Sleep 6/10. 
Day 7: cravings mild, don’t think about it much. Sleep 8/10. 

- How did i deal with cravings? whenever i would crave hitting a vape i would take deep breaths (square breathing). I would also drink ICE COLD water or drink my coffee. 
- How did you feel? the first couple of days the only physical symptom i had was a headache. I was a little moody, but not much. My anxiety was manageable and cravings as well. Now i barely feel any, maybe an occasional headache. 
- What was my reason for quitting? I had been trying to quit for so long, aka just telling myself i need to. I quit in the past for what felt like 2-3 months, but it was actually only 3 weeks. I reloaded when a friend bought a vape and let me hit it. Now, i want to quit because i started seeing the effects. Shortness of breath, +anxiety, +depression, laziness. I started realizing that it didn’t do anything for me. Anytime i would hit it, i felt like crap, or guilty. Long story short i quit for my health, i didn’t want to be addicted to something anymore that gave nothing back. 
- Mentality: my mentality from quitting now, versus, the first time is i actually want to and keep telling myself why. Before i wanted to, but stopped holding myself accountable. This time whenever i think about releasing i tell myself why. The more research i did i started to understand the “addition” process and how it works. I started understanding what nicotine does to our bodies and how it affects long term. I started reading people’s experiences and talking about it. I found talking about it really helps. 
-   Relapse: my first time trying to quit recently (jan 1st) i relapsed twice, each time at the 24 hour mark. As nasty as it is, i literally dug my vape out of the trash both those times. 

Best advice, do what makes you happy, if using NRT works go ahead. I personally was fine cold turkey. Quit smoking app, has a community portion that is nice and gives you a tracker. Reddit helped me so much, the quit vaping communities. Gum/Jolly ranchers just to keep me distracted and mouth occupied. 

My situation: i am on anxiety meds and a stimulant for appetite control (weight management). Cravings were controlled for the most part during my first week and my appetite was increased a tad the first day or so, but manageable. These medications may have made my time a little easier. 

Vape: 
i usually would get Breeze Pros 5% (USA). they used to last me about 2 weeks, if not more. I started going through them in a week. Then moved to north’s, lasted me maybe 2 weeks? Then geek bar pulse x lasted me 2 ish weeks then threw it away, still had 39% juice life when i did. I didn’t care about wasting the money anymore because it was for a better cause. 

Vaping is an awful addition that people are grasped onto inorder to cope, or have something to do. I’m so saddened by my generation for really brining vapes to light. I first got addicted because i kept seeing them around. It’s honestly so disheartening knowing kids out there in middle school are doing it as well. I wish the best for everyone on their journey to quitting and am so proud because you are making such a good decision. 

Let me scare you: COPD, common thing smokers can get. I work in health care/in nursing school. Working with patients with COPD, hearing them wheeze is scary, seeing what they cough up? EW. Hearing the cough is life changing. The shortness of breath is god awful. My mom (smoker 20+ ish years) She can’t even eat food without getting out of breath. she’s winded as she’s chewing. Not everyone’s experience is the same, but the outcome can lead to insane things mild or severe it’s not worth the damage to your brain, lungs, heart, and overall body. When your heart gets affected it can also start affecting all other organs because your heart is what keeps those organs up basically with blood. Personally i kinda wanna live lol.

1hxxvus,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1hxxvus/whats_your_goto_strategy_for_overcoming_challenges/,What’s Your Go-To Strategy for Overcoming Challenges,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🙌 

Alright, let’s dive into something we all face—*challenges.* Whether it’s trying to hit that gym routine, smashing deadlines at work, or just not burning toast for once—life comes with its fair share of hurdles. **But hey, isn’t that what makes it interesting?** 😅

**So, what's YOUR go-to strategy for overcoming challenges?** Let me toss one of my favorites into the ring—*working smarter, not harder.* ☕️

Picture this: It's Monday morning, and you’re staring at a to-do list that feels longer than a CVS receipt. The age-old enemy—*overwhelm*—starts creeping in. But fear not, my friends, here's how I keep my sanity:

- **Prioritize Like a Boss**: Not everything needs to be done *right now*. I usually pick the top 3 things that must get done and focus on beating those first. Pro tip: sometimes that includes *“get a decent amount of caffeine in your system.”* 😂

- **Chunk It Down**: Big tasks are intimidating. So, I break them down into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Why fight a dragon when you can swat a few flies first? 🐉 -> 🪰

- **The Buddy System**: Sometimes we all need a hype person. Sharing your challenge with someone who’s got a positive vibe can change everything. Who knew a simple, ""You got this!"" over morning coffee could be so game-changing?

- **Celebrate the Small Wins**: Finished that nasty project? Managed to make it to Friday without losing your mind? Celebrate. No win is too small—a little self-love goes a long way. 🌟

By now, you might be thinking, *“Sure, but what if I’m just not feeling it?”* On those days, I remind myself that being stuck is temporary, kind of like fashion trends or my cat's obsession with cardboard boxes.

But hey, that’s just what works for me. What about you? 🧐 Anybody else have a quirky or unconventional approach to tackling obstacles? *Pour yourself a cup of tea (or something stronger) and let's share some wisdom.*

Here’s to turning life’s challenges into stepping stones, one semi-burnt toast at a time. Cheers! 🍞✨

We both have been married before and we both have adult children. For context....we are both in recovery and have been sober (me 10 years, him 14). We moved in together 6 months ago. We waited a long time to move in for a few reasons. We are both pretty independent and since we were in long term marriages, neither of us were in any rush at all. We also wanted to wait til the adult kids flew the nest and settled, but the main reason is because he has some bad habits. 

The bad habits: he has been on Suboxone for 14 years. He told me early in our relationship and i told him it was important to me that he works with his dr to taper off slowly. He agreed but never followed through. After many discussions, about a year ago he decided to  start tapering.   He is no where near close to being off it. He is also on about 8 other types of medications. Diabetic meds, depression meds, blood pressure meds etc. He smokes well over a pack a day. He only eats once a day, sometimes twice. Never takes his blood sugar. He's type 1. He drinks about 8 large takeout coffees a day with 3 sugars in each. He drinks coffee right up until bedtime. He can never sleep thru the night, gets up at least 2 or 3 times to use the washroom then smoke. A few times a week he takes a suppository type thing to help him go as it appears he can't naturally. I knew of some of these bad habits but not to this extent exactly. He has also developed ED. Our sex life is non existent. We had sex twice last year. He is on testosterone and we're in councelling. I am not perfect and I don't expect him to be either. We have had many conversations about his poor lifestyle choices and my fear of losing him. I can't help but wonder if he had a better lifestyle he could come off some of those meds and perhaps our sex life and his life in general could improve. I love this man with all my heart and want to grow old with him but watching him destroy his body is destroying me. I'm not sure how much longer I can watch this. I love him very much but I also know that's love is not always enough. I'm not sure I should stay even tho it would hurt like hell to leave. Why is it so hard to respect your basic health?

I’ve tried everything. ,"I've never felt so horrible in my life. This is the worst it's been. I don't have visual distortions, the world doesn't loom scary or feel dangerous anymore. There's just this complete discount from reality and myself. I don't feel fight or flight at ALL. Zero. No adrenaline - nothing. When I close my eyes I can't even feel my own body or breathing. I'm grinch to connect with old memories to remind myself I am still me, but I can't - they're completely inaccessible. Tonight I was at dinner and I felt like a ghost - like I could just walk through a wall, I'm completely unaware of the world around me and my own body.

I've tried so many things. I'm at a loss. I never could have imagined a year ago or 6 months ago that I would get worse, not better. There's some deeply rooted anxiety that I cannot feel or access anymore, that's making my body / mind not feel safe. At least when you feel anxious, you know what it is. When you feel fight or flight, you know what it is. I don't feel a thing and haven't in months. Can't even feel a hot shower, or smell something and have memories come up. It's like I'm brain dead.

I felt so much fear and feelings of unsafety before, like I had to run home or be within a safe distance of home. I feel none of that anymore, I don't even feel like I'm unsafe or needing to flee, I feel dead. Nothing. This has to be the collapse stage of a overwhelmed nervous system. But I've done everything to try to heal. I don't know what my body and mind feel unsafe about. Yes I've been through tons of trauma. None of it is happening right now. I've been on meds and in therapy for 2.5 years and only getting worse. It's so bad that I feel like I never had a life, I can't access any of my memories pre summer 2022 when this started. I barely even remember anything since then, either. Something is going on here - I need to have a scan done of my brain.

I am fatigued 24/7. I don't care about ANYTHING. Not dating, doing fun things, etc. I'm 32 years old and have no sex life or romantic life. I am so so so numb and exhausted. My head spins all day with the same thoughts about my state and how stuck I am, how hopeless I am. You would be too if this was your life. I have nothing to look forward to, enjoy, feel. Even a cup of coffee I can't enjoy or be present for. I am not present in my body or my life. My mind thinks it's protecting me but it's doing the opposite and killing me. I had a perfectly happy life up until September 2022. I was happy, I loved life, I had so much energy, I meditated every morning and felt great. I was in such a good place. And then panic attacks, agoraphobia and DPDR ruined my life. I've never been the same since, and instead of getting better, I am getting worse. I'm at a complete loss of what to do. Complete. I can't verbalize my experience and have anyone understand. All that's in my head all day is looping thoughts, songs and inwardness. There's no inner world in me anymore, and no outer world either.

We both live in the woods but her woods are 30 minutes away from my woods, so I decided to leave 30 minutes early to give myself time to get lost. 

I was going along and knew I was approaching my turn, my phone started glitching out and I thought my gps was telling me I was passing it right now so I took a sharp right and didn’t have enough room to turn onto the road and drove head first into a ditch. I didn’t even scream I didn’t do anything. I knew if I were to force it I’d have flipped. I’ve never crashed in my life. Had a few crazy things happen as a passenger but never a blunt impact like that, but I was physically completely fine. Straight up miracle.

Definitely shaken up. I immediately called 911 cause I didn’t know what else to do. Then a stranger pulled up and offered to help, THEN the woman I was going to meet showed up, she happened to be passing by coming back from an errand. We were still at least 10-12 miles from her house. We immediately started laughing about the whole situation, a good samaritan showed up and pulled me out with his tractor, the cop showed up looked at my car and I just had mugs, grape vines and my big book strewn on the floor and he gave me the A ok right away, my car was completely fine. I have (had) a hitch on the front and it completely dented that in but that was it and I think it saved my entire grill. Not a single scratch. 

I’m a very careful driver, don’t worry. Nothing like this has ever happened even in my drinking career, and thankfully no one was around me. I feel so stupid, but the whole experience absolutely launched me back into gratitude, when this whole past week I’ve been struggling feeling defeated a bit and overwhelmed I was talking with my higher power the whole way there and just asking for help facing these issues and then all this happened. It didn’t even cross my mind to throw a fit. I’m so incredibly grateful. 

We spent the afternoon sipping coffee, laughing and talking shop about the program. Even went on a gorgeous walk in the woods and then gator ride through the forest.

She was only 50. She should be at home, are her craft table, painting something while I watch a shitty historical drama. Why isn't her craft table out? Where is she? Is she in the bathroom? 

I'm just 15. I'm going to miss her longer than I knew her. The majority of the memories I made with her were when I was hardly conscious. I'm not going to have anything to know her by. I'm going to be the girl who doesn't have a mom. Poor thing. 

They dont understand. It's like I'm living two seperate lives. I'll be happy for a moment, then I'll realized I've managed to forget I don't have a mommy anymore, and then I feel like a guilt-ridden piece of shit. I've always struggled with emotional repression, which doesn't make any of this easier. I'm not sad enough. I'm not! My mom and I were so close. I was her youngest, her baby, and she definitely treated me the part and I loved her to pieces–so why am I not in pieces? Have I failed as a daughter? 

I know, logically, that I'm probably just in shock, but that doesn't help much when feelings are anything but logical. 

I just want her back. I want her to see my sweet sixteen. It's what she would've wanted. I know she'd give the world to be there for me. To see me get my first car. My first job. To see me graduate.

I stare down at the dice and clamp my tongue between my teeth. There’s no reason I should be afraid; I know that. Saul came to this place multiple times and did this exact same thing. He also probably died on numerous occasions and was perfectly fine until Sue nulled him. Still, I don’t fully know what this creature is going to do to us should we lose, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my time on this mountain so far, it’s that some deaths can be far worse than you’d ever imagine.

“What’s the matter, Wesly?” The creature teases, “You know as well as I do that death holds no consequence. You’re *lucky* to encounter me at the point in time that you did. You have as many chances as you can bear to beat me. That’s much more than most unlucky souls can say.”

A hand reemerges from the darkness and taps softly on the tiles, fanning them out for me to see. This limb isn’t any of the two I just saw, however. This one is an old, scarred hand, hairy and with an anchor tattoo. It disappears just as fast as it comes.

Realizing that I’m allowing her to get under my skin again, I put back on my best face, “Riddles went out of style, huh?” I ask her.

The Sphinx chuckles in amusement, “They grew a little too tiresome for me.”

I look back at the dice, “What is this game?”

“An old one,” The Sphinx answers, “One of wit and strategy. We call it Totem.”

“What’s the goal?” I ask her.

“To roll higher than me.” She says plainly, a twinge of excitement in her voice. She knows she has her hooks in me.

“I assume there’s more to it than that?”

“You would assume correctly.”

My eyes fix on the table once more, and all the pieces there. I know that I can’t win first try, but how much can I learn in my first game with her? How much pain was I going to endure should I lose? Were there any lasting consequences that Saul had when he lost? At the very least, he didn’t go null, but with the way my chest has been, I’m beginning to realize there are still ways to mess up my body beyond the mental scars that come from some beasts.

I feel a hand touch my shoulder and I glance back to see Val staring at me, “Wes, are we sure about this?” she asks over coms.

“Are you not?” I ask, “We knew what was down here waiting, Val. There’s only one way through.”

“No, I know—I was sure, but…” Val mutters, staring Wisdom in her eyes as she stares back, “Maybe we should think a little more about this,” she suggests. “We don’t fully know what we’re dealing with here, and we know this thing is cunning. What if she was playing nice with Saul, but with us she pulls something like she did with this facility?”

“Val, we’ve already waited so long trying to get here…” I remind her, “I’m not sure we’ve even learned anything here so far that we didn’t already know about her. What’s there to plan?”

“So you want to just dive into a fight with a demon that we have no idea the full capabilities of? I know you want out of here, but this is just impulsive.”

“When is there going to be a better time, Val? We can wait and plan and try to sort some more stuff out, but her offer is probably going to be the same then as it is now.”

“The better time would be when you’re not on the verge of a heart attack, Wes,” Val tells me, leaning close and growing a little more stern, “You’ve been clutching at your chest all day. All of this pain and stress isn’t good for you. I can’t imagine losing to this thing is going to help that.”

“I’m fine.”

“No, you’re not. *Clearly* you are not.”

“For the love of God—could people just stop telling me that?” I say a little harsher than I mean to. I’m not trying to be a jerk, but I’ve gotten this lecture so many times at this point that it’s starting to stress me out more than anything else, “I know I’m not fine, but knowing for sure that there is a way out? That will help, and this is the only way we get that. I know I’m stressed. I know that I’m overworking myself. I *know* that I’m being impulsive. But I can’t physically let myself rest until I finish this. It just makes things worse.”

Val studies me closely, the UV glow of her visor burning into me brighter than the Sphinx’s eyes. I can tell that she hates that response, but we’re already here, and she knows I’ve made up my mind.

“What are we discussing in there?” Sapientia asks in amusement, “Getting cold feet?”

“Do what you need to do then,” Val tells me, a distinct cold to her voice.

I turn back to face the Sphinx, but before my mouth is even open, another voice steals my words.

“I’ll play you.” Claireese says, stepping past me.

My heart skips a beat, “Claire, wait—”

“Save it, Wes. This is the best compromise,” she tells me, “This doesn’t mean you don’t get to play her, it just means that you don’t die first. Study the game as I play, and when I lose, maybe you’ll have a better shot at beating her.” The girl steps forward before I can argue, and the Sphinx cuts me off.

“So you’d like to play me first, hmm?” the beast taunts.

“Yeah,” Claire nods with a deep breath.

“Fantastic. Then take your place,” another new hand gestures to the other side of the slab. Claireese does so.

“How do I play?” she asks.

“Now, now, my dear, that’s a question you should have asked before agreeing to play, now isn’t it?”

“W-What? What’s that logic?” Claireese argues, concern lacing her words.

“You must be specific when making deals, my dear. I told you that if you play me and win, I’d give you information. We never discussed any other terms.”

“I asked you the rules,” I jump in, “Two separate times.”

“On the contrary, Wesly. You asked what the game was, it’s goal, and if there was more to it than the one rule I did give you. I answered all of those questions entirely true.”

I open my mouth to argue, but quickly realize there’s no point. She’s not wrong, and besides, she clearly sets the boundaries anyway. The situation does give us some vital information about the woman, however. She abides strictly by some form of personal code, and her cunning comes from the ignorance of those facing her. Still, I can’t help but be bitter at her, knowing that Claireese basically just signed her own death waver.

“So that’s how you play?” I growl at her, “by technicalities?”

The Sphinx ‘smiles’, “A girl needs to eat, Wesly, and it’s been a *long* time since I’ve had a good meal.” She turns back to Claireese, then speaks in a sing-song voice as if nothing is wrong, “Choose your dice then, lovely.” The sphinx tells her.

We watch as the small bones on the platform lightly rattle against the stone before rolling into separate piles as if by magic. Some are on their own, some have a partner, and there’s one set in a group of three.

Claireese stares down at the dice, then cautiously picks one up; one of the biggest ones.

“Interesting choice—” The Sphinx starts.

“Hold on now,” Claire tells her, “I’m just looking.”

The eyes of the monster linger closer to the girl, fascination smoldering in them, “Oh? And you believe you’re allowed to do that?”

“Considering that I’m screwed no matter what now, I figured it’s the least you could afford me.” My helmet analyzes Claireese’s posture and movement patterns as I watch her. It informs me that she’s in a panicked state.

The Sphinx is silent for a while before releasing a small chuckle. “You’re a plucky one, are you? Fine. Browse all you like. But hurry it along, would you? I’ve simply been *dying* to play.”

One by one, Claire studies the sets of dice, doing her best to ignore the smolder coming from in front of her. She reaches for the tiles next, but before she can get to them, a pale, boney arm with slate black nails slams down on top of them, making all of us jump.

“I nearly forgot to shuffle these while you choose. Thank you for reminding me,” croons Wisdom. She hauls the tiles off into the darkness, to which we hear them begin clattering around.

“How do we know you aren’t cheating somehow?” Val postures. “If we don’t know how to play, how will we know if we’re winning or not?”

The Sphinx’s eyes snap to her, and dilate to tiny specks, “You’d be wise not to call my character into question, Valentine. I never am dishonest; especially when it comes to the game.”

“This one,” Claire says, trying to keep the heat off of Val. She holds a jagged looking bone in her fingers, sharp on two sides with ridges along the middle for it to land on. The symbols are carved into the crook of each one.

“And your sigil?” asks the Sphinx.

Claireese tilts her head in confusion as she looks back at the dice. She flickers her visor between the glowing rings in the darkness and the fragment in her hand, trying to get a read on what the beast means. Luckily, she get’s a hint from her.

“Just pick one, my dear. That part is all luck anyway.”

Claireese eyes the dice again, then points to a rune on it, saying in almost a question, “That one?”

Sapientia looks at the trinket intensely before croaking out softly, “Marvelous.”

Two stone tiles come sliding across the table face down to Claireese, to which the girl cautiously takes them. She lifts them fully from the platform for a second before hesitating and only slightly slanting them to peek at. Obviously, the symbols there mean nothing to her, but it’s at least a good idea. When the Sphinx doesn’t call her out on anything, Claireese takes it as the correct thing to do, then sets the tiles back down as she found them.

“Shall we then?” the Sphinx asks, grabbing the pile of three dice. We hear them clatter as she pulls them into her shadow, so Claireese cups hers into her palm as well. The beasts casts her bones across the table, and we jump a bit as a small pop erupts from two that touch, casting a flicker of sparks across the table. The Sphinx peers down at them before looking up at Claireese.

Claire shakes her hand skeptically for a moment, the small object within rattling about as she waits for any sort of verbal instruction. When she doesn’t get anything, she simply let’s the dice fly. It clatters across the stone, coming to a halt in the center of the table. The Sphinx’s lets out a fascinated sounded grunt.

“I knock.” She announces, her gaze sliding to Claireese.

My friend stares at the creature in utter confusion, then back down to the dice. I can see her hand start picking frantically at the zipper of her jacket as she stands in the silence. Finally, she returns a soft, “I knock too.”

The Sphinx’s eyes dilate for a moment, before we see another limb emerge from the dark. The lion's paw from earlier. One of the talons snaps out, to which Wisdom digs it into the stone before her. Chills run through my body at the awful scraping noise that follows as she digs a mark into the table; a diagonal line no longer than an inch.

“That’s one for me,” she tells Claireese.

The girl doesn’t respond to the being directly. She just lets out a soft, shaky, “Okay…” before retrieving her dice and going again.

The same thing happens like before, with the Sphinx’s dice sparking off one another, although this time, Claireese’s dice does something too. As it lands on the table, the symbol that’s face up begins to glow. It's hardly enough to emit any meaningful light, but in the darkness, it clearly sticks out as slightly radiant.

“Ward.” The Sphinx says, her pupils growing excitedly.

Claireese looks down at her totem again and thinks for a moment. “Knock,” she says confidently.

The Sphinx releases a small pleased chuckle, then scoops her dice back up without another word. She doesn’t add a mark this time. Cautiously, Claireese reaches for her dice as well.

The next round goes the same, minus the fancy glowing, although this time, the Sphinx calls knock again. Claireese gives ‘ward’ a spin, which seems to work as there're no marks added. The next turn, however, something different happens again. Wisdom casts her dice out alongside Claireese, to which she slips a hand out of the dark to reveal one of her tiles.

“Knock.” She declares. I don’t understand any of the sigils on the stone, but whatever it means, the beast stares at Claireese expectantly. It’s her turn now.

The girl nervously reaches for one of her tiles, and flips it, sliding it out into the open where the Sphinx eyes it over.

“Lucky you.” She purrs. A hand reaches out from the darkness and stretches across the table this time, marking a line similar to hers in front of Claireese.

“Okay, good…” Claire says with a shaky voice into the coms, “Now I just need to figure out what I just did and do that some more.”

“I wish I knew what it was that you even did,” Val mutters to her softly.

“I fear we may need to take those helms from you if you’re going to play me,” The Sphinx interrupts us, proving my theory right about her hearing. “The game is only played between two.”

Claire doesn’t respond. She remains quiet and scoops up her dice. Rattling it in her hand. She casts it out on the table the same time as the sphinx this time, and the beasts simply stares at her. It takes Claire a second to realize that it’s finally her turn to call first.

She looks to her last tile and flips it over, sliding it to the center of the table and saying, “Knock.”

The Sphinx releases an amused hum, “Nice try, my little morsel, but you haven’t quite gotten it yet.” Her hand extends from the darkness and knocks twice on the table before she unfolds a finger to claw a new line, crossing her other one. Her eyes loom over Claireese, raising slightly into the air as she speaks again, “Last chance to figure it out, daughter of Eve. Are you feeling lucky?”

Claireese doesn’t bother speaking again as she reaches for her dice once more. Her hand hovers cautiously over them, her brain searching frantically for a plan before realizing there’s only one way out. With no other option, she scoops up her die.

The rolls are cast, and Claire looks down at her dice, hugging her stomach with a free hand that trembles softly. My stomach churns at her fear. I hate that she has to be the first into the unknown.

The Sphinx’s hungry eyes pour over the cast runes before zeroing in on Claire in tight pins. “Knock.” She calls out.

“…Ward.” Claire returns, barely a whisper.

There’s a long, terrible silence in the room as all three of us hold our breath, waiting for the results. The creature is unreadable in the dark, her golden circles the only window we have into her eldritch thoughts. They go wide like saucers as they glare across the table at my friend, and I get a jolt of numbness as she speaks.

“I wouldn’t feel too bad, my dear,” she starts, digging a claw into the table and drawing another strike through the top part of the ‘X’ she had already made. “It’s impressive you managed even one with how lost you are.”

In the time that my eyes blink shut, then open from flinching, the Sphinx has already pounced across the table and pinned Claireese to the floor. She lies sloped against the steps behind us, whimpering and grunting softly as claws dig into her chest. I can almost see the sphinx through the cloud of darkness that follows her now, but her form is vague and inconsistent from the pieces that stick out in the shadow.

It feels like every small instant I stare, she’s changing—the shape of a beautiful woman into that of a horrid beast into an indiscernible, writhing mass of shapes. They all shift before my eyes can even focus in on them, leaving me to wonder if they were even there to begin with or if my mind is trying its hardest to fill in the blanks of what might be pinning my friend to the floor. the only part that’s certain is the pale, gangly hand that holds her neck against the crook of a step, causing her to choke and sputter.

Instinctively, I move forward, but the Sphinx snaps her eyes to me through the dark.

“Now, now, Wesly. We had a deal. Let’s not sour our trust so soon, hm?”

“Y-You didn’t ever say what happens if we lose!” I shout frantically, trying to play her own game. It at least buys me a few seconds as she tilts her head. “You said, ‘If we lose, then’… You never finished the sentence. How were we supposed to know this was the punishment?”

That manages a chuckle from the creature, “I suppose you have a point, Wesly. I didn’t tell you.” With a hand still pinning her chest, Sapientia slips her other one up Claire’s neck, hooking the rim of her helmet and yanking it off. It clatters down the pyramid to the lab floor, and I’m met with Claire’s terror filled eyes as she breathes frantically.

“Let me *show* you instead.” The Sphinx whispers before lunging forward.

My eyes can’t make out what exactly it is that wraps around Claireese’s neck, but I can see my friend's face clearly. Val winces her gaze to the floor at the sight, unable to bear the pained squeak Claire lets out before being silenced, but I can’t bring myself to. The sight is awful, and the terrible, fleshy smacking and slurping makes me sick, but I can’t look away. Claire’s eyes are locked on me, distant and shocked as her limbs instinctively thrash and shove against the body on top of her. The small connection we have as I stare back feels like the only solace she has through the experience, and it would feel too much like abandoning her if I were to look away. After what feels like hours, Claire’s body stops fighting, her eyes go glassy, and she slumps back against the floor, finally free from the Sphinx’s hold.

The creature lumbers over my friend's corpse for a moment, panting hard as she soaks up the final drops of blood still clinging to her lips. Then, contrasting the wild animal that she just showed us, she rises gracefully before prowling back up the steps and to her platform.

Val and I each meet her gaze again as her eyes go from feral slits back to perfect rings.

“Well?” She playfully hums, “Who’s next?”

Val turns to me and tries desperately one last time in a low whisper, “Wes… Let’s just walk away.”

“Val…” I sigh softly. I’m becoming too mentally fatigued to fight these battles every time a decision needs to be made.

The girl must sense this, because she stares at me for a moment longer before snapping around and facing the Sphinx, “I’m next.” She turns back to me and jabs a finger before I can say anything, “If you want to play this game, fine, but I’m not going to be around to watch you do it.”

I know the ‘game’ she’s referring to isn’t Totem, and what’s worse is I can tell that I’ve genuinely upset her with my stubbornness. I don’t know what to say without making things worse, so I just keep my mouth shut as she takes her place before the altar.

I’m disheartened to see that Val’s game goes worse than Claire’s. She takes her time to study things too and try to piece it all together, but I don’t know if she gathers much. She doesn’t even get lucky enough to score a single hit on the beast before she gets all three of her marks. Val doesn’t say anything to me the whole time, and though I can tell she’s scared, she doesn’t make any sound when the Sphinx leaps across the table this time.

She swipes Val off to the side to feed, blocking her with her shadowy figure. It at the very least, despite the sickening sounds of gore, makes it so I don’t have to watch. At this point, I’m feeling viscerally ill, my chest so tight it feels like there’s something lodged in my sternum. It’s hard to breathe and I want to throw up, but I do my best to maintain a solid outward appearance as to not be weak in front of the creature trying to determine my ‘worthiness’. Maybe Val is right. Maybe this isn’t a good idea. I know it’ll just upset her more if she finds out I still took a turn after everything so far, but at the same time, it feels like a horrible waste if I stop…

She takes her seat again then looks me over, delight dancing in her voice as she asks, “Well, Wesly? What do you think? You want to try your hand as well?”

I exhale shakily through my nose rhythmically, trying to get my heartbeat under control. The amber eyes fix on me in their now intimate shrinking and growing dance, trying to analyze me. For some reason I can’t explain, it irks me. It frustrates me to no end the cocky, snide attitude of this beast. She knows she holds all the cards—all the knowledge—and that we’re helpless unless we play. Of course it would be this. I couldn’t be easy.

 I can run away, but then what? Try a million ways out and throw ourselves at dead ends to see if we can escape? Even if we go with our gut and try to kill the King to escape, there’s no guarantee that it, too, isn’t part of the loop, able to reset and bring itself back to life. Or worse, what if it can’t die? If we tried to kill it and failed, there’s no doubt it wouldn’t hesitate to null us. Then that’d be it. We’d be vegetables for the rest of eternity, trapped in a shell among the same three days over and over and over.

Val may have a point on this, but she’s also not thinking long term. If I’m stressed now, the stress of the alternative is too much to bear. It would break me, and I don’t know what I would do as a broken person. The first time I let my mind break, I ended up with a scar on my arm, and the second time I chose to, I murdered hundreds of people. Would I become like Sue and her followers after a while? Psychotic sadists that find joy in ripping and tearing through other living things?

My breath feels tight coming in and out now, like breathing through coffee straws, and I can’t stay in my head any longer. To the Sphinx’s surprise, I reach up to the rim of my helmet and pull it loose. The cold, stale, rot-filled air of the lab isn’t easy on my lungs, but it’s better than being trapped in the shell. Wisdom clearly revels in this development, her pupils going wild in size and shape.

“Oh my… hello, handsome.” She teases with a giggle.

“Do you have a light?” I ignore her taunts. “I can’t see without the helmet.”

“And why would you need to see?” She asks, knowingly.

“Because I need to see the table.”

I hear an amused purring sound from across the table as two braziers elevated on pillars to either side of us suddenly light up, bathing the space in just enough light for me to see the playing field. I’m confident the torches and their pillars weren’t there when I had my helmet on, but I don’t dwell on it. There are more important matters.

I grab the same dice Claire used and then we start, my luck being the same as those before me. I lose one round, then manage to draw two before losing another. I almost regret taking my helmet off as I play, the Sphinx’s eyes violating me the whole time and reading all the new details that my expressions offer. At least the visor created some sort of small barrier between us.

To my surprise, I actually manage to get a hit on her when I knock upon hitting the glowing rune on a roll. She even guarded, which at least gives me the knowledge that some values can override each other. The victory is trivial, however, as I know I have to do that two more times, and that’s a near impossibility at my level. But then something strange happens. I pull another win. I roll, slide a tile out, then knock, only for the Sphinx to do the same and still lose. My eyes fix to the table as I reach out for my dice, seeing that we’re tied at the moment.

My breath is low and shallow, my hand trembling as I extend it out. I scoop up my piece for most likely the final time, and I can feel the Sphinx’s eyes boring into me as I try to focus on the altar, pretending not to notice.

She doesn’t let me, however, opting to speak, “What’s the matter, Wesly?”

I rattle my dice, then cast it onto the table. “Do you really need me to answer that?”

“It would be polite to do so.”

“You’re all knowing,” I tell her, trying to keep as plain an expression as possible, “You should know the answer already.”

She chuckles in the back of her throat before speaking again, not acknowledging what I said, “Something in your eyes—you’re carrying something.”

“Can we just finish this game?” I ask.

“Oh, come now, handsome, humor me for a bit. Buttering me up may have its benefits.” The beast purrs.

I return my glare to her, and take a deep breath, “What do you want me to say? Obviously, things aren’t exactly ‘peachy’ right now.”

“Ah, but I’m not talking about the grander picture,” The Sphinx coos, “This is about the game. About me. Sure, your situation is bad, but you’re carrying something else, and it’s not fear. You look relieved.”

I furrow my brow, “What?”

“You seem relieved. That this game is nearly over.”

“I *would* like to get it over with,” I tell her, “So can we? Stop trying to throw me off—”

“You were afraid to come here, weren’t you?” the Sphinx interrupts, “Not because you were scared to meet me—no, you’ve fought beasts twice as frightening as me. I think you’re scared of something else.”

“Knock.” I tell her.

The beast leans closer across the table, “You know what I think you’re afraid of?” She whispers, “I think your stubbornness is a double-edged sword. You couldn’t not come here, Wesly, but deep down, no matter what you tell dear Valentine and everyone else, you don’t really want to.”

“What are you even rambling about, right now?” I hiss, “Just take your turn and get this over with.”

“You’re afraid because you know that eventually, if you keep throwing yourself at me over and over again, you’ll beat me, Wesly. And when you do, you’ll get exactly what you want; the answer to your question. Sometimes the truth is dangerous, though; after all, they say ignorance is bliss. I think you’ve realized that better than anyone. So tell me, handsome, what are you are afraid of finding out?”

My blood runs cold, and my chest feels too tight to breathe. I choke on the last breath I pulled in as it hitches in my throat, leaving me a stiff, sick mess as I stare the monster down. It feels like an eternity as I stand there, lost in her abyss pools. Somehow, it feels like her pupils are darker than the shadow of everything else. Just when I think that she’s not going to move on until she gets an answer, the Sphinx releases a small chuckle and slips back to her side of the table. She rolls her dice out then stares down at them.

“Pity.” she declares, knocking on the stone, “And here I was rooting for you.”

The next thing I know, I’m on my back staring up at the ceiling, the sharp pain in my chest now accompanied by five other ones that steadily leak blood. Even with her on top of me, I can’t make out Wisdom’s features as the braziers snuff out, leaving us in complete darkness. Her eyes are so close now that they take up nearly all my vision, and I can feel her hot breath pouring against me as she huffs like a wolf.

“This has been fun, handsome. I truly hope I get to see you and your friends again *very* soon. Although, I’m sure *you* feel differently,” She giggles. Then, she snaps down on my neck.

Val and Claire’s grunts and moans didn’t do their deaths justice. The Sphinx’s bite isn’t just a normal killing blow. As her teeth sink into my throat and scrape against the bone of my spine, I feel a pain like no other. It sears through every nerve of my body, like fire ants crawling around in every fold of flesh. I can feel my blood being gulped out too, the worst part of it all, somehow. The endless draw of my crimson leaving my flesh as it slowly grows cold. It’s too familiar. Too similar to the way it pours out of a slit in the flesh from a knife wound.

‘Slowly’ is the right word, too. It feels like an eternity there, pinned to the ground. I think after five minutes it must be any second that darkness will encroach, but then ten pass. Then twenty and forty and then an hour. It dawns on me as I continue to writhe and squirm that this isn’t just a dilation of time from my perception. The Sphinx is somehow extending this. Savoring it. My pain just as much as my blood. I wonder if Val and Claire felt this way too—an eternity of pain, in an instant. Finally, when I’m nearly certain I can’t take it anymore, I feel my vision begin to darken. The sensation of the Sphinx’s teeth becomes less on my neck, and finally, I find myself going completely numb. The droning wind of the facility and the feral gulps ripping through it goes quiet, and then I hear nothing at all.

Snapping awake in the truck, my hands go for my throat right away. Val and Claire do the same, and we each once each other over quickly before sinking back against the wall. It’s clear by everyone’s faces that they want to know what happened, but they thankfully don’t ask. They know better at this point when we show up with pale faces and discouraged expressions that our expedition most likely didn’t go according to plan. We’ll tell them all later, but right now, we just need a breather. After what we just went through, I’m actually relieved for once that we get three days inside the compound.

There’s little relief as we glide through the endless night toward safety, however. The whole silent drive, I feel Val simmering next to me, and Claire on the other side looking sick as she tries to reconcile her own feelings about the way she was killed. I do the same, but my mind is more focused on what the Sphinx said before she killed me. She saw right through. She read me like a book.

He was in charge of taking care of any issues that happened after the end of the morning shifts. I was serving as a physician and each time there was a sick soldier that had to be sent to the hospital or to stay in our infirmery or whatever I would call him. So we would talk many times throughout the day. I would also message him things like sick leave documents etc.

At some point I was also hospitalized because I had a nasty food poisoning. He came to visit along with the Captain. It was the first time that I actually saw him, I only knew him by his voice. I felt alive again at that moment he was so damn cute.

Now that my duty is over we've been out for a coffee twice. We've discussed about ""safe"" topics like what we do in our lives (me in medicine and him in the army) and about gym. We also make phone calls, he calls me during his shifts and we talk for some time.

I have traces of interest. We exchange selfies, I call him by his military grade and add a word that in Greek resembles somehow that -chan used in Japanese (which shows familiarity). He calls me something that in Greek means small (but has something like a cute meaning). Should I take the wait and see approach or do something?

Another thing is that I feel stressed when I talk to him. I'm happy and I can't wait to talk but I'm also stressed. He's not my chief anymore, I'm not his subordinate or whatever but I still feel that I'm talking to someone in authority and that I have to respect.

Hey, MaximizeMe family! 🌟 Have you ever felt like you’re juggling so many tasks that you might as well join the circus? 🎪 Spoiler: I’m the one on that unicycle, balancing a flaming baton in one hand and my life goals in the other. But hey, who isn’t keeping life interesting these days?

Let's get real. Staying organized in this chaotic world feels like trying to herd cats, right? **BUT**, with the right tools at your disposal, it's like giving those cats a common goal and watching the magic happen. 🐱✨

**Here’s my secret weapon: planning and task apps.** Trust me, they’re like having a personal assistant in your pocket, minus the expense of course. 😉

**Why? Because:**

1. **The List Maker’s Dream**: **To-Do Lists**…and more lists! With apps like Todoist or Microsoft To Do, you can write lists, subdivide them, color-code, and feel like you invented organization. Isn't it oddly satisfying to check things off? *Galadriel voice* ‘Even the smallest task checked off is capable of changing the course of a day.'

2. **Tame the Chaos, Calendar Style**: Google Calendar or Fantastical are like the Harry Potters of app world—magically juggling your work meetings, coffee dates, and (let’s be honest) binge-watching marathons. Remember, if it’s not scheduled, it doesn't exist!

3. **Bullet Journaling for Techies**: With apps like Notion or Evernote, it's like your brain gets a digital upgrade. Imagine having a diary, vision board, and reminder app all rolled into one—minus the glitter spills. These apps can show you the bigger picture while handling nitty-gritty details. 🎨🧠

4. **Focus Mode: Activated**: Apps like Forest or Focus@Will help you grow virtual trees or tune into concentration-enhancing tunes, adding a little reward system every time you dodge the endless scroll of social media.

But, **be warned**, not every shiny new app is your friend. We've all gone down the rabbit hole only to realize that *yet another* app doesn't necessarily solve everything. Stick to what fits your style!

**Real Talk**: Anyone ever spent more time organizing their organizing app than actually doing the tasks? 🙋‍♂️ It’s a journey, folks. But once you find your rhythm, it’s like switching from dial-up to fiber-optic internet. Fast-track to productivity!

Alright, my fellow life-optimizers, let’s hear your stories. Found an app that changed your productivity game or some quirky tip that keeps you on track? Jump in and let’s get the convo rolling! 

*(And remember, the next time life feels like a three-ring circus, just think: 'I’ve got an app for that.' 😉)*",1,1736486801.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

","For over a month I had been taking the ancestral supplements grass-fed beef liver as per dose and felt fantastic. I got it because I have problems with anemia, blood clotting, low B vitamin and stuff like that based on actual blood work. So instead of taking the prescribed B supplement and vitamin d and this or that that my doctor was going to give me I was like okay I'll take dessicated bovine liver. I felt fantastic. I was curious and when I ran out and was looking to reorder I decided to mix it up because I was seeing a lot of good things about liver plus adrenal and thyroid. Thyroid issues (hypo) are very prevalent in my family. My aunt was telling me that she's had better results with taking porcine thyroid than she ever did with any sort of medication. So I thought I would give ancient nutritions women vitality a try. I also keep getting lots of primal Queen ads flooding my feeds. So I was skeptical of that brand but either way so I was like okay let's try the women's vitality expecting to feel great, like I had reading about and I felt like absolute dog shit.

It was as soon as I started taking women's vitality. I've read somewhat briefly other people have had this issue but I can't find anything about as to why. Everything I see is always talking about all the pros of this combo and I'm having a hard time finding any information as to why I felt like dog shit on this. I've found plenty of info saying that when you have low adrenal I'm supposed to be feeling like how I was while taking the adrenal supplement. I tried taking the recommended dose and I tried taking just a third of the recommended dose and no matter what I felt bad.

(*Grainy, through the phone, with the faint sounds of a car running in the back*) -and I put my hands on his shoulders, sit him down, look him dead in his dead eyes, and tell him with as much sincerity as I can manage… “that’s what she said.”



\[Laugh\] 



I did, and I’ll do it again. I’m not sorry, “that’s what she said” jokes have always been funny and always will be. 



Well, maybe I’d make less jokes if he weren’t the butt of them! He’s a total tool, babe, as much as I love him. The sooner someone tells him, the better. 



He’ll be fiiiine. We’ve got a shift together tomorrow. I’ll bring him coffee, and we’ll be thick and thieves. 



Oh, you best believe we’ll need the coffee. It’s gonna be a crazy night, that Valentine’s Day time slot, and not even any holiday pay to make it worth it. 



It’s alright. Another day, another dollar. But you’re not working tomorrow. Got anything fun planned?



Ohh, that sounds like a good time. Not too exciting but very fun all the same, the perfect Galentine’s if you will. Get a drink for me, will you? 



I’d get my own drink if I could, beautiful; I would if I could. You’ll have to have enough fun for the both of us and tell me all about it. Besides, I wouldn’t want to cramp you and Taylor’s style, and it’s always so fun hearing you tell it back to me the next day.



(*Agreeing*) Only think more fun would be getting to live it myself. One day, baby, one day I’ll be driving to you instead of my dumb, studio apartment. 



Thirty-one hours and sixteen minutes. Thirty one hours even if I go straight from work. Don’t you tempt me; I’ve got a full tank of gas and an audiobook. 



(*Somber*) I know. I wish we could spend our first Valentine’s Day together too. I wish we could afford the time off or the plane tickets. The long-distance thing is hard. 



\[A little laugh\] 



I’m trying to make it worth it, I promise. In fact, the present I got you should be there any minute. Can you guess what it is? What did you really want as a gift?



\[Another little laugh as the faint car sounds stop and are replaced with walking\] 



Me on your doorstep, I should have guessed. Well, call me a cupid/genie hybrid, because I might make your Valentine’s Day wishes come true. 



\[The doorbell rings.\]



You should go answer that. 



\[Footsteps, the opening of a door\]



(*Clear, not coming from the phone, bashful*) Hi. 



\[A joyous laugh and *thump* of being hugged strongly\]



(*Giddy*) What do you mean what am I doing here? I’m here to be your valentine, obviously. 



I *was* driving, just not in my car to my place. Got that sweet rental over there. 



Typically, I *wouldn’t* be able to afford the car and plane ticket. That’s why I’ve been saving for the past… oh, six months give or take. 



Of course. It’s not like Valentine’s Day isn’t on the same day every year. I had plenty of time to pinch my pennies and plan something. (*Playful*) It doesn’t hurt that your best friend made a sizable donation to the charitable foundation of true love.



Yes, they did. Taylor wants me to pass on to you that I’m your present and that they forgive you for bailing tomorrow. They already have other possible plans lined up, because they thought you might be busy. (*Shy*) With me. If you want to be. If you’ll have me. 



\[Cloth rustling of another hug\]



(*Low, as if by the listener’s ear*) I’m really here. You’re really here. We’re here together. You have me. 



Have I mentioned how beautiful you are? I can’t believe I haven’t done that yet. Video chat over discord really doesn’t do you justice. It’s so nice to talk to you without worrying about the call dropping. It’s nice to touch you and hold you… It’d be nice to kiss you if you’d be okay with that.



\[A breath before a tentative kiss followed by several quick, giddy kisses and then an intimate moment of shared breathing interrupted by an alarm.\]



And there it is. Happy Valentine’s Day, baby. 



\[Kiss\]



Do you want to come see the presents I’ve got for you in the car, or do you want to leave those for tomorrow? Or should I say later today? 



Of course I got you presents, silly. Me showing up here, that’s a me and Taylor collaboration, but the ones I’ve got wrapped up in the trunk are all me and much better than my jetlagged ass on your doorstep. 



That’s fair- let the suspense build, open them in the daylight. Presents are always better in the morning. (*Tentative*) I guess, I’ll see you in the morning? 



(*Bashful*) Well, I booked a nearby hotel room. I didn’t want to presume.



(*Happy*) I would love to stay here if you’d have me. 



Whatever you say, Valentine.



No, my bag is in this shrub right here.



(*Cheeky*) I didn’t want to presume, but I did hope. I hoped very, very hard.

Some months ago, I bought some dried caps online and made tea with them. I'm not super confident that I fully converted all the ibotenic acid (iirc I boiled it for 30 minutes), but this was my experience. 

I experimented with the amount of tea for a few days. I started with 2 tablespoons and eventually worked my way up into drinking a small coffee mug of it. The first thing I noticed was how patient it made me. Waiting on ads to run through or for things to load was no big deal. I watched several documentaries and other long YouTube videos I'd meant to watch but had never gotten around to. 

Then on the night I drank a full cup I had what you might call a little diet trip. I had a very relaxing and chill shower, then while I was trying to fall asleep I was listening to an album. But I couldn't really fully enjoy the music because the beginning of each song jumpscared me and I jolted in surprise. Then the music would quickly fade away. This happened for each song. 

I also became very weak...I kept dropping my glasses case, and my phone felt like it weighed like 50 pounds. But even weirder than that was whenever anything would move (my hands, the ceiling fan, etc.) the object would leave a neon blue and green shadow. 

Since then I've bought a container of muscimol gummies from highlyconcentr8ed. I like them and will probably buy them again if possible, but I'm wondering if the crazy effects (music jumpscare, weak hands, neon shadows) are from the ibotenic acid for the muscimol. 

Anyway, I just read on the 4aco subreddit that apparently the FDA banned muscimol usage in edible products. So, if that's true, it looks like I may have to make that tea again sooner rather than later. ",1,1736485583.0,AmanitaMuscaria,1,1.0,False

Healthy relationships take care and attention. 

This weekend, how do you plan to or think you can intentionally care for your relationships? Consider taking time to get a cup of coffee with a friend Saturday morning or get your family together to do a much-needed chore around the house. Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger. 

In the comments below, share your goals for relationship care, ask for help coming up with ideas, or just share how you feel about devoting your time and energy to caring for the important people in your life. If the experience was positive, share it below to inspire others so we can celebrate your wins! If your plans do not go well or fell flat, share that too!

1hxwv0p,https://i.redd.it/txnkm1pul3ce1.jpeg,Must Visit Cafe ,"In a city that prides itself on cafes and coffee, there’s a somewhat not cool “bakery and coffee shop” in Newtown that’s hard to beat when it comes to the things that really matter. Such as long blacks and pies. 

They delivered an excellent long  black - no more than 2/3 full so it was nice and strong and with hot water on the side. I have no idea what brand of coffee it was and whether it was grown sustainably or organically and no idea whether it was picked and packed responsibly and ethically. I do know that it was the best long black I’d had in awhile. 

Best of all and the reason I go there is that they have my favourite pie flavour, one which is very hard to find. I can’t reveal that flavour as they don’t make many and if I tell you they might sell out before I get there. 

I’ve sampled pies nationwide and these pies are great. Better than most other pie places. 
They have a range of traditional pie flavours. And other essentials like sausage rolls and white bread sammies. 

Bright lighting that reveals every detail, authentic plastic chairs, hard noisy flooring, and real chair scrape noise /  atmosphere enhanced by the diverse clientele of Newtown. No staff tattoos that I noticed but then again I wasn’t looking. 
Honestly, you’re spoiled for choice here - there’s a typical normal cool cafe with tattoos just up the road plus Maccas across the road. 

Back to the untrendy bakery cafe. It’s basic but awesome. Plus you can often park on the street outside or nearby! A rarity. Not sure about cycle facilities.

You know the type: clipboard, self-righteous attitude, always sniffing out problems that don’t exist. She’s not even on the HOA board, but she acts like she’s the president of the universe.

The issue started when I decided to brighten up my yard with some colorful flowers. Nothing crazy—just some daisies, tulips, and a little garden patch. Harmless, right? Well, not according to Karen.

One afternoon, she stomps over, waving her little HOA rulebook like it’s the Bible and she’s Moses coming down the mountain. “Those flowers aren’t in compliance,” she screeches. “You’re violating section 12.4! Only native plants are allowed.”

I try to reason with her. “Karen, the HOA guidelines just say the yard has to be well-maintained. These flowers are fine.”

But no, Karen wasn’t having it. She said she was going to report me to the HOA because “rules are rules.” Fine. You want me to follow the rules, Karen? I’ll follow the rules.

So, I did some research and found every obnoxious native plant I could get my hands on. Thorny bushes? Check. Spiky grasses? Check. A massive yucca plant that looks like it wants to eat small animals? Oh, you better believe I planted that front and center.

By the time I was done, my yard looked like a post-apocalyptic jungle—but every single plant was 100% native to the area. And, let me tell you, I double-checked the HOA guidelines to make sure I was bulletproof.

Karen comes stomping back a week later, furious. “This is unacceptable!” she yells, flailing her clipboard. “Your yard looks terrible!”

“Oh, Karen,” I said, with the sweetest smile I could muster. “You were so right. My flowers weren’t compliant. But these are all native plants, just like the rules you pointed out. Isn’t it great?”

She sputtered like a broken engine and ran off to the HOA. They reviewed my yard and, guess what? Completely compliant. Karen ended up getting a warning from the board for harassing neighbors.

Now I sit on my porch, sipping coffee, surrounded by my chaotic jungle of compliance, while Karen avoids making eye contact every time she walks by. It’s the little victories, you know?",475,1736484934.0,MaliciousCompliance,32,0.86,False

1. Bring a Dish: Everyone should contribute food to share. Home-cooked is ideal, but if cooking isn’t your thing, feel free to grab something from outside. The goal is to snack and enjoy a wholesome spread. 🧺
Also bring your own water bottle.
Outside Snacks could be samosa, poha, jalebi, dhokla, chips, fruit cakes, cold drink or juice or lemonade, or tea/Coffee.


2. Friendly Vibes Only: Be kind and welcoming to everyone. We want an environment where people feel comfortable, so please leave any ""savage"" attitudes at home. 😇


3. Comfort and requirements: Wear something comfortable that allows you to sit, walk, and enjoy the time without any fuss. Please try to bring a bedsheet, use and throw spoons, napkins or tissue papers, garbage bags/polybags so we can clean the space post picnic.


4. Punctuality Matters: Please be on time! It’s important for everyone to be part of the introductions, and late arrivals can disrupt the flow. ⏰


5. No Alcohol or Smoking: This is a sober event, so please don’t bring alcohol or come pre-drunk. If you need to smoke, feel free to step out or wait until after the picnic.


6. If you are a reader bring books to exchange with each other, no free gifting and parts. You can bring cards or board games to chill out too.

When evaluating diamond brilliance, several critical factors come into play, directly impacting the visual appeal of your diamond:

* Brilliance refers to the amount of white light reflected back to the viewer, creating that signature diamond sparkle.
* Cut quality plays the most significant role in determining brilliance. Opt for higher cut grades like AGS Triple Ideal.
* Diamonds with a balanced mix of large and small facets and appropriate structured contrast maximize brilliance.
* High clarity minimizes internal flaws that can obstruct light, enhancing overall brilliance.
* Brilliance can change based on lighting conditions; consider how the diamond performs in different settings.
* Personal preference matters - some prefer subtle scintillation, while others seek bold flashes of light.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Feel free to[ reach out for a free one-on-one consultation.](https://labdiamondsreview.com/contact-us/)

# Who is this for?

This information is ideal for:

* New diamond buyers seeking to understand the significance of brilliance
* Those looking to make an informed choice regarding diamond quality and aesthetics
* Engagement ring shoppers wanting to maximize the visual impact of their center stone

# Who is this not for?

This summary may not be relevant for:

* Seasoned diamond collectors already knowledgeable about gemology
* Those prioritizing other factors like size or color over brilliance
* Buyers on a very tight budget who may need to compromise on cut quality

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Focus on cut grade: Prioritize diamonds with Excellent or Ideal cut grades.
2. Consider round brilliants: They typically offer the highest level of brilliance.
3. Evaluate in different lighting: Ask to see the diamond under various light sources.
4. Use magnification: Examine the diamond under 10x magnification to check for light leakage.
5. Compare similar diamonds: View multiple stones side-by-side to better assess brilliance differences.
6. Trust reputable retailers: Choose sellers known for their cut quality standards.
7. Consider light performance tools: Some retailers offer ASET or Idealscope images to evaluate light return.

# FAQ

1. What exactly is diamond brilliance?Brilliance refers to the white flashes of light reflected back to the viewer's eyes when light enters the diamond.
2. Why do some diamonds sparkle more than others?Sparkle is primarily determined by cut quality and clarity. Well-cut diamonds with fewer inclusions will generally sparkle more.
3. How does the cut affect brilliance?

A well-executed cut maximizes light reflection back to the viewer. Poor cuts can cause light to leak out, reducing brilliance.

1. Can diamonds be cut to favor brilliance over fire?Yes, some cuts emphasize brilliance over fire. However, most experts recommend a balanced cut combining brilliance, fire, and scintillation.
2. How does lighting affect diamond brilliance?Brilliance is more noticeable in indirect lighting, while direct lighting tends to enhance fire. Natural lighting can affect how much brilliance is observed.
3. Are certain diamond shapes better for brilliance?

Round brilliant, cushion, princess, and Asscher cuts are known for high sparkle due to their many facets. Emerald cuts tend to have less fire but can still appear brilliant with good clarity.

By understanding these factors, you can make a more informed decision when selecting a diamond that maximizes brilliance and meets your preferences.

1hxwiyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cubbe_rd/comments/1hxwiyt/the_hermit/,The Hermit,"I have a five-year plan on a whiteboard in my room.  
My mother mentioned seeing it sat leaning against the wall.  
The steps include school and work, homes and cars and travel.  
""There is no mention of friends,"" she said.

""You are not planning on becoming a hermit, are you?""

Two friends in high school, one friendly and one loud.  
The former had a habit of finding new people.  
He'd crack jokes and throw parties.  
He made you feel included.  
We played video games after school many times in those days.  
Shared lunches and talked through our least favorite classes.

An easy way about him, a deftness with people.  
Friends like that are a godsend to the taciturn.  
But they have a habit of forgetting.  
You are one of many they will bring into their lives.  
And in time they will find some with more kindred spirits.  
Old friends slip through the cracks.

Two friends in high school, the other loud and abrasive.  
He had a habit of speaking his mind, reputation be damned.  
But I knew him better than most.  
Indeed, he was opinionated and stubborn.  
In truth, he and I were cut from quite different cloths.  
But underneath was a compassionate boy  
Burdened with grief and a pronounced loneliness.

We went to a restaurant once, late at night.  
Where and why I cannot recall,  
But he told me his secrets, and I told him mine.  
We saw in each other, safety and compassion.  
Inseparable from that night on.

I watched him grow kinder year after year.  
I watched him make more and more friends of his own.  
He found his tribe, those cut from the same cloth.  
Time passed, our paths diverged.  
There was no fanfare, no melodrama or betrayal.  
I quietly left his side and slipped out into the night. 

Two friends in college, the first from far away.  
Alone on an unfamiliar side of the world, he clung on to me.  
I used to play guitar late at night, behind the school building.  
Singing out my lonely tunes where I thought nobody could hear.  
He came up to me, and like two children on a playground  
“We should be friends,” he said. And we did.  
Two beds in one bedroom, for the rest of our time there.  
We talked music and movies, his girls and my insecurities.  
Got lunches and groceries  
And we played our guitars out behind the school building.

To be honest, I don’t understand why that stopped.  
Little by little he started to decline.  
I continued to offer for quite some time.  
But eventually, I stopped asking.

Graduation day, I was leaving forever.  
I texted to ask where he was.  
“In the next building over,  
But I’m gonna get food with my family,  
So sorry, but have a good life.”  
Never said goodbye,  
And never saw him again.

The other boy I first saw not far from my dorm room,  
One hallway over, just out of my reach.  
A handsome face that I’d see from time to time,  
Roaming around campus, always one step away.  
I couldn’t work up the courage to acquaint myself,  
So I quietly pined through the year

The next year, I got a job, walked in, and there he was.  
I watched him help people much better than I did.  
We barely talked for the first couple months,  
But slowly and surely, we found a cordiality.  
We had lots in common: mathematics and gaming and books.  
If you asked me back then, I’d have told you I loved him.  
The naivety of a teenager, perhaps  
But the admiration was real.  
I asked him out once I'd worked up the nerve.  
""You're sweet,"" he said, and that's the last that I heard.

Two boyfriends in the limbo between college and work.  
The first one was nice but a tad oblivious  
We jumped in headfirst, played at boyfriends  
We made it work for as long as we could  
Too young to know that it wasn’t love

The second, a very different beast.  
Funny and charming, flirty and mischievous  
Endlessly romantic, damn near divine.  
A devil cast down at my feet from heaven.  
He told me he loved me, and I believed him.

He invited me into his life. We made plans.  
I imagined us, married and moving away.  
He wanted to be a park ranger out on the coast.  
Find a quiet house where I’d write songs and wait for him.  
He introduced me to his friends at the bar  
And for the first time it felt like I might have a crowd.  
But merely two weeks later,  
Be it sadness or sickness or boredom or disgust,  
He left me with hardly a word.

The first real heartbreak hurts worse than the rest.  
And this one, a blindside, a backstab I did not anticipate.  
I wonder sometimes, even several years on,  
Where did it go wrong?  
Did he cry? Was he relieved?  
Was the love ever real?  
What does he think of me now?  
Does he think of me now?

Two friends at work, in the thick of that pain.  
The first worked in the room directly below me,  
Another rookie, here to make a difference.  
Only a few years older than me, in truth  
But I looked up to him like an older brother.  
Funny and kind and confident and caring,  
The first person I told about my heartbreak.  
He took me through the worst of my grief.  
Put up with me as I wallowed, spent many a lunch  
Hanging out, playing games, wasting time, and talking shop.

On the worst days, I’d go out and buy him a coffee.  
""You're the best"" he would say in front of everyone.  
He hated it here, and I can't say I blame him.  
Left before I did, moved towns to be with his girl.  
I cried that week, but I was happy for him, truly.  
We kept in touch for some time, even visited twice,  
But that kind of distance is difficult to overcome.  
We went to a bar once, me and his friends  
“We’re in this for life, buddy,” he said in a drunken stupor.  
I wonder if this one was my fault, this fizzling out.  
If I texted or called, would he want me around?

And the other friend in the place where I worked,  
Another rookie, several halls down from mine.  
We’d stop by each other’s rooms after just to vent  
To complain about shitty bosses and shittier coworkers.  
We hung out once or twice, at the work day’s end.  
I reached out once or twice, even after I quit.  
“Should we hang out?” And she’d say, “Definitely!  
Let me get back to you,” but she never did.

I had quit, and resolved to start a new journey  
But in its stead, began a long exile.  
I searched and researched to find something new.  
Spent days in the dark in my room all alone.  
Searched for new jobs, applied, and got ""no's"".  
No one to talk to, and little to do.  
I buried myself in my pillow and my phone.

The internet is where the next stories unfold.  
I made a new friend, someone good-hearted and fun.  
We talked day and night.  
Stayed up late for weeks and then months.  
Be it sadness or sickness or boredom or apathy,  
He found better ways to spend his time than with me.

After him, another, reserved and quietly considerate.  
Some flings here and there as I tried to find something real.  
A friendship I sought out and eventually won.  
Two more friends I wrote from across the pond.  
And three more from three different states.  
One by one, person by person,  
Lengthy conversations faded into nothingness.

""You are not planning on becoming a hermit, are you?"" my mother said to me. 

""I have plenty of friends,"" I replied.

Two friends in high school, two friends in college,  
Two boyfriends, two work friends, and a multitude more.  
What does it say when they all stop replying?  
I look back at my life, my history laid out on the page  
All of the people lost to time  
Each one a scar—how they pile up as you age.  
They haunt me as I reminisce, and throw me accusations  
A vile truth behind them all.  
I am a mathematician.  
I can find the common factor.

There is something unseen, unspeakable within me.  
I study and write, sit and contemplate what it is.  
I wallow, I scream, I sleep through the day.  
Was I always this bitter?  
This ugly and resentful?  
I can hardly recall.

I’ve gotten sober, and I’m not sure why.  
One third of my life gone, if I’m being generous.  
There’s a bottle of heart meds unopened on my desk.  
Why aren’t I taking them?  
Four unopened messages on my phone.  
What does it say about me that I stopped trying?  
That weeks and months pass without me saying a word?  
It’s a mercy, I think to myself.  
Perhaps I am planning on becoming a hermit after all.",1,1736483943.0,u_cubbe_rd,0,1.0,False
1hxwiqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HenryFinanceEurope/comments/1hxwiqf/why_marketcap_weighted_etfs_are_optimal/,Why market-cap weighted ETFs are 'optimal',"Passive and diversified broad-index funds or ETFs arguably represent a game-theory optimal (GTO) approach to investing in real-world markets. They embody the principles of minimizing costs, reducing risk, and leveraging market efficiency. Let me break this down, but first, let’s clarify what “game theory” means.

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. Initially applied to zero-sum games, where one player's gain equals another's loss, it has since expanded to non-zero-sum games and those with ""imperfect information,"" like poker. This is a clip from [A beautiful mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xe9U0D9xY8&ab_channel=BingeSociety) which show cases a crude example of a type of game theory strategy. The other common example is the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw&ab_channel=ThisPlace). This gave rise to the concept of 'Game Theory Optimal' (GTO) strategies such as in Poker (explained in this video [GTO Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx0iJ7h_b8o&ab_channel=FindingEquilibrium), which aim to minimize losses regardless of opponents' actions. This led to the development of multiple Poker AI which beat the majority of professional players in heads-up Poker discussed in this podcast: [Poker AI vs. Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oHH4aClJQs&ab_channel=LexFridmanwhich). However, in investing, GTO is about maximizing risk-adjusted returns, not just minimizing risk.

The concept of *Nash equilibrium* is crucial here. In a Nash equilibrium, players make optimal decisions considering others’ actions, and no one can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. For example, imagine two coffee shops on the same street. If both set prices such that neither gains more customers or profit by adjusting their price alone, they’re in a Nash equilibrium. Here is a video showcasing this in action: [Simulating Supply and Demand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&ab_channel=Primer).

An example in the stock market, similar dynamics occur where participants (buyers, sellers, and investors) interact in the market. If an investor buys an undervalued stock and its price rises to reflect its true value, the market eventually reaches equilibrium. At this point, buyers have no incentive to pay more, and sellers see no benefit in lowering their price, as the stock is now fairly valued. This balance persists until new information or external factors disrupt the market dynamics.

The 'efficient market hypothesis' is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all available information and consistent alpha generation is impossible. 'Alpha' is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its “edge.” Many state that the market behaves this way and approaches an 'efficient market' behaviour such that 'alpha' approaches an asymptote of zero. This is explained well in this video: [Ben Felix - Is The Market Efficient?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix)

['Factor investing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4&ab_channel=BenFelix), such as tilting towards small-cap stocks for their historical premium, can theoretically improve absolute returns. However, these 'factor premiums' come with additional risk, which may not be proportional to their returns. Moreover, as more investors adopt such strategies, their effectiveness diminishes due to crowding. Efficient markets ensure that higher returns at a cheaper price are compensation for higher risk, but they're not a “free lunch.” They are explained in the linked video.

Studies by Fama and French conducting backtesting of data, show that most returns come from market beta, which accounts for >80% of returns (which captures overall market movement), while factors (such as value, momentum, profit and size) contribute the remaining \~18% and 1-2% remains unaccounted for without inclusion of other factors or human behaviour. This is mentioned at 2 mins in by Rick Ferri in this video: [The Case Against Factor Investing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_MFyltNt4)

As an example: tilting toward smaller companies (e.g., small-cap weighting) is based on the small-cap premium hypothesis which is based on the 'size' factor. This is from the observation that historically, smaller companies have delivered higher returns than larger companies, i.e. the small-cap 'premium'. However, these premiums necessarily come with more risk and are not 'free' by increasing risk-adjusted returns with no consequence. Because no 'free lunch' exists; you can’t gain higher returns without taking on proportionate or higher than proportionate risks. As such, higher risk does not translate into higher risk-adjusted returns, only higher absolute returns to compensate for their risks. Passive ETFs guarantee the market at low cost.

ETFs provide market-average returns (beta) at low cost, avoiding the risks and expenses of active management. As markets become more efficient, alpha opportunities shrink, and active strategies yield diminishing returns and attempting to seek alpha results in reduced risk-adjusted returns.. Passive strategies, therefore, dominate by capturing an efficient or near efficient market's return whilst maximising risk-adjusted returns by minimizing unnecessary risk and fees.

Real-world markets aren’t perfect:

1. There is imperfect Information. Not all participants have full access to accurate information, leading to inefficiencies. Some participants have more information than others. However, we are assuming there is no Nancy Pelosi or insider trading going on.
2. There is diversity and lack of heterogeneity. Risk preferences, time horizons, and available resources vary among investors. Many are subject to behavioural biases.
3. Market dynamics are ever present. Although the market is usually quick to price this in, changing economic conditions, policy decisions, and external shocks, can disrupt equilibrium states.

Active investors play a role in price discovery, correcting mispricings by buying undervalued assets or selling overvalued ones. Yet, as alpha becomes harder to find, passive strategies gain appeal. Over time, as markets become more efficient, a Nash equilibrium forms between active and passive investors. The more efficient the market, the tougher it is for active investors to outperform without assuming disproportionate risk. In stock trading, buyers and sellers anticipate each other’s decisions, leading to equilibrium prices where supply matches demand. If the 'efficient market hypothesis' is valid for the stock market, this means that stocks are correctly priced for their risk and the market generally behaves this way. Does this not imply that a 'passive' market-cap-weighted portfolio (i.e. buying the market) represents a game theory optimal strategy by definition?

The asset management industry may exploit inefficiencies to generate alpha, but their fees and payment structure usually mean that they don't end up passing on meaningful benefits to investors after using their money to take on more risk. Rather, it seems to be going to the fund managers themselves, unless they significantly outperform the market over time. However, that is not to mention the added risk involved of doing so depending on their strategy. As an example of the above, I have a mate who invests in an actively managed fund of around 20-30 stocks which charges 1-2% fee as well as a performance fee (20% of returns), so they are the one pocketing all the 'alpha' in excess of market returns. Strategies like HFT quant shops may unintentionally contribute to price efficiency by addressing short-term market imbalances, even if that isn’t their primary aim and aren't tied to intrinsic value analysis or fundamentals.

In actuality, passive investors are a very small portion of the market, however the more passive investors there are, the more active investors attempt to seek 'alpha' are rewarded who help stabilise price discovery. Where active investors are identifying and correcting mispricing in the market by buying undervalued assets or selling overvalued ones (by assuming more risk). This assumes that 'alpha' gets larger as less active investors seek to capitalise on it with new information and as a consequence this price discovery ensures that 'factors' such as 'value' are priced appropriately given their excess risk.

In a market where risk is always present and returns are not guaranteed, minimising risk while capturing the returns of the market is the dominant strategy. ETFs achieve this through diversification based on market-cap weighting, whilst active investors take on unnecessary risk in the hope of outperforming. As more active investors are enter the market and hypothetically only 3/10 active investors get rewarded for seeking alpha,  this eventually becomes 1/10 investors who outperform the index. This  then eventually favour passive investors as they receive optimised risk-adjusted returns, as there they are assuming less risk as assets eventually become appropriately priced as 'alpha' approaches zero.

This will then lead to its own 'Nash equilibrium' then with passive investors and active investors. Although if we are the believe that market are indeed efficient and that markets incorporate information quickly, there is little room for active investors to find 'alpha' without taking on disproportionate risk. The more efficient the market, the harder it is for active investors to outperform, despite employing the more aggressive strategy. This particular Nash Equillibrium is similar to this video:  [Simulating the Evolution of Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w&ab_channel=Primer). Therefore, ETFs are dominant because they align with the market’s average and avoid the cost of failed attempts to beat it by copying the market sentiment (i.e. buying the proverbial 'haystack').

I am a consultant turned Software Sales Rep. I travel about once a month. When I travel for 1-2 days - One Bagging with my Synik 30 works, but if I travel more than 1-2 days I like to bring my small carry-on roller. I usually fly with dress shoes in my bag and wear Tennis Shoes. That setup doesn't quite work with a one-bagger situation...

I loved my Synik 30 and the loved Tom Bihn line when I first got it. My ""Travel Tray"" is the coolest thing I ever bought and I refuse to travel anywhere without it (It carries my phone charger, then when I get home from the hotel its my catch all for my wallet, hotel key, car keys, etc). Now I find myself wanting something that is more of a carry-on that isn't for my one-bag situation. I also want something that looks more professional and less like a balloon. This could be my take my laptop to a coffee shop bag or it may be the bag that compliments my roller luggage and goes underneath the seat with me on an airplane. 

Here is what I'm looking for:

* Something that will hold the following:
   * 1 day worth of clothes (I always carry one day of clothes in a packing cube. Like the idea of this bag still working as an overnight bag. This could also hold a jacket or an extra layer of clothes.)
   * Toiletry Bag
   * Sunglasses
   * Airpods
   * iPad
   * Notepad
   * 13in Laptop
   * Bose Headphones
   * Tom Bihn Travel Tray
   * Tom Bihn First Aid
   * Some other Tom Bihn Pouches
   * Anker Battery
* Professional Looking
   * Love Black Ember Forge, Tumi, B&S, etc look. I am going to meet with CIOs, CEOs, etc. I can no longer be the nerdy computer guy bringing out my
* Not overly bulky looking
   * Synik when I onebag looks huge
* Organization
   * I don't want a black hole of a bag. I like to find what I'm looking for quickly. One of the things I love about my Synik is how organized I am

I'm the type of guy that likes to be prepared, so no matter where I go I want to have a few extra cables, my first aid kit, etc. Some of these smaller bags lack organization or just don't seem big enough to hold a day of clothes. Some feel like a black hole and are too big for what I'm looking for (and I already have the Synik). If the Synik was more professional looking I would be tempted to use it as my EDC/CarryOn, but it just doesn't fit the aesthetic.

1hxw85d,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1hxw85d/did_i_cross_the_line_with_my_former_fling/,Did I cross the line with my former fling?,"I wrote about this previously, so please excuse if you’ve read it before. I just wanted to add new details because I’m just wondering if I did something wrong.

After 3 months apart, We reconnected over the holidays. Sending each other funny memes and videos.  
He started making jokes, that felt like he was testing the waters. Like asking if I ate my grapes for the new year. Which is a superstition to find love. When I mentioned choking on grapes, he said “you’re not a choker.”
Making a joke about me not being brave enough to watch a horror movie and saying since I briefly watched part of it , “ I only stuck the tip in”. I even responded saying, the movie wasn’t big enough and he said that was a great come back. 
We didn’t linger on those conversations for too long. He later said I could borrow a book from him that he thought I’d love to read. I did it previously and the encounter was very brief and cordial. I figured it would be the same. 

When I went over to his place, he invited me in (which he hadn’t done before), gave me a hug, and showed me a new tattoo. We were sitting on the couch, and his dog was nearby, shedding hair that kept landing on my legs. He kept brushing it off, and it felt like an excuse to touch me, though it was subtle. I wasn’t sure if he was trying to initiate something or just being casual.

Eventually, I leaned in for a hug, and we ended up kissing, which led to us being intimate. He came almost immediately . Like 2 minutes max just from oral sex. Afterward, he wasn’t very affectionate. Instead, we just talked like nothing had happened.

He told me how proud he was of where we both were mentally and said it felt good to reconnect. 
He wasn’t being an asshole, just like someone who wasn’t sure what to do. 
He also said he liked that we could be friends again and mentioned that we shouldn’t do anything sexual in the future because he doesn’t want to push me back emotionally. He framed the situation as “we’re human, and we were craving intimacy.” He said it was great and felt amazing, but emotionally it might not be right to do. He even said “I think one day we can get to a place where we can talk and give advice to each other about our dating lives.” Then he backtracked saying most likely not, but since we began as friends that’s helping us remain friends now. 

At one point, though, I wasn’t satisfied with how things ended (physically), and I brought it up. Despite agreeing and  saying we shouldn’t do anything again, I leaned in for another kiss and asked if we could have sex one last time. He hesitated, saying it wasn’t a good idea and that every time we’ve been intimate in the past, it’s led to me feeling confused or hurt. But after I kissed him again, he gave in, and it happened.

Later, he reiterated that we shouldn’t do it again and emphasized that he’s not the kind of guy who takes advantage of women. He said I showed up looking so good, it was hard to resist. He even said he hasn’t been with anyone else sexually  since me and suggested we could build a strong friendship. He said he hasn’t been on dates and doesn’t have dating  money at the moment and he’s focused on work now. However, he gambles every week on sports and is planning a major birthday party for himself next month. 

When we tried dating in the past, he often brought up how he didn’t like having expectations placed on him. He mentioned that relationships scared him because he felt pressured to be perfect, and it seemed like he didn’t want to be held accountable. I remember him saying he doesn’t like hurting other people or when people are mad at him, which felt like something he struggles to process or deal with when it happens.

I was drunk a few days after our intimacy and made a joke after he asked what I wanted to do for my birthday. I replied saying “you”. He said it was inappropriate and we shouldn’t cross boundaries even with jokes moving forward. I asked what boundaries did he have. He said we didn’t have to do this, not making sex jokes should be clear as day and that we shouldn’t have had sex at all in the first place. I told him he made a similar  joke previously, but he said that was different. Making a joke about
Sex vs a joke about sex with each  other crosses the line and he needs time to feel comfortable around me again, bevause I might make thinhs serious and he has no space for overly complication situations. I apologized for the joke and we agreed to not talk about sex again. I asked if we could maybe just meet up for coffee in the future and he made a comment saying how he didn’t want to be social this month  , so I just didn’t respond after that.  He still checks my Instagram stories frequently, sometimes the first to view it and sometimes comments on them. I guess I don’t understand his deal at all 

Now I’m stuck wondering if I Was I given mixed signals leading up to what happened or did I misunderstood and Crossed a line ? While it may not be intentional, it’s like I feel like he’s blaming me for everything

I’m not sure if this is a good place to post this, I posted something similar in travel partners as well but it seems a bit dead there. 

I’m a Canadian girl looking for someone or people to travel with. Basically, I’ll be heading to Australia (Perth) around the 11th or 13th of March to attend a wedding. I will leave Perth on March 25th or so and head to Sydney. At this point I have no solid plan but I do have some ideas of things I want to do and would love to either meet up with someone who might want to show me around / travel with me or maybe you’re not even from Australia but might want someone to go to Australia with or meet there to have someone to explore with.


A bit about me:
- 33F from Toronto, Canada
- petite, brunette, active / slim
- some of my interests are music, dogs / animals, fitness, yoga, matcha, coffee, art, fashion
- I’m friendly, easy to talk to, get along well with most people 
- I don’t smoke or do drugs, would appreciate the same


If any of this sounds interesting to you then I’d love to hear from you.


Just to add, I’m not looking for hookups. I am single and straight, so I wouldn’t rule out anything, but that’s not my main goal here and would hope that there are no expectations. I’d just really like to find someone (or people) to spend some days travelling with while in Australia. I did consider maybe NZ as well, but I also don’t want to go alone, so that could be an option still. ",1,1736482696.0,R4R30Plus,2,1.0,False
1hxw5ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliexpress/comments/1hxw5ou/right_product_and_address_totally_wrong_name/,Right product and address totally wrong name,"First time ordering off AliExpress. 

The order was one item (a coffee grinder) and the shipper never updated the shipping information (tracking number or delivery date). A few days after placing the order my order was updated and said “part of your order has shipped” which was strange because it was only one item. Then a few more days later, a random package not at all the right size came with a name we’ve never heard of (been at our house for 5 years and never once received any mail to this name so pretty odd). No information on where it came from so we assumed it was Amazon and reported an incorrect delivery on their website and was told to just keep the item but hadn’t opened it yet. 

Then a few days later another item to the same person arrived and this package was more the size we expected but again my order had still not been updated with any tracking information and being that it was less than a week from ordering and less than the original anticipated delivery date (the one given at check out) I didn’t think it was my item. However since we were told the items did not need to be returned we opened it and lo and behold it was my item. We then opened the first package as well and it was a very closely related item (a coffee scale) and appeared to be sent by the same seller. 

My theory is the seller happened to get two very similar orders but somehow the names got mixed up and the addresses too. 

Pretty strange over all honestly. Thought others would like to know something like this. ",2,1736482631.0,Aliexpress,3,1.0,False
1hxw4p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1hxw4p8/feedback_on_slowerpaced_10day_itinerary_with_an/,Feedback on slower-paced 10-day itinerary with an 8-yr-old: only Monteverde and Manuel Antonio?,"Thanks to any who take the time to read! I'm hoping the r/costaricatravel community can help me think through our plan for a trip starting late Feb and going into early March.

Background: this will be the first time to CR for myself and our 9-yr-old daughter who loves wildlife, exploring the beach, and feeling adventuresome. This will be my wife's second time (she's been to La Fortuna, Monteverde (her fav), and Corcovado Natl Park).

We already know from family travel experience that we prefer to have more than just 2 or 3 days in a place, and so we want to avoid a fast-paced trip with multiple destinations. We'd also really like to avoid renting a car (hence us choosing very ""obvious"" destinations, where we hope we can rely on walking and busses).

We've pinned down good accoms (cabin on small family farm just outside Santa Elena in MV; then a little hotel with a pool just outside MA park gates) that we'll enjoy spending downtime in, and so we also want to try not to bloat our spending with too many tourist experiences.

Goals:

* multiple short and easy-to-access hikes, soaking in and exploring amazing landscapes without being rushed
* do a a treetop canopy tour (though not yet sure about ziplines specifically)
* learn about local agriculture, take a coffee tour
* hopefully lots of wildlife spotting (daughter is crazy about monkeys, sloths, and reptiles)
* walks along the beach, sand-castle building, etc..

Here's our outline so far:

* Day 0: land in Liberia 3pm in afternoon, transfer immed to Monteverde
* Day 1 - 5: Monteverde & Santa Elena
* Day 6: transfer from Monteverde to Manuel Antonio
* Day 7 - 10: Manuel Antonio & Quepos
* Day 11: wake up early, book shuttle to dash and catch 3:30pm return flight from Liberia

Main questions:

* removing the internal travel day, we'll have 9 full days; should either Monteverde or Manuel Antonio get a 5th day?
* am I justified in feeling a little FOMO about this slower plan, or will we be rewarded for keeping it low-key?
* any recommendations of low-key, accessible, and affordable activities that can dot our itinerary without dominating it?
* any different spots in CR we should be considering instead?

Thanks so much! Hope to be able to pay it forward by posting a trip report! (Seems that most posts have shorter stays in each spot.)",2,1736482534.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
