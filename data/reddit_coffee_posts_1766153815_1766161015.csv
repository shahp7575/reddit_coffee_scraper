1pqouq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1pqouq7/the_concept_of_casual_is_so_confusing_to_me_so/,The concept of casual is so confusing to me. So much nuance for one word.,"TL;DR, I’ve (NB 40) been trying to approach more casual situations for the first time and am realizing it’s normal for some folks to jump right into penetrative sex in the first like… half hour of hooking up. Is this normal for you? No shade or judgment, but I’m realizing this tends to be really overwhelming and overstimulating for me, even if I’m initially aroused and up for it. 

Anyway… I think this is mostly just me processing and venting in my journal and thinking… huh I guess I’m curious what Reddit thinks. 

Longer version- Sorry in advance, I’m socially awkward, neurodivergent, and often struggle with assuming I’m expected to behave a certain way… i get that consent is a huge thing in any sexual situation and half of learning is through trying stuff and realizing some things work and others don’t. 

I’ve been married and dating on the apps for quite a few years, but typically dating has looked like more courtship ritual…. Grab coffee, gradually escalate to higher effort dates, and hook up within 3-5 dates. I tend to date people who don’t make the first move, and I usually like to initiate and escalate after building a bit of anticipation.  

Where I’m finding I’ve had to course correct is on being what people have called “emotionally slutty” where I tend to rush in on doing wifey shit for people and make myself a bit too available in retrospect. Sleepovers, emotional labor, etc. This had led to a bit of limerence on either side at times, and some awkward breakups. (Though I guess breakups are just inherently awkward)  

OTOH I personally I have historically liked the slow roll for a couple of reasons- 

One is that my traumatized nervous system can tend to fall into freezing and fawning, and I’ll realize moments/hours later that sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach… I’m finding that it can be super helpful for me to have time to process certain things. I didn’t like what that person said, or that didn’t feel great in the moment. It can be really helpful to just make out and then take 24 hours to sit with and process how it felt. Through a *LOT* of work, I’ve been able to really connect with my body more and understand those feelings as they’re happening immediately, but I’m still prone to moments that feel less manageable. 

Two is that sexually I just tend to lean really hard on the sensual side. I’m finding attunement, coherence, and clarity are really important to me. I find this all takes time to build in rapport, and I find one of my biggest enemies in the bedroom with the way my brain works is distraction. I find too much ambiguity (especially with someone who’s basically a stranger) very distracting. I hate it when (especially kink) dynamics feel performative, and there’s often this very clear line for me between “OK we’re following a clear sensation and this is hot/exciting” vs “ugh we’re just mashing bits together and this is kinda meh, can we reset?” 

I’m also generally quite comfortable with my sexuality. With my more compatible partners we’d match a frequency of multiple times a day with pretty extended time-blind sessions. I don’t find myself squeamish or prudish about much of anything, be it kink or otherwise… I tend to find myself very well immersed when I am connected with someone in a place of play and safety. 

There is also a common pattern worth noting of using sex as a coping strategy for regulating a chronically dysregulated nervous system, bordering on hypersexuality… I’ve noted this can be especially intense when I meet someone who’s similar. I think in some sense I’ve hoped that I could find someone to connect with in this way while slow rolling the romantic stuff and I build up trust, as I find it takes 3-6 mos for those aspects to really develop and trust to build. 

One thing I’m finding is if I rush past the anticipation and build-up, I can very easily look up and find that the smells, sounds, sights out of context of the person I’m with…. Are just too much and suddenly I’m not feeling it. Like intensely so. Like what the hell am I doing here. 

Words like Demisexual confuse the hell out of me. As a penis having person, both responsive and spontaneous arousal are pretty common and easy for me, but I’m finding my standards for rapport and attunement are really high for sustaining interest and navigating play.  My spouse is very much in the responsive arousal camp, and very firmly identifies as Demi. She hates dating apps because she has no way of determining interest in someone from a picture and some words. It seems… a lot more cut and dry for her? 

Anyway, words are hard, and I often hate the reduction of concepts like Casual, FWB, Romantic, because I find them incongruent to each individual dynamic I find myself in. 

I’m starting to wonder if dating  apps are just… completely fucked. They often serve to just make me feel like I’m unattractive and unwanted, and starting a relationship out with what feels like a job interview gives some instant gratification, but often feels like mating in captivity with these weird expectations and circumstances attached. I watch my other friends navigate them with a relative sense of ease, but… I’m also realizing they put themselves in situations that would probably not really work for me. 

I’m starting to opt a lot more for mutual aid groups and community events that I try to contribute more to and show up with consistency in. I’m realizing that maybe where I find more casual, self-contained experiences where I can build that rapport is through making friends with the opportunity to escalate over time if there’s a vibe.

1pqooxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1pqooxw/spent_years_fighting_insomnia_here_is_the/,"Spent years fighting insomnia. Here is the protocol that finally fixed my circadian rhythm (No meds, ZERO pills).","I’m sure you’re sick of reading long stories, so I’ll try to keep this short.

My insomnia wasn't just ""trouble sleeping."" It was a loop. I’d wake up late (like 11 AM), feel guilty, chug coffee to catch up, crash in the afternoon, and then stare at the ceiling until 3 AM.

Standard advice says: ""Just force yourself to wake up at 7 AM.""

That never worked. I’d do it for two days, crash, and bounce back even harder.

I finally fixed it by coming across the T-min protocol in a Huberman Lab podcast. No melatonin (though it can help), no pills. Just timing.

Here is the exact logic I used to break the loop:

# 1. The ""Compass"" Rule (Stopping the Guilt)

**The Mistake: Waking up at 11 AM but trying to run your day like it's 7 AM.**

The Protocol: I started anchoring my biological day to my Actual Wake Time.

If I wake up at 11 AM, that is my morning.

* **Light:** Immediate view (cortisol spike).
* **Caffeine:** Delayed 90 minutes (12:30 PM).
* **Why:** If you drink coffee immediately, you block adenosine clearance and guarantee a crash later. If you eat lunch immediately, you confuse your liver clocks.

# 2. The ""30-Minute Speed Limit""

The Mistake: Trying to jump from an 11 AM wake-up to 7 AM. That is biologically violent—it's essentially 4 hours of jet lag.

The Protocol: I implemented a Max Shift rule.

I only move my target wake time by 30 minutes a day.

* Day 1: 11:00 AM
* Day 2: 10:30 AM
* Day 3: 10:00 AM

It feels slow, but it actually sticks because you don't trigger a sleep-deprivation crash.

# 3. The ""Metabolic Traffic Light""

The Mistake: Eating heavy carbs or snacks late at night. This tells your body ""it is daytime"" even if it's midnight.

The Protocol: I use a simple zone system based on my wake time:

* **Green Zone (Wake to +8h):** Complex carbs allowed.
* **Yellow Zone (Until 3h before bed):** Protein & Fats only. (No insulin spikes).
* **Red Zone (3h before bed):** Fasting.

This single change did more for my sleep quality than magnesium ever did.

# 4. Respecting the ""Nadir Dip/NSDR""

The Mistake: Fighting the afternoon slump with espresso.

The Protocol: Your body naturally crashes \~6 hours after waking. Instead of caffeine, I schedule a 20-minute NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) or strict downtime during this window. It clears the mental fog without wrecking tonight's sleep.

# 

The only issue was that tracking these windows manually became insanely tedious. Being a software engineer, I decided to automate this heuristic for myself.

I wanted to share the tool with the community here to help others. It is completely free to use, requires no email or signup, and will be free forever (I do have plans to make a mobile app if enough people want it, but the web tool stays free forever). You just punch in when you woke up, and it gives you the protocol for the day and the safe target for tomorrow.

I cannot share the direct link due to sub rules but you can dm me for the link to the tool. Or you can type **sleep-recoveryDOTvercelDOTapp** \[replace DOT with actual dot (.) \].

1pqon6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pqon6i/our_daughter_was_born_laughing/,Our daughter was born laughing.,"My daughter Mara wasn't born crying. 

She was born laughing.

While we were trying to sleep, she woke us up. 

My husband refused to help, turning away in bed and burying his face in the pillows. 

“You sort it,” he grumbled. 

To Milo, Mara, our beautiful daughter, was just an *it*. 

I leaned over her cradle and lifted her into my arms. “You know,” I murmured to her, “laughing is very cute, but you’re keeping your momma awake.”

In response, Mara laughed again. Louder. 

“Kana.” Milo shouted. “Just fucking *leave* it!”

When I climbed into bed, I could hear Milo’s muffled sobs. 

The next morning, he was standing in front of the coffee machine, staring at the wall. 

He didn't drink the coffee. He dumped it down the sink.

Then refilled another cup.

Mara was giggling while I was trying to feed her breakfast. 

“Say ahhh!” I said, but Mara just laughed.

“I can't fucking take it anymore.” Milo whispered behind me.

He lurched forward, snatching Mara from my arms.

My hands felt empty, suddenly, words tangling on my tongue. 

*No*. 

I froze, my lips parted in a scream as my husband ripped our daughter’s head from her torso, and I screamed as blood ran thick down his arms and pooled on the floor. Milo didn't stop. He ripped off her legs, then her arms. “I can't fucking *take* it anymore!” Milo cried, and I dropped to my knees cradling little Mara’s torso. 

Milo followed me, his eyes red raw. “Listen to me,” he whispered. 

When I screamed at him, babbling, vomit filled my throat. 

He yanked me back down with him. “Fucking LISTEN to me!” 

He killed our daughter. 

He *murdered* our child!

“It's not real!” He dangled *white stuffing* in front of me, and for the first time, color bled across my vision. I blinked. 

There was no blood. 

“Kana, look at me. I'm not your husband, we are not fucking married, we’re seventeen! The stupid doll was laughing because the batteries needed *changing*!” He gripped my shoulders. 

“I'm Milo Reyes! I sit behind you in English!” 

He pulled me to my feet, dragging me to the door. “None of this is real,” he whispered, choking on a sob. “Outside there is a government compound. We’re stuck here! Our whole damn class!”

“Mr. Reyes.” A voice crackled from above. 

The voice was familiar. 

“Please exit Forever Home 15 and collect your new child to restart the simulation. Failure to comply with the Family First Law will result in you and your wife's execution.""

Milo turned to me. “Stay here.""

I stayed frozen, while he left, slamming the door behind him.

Milo came back with another doll nestled in his arms. But his eyes were distant. 

Empty. 

He cradled the doll, smiling wide. “Isn't she *beautiful*?” He whispered. 

Behind him, a tiny red light on the door blinked at me. 

Milo laughed, booping the doll on the nose, rocking her against his chest.

1pqomg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1pqomg4/what_role_does_caffeine_play_in_anxiety_and_sleep/,What role does caffeine play in anxiety and sleep issues?,"Caffeine can quietly make both anxiety and sleep worse, especially if you’re already a bit stressed or sensitive. It works by blocking a natural “sleepy” chemical in the brain and boosting stress chemicals like adrenaline, which is why you feel more awake and focused, but that same effect can turn into jitters, a racing heart, restlessness, and overthinking that feel a lot like anxiety. For some people, high caffeine intake or sudden extra cups can even trigger powerful anxious or panic‑like feelings, especially if they already live with an anxiety disorder.

Caffeine also hangs around in your body for hours, so an evening coffee, strong tea, energy drink, or even too much cola can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. It can increase the time it takes to drift off, cause more waking up in the night, and reduce deep, good‑quality sleep, which leaves you feeling tired and edgy the next day and that tiredness can then fuel even more anxiety. If you notice this pattern, it often helps to cut down on total caffeine, avoid it after late afternoon, and swap some drinks for decaf or herbal options. Many people find that their sleep and anxiety improve within a few days of reducing caffeine.",1,1766159795.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1pqolds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/1pqolds/weekly_rotten_restaurant_report_1219/,Weekly Rotten Restaurant Report (12/19),"Sorry guys THE REPORT IS GONE... all my stuff BLEW AWAY yesterday in the wind!

HAH, JUST KIDDING! Seriously though -- with that wind storm I'm impressed we are still here. You guys are still A-OK, right?!

It's been a busy week so I don't have much of an update, but this time I tweaked one part of the report to make it slightly better. This time I added a `Type` column to each table to help categorize each establishment. With this change, I am now able to remove the `Business-Type Legend` at the bottom of the previous report that had the strange/ambiguous monikers in the names of businesses too (e.g. ""mod"", ""f"", ""e"", etc). Less is more!

I have more improvements planned in my TODO list coming up when I find time, but if you have ideas/thoughts on improvements, send them this way.

Enjoy the Christmas holiday next week (if that's what you do). Regardless, it's a great time for fun, family and friends! We just need snow! 😁

These are all the places that scored worse than 85. Similar to the previous Rotten Restaurant Report format, I don’t include scores between 85 and 99 since these are typically just minor misses in an inspection and likely not worth worrying about.

1pqokq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pqokq5/thoughts_on_young_men_red_pill_dating_culture/,Thoughts on young men & red pill dating culture,"I think something that might help with understanding young men in red pill spaces and young men in general is that some of these guys just feel used. Regardless of whether or not that's the case in reality, I know plenty of non red pill young guys in their early 20's who have really done their best when dating, who are just absolutely burnt out. 

And there isn't really any advice for young men from non red pill spaces except ""well go get another woman"". I will say, as any young man knows, being the one to pursue and pay and plan every interaction just for a woman to go ""wow you're so wonderful, not feeling it anymore, had a great time goodbye"" is a very grinding experience. It's also infuriating to then open a social media app and see ""the bar is on the floor"" being thrown around when you just put your all into a romantic interaction. You can only get so many college rejection letters before you stop wanting to go to college. Obviously, women are well within their right to decline going forward at any time, but it definitely has some of my good friends feeling bitter about their interactions. 

I think young men feel like they're just paying for a women's ""experience"", and once that 3 or 4 date sparkle wears off - she just goes to the next guy and the cycle repeats (in their mind). Regardless of whether or not it's completely okay for a woman to do (which I stated it is so don't crucify me), it is a net losing position for young men who are doing their best to try to form long term romantic connections, because young men are the side that is expected to pay a premium for the interactions. I think a lot of young men, like women, just want to be understood and told that they finally aren't the one ""fucking up"" even though they're doing their best. 

This is also where coffee date culture comes around. You can only plan so many $100 mini golf/driving range dates until you realize that the model is unsustainable for someone who works for a living.

I work in an office with one of those sad break rooms: flickering lights, stale coffee, fridge full of containers no one claims. Nothing ever happens there.

During lunch I saw a coworker open the fridge, take out his container, look at it for a long time, and then quietly whisper, “You deserve better,” before throwing it in the trash.

I thought maybe he was joking.

Then he sat down, pulled out a fork, and ate a plain tortilla. No filling. No salad. No sauce. Just a tortilla. Folded in half like he was trying not to look directly at his own pain.

Nobody said anything. We all just… pretended this was fine.

And the weirdest part? I can’t tell if I’m sad for him or deeply impressed by the emotional commitment.

Anyway, I haven’t stopped thinking about it. Was this a cry for help? A minimalist flex? Performance art? A statement on capitalism? I don’t know.

All I know is that nothing in my life prepared me for tortilla lunch existentialism.

Are there any places that have a Stinger sub on their menu? Guud & Evul (RIP, my favorite restaurant before they closed) used to have a great one, and I know Betty’s on Virginia Street in Allentown used to have a Stinger sub but it looks like they replaced it with a combination platter of beef on weck, wings and blue cheese.

Has anyone here tried Buffalo V-Spot in City of Tonawanda? How does their pizza compare to Macy’s Place and Blaze Pizza? It’s funny Guud & Evul closes and this place pops up right down the street.

Are there any places with sandwiches in the same vein as Guud & Evul? The Big Parm especially, so good I think about it all the time. Does anyone know if Shawn is still doing their food truck? My favorite sandwiches are the Biff from Amy’s and the burger from Augie’s (formerly Mister Sizzles, I haven’t had either in awhile).

I still have to check out The Vegan Grocery Store on Oliver here in NT (I usually go to Wegmans for groceries, Alberta has a much wider selection than Niagara Falls Boulevard). I have a Yelp collection of every vegan place I could find in Niagara and Erie counties but it’s over a year old.

1pqo84t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1pqo84t/free_unsolicited_advice/,Free unsolicited advice,"With the end of the 2025 approaching, it's usually a good time to think about your performance and the important lessons, ideas, and experiences to bring to 2026.

I want to share a few of general advice, some of my own trading experience. This year I have completed 8 years trading, and my advice goes to discretionary traders.

* Never accept a stop loss without reviewing your mistake

Everybody makes mistakes, sometimes the price action is more volatile than usual, maybe something important slipped through your checklist, whatever it may be that caused a trading error, always review your trades, understand what went wrong, summarize your day, and take a lesson with you.

More often than not, by reviewing every single trade, you'll gain more insight into your own psychology and behavior, than just calling yourself an idiot for the mistake and pitting the money lost. A famous Brazilian trader always says: ""You must always get something from the market, either money or a lesson.""

* Always prepare your trading day (or week if you swing trade) and only trade according to your plan

My best trades are always those which I have identified before the trading session. Specially if you are a daytrader, it can be very hard to watch the price action move up and down without pulling the trigger on any trade. You watch the market and ""see"" trades unfolding, but you can't take it because it's not part of your plan. It only hurts if you are cultivating the thought that you must get rich faster. So cull this feeling from yourself.

It's important to remember that being a day trader does not mean being a daily trader. It's ok and desirable not to trade every single day, only take risk when you know probability is in your favor, build your account and your confidence through rigorous selection. The old saying has been around for a long time: ""bulls make money, bears make money, hogs get slaughtered. Don't be a hog.""

* Clean your workstation and your charts periodically

Markets are constantly changing and we must be flexible, so sometimes it's important to reset our view of the markets. Doesn't mean to radically change our opinion, but to get a second one. 

Re-do the work, restart your bias, and if it leads you to the same place as before, you only benefit from reinforcing the path. More often than not, I see something different or a detail that sharpens my opinion.

Cleaning my workstation from all the coffee mug stains, loose paper, dust, books and notebooks stacked. By the time I'm done, I'm already feeling a greater desire to work for hours. Clean up your desk.

If you trade from your phone, I'm sorry for you, get a computer as soon as possible, but if you insist on trading from your phone, then set up a corner in your house exclusive to trading. That's your ""trading corner"" and never do any trading outside that corner.

* Don't worry about other people's money

This one is more outward than inward, but I couldn't help notice this month an increase of ads directed towards selling courses and other services on another social media platform.

The 'hook' is always the same: big money, fancy cars, expensive trips, etc. And the trading done is always some ludicrous result like an entry at the very beginning of a reversal with open profits of a large swing of several times presumable initial risk.

Those people are like goblins just trying to depart you from your money. They prey on greed and envy. 

Making a living off trading is not a matter of squeezing all the points of a move. It's about being very good at trading your own model with confidence, so that you can trade very very heavy size on it without compromising your performance.

Occasionally you'll catch a big move like those displayed on those ads, but, needless to say, those are rare and won't make for your success as a trader on their own.

  
That's it. I didn't want to just repeat some advice that was probably given a million times before me, but the truth to the matter is that there isn't much of anything that is really groundbreaking. Be organized, prepared, put in the work, and focus on your lot.

*By Paul M. Banks, The Sports Bank’s Chief Punter of Puns*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: Arsenal’s “Toaster Defense” vs. Palace’s “Goal-Scoring Toaster”**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The odds for this EFL Cup quarterfinal scream “Arsenal is the favorite, and Crystal Palace is here for the vibes.” At FanDuel, Arsenal is a 1.57 favorite (64% implied probability), Crystal Palace is a 5.4 underdog (18.5%), and the draw sits at 4.0 (25%). For context, if Palace’s defense were a toaster, it’d be the one that sparks and sets the kitchen on fire every time it’s plugged in. Arsenal’s offense? A commercial-grade bread machine cranking out baguettes of brilliance.

The over/under 2.5 goals line is 1.88 for over and 1.85 for under. Given Arsenal’s league-leading 24 goals this season and Palace’s porous 22 goals conceded, the “over” feels like a freebie. It’s not a prediction—it’s a *mathematical certainty* that someone will miss a header and accidentally score a hat trick.

---

**2. Digest the News: Palace’s “Iceman Cometh” and Arsenal’s “Iceman… Still Cometh?”**  
Crystal Palace’s recent news is about as exciting as a spreadsheet. Their star striker, Eberechi Eze, is “recovering from a minor hamstring injury sustained during a heated argument with his fridge.” Meanwhile, Arsenal’s Martin Ødegaard is “resting after a viral social media post about needing more coffee.”

But here’s the kicker: Palace’s manager, Roy Hodgson, has vowed to “play for the underdog” by fielding a lineup that includes a 42-year-old mascot and a player named “Eberechi Eze” (who might or might not be the same guy). Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta, on the other hand, has promis

It's a quiet area and not very popular or busy, but somehow it's always full of pretty posh people or at least very comfortable financially people.  I always wondered why that is?  
It is definitely a nice and chill coffee place, but the location is pretty far off from everything, and as far as I hear, the Histon Arbury area is not a ""cool"" place to go hangout at (I'm not originally from Cambridge, so this is just what I hear.

I am currently on the hunt for my new machine and grinder to replace my Breville Express.

For the grinder I am currently looking at the WPM ZP-1, though I would accept recommendations on that. I am currently lost on what I should get for a machine.

My use case:

Every morning that I am home I make a shot for my wife to do a shaken espresso and I make a cappuccino for myself. Then, around lunch or thereafter I make a shot for myself.

I have been using my Breville in a manual context since I purchased it. I do not use any of the automated features.

I am ready to upgrade to a more prosumer machine that I can get better consistency from, as well as reduce the time it takes to make my morning coffees. If I could steam and brew at the same time I would be overjoyed. It takes forever to make a cappuccino on the Breville. I enjoy getting fresh beans, dialing in, and the overall process so no machine scares me.

120v U.S. power

I had been looking at Rocket, Diletta, Lelit, Profitec…

I wouldn’t mind being under $2500 with PID which puts me in heat exchanger territory. I’m not even sure if 120v can support dual boiler. I would consider having 220v installed if it was necessary but I would like not to.

Machine recommendations?

Heat exchange or Dual boiler?

Do I need 220v?

Holy fucking moly, did this coffee blow me away. I am an iced coffee guy, here’s my recipe: 

I did 30 grams of coffee, 205 degrees. 50g bloom for 45 seconds, then an additional 150g water, then steep for 2 minutes 15 seconds, slow press, pour over a cup full of ice. 

This shit tastes like pineapple and peach juice. My brain is broken. If you dig fruity cups, give this a try!",6,1766158257.0,AeroPress,0,0.88,False

**Dark Fondue Cookie**: Fondue can be even chocolate, cheese or meat, but looking at the color and the format of her hair, i can say its the chocolate fondue, and i LOVE chocolate

**Croissant Cookie:** I havent eaten croissants in a long time but they still would taste very good

**Baguette Cookie:** Baguettes are bread and im a sucker for bread

**Maple Taffy Cookie:** According to my researchs, Maple taffy is just boiled, softball Maple Syrup Candy, so ig it would taste great!

**String Gummy Cookie:** Candy = Yummy

**Marble Bread Cookie:** i ate marble bread sometimes and despite not being bad, i thought it was pretty dry

**Coffee Candy Cookie:** idk im not really a fan of caffeine sweets but they could still taste good

**Schneeball Cookie:** i never ate an schneeball so idk how it would taste like 🥀💔

**Timekeeper Cookie:** Althought we dont know TK's Flavour id say its either, **Polished wood furniture or Moldy Croissants**",2,1766158209.0,TimeBalanceDepartment,13,0.75,False

I love how excuse me has two meanings. If I'm pulling a boat down an aisle where three people are standing in the middle having a coffee clatch, and I say ""excuse me"" it is \*completely optional\* for them to move or continue the conversation. I stood for ten minutes yesterday trying to get to my section. One day, a group walking four abreast actually made me back the whole way out of the aisle, rather than forming a single line for a few feet.

  
On the other hand, when I'm stocking my section (soda vendor merchandiser) and someone comes and says it to me, it \*actually\* means, ""get the fuck out of my way right now!""

I’m a 26-year-old South Asian guy living downtown by the Harbourfront. I work in finance and I’m genuinely looking to meet someone, get to know each other naturally, and hopefully let it grow into something meaningful if we click.

A bit about me:

•	Big soccer fan — Barcelona has my heart

•	Also into hockey (yes, I suffer with the MapleLeafs 😅)

•	Love checking out new coffee spots around the city

•	Work out regularly and try to stay active

•	Enjoy traveling, gaming, and hanging out with friends

•	Huge animal lover — cats and dogs

I’d describe myself as easygoing, thoughtful, and someone who values real conversation and mutual effort. Not here for anything rushed or casual-only — just looking for a genuine connection with the right person.

If this resonates with you and you’re also looking for something real, feel free to message me and tell me a bit about yourself 🙂",1,1766158169.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

You can search for any place you want to travel! You may see empty reviews but if you signup you get access to most authentic precautions and scams

But as the title said, I glued together the panel for the table top and was able to scrape most of the glue away before it fully dried, but there was a little residue left leaving marks. Mostly from under the cauls that I had made. I decided to try and use a cabinet scraper to scrape away most of the residue, which worked out pretty well except now instead of being completely flat there is a little bit of waviness to the table top that most people probably wouldn’t notice, but I do when I run my hand across. I’m not sure if it’s too little to use the hand plan or not and I’m kind of nervous about using that and making the situation potentially worse.

I have just about everything a young man could ask for. Christmas is basically here, and we will have over forty members of my extended family at our house. As ungrateful as it sounds, I don’t look forward to Christmas, new years, or anything after that. I don’t feel jolly. I haven’t felt genuine joy for months. 

To me, Christmas will come and go. Just like thanksgiving did. New Years will only make me depressed, because 2025 was a late and disruptive Segway into the reality of my life. Which is, hence not much. My life doesn’t feeling like I’m really living. I drive a nice car, live in a beautiful house rent free with my parents, but it’s just not enough. Part of this is me being a snob, most of it is me being stuck exactly where I have been for years. College came and went, and now I’m a washed fuck that has no genuine reason to look forward to the next “era of my life”. 

I have a few friends. They are scattered from me. I log onto Fortnite or whatever else to “hang out with them”. It just isn’t what I think reality should be. I should be going out, but as a 23 year old I don’t know how to meet new people. School is no more for me, idk what to do. I don’t feel much human connection. I felt damn near no human connection in high school, feel through the cracks and became a ghost by high school graduation. Got through covid, that last year being my first year in college. Things finally started to change for me. Even though money was a struggle, I felt connection with the college friends I made. I had a sense of community even if it was a real small one. I traveled Europe with the little money I had. The negative of college was likely the substance abuse, ever since coming from Europe I drink coffee. I now drink coffee and Diet Coke by the cart load. I had a hell of a drinking problem in the first half of the college. I the second half of college, I became a stoner. I was always scared of lung cancer, so I started with edibles. I then shortly after started smoking. Now I smoke damn near everyday, even after being back home fully. As imagined my parents can smell it and it has caused a large rift at our house. I love weed, and I want to try to keep it at bay. I pray I can enjoy without be so fucking dependent. I’m trying to go back to just gummies, not everyday.

Anyways, I see my lifestyle beyond substances at remarkable grim. As most 23 yr olds, I work an entry level job. There are a lot of flaws to this, as all entry level jobs do. My career has me worried but there are more simple issues I need corrected real quick.

My social life and the improvements that I strive for feel like a dead end, like my career does. I live in a very overpopulated area. You would think this would be a good thing. Out of the million people I am surrounded by, I never see the people I would like to be around. I go out to bars with friends, you never find the girl of your dreams like in the movies. Never happened, ever, and have gone to bars for three years in and off now. I work seven shifts in a row, so going to the gym everyday like I did at the end of college is difficult. I go to a gym with several locations, every location is packed by the time I get off work. There are plenty of people that could be a “gym buddy” there, but I work a front facing job so I get tired to people by 7pm… it’s difficult to go at all when you can barely find a spot in the lot and get a half decent workout. My gains are dwindling with the little energy I have left.

I feel like a slob and a failure. I have shitty money management, I’m saving more and more but I have to do much better over the next months. I haven’t made much self improvement, even if I went to a bar full of my crushes, I don’t look or feel good enough to be with any of them. Like the cliche I am, I feel like my own worse enemy, feel like nothing is changing in my life and I continue to waste away my “healthy, good years”. Without a girlfriend, friends near me, and a good career, I feel like there is nothing to look forward to. I like living, I’m not suicidal and DONT WANT TO DIE. But I don’t think I’m truly living.

1pqnrmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pqnrmi/considering_the_meraki_espresso_machine_1500/,"Considering the Meraki Espresso Machine [~$1,500]","I’ve read through probably hundreds of posts and watched handfuls of YouTube videos, and the positives all seem to outweigh the negatives for someone (I know I’ll get downvoted for saying this) looking for a workflow-centric machine that makes decent espresso (especially medium/dark roast), and can make quick, simultaneous work of americanos and lattes. While I eventually plan to upgrade to something like the Lucca A53 or another machine without an integrated grinder and finer customization options, that’s a decade or more away. Between a wife in the medical field, kids running around the house, and not enough time to scramble an egg most mornings, I need to prioritize convenience, and hopefully, consistency. Essentially, a machine that’s good enough at everything, but master of none.

I’ve narrowed down my options to either the Meraki or Breville Oracle Jet, but research has me leaning toward the Meraki.

My main questions for those who own the machine: outside of the water tank and bean grinder, are there any other major plastic parts that come in direct contact with the coffee, or is the plastic primarily used as encasements and shell parts?

I haven’t found much feedback mentioning cleaning/descaling, and what I have found seems like there are pretty strong opinions on both sides (same with their customer service). What has your experience been?

Open to all opinions and ideas, even if it’s that both options I’m considering are terrible and I’ve disgraced r/espresso by posting here.

I'm actually going out tonight for drinks with a couple of guys from church. But I was very plugged in at my church. I was at youth group on Wednesday nights helping out and leading small group for the middle school boys. I also was a discussion leader for a mens group that met once a month. I was also on several committees. I met with my pastor and the youth pastor to tell them that I couldn't serve in any capacity anymore because I didn't believe anymore. I wasn't met with any condemnation but encouraged to keep searching and not give up on it blah blah blah. I was even encouraged to go to seminary after explaining my biggest hangups. I didn't bother explaining that searching for truth was exactly what led me to apostatize; I knew it was a fruitless endeavor.  I'd consider my pastor more of a friend than pastor. I've known him over a decade and he married me and my wife. I even went to the choir Christmas presentation this past Sunday night and enjoyed the music and myself. Had cookies and coffee in the gym afterwards. For context, im located in the metro Atlanta area, so my church is relatively large and diverse to an extent. It does a lot of things well when it comes to community and making it feel like a nice place to be. Anyways, I feel like a big chunk of my life is now missing. Not because of faith but because of all the roles in the church that I occupied and the familiar faces.

No snarking before coffee 😉. We have all came too far to give up now. Let's go y'all 💪💪💪. Apologies included in post.,"

EDITED POST , well deleted, edited, and reposted ..

 Moving forward I will focus on the court of public opinion as a form of justice for her. Thank you to the person who helped me open my mind to not focus so much on what the Justice System failed to get right , and focus on how we as the public can educate people moving forward. Also, huge thank you to the amazing Mods in here. I've only had one other issue in here over a year ago and both times , the mods were so helpful and understanding. Y'all the MVPs ! 

To all my fellow snarkers in here , I owe you an apology ,I should not have said ""I'm done w the case "" , nor should I snark before coffee. No way would I just give up after consistent research. I'm admitting I woke up crabby af, and posted before coffee. I believe in JUSTICE way more than I believe in giving up and I thank all of you in this Snark who work so hard to get the truth out ! 

 Gypster is the definition of Insanity, repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different results. As someone with a Genetic disorder myself , please believe all the medical stuff was necessary, and she had a good mother who cared. We already struggle enough to fight with hypochondriacs for medical care and this case has really done a number on how people view wheelchairs, etc. Meanwhile as I type this , I am braced up with all my braces and KTape struggling to walk. I pray God takes her ability to walk. She's the only person I wish true pain on. 

She had the easiest parole known to man, she's never been told no, and she gets rewarded for bad behavior. She thrives off attention, loves getting away with things like Murder , 🍇, and is into little kids. If she was a man, we all know this would be different. There is an autistic man sitting in prison for the rest of his life and no one proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he's guilty. He just simply took the fall for her by saying he did it, all part of the manipulation. The men who handled the case must be sick fs , the parole board thought she out of all people deserves a second chance ?! It's all just so disgusting. She's the type of woman we warn our sons about. 

There is not one good quality about her and she has yet to show any fucking remorse. She can turn tears on and off faster than anyone I know, so don't fall for her fake emotions. She aaccuses people of false 🍇 by using those fantasies and then turning on the person later. She is a psychopath who will reoffend in my opinion.  Just remember all of this when someone else gets hurt. She is the lowest of the low, one of the most dangerous people to society, and everyone around her. 

We have all worked so hard to contact parole, tried to correct every interview , tried to spread the truth , but she's a psychopath and they're charming. Out of 20 years of studying cases, this one made me lose any and all trust I have in our justice system, NOT ONE person with any legal background or higher up pull said anything to try to make sure she was never free in society. They knew how disturbed she was and said F IT, and must have enjoyed her videos and disgusting manipulation. 

Do you know how hard some people work to receive Parole ?!?!?! She wasn't even a model inmate. She has done nothing but he rewarded, prison was a breeze for her, she's made bank while the rest of the world struggles to survive, and she's never even had a JOB. She has been catered to her whole life. Real abuse victims don't behave this way. She is, was, and always will be the abuser in my opinion. 

Ask yourself, if you were brutally murdered, wouldn't you hope someone made sure Justice was served and made sure your legacy wasn't completely damaged ? All we have when we leave this world is our legacy we leave behind, and both Emma's and Dee's have been demolished because of their own family members. I keep seeing people say ""Gypsy said this,  Gypsy said that"". None of that matters because she doesn't know how to tell the truth.

1pqnnb2,https://i.redd.it/xtsoc53zf68g1.png,What’s your take on using AI agents to keep mockups consistent?,"I’ve been thinking about this recently and wanted to put it out here for discussion.

When I’m working on early branding stages, especially for small businesses, I usually need to show several mockups to explain the system. A logo on a menu, a storefront sign, some basic packaging, maybe a simple poster. Nothing final, just enough to help clients understand how things come together.

What always takes more time than expected is keeping those mockups consistent. Same logo scale, spacing, colors, typography hierarchy. It’s important work, but it’s also very mechanical, and it can easily eat up hours without adding much creative value.

Lately I’ve tried using an agent-style tool to handle that part of the process. Not to design the logo or make decisions, but simply to apply an already defined brand system across different mockups in a consistent way.

That made me pause a bit and think about where the line actually is.

On one hand, it feels like pure workflow efficiency. On the other, I can see why some people might feel uneasy about automation creeping further into the design process.

To be clear, this isn’t about generating logos from prompts or letting software decide visual direction. It’s more about execution. The logo exists, the rules exist, and the tool is just helping apply them without manually rebuilding the same structure over and over.

Personally, I’m still figuring out how I feel about it. I’d be interested to hear how others approach this in real client work and where they personally draw that boundary.

Just created a new extension which was asked in Reddit. Not sure on the subreddit though.

About extension - UTubeFilter 

This extension will help to to block shorts and Channel which annoys you. 

Also, already watched video will not appear. 

For example, you searched for javascript and watched couple of videos. But when you search for it again, the same video will be in top. For many it annoys including me. So I created a extension with check mark. 

When you check mark - block already watched, then it will block already watched content. 

Similarly for block all shorts, block particular channel long video or short video. This will give you full control of the content you see in YouTube.

So I’ve been on a mission to spend as little as possible. And last month, I managed to only spend $600 for the entire month. 

I moved to a shared apartment with three other people, and I pay around 300 a month including utilities. I don’t have much privacy, but whatever.

I walk to work every day. I used to spend closer to 200 on transportation, now I literally spend 0. 

I never eat out. If I’m hungry, I eat at home. I meal prep every weekend, and I eat simple food like canned tuna, beans, rice, chicken, eggs, etc. Eating out just isn’t something I budget for anymore.

Breakfast is almost the same every day. Lunch and dinner are usually the same thing too. It’s boring, but it keeps costs now. I also make my own coffee at home, which is now saving me at least a hundred dollars a month. 

When I hang out with friends, we don’t go to bars or restaurants. We do free stuff like hiking, picnics, long walks, hanging out at someone’s place. It’s still fun and I love it.

So far it’s been a really unique experience, not sure if I’ll continue for the long term… we’ll see.

For anyone curious, it’s either nickel or chrome plated (I’m almost entirely certain it’s nickel but did find a few places calling it chrome) and the plating has completely worn away from the cooking surface of the pan.

With nothing other than a splash of oil in a hot pan I cooked scrambled eggs. The results speak for themselves, virtually nothing stuck to the pan. 

Maybe seasoning helps your pan not get stuff stuck on it, but in my experience it’s almost entirely down to heat control and technique. 

For anyone curious about how I heat:

1. Heat on medium (4/10) for 5 minutes. I scrambled eggs, started coffee and toast. 

2. Check the pan with a drop of water. It should just be at the transition between the water sizzling in place and Leidenfrost-ing (water drop dancing around). Once you get used to this with your pan and stove you don’t really check anymore.

3. Turn pan to high, add oil and wait a few moments. Maybe 10 seconds if it’s eggs, closer to 30 for something like chicken.

4. Add food. Turn pan back to medium after waiting. Like 5-10 seconds for eggs and again, longer for something bigger.

The TLDR here is: just wash your pans, if over 120 hours of lye didn’t “ruin” this pan then I doubt a wash with dawn is going to negatively affect a pan. 

I’m going to continue cooking with this pan and only washing + drying, no intentional seasoning, no oiling after use. ",14,1766157223.0,castiron,4,0.77,False

\-Inverter/Generator setup   
\-Inflatable couch for the bigger tent setup  
\-Rugged heated gloves (be nice to chop wood in comfort during below zero trips lol

Anyways that's all that's coming to mind right now. Maybe you guys have some gear that I might have overlooked. Would love to hear your suggestions. Thanks!

It's still the best AI family resort in Mexico (I've been to most all of them).  Here are thoughts and how I book.

* Teatro del Río – Dinner with a live show.   This is worth doing - cause the show is good - but the food is pretty horrendous.  They are just serving a ton of people at once.  Better is the[ dinner at Xcaret Park and show](https://www.xcaret.com/en/attractions/xcaret-mexico-espectacular/).  The food here isnt much better - but its an even bigger experience.  And you can take the boat to the park from the main Xcaret Mexico hotel.  I don't think youd need to do both but of the two - this is the one I'd recommend.
* Xin-Gao – Asian fusion with teppanyaki, sushi bar and multiple dining “experiences.”   This is fine but the new asian....
* Tama Mon is probably a little nicer and they have a Sushi Train which looked cool.  Those reservations go fast - but then they also have teppanyaki.  Then if you cant get those you can just sit at the restaurant and walk up to a Tepenyaki type bar.  Then if you can't get that they have a Ramen bar which looked interesting.  Food was so-so but I didn't get to do the sushi train.  That looked fun.
* Las Cuevas Steakhouse – A cool, cave-style dinner setting. This is excellent but it DOES now require a reservation, they switched it.
* Monarca *(new)* – Michoacán-inspired cuisine with live entertainment.  Monarca is the best restaurant on property.  Far and away the best.  They just started needing reservations.  Live music starts at 8pm so center reservation around that.
* Costero *(new)* – Coastal Veracruz seafood and a really nice terrace vibe;  didn't go for dinner but it has a less busy Breakfast that was nice.
* Xinema (behind the water slides); group of street food trucks attached to a ""movie theater"".  It is open late and all day and has what I thought was some of the best food.   Things to get.  Tacos Al Pastor (the red kind on the left hand side) and get them with everything.   The Shrimp tacos (fish ones not as good).  The Hamburger from the hamburger cart is very good.  Pizza not good.  Marquesitas are not great from the cart there and the wait is long, instead, get them from the cart at the Gelataria beneath the phase two lobby.
* Bio.  This is always a favorite of ours for breakfast (busy) and lunch (less busy).  It is built inside a cenote and it is vegan only.  The smoothies are very, very good and best on property.
* Azul Nogada - went three times. Lots of vegetarian and non vegetarian options.  All the appetizers here are solid.  Just keep in mind its like, super authentic mexican.  So cactus tacos etc....
* Brunch Dominical (inside Cuevas, reservation only)- yes this is amazing.  No it’s not worth 700 dollars for 4 people.  And NO its not worth it as a freebee for listening to the pyramid scheme from the Destination Club (more on that later).  
* Mercado de la Merced - for whatever reason this Buffet holds strong as the best buffet and food in general - however I can only go once or twice cause of the crowds.  I do not appreciate being side tackled while trying to get guacamole
* La Xentral - the new Phase Two buffet is a MUCH calmer, more enjoyable experience but the food is nowhere near as good.  Tortas are the highlight.



Places that arent worth it:

\-Chi - really not good at all.  

\-Cantina Los Faroles - no one in my group ever likes anything here except for the deserts which are solid.  Turns into a nightclub at 11 maybe thats worth it -but otherwise avoid.

\-Ha - for 500 dollars do not do this.



A few things about the Phase Two and Phase One rooms to consider.  I would say, as a whole, the Phase two rooms are better set up than the phase one room - but that’s specific to a couple issues I had with two of the main phase one locations.  

Phase One:

* Casa Fuego  - They are doing a massive amount of construction on Casa Fuego (though when it opens again my former favorite restaurant is there) so its closed for [now.Casa](http://now.Casa) Tierra - Used to like it here but now you can hear the Fuego construction - so that’s out.  
* Casa Agua - This is fine - no complaints.
* Casa Espiral - Never stay here.  There is a nightly show and there is no sleeping.   The worst of all the Casas.
* Casa Viento - Octopus slide is here which is good for kids but it’s just too busy.  Also keep in mind the ONLY way to get from phase one to phase two for some reason is by walking past this area.  Avoid.

Phase Two

* Casa Luna - this is a quiet one for little kids with a couple AMAZING kids features that are open to all but still fantastic.  Xiquit Inn a massive, genius play area.  And Lunateca for very little kids wich would cost a million dollars a visit if it were in the US. 
* Casa Vida - Has the water slides so a little busy.  But lots of water features.
* Casa Sol - This is where we stayed…great location.  It has teen clubs that look fantastic and a teen rooftop bar that absolutely no one ever uses.  
* Casa Cielo - didn’t stay here but super strange how it’s basically under the phase 2  lobby.  Seemed quiet over there though.



New features I loved:

\- Phase Two waterslides are waterpark worthy.  Really excellent.

\- Xiquit Inn - I mentioned it before but this place is just genius.  It deserves a review of its own.  I think the age limit is 10 (dont say you are older or they wont let you in) but I think kids up to 11/12 would love it.  It has to be seen to be believed.

\- Lunateca - A playroom for little ones undersells how awesome this place is.  I would say good for kids up to 4 or so?

\- Bar Las Maquinitas - such a cool bar but great for kids.  Pinball, Video Games, but also retro games/electronics from Mexico in the 80’s/90’s.  Again, genius.

\- Cafeteca - not really a restaurant but a coffee shop the place really needed.  All day really good sandwiches and top tier coffee.  They are finally on par with the coffee shop at Grand Velas.

\- The new Isla/Ixla.  This seems like overkill and i love it.  This is a new island/path to run/walk on that are conencted to Phase Two.  Necessary?  No.  Genius?  Absolutely.



Booking:

Lastly I will just say, as I’ve said before, the Destination Club pitch makes no sense.  I’ve heard them out and their 40% off pitch and it’s just not logical.  Of course their prices are lower than the Xcaret website prices, those are artificially inflated SO they can provide that discount.  But if you go to other vendors you can get the same discounts by booking early.  This was my third trip using Roomongo and I paid the same price as the destination club folks for two adults and two kids.  I know this cause I asked.  I will go to Xcaret yearly and will always just book with Roomongo.   I don't work for them...I'm just sick of seeing people being fed alcohol and signing away their life savings to get the same rates I get every year.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

What tricks have you found that make AI actually think instead of just answering?

We enter Michelle’s Spooky Mansion once again. The front door creaks, and the familiar warmth of candlelight greets us. Outside the tall windows, the night is quiet—too quiet. The wind brushes the trees. Somewhere upstairs, a floorboard sighs.

Michelle steps forward, smiling, her witch hat tilted just enough to feel playful rather than threatening.

Michelle:
“Do you remember the games you played as a kid? The ones where everyone laughed, ran, and forgot the world for a while?”

She walks past a shelf of old toys—wooden blocks, a cracked porcelain doll, a faded teddy bear with one button eye.

Michelle:
“Hide and seek. Tag. Flashlight games at night. Simple fun, right?”

She lowers her voice.

Michelle:
“But some games… should never be played without rules. Or warnings.”

Thunder murmurs softly outside.

Michelle:
“Tonight’s story is about hide and seek. And about what happens when the house remembers the players… even after they’re gone.”

She pauses, eyes glinting.

Michelle:
“Let me tell you a story.”

The candles flicker. The mansion fades into darkness.

🕯️ The Story — “The Aftons’ Last Game”

🌙 A Silent House

It was a silent night in the Aftons’ house.

The living room was dark, lit only by the faint glow of a streetlamp slipping through the curtains. Four sisters sat together on the couch, as they often did.

From left to right: Jenna, the oldest—calm, observant.
Libby, restless and childlike.
Camille, barefoot, relaxed, always talking about peace and kindness.
And Marie, the quiet one, staring at the window.

Libby broke the silence.

Libby:
“Where did Mom go again?”

No one answered at first.

Marie leaned closer to the window.

Marie:
“She’s not back yet… but I saw people walk past the house earlier.”

Jenna looked up.

Jenna:
“People?”

Marie:
“Yeah. They looked at the house, then hurried away. Like they were scared.”

Camille smiled gently.

Camille:
“Fear is just energy, you know. If we stay calm, nothing bad happens.”

Libby hugged a pillow.

Libby:
“I don’t like it when it’s this quiet.”


---

📰 The Newspaper

Jenna reached down and picked up a folded newspaper from the coffee table.

Jenna:
“This came today.”

She opened it slowly. The headline was bold and chilling:

SERIAL KILLER STILL AT LARGE — ESCAPED TWO MONTHS AGO

Libby gasped.

Libby:
“That’s the one… the one who hid in people’s houses!”

Marie (softly):
“They said he killed teenagers… when they tried to hide from him.”

The room felt colder.

Camille placed a hand over Libby’s.

Camille:
“Let’s not feed fear. We’re together. That’s what matters.”

Libby tried to smile, but her voice trembled.

Libby:
“Mom’s been gone so long…”

Jenna closed the paper.

Jenna:
“Hey. Let’s do what we always did.”

Marie turned.

Marie:
“You mean…?”

Jenna:
“Hide and seek.”

Libby’s eyes lit up.

Libby:
“Like when we were little?”

Camille nodded.

Camille:
“Games bring balance.”

After a brief hesitation, Marie agreed.


---

🔢 The Game Begins

Libby volunteered to count first.

She stood facing the wall.

Libby:
“One… two… three…”

Jenna, Camille, and Marie scattered quietly.

Libby finished counting and turned around.

Libby:
“Ready or not, here I come!”

She searched the living room.

Libby:
“Found you, Marie!”

Marie laughed nervously.

Moments later—

Libby:
“Oh come on… Jenna, you’re terrible at hiding!”

And Camille, sitting far too obviously behind a curtain, laughed as well.

Camille:
“I wanted to be found.”

They all giggled. The tension faded—just a little.


---

👁️ Marie’s Turn

Now it was Marie’s turn to seek.

She stood still, eyes closed, counting softly.

But as she opened her eyes, something felt wrong.

The house seemed… deeper.

She took a step forward.

A faint laugh echoed.

Marie:
“Jenna…?”

She found Jenna easily. Then Libby.

But Camille was nowhere.

Marie:
“Camille?”

No answer.

They searched together. The bedrooms. The kitchen. The bathroom.

Then Jenna remembered.

Jenna:
“The secret room.”

Behind a loose panel in the hallway.

They opened it.

Inside sat Camille, smiling calmly—and beside her, Libby’s old teddy bear, long thought lost.

Libby:
“My bear!”

They laughed, relieved.

Then—

💥 The Bang

A loud bang shook the house.

All four froze.

Jenna:
“That came from outside.”

Jenna moved toward the door.

Libby (grabbing her arm):
“Don’t! Remember the newspaper!”

Camille raised her hands gently.

Camille:
“Breathe. Hide. Just like the game.”

Marie nodded.

Marie:
“Hide. Quietly.”

They scattered again—this time not playing.

🔨 The Intruder

The front door creaked open.

Footsteps.

A man entered.

He wore a cap and a dark jacket.
In his hand—a hammer.

He searched the living room.

The dining room.

The kitchen.

Bedrooms.

Bathroom.

Nothing.

Jenna held her breath so tightly it hurt.

The man reached the front door.

Relief washed over them.

Then another voice.

Woman (outside):
“You’re here?”

Libby (whispering):
“Mom!”

Their hearts leapt.

But the man hadn’t left.

Mom:
“Wilbur… what do you think of the house?”

Wilbur:
“It’s old. But… are you sure you want it torn down?”

Torn down?

The sisters stared at one another.

Mom (crying softly):
“I have to.”

She wiped her eyes.

Mom:
“My four daughters… Jenna, Libby, Camille, and Marie…”

The girls felt the floor vanish beneath them.

Mom:
“They loved this house. They loved hide and seek.”

Wilbur lowered his head.

Mom:
“Two months ago… we were almost home. Then a truck came out of nowhere.”

Silence.

Mom:
“They didn’t survive.”

Libby’s breath caught.

Marie (realizing):
“We… we’re…”

Jenna swallowed.

They were dead.

Mom:
“That truck driver… he was the serial killer. He escaped… and the crash stopped him.”

Wilbur gently touched her shoulder.

The sisters looked around.

They were unseen.

Unheard.

Ghosts.

That’s why people fled the house.


---

🧸 Goodbye

Wilbur promised to begin the work.

He left.

Mom walked through the house alone.

She stopped.

On the floor—Libby’s teddy bear.

She picked it up, tears falling.

Mom:
“I miss you… so much.”

She left the house.

The sisters stood together.

For the last time.

The house grew quiet.

🕯️ Back to Michelle

The mansion returns.

Michelle exhales softly.

Michelle:
“Did you enjoy that story?”

She smiles sadly.

Michelle:
“Don’t worry—it’s fictional. But the fear behind it… is very real.”

She steps closer.

Michelle:
“Across the world, there are legends about dangerous games. In Japan, Hitori Kakurenbo—One-Man Hide-and-Seek—warns of spirits entering dolls. In the West, stories like The Mistletoe Bough tell of games gone wrong… forever.”

She raises a finger playfully.

Michelle:
“So remember—games need rules. And some places… shouldn’t be played in at all.”

She grins.

Michelle:
“Thank you for visiting Michelle’s Spooky Mansion. Sleep tight—and maybe leave the lights on tonight.”

She waves.

Behind her, a soft childlike laugh echoes—then stops.

1pqnc8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalTapHorror/comments/1pqnc8t/eternal_lease/,Eternal Lease,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated.

No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again.

With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, I made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting.

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak.

I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done.

I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be.

I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.”

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made.

But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself.

The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything.

As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes.

Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.

Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will.

I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from inside the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out.

“Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?”

“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.”

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was made for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian.

However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip.

He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.”

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face.

“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.”

“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it.

“Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”

His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.

“Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done anything that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?”

The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right.

“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily.

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”

“I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.

“Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”

B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder

B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love.

I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.”

I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.”

Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.”

He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?”

It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this.

“Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.”

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes.

As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest.

B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”

I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to hear.

At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face.

“Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.”

After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.”

My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.

The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up.

I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted.

I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”

As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day.

He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?”

“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.”

“Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head.

“Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly.

As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.

I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house.

There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong.

“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear.

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately.

I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. “Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter.

My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s and a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked.

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad.

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since when do you have an iPad?”

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what we can to process our grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.”

I paused. It was April. I had literally just  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here?

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are you feeling okay?” he asked with a glare.

I was at a loss for words for a moment. “Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?”

He and my brother both stared at me, confused.

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled.

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously.

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.”

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call. The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen.

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.”

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?”

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad.

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled.

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave.

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.”

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile.

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.”

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and immediately drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal.

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red.

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome.

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset.

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one.

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.”

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.”

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually did get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?”

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised.

“A bed? Like a whole bed?”

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.”

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket.

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.”

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib.

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter.

“I- this is- how’d you even,”

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?”

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.”

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them.

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie.

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.”

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room.

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie.

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly.

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see.

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.”

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper.

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke.

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints.

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces.

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod.

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith.

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes.

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face.

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.”

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity.

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out.

I awoke in my bedroom.

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family.

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?”

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members.

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance.

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms.

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison.

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance.

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels.

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes.

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing. The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers.

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate.

Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”",1,1766156710.0,SpinalTapHorror,1,1.0,False
1pqnbr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pqnbr7/eternal_lease/,Eternal Lease,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated.

No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again.

With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, I made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting.

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak.

I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done.

I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be.

I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.”

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made.

But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself.

The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything.

As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes.

Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.

Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will.

I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from inside the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out.

“Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?”

“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.”

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was made for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian.

However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip.

He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.”

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face.

“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.”

“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it.

“Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”

His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.

“Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done anything that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?”

The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right.

“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily.

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”

“I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.

“Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”

B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder

B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love.

I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.”

I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.”

Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.”

He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?”

It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this.

“Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.”

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes.

As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest.

B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”

I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to hear.

At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face.

“Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.”

After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.”

My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.

The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up.

I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted.

I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”

As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day.

He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?”

“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.”

“Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head.

“Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly.

As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.

I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house.

There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong.

“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear.

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately.

I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. “Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter.

My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s and a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked.

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad.

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since when do you have an iPad?”

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what we can to process our grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.”

I paused. It was April. I had literally just  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here?

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are you feeling okay?” he asked with a glare.

I was at a loss for words for a moment. “Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?”

He and my brother both stared at me, confused.

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled.

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously.

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.”

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call. The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen.

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.”

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?”

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad.

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled.

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave.

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.”

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile.

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.”

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and immediately drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal.

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red.

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome.

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset.

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one.

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.”

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.”

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually did get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?”

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised.

“A bed? Like a whole bed?”

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.”

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket.

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.”

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib.

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter.

“I- this is- how’d you even,”

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?”

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.”

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them.

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie.

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.”

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room.

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie.

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly.

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see.

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.”

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper.

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke.

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints.

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces.

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod.

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith.

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes.

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face.

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.”

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity.

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out.

I awoke in my bedroom.

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family.

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?”

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members.

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance.

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms.

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison.

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance.

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels.

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes.

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing. The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers.

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate.

Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”",1,1766156675.0,story,1,1.0,False

i box 3 days a week but am going to start nearly everyday for an hour a day in january because i want to start amateur bouts, but i don't want the weight cut to be too drastic. i also do additional cardio (run 2 miles 3x/week through intervals) and lift 4x/week. 

I've been eating at maintenance for a week now (besides last night when i said fuck it because i got frustrated and it was my friend's birthday). i cannot stop thinking about food from the moment i wake up to when i go to bed, and it gets SO BAD AT NIGHT. i have discipline all day and then at night i eat most of my calories. i've tried being a little looser throughout the day and i just end up eating more.

how much of a deficit should i be at, what should i change about my workout routine, and how do you stop the food noise? i'm losing my mind trying to lose these last 10ish pounds and food is LITERALLY always on my mind. 

ive tried not cutting things out cold turkey, cutting things out cold turkey, diet sodas, water, coffee, different intermittent fasting, different spread of my meals. ",2,1766156309.0,loseit,6,0.67,False
1pqn5nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZomWorld/comments/1pqn5nh/release_notes_for_version_01140/,Release notes for version 0.1.14.0,"# New features

1. Add mouse wheel sensitivity option
2. Sleepiness revamp - see individual notes in the adjustments section
3. Reorganise character UI into senses (subjective perception) and body (objective values)
4. You get messages about dreams you have, when your skill level increases, when you drop a knife while stabbing, etc.
5. Rebuild stimulation as stress, based on two different stress hormones (cortisol and adenaline). See the adjustments section for full notes.
6. The mood window is now called ""emotions"", and is grouped by events, not separately for mood and stress
7. Wellbeing and stress now are simulated using hormones, which have different half-lives. For example, adrenaline drops very quickly but stress lingers around longer.
8. Alarm clocks that you can turn on/off and adjust the alarm. Since you can't wake up voluntarily anymore, these are useful. It works simply by increasing your adrenaline when you hear it ringing - this then decreases your sleepiness. This means that if you're really exhausted, you still might not wake up.
9. Procedural world generation. Roads, basic towns, fields with farms, and paths to houses are generated automatically.
10. Small basic forests to begin with. Some towns also have tree alleys.
11. Towns and homesteads also get randomly generated names - written on traffic signs and mailboxes, respectively.
12. Add back two home types that used to be in the game (the big house, and a small apartment)
13. More realistic windows (not full height anymore)
14. Loot types for each building - the game now generates a virtual resident with specific character traits, and the loot in the house will depend on the personality of the resident.
15. This means loot spawns in groups and clusters. For example, if the virtual resident of a house owns a gun, then they will also have spare magazines, ammo, and a holster for it.
16. Dehydration now progresses slower the more dehydrated you are (not linear anymore)

# Adjustments

1. Make word wrap wider in the mood window
2. Camera starts zooming in only starting from 50% sleepiness
3. Make sleepiness factors easier to understand - melatonin is just ""darkness"", instead of ""mood"", it's now ""good"" or ""bad"" mood
4. Remove muscle fatigue impact on sleepiness and increase impact of low muscle condition on sleepiness
5. Correct the offset of the circadian sleepiness rhythm - low point is now at 3AM
6. Make full sleep start automatically at 95% (not microsleep)
7. Decrease the minimum sleepiness to fall asleep to much lower
8. Remove waking up manually with a button - character only wakes up if they're not sleepy enough
9. Remove thirst and hunger impacts on sleepiness
10. Scale stress from events according to wellbeing (mood). Low wellbeing = higher stress
11. Remove the mood and stress target systems
12. Remove the mental fatigue system - that role is now played by wellbeing
13. Make stress impact on sleep one-to-one, makes it easier to understand
14. Coffee now impacts sleepiness slightly differently - it only reduces sleep pressure (which is increased simply by being awake). It does not decrease sleepiness beyond that.
15. Move hands higher when you're aiming a gun or a knife
16. Do client-side ""prediction"" so your hand turns quicker when aiming
17. Only stress from adrenaline increases your heart rate. Cortisol does not - that's more of a long-term stressor
18. Now almost the only impact on wellbeing is stress
19. Healthy foods increase your stress but also your wellbeing. Junk food decreases stress but also your wellbeing.
20. Wellbeing is restored by sleeping
21. How much faster you move around when stressed is now affected only by adrenaline, not cortisol
22. Converted all containers of food into actual containers, with the liquid a separate object inside. This is preparing for the liquid system.
23. Night-time lasts longer
24. Houses now get sheds.
25. Houses now get their ground correctly generated - every house of a certain type now gets the correct floor type in each room. This was previously hardcoded in the map.
26. Added front doors to all buildings
27. Add back the back rooms of the supermarket with extra shelves
28. Adjusted how long it takes to eat different types of food - eating an apple was very slow before

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

1pqn50m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqn50m,My wife has a 1000 - day Duolingo streak and still could not write or communicate efficiently - so I built something small for her,"My wife has been learning English and French for years.  
She’s consistent. She has a \~1000-day Duolingo streak. She can communicate.

But every time she tried to *write* \- short messages, emails, journaling - she’d say the same thing:

“I know this is wrong, but I don’t know why.”

Exercises were fine. Streaks were fine.  
What was missing was **feedback on her own attempts to speak another language**, not another canned sentence.

So as a side project, I built a very simple web app for her:

* You write a few sentences about your day (no prompts)
* You get detailed feedback explaining *why* things sound unnatural
* It tracks the kinds of mistakes you repeat over time and helps you get rid of them

No streak pressure, no XP, no flashcards.  
Just writing → feedback → slowly fixing the same errors.

I’m opening it up quietly to a few other learners mostly because I’m curious if this is a “just us” problem or a real gap.

If you’re stuck at that annoying intermediate plateau and like writing, I’m very open to feedback (good or bad).

Yes I know, I have a problem :D","A few weeks ago, I had to make a choice to either buy the H&S Evolution 2 in 1 or the Iwata Eclipse, as I obviously only need one of them. I decided to go for the Evo but the Eclipse remained a legendary brush, and I kind of really wanted to have one of those too. So, I was thinking to myself; ""You know what, my stupid sister doesn't need a new coffee machine for Christmas, I'm sure she'd be perfectly happy with a pair of socks"". With that out of the way, I decided to switch it up a bit and go for the Takumi instead of the regular top feed. Working with the Takumi is such a joy. It brings me closer to the work, and presets a wider field of view. Other than that, it preforms just like the regular Eclipse. Is it a better brush than the Evo though? I initially wanted to write a whole review on both brushes but came to the conclusion that it eventually doesn't really matter, because the difference between the both of them is not as big as one might think. If I had to chose only one, I would pick the Evo again. To me it's the overall easier brush. It works at a lower air pressure, is easier to clean and provides a wider range of versatility, even with only the 0.45 nozzle. I wan't to be absolutely clear though. This might just as well be personal preference. Both are fantastic brushes and I see why someone else might pick one over the other.

1pqn1hc,https://i.redd.it/2jeat72ic68g1.jpeg,The Moment I Realized I Didn’t Need Permission to Live,"There’s a specific kind of silence that arrives at the end of December. It’s not the peaceful kind, the one you get from a clean house or an empty inbox. It’s the silence that appears after you’ve fought through a year you thought might break you, only to realize you’re still standing, and maybe even standing taller.

This year, I learned how to walk away without apologizing for it. I cut ties with ghosts, not with grief. I stopped answering messages that only demanded pieces of me. I discovered that solitude isn’t loneliness when it has purpose.

And in the same breath, I built. I wrote like a man possessed. I created universes, pink houses with long shadows, girls with blue umbrellas, haunted minds and aching memories. I stitched my past into stories, not because I wanted to relive it, but because it deserved to be understood.

People think growth is glamorous. It’s not. It’s ugly. It’s uncomfortable. It smells like burned bridges and cold coffee. But it also feels like breathing with both lungs again.

The best gift I gave myself this year wasn’t success, or followers, or applause. It was permission to take myself seriously. To dream without needing validation. To say no without guilt. To say yes without fear.

Next year, I won’t chase love, friendships, or approval. I’ll build a life that makes those things chase me.

And I’ll keep writing, not to escape reality, but to finally shape it.

Basically I just want to know what actual humans think of it. Do the jokes land? Would you keep reading etc. Think Roddy Doyle but drunker,"**CHAPTER 1**

I was twenty-three years old, and my life was a fucking disaster. Every bad decision, every lie, every stolen naggin of cheap vodka had landed me here: about to be admitted into what was basically a feckin’ Magdalene Laundry for generational fuck-ups. I felt half-arsedly suicidal, disoriented, teetering on the edge of full-blown DTs. I was truly on my bollix. But I still had the essentials: my denial and the beautiful, delusional arrogance that came with it.

The long hall was floored with hard brown industrial lino — that misery-coloured shite designed to depress anyone unlucky enough to stand on it. The smell of stale farts, piss, and chemical cleaner was noxious. The place felt like a prison hospital crossed with an auld one’s sitting room — the type with ancient biscuit tins full of sewing needles, loose buttons, and stale Murray Mints. Yellowing floral wallpaper drowned the walls, plastered with Holy Marys, nativity scenes, and little plaques spouting shite like *He is a Father of Second Chances* and *Let Go, Let God*. Almost directly in front of me, the Sacred Heart of Jesus glared down accusingly.

*Bejaysus, Liam — you’ve really made a balls of yourself this time, son.*

Looking at the big fella gave me an idea. Maybe I could be like your man from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest* — an alcoholic Messiah on a mission of Grace.

But like I said already: I was delusional.

I was standing just outside the dreaded Nurses’ Station — the central hub of the Star of the Sea Treatment Centre for people in crisis addiction. Was my addiction a crisis? Not sure. Maybe I just needed a girlfriend. But my legal troubles and living situation certainly were. A severe-looking woman in her fifties — a nun, I presumed — was off fetching the pyjamas I’d be stuck in for detox week.

She left me with my addled thoughts, and I felt like a condemned man waiting to be led away — too terrified to sit, too cowardly to wander. I stared at the lino, eyes like saucers, praying she’d hurry back.

A fella who looked like he’d been through the wars appeared, shuffling up the hall toward me. Sixties-looking, though probably only early fifties. Psoriasis scarred his arms in angry blotches, and a huge Freddie Mercury moustache dominated his alcohol-ravaged face. He clutched a cup of tea in both hands, trembling so violently he was spilling it everywhere.

Was this me in a few blacked-out years if I didn’t cop on? Surely not. This lad was a true dipso. I just needed a job and a bit of direction. I could probably even still smoke a joint or two if I made it out of here alive.

He stopped beside me, paused, sized me up, and in a surprisingly gentle Northside accent asked:

“Are ya goin’ to be stayin’ with us, son?”

I nodded and rolled my eyes heavenward. “For me sins, bud.” I was trying to pull off the strong-silent-type until I got my bearings.

He glanced at the trail of tea behind him, then nodded at a door marked *Sitting Room*. “Sorry, son… would ya open that aul door quick before she gets back? She’ll bleedin’ kill me if she sees I’ve dripped this everywhere.”

“No bothers, bud.”

I pushed open the door, half-bracing for a Mountjoy holding cell. If these lads thought I was a soft touch, I’d be watching my back in the showers for ninety-odd days.

Instead, I was both startled and relieved to find a warm, cosy sitting room. A massive fireplace blazed with turf. A bookshelf in the corner was filled with — of all things — 1970s Mills & Boon romances.

“Lads, we’ve a new guest — be on yer best behaviour now,” my new mate announced with a wink, plonking himself into an ancient armchair and spilling even more tea.

Two fragile-looking old fellas at the rain-battered window looked up from their Connect Four game and smiled. Another sullen ginger lad in his thirties sat alone on a worn couch, nodding at me half-heartedly with jaundiced, anxious eyes before bending back to a massive jigsaw of *The Gladiators* — not the Romans, the feckin’ 90s TV show with Jet and Wolf.

One of the Connect Four lads — late sixties, grey hair but well groomed — stood up and declared in a Southside accent:

“You’re fucked now, kiddo. Welcome to the club.”

He held out his hand. “I’m Eugene. This West Cork eejit I’m thrashin’ is Eddie. Our quiet friend here is Phillip.”

Phillip didn’t look up from hunting a missing piece of Jet’s tits.

“You’ve already met Anto. He loves his tea. We’ll have to get ya a straw, Anto.”

Anywhere else it could’ve been a piss-take, but Eugene said it with genuine concern.

“Ah Jaysus, Eugene, I’m in a bleedin’ jock. Can’t wait for the aul night meds,” Anto muttered, collapsing deeper into the chair by the fire.

Watching him shake made me sweat. Dread for my own rattle crept in fast. I prayed the nun would be liberal with the Xanax.

As if on cue: “Oh for God’s sake!”

Her footsteps slapped the lino like machine-gun bursts. Her head popped around the door — sharp eyes, glasses slipping, scanning the room like an angry robin before locking onto Anto.

“Anthony O’Grady,” she chastised in a thick Cork accent. “How many times have you been here? You know full well you’re not allowed to drink in here.”

“I’m very sorry, Margaret,” Anto said meekly. “It’s bleedin’ cold outside. I just wanted a nice tea by the fire.”

“It’s not *by* the fire though, Anthony, is it? No — it’s all over the hall and on the carpet.” She huffed. “I’ve better things to be doing than cleaning up tea.”

But when she looked at his trembling hands, something softened. She reached into her cardigan and dropped two Librium capsules into his cup. She placed a hand on his greying hair and lifted the drink to his lips.

“Now, silly Billy, drink that down like a good man.”

Anto’s eyes welled. “Ah thanks, Margaret luv. You’re an absolute star.”

“And you’re an absolute bollix,” she said, giving him a playful tap. Then she turned to me, snapping back into sternness. “Now, young man. Let’s get you assessed and undressed. It’s getting late, and we’ve rosary in less than an hour.”

From behind her, Eugene piped up, “Ah Margaret, I thought you only had eyes for Anto. Look at him — he’s just devastated.”

I followed her into the harsh humming corridor, leaving the fire’s warmth behind.

The Nurses’ Station was tiny, dominated by filing cabinets and a built-in mahogany desk cluttered with forms. She pointed at a swivel seat. I sat, clutching the ancient pajamas like a life jacket.

For all my bravado, I was fucking terrified. My leg bounced like it was trying to escape my body. If I didn’t get something into me soon, I’d either drop dead from a heart attack or start screaming and never stop. If she rejected me, I had nowhere to go. I was in the back-arse of nowhere — some place in Cavan I’d never been. I pictured myself kidnapped by bogger hillbillies and fed to feral sheep. Nobody would ever hear from me again.

She filled out the intake form silently. The scratch of her Biro felt like a cat clawing a blackboard.

Angus — the Twelve-Stepper who’d stuck his neck out to get me in — had sworn I was guaranteed a bed. He’d done this place three times before it “clicked.” Fourteen months sober now, working, engaged — fair play. But fuck me, three times. I wished I had the cash for some fancy place that worked first time. He’d dropped me off, gave me twenty quid for fags and coffee, and bolted in case I changed my mind.

Finally she looked up. “So you know Angus, then, Liam. You’re lucky you met him. I hope you appreciate the chance you’re being given.”

Relief washed through me. She was keeping me.

She tapped a clipboard thick with names. “That’s the waiting list. Some people have been ringing for weeks. You got in ahead of them. It wasn’t me who let you in.” She touched the small gold cross at her neck. “Do you pray, Liam?”

“Eh… not really, Sister. To be honest, I’m praying right now you’ll give me a few tablets before I keel over.”

She did not find that amusing. “Liam, don’t be a baby. A healthy young man like you could live another thirty or forty miserable years like this. Trust me — I’ve been here nearly forty years.”

Then, unexpectedly, she took my shaking hand. “You’re going to be okay now, love. You’re safe. I don’t need to ask you anything tonight; I can see you’re not able.”

She poured water into a plastic cup and produced an Upjohn 90 — a purple Xanax, the good stuff. She pointed through an observation window to a room that looked like an eighties hospital ward.

“Your bed is in there — first one in front of my window. We’ll keep a good eye on you tonight. Rosary at eight in the sitting room. Tea after in the dining room. Night meds at nine. I’m putting you on a double detox — double medication. Now go get changed. Leave your money here. Keep your fags. And very importantly: no phones, no drugs, no drink, no violence.”

“Yes Sister, thanks Sister — three bags full, Sister.”

“And Liam?”

“Yes, Sister?”

“I’m not a nun. I’m Margaret. Or Mags, if you want. If you really want to butter me up, call me Nurse. Makes me feel important.”

I had no idea if she was serious, so I tried to smile in a way that covered both possibilities.

“In you go,” she said. “Get changed and come back with your bag.”

I floated into the dorm. The pill hadn’t kicked in yet, but knowing it was dissolving in my gut cut the anxiety in half. Having a bed cut it by another ten percent. Things were looking up.

The dorm looked exactly like what I imagined a Catholic boarding school’s hospital wing must look like: bare bones, two rows of eight metal-frame beds facing each other, wooden lockers etched with Biro graffiti and fossilized chewing gum. A faded Italia ’90 sticker of Roy Keane clung to my locker. A large portrait of Our Lady hung beneath an ominous wooden crucifix. Heavy green duck-down blankets — the kind from the Angeles-on-the-radio era — covered each bed.

I sat cautiously. The springs groaned like they’d been rusting since the Famine. Rubber mattress, as expected.

I saw Margaret through the observation window. She glanced up. I waved. She closed the curtain.

I opened my bag. My entire life, condensed:

One soiled going-out shirt  
Three non-fresh underpants  
Two pairs of ripped, blood-stained jeans  
One shrunken hoodie  
One pair of odd socks

Everything stank of stale beer — the bag had doubled as a drink carrier. A busted can of Dutch Gold had left everything sticky.

*Fuck my life. Never pack for yourself on a bender.*

At least I’d remembered my dole card, charge sheets, and court date. And Angus had given me a heavy winter high-vis jacket he had spare from the sites. Fair play — he’d even put it in a bin liner so it wouldn’t get soaked in Dutch Gold. Must be a genius.

“Right, time to change into these yokes,” I muttered.

I followed the stench of bleach and dripping water to the open bathroom door. Six battered toilets, a big metal piss trough with a puddle underneath. Cold as the Arctic. Showering here would be torture. And I’d forgotten basics: no toothbrush, no wash stuff.

*Double fuck my life.*

I stripped out of my battle-scarred clothes — tiny denim jacket, beer-stained Penney’s top over a stinking T-shirt, jeans hanging off me. No jocks. Angus had to give me work boots; my five-quid canvas shoes had been soaked through for days.

I threw on the pajamas — those 80s ones with weird geometric patterns, light navy and white. Too small after losing two stone. I looked like a homeless stick insect from someone’s bad acid trip.

Fuck it.

Back in the dorm, I put on the high-vis now I was a regular Fashion icon. And guess what — fifteen quid in change in the pockets. Enough for a cuppa from the machine.

Fucking Legend. I owed him.

Underpants would still have been handy, though.

I dropped my pathetic belongings back into Margaret’s office. She didn’t react to the stink.

“You better not be lying about the phone.”

I wished I had been. A hazy flash slammed into me — me screaming “FUCKING CUNT!” down the line at my Ma before throwing the phone into the canal. Blink it away.

“On my nanny’s grave, Margaret — it’s gone.”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Smoking area is straight down the hall and left. Rosary in fifteen. Don’t be late.”

“Yes S— … Nurse.”

I headed off, praying I could hide in the smoking area long enough to dodge the Rosary. No offense to Margaret — it just wasn’t my scene. ",2,1766155898.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

They live 7-8 hours away and we will drive there. There will be mountains and snow on our journey.

“For her Ph.D. research, Valencia-Montoya placed pots with male or female cycads (*Zamia furfuracea*) 50 meters from one another. “After collecting beetles that pollinate that species (*Rhopalotria furfuracea*), she put a dye on them and confirmed they were attracted by the cones—so much so that they sought out the cones’ warmest crevices.” It’s long been known that [the beetles are attracted to strong scents released by cycads](https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-pollinators-nose), so she also used 3D scent-free replicas which also drew in the insects, arriving + departing as the temperature rose and fell. “Using an electron microscope, she found that the tips of the beetles’ antennae have neurons…studying antennae snipped off the millimeter-size beetles—work so precise that she had to give up drinking coffee—she learned that the neurons respond to heat.” Interestingly, “RNA within the neurons also revealed the activity of a gene called *TRPA1*, which is known from mosquitoes and snakes to be involved in infrared detection.” 

And talk about selectivity: “The antennae of *Pharaxonotha floridana* react more strongly to the temperature range of cones belonging to *Zamia integrifolia*, the species it prefers to pollinate, whereas *R. furfuraceae* antennae responded more to the warmer cones from its host plant (*Z. furfuracea*). Finally, “the male cones reached their peak temperature about 3 hours before female cones.” What can I say that would not be inappropriate here?",4,1766155746.0,Beetles,2,1.0,False

1pqmxk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pqmxk1/i_have_a_new_milkman/,I have a new milkman,"I grew up in a small culdesac in a suburban area full of detached houses. Everyone was on friendly terms and almost all were young families. The other children and I would play games together on the safe street after all only people who lived there would drive into the dead end culdesac. It was very peaceful and pleasant. That was until the milkman changed.



Every other day a big bottle of fresh milk was delivered to every door in the culdesac from a local farm. I vividly remember the giddy feeling I had as a child when I left the empty bottle out in the evening only for it to be replaced as if by magic the following morning. It was like a miniature Christmas to me. One day I set an alarm and woke up in the early morning in order to pull open my curtains and wait for the milkman to arrive. A silent electric powered milk float eventually pulled into the culdesac. The float was laden with trays upon trays of bottle white milk which quietly clinked together as he drove. The milkman looked tired but cheerful as he went about his task. When he came to our front door I opened my window and called out a greeting. The milkman was startled and dropped our bottle onto the pavement. He looked up at me. The man’s face was round, red and kind. A brief scowl or irritance disappeared when he saw me looking down at him in awe. He quietly tipped his cap to me before retrieving a fresh bottle or milk.



My parents scolded me when they found the note the milkman had left on our milk bottle. I accepted their discipline but couldn’t help but feel elated when they gave me the note. 



“Sorry for the glass, I don't carry a sweeper. Your young lad gave me a fright when he called out this morn. All the best. Milkman.”



I cherished the piece of communication and kept it in my bedside drawer. My parents seemed perplexed at my obsession but did not deter me. With pride I relayed the tale to my school mates and the other children in the culdesac. Some shared my excitement but others mocked my passion. I got into a scrape with an older boy who called me a cruel name over the whole affair. Nursing a few pains I elected to renew my spirits by waking up early for the milkman once again.



The milk float pulled into the culdesac and somehow seemed quieter than it had the first time. None of the trays in the back made a sound either. I felt strange when I saw the milkman step out from the float. He was much taller than the last time. When he walked his legs seemed to bend outwards slightly as if they were too long. Across the road I watched the tall milkman approach the front door and place down two fresh milk bottles. He then picked up the empty bottle but he had his back to me. When the milkman turned around the empty bottle was gone. His cap was pulled low in front of his face. As he came to approach our door I reached for the handle to open my window but paused. Something instinctual warned me against making myself known. The tall milkman placed two bottles of fresh milk on our doorstep; we only ever received one at a time before. Then I watched as a thin fingered hand picked up our empty bottle of milk and raised it to the obscured face of the milkman. From behind the window I heard the quiet crunch, crunch, crunch as the milkman ate the glass bottle.



My parents did not believe me and added the delivered milk to their coffee and breakfast cereal. When I refused to drink my glass of milk or eat my cereal they became infuriated. I went to school that morning with a sore bottom but that did not shake my sense of unease. I sought out the children at school who lived on my culdesac and they confirmed that an extra bottle of milk had been delivered to their doors that morning. Not only that, they explained, with a smile on their faces, that it was the sweetest milk they had ever drank.



Everyone acted differently that evening and the day after. My parents treated me with great kindness professing their love for me in uncomfortably vulnerable conversations. Father wept that he would never strike me again and only did so because it was how he had been raised. Mother held me tightly pressed against her as if she wanted me back in her stomach again. When I escaped their strange clutches the games outside were not any better. The culdesac gang as we dubbed ourselves were in equally odd spirits. Instead of war they wanted to play games of peace. They skipped around in a circle holding hands for at least ten minutes and I watched on with a frown. It was no fun at all. 



Three bottles of milk were sitting on our doorstep. That was what the label claimed the contents were but I was disgusted at the grey thick liquid within. My parents slurped it down all the same. When I refused to have any there was no angry response, just a quiet acceptance. Everyone at school acted like copies of one another. The lessons became difficult. Our teacher drew complicated diagrams with numbers above what I could count on the blackboard and asked questions. Everyone’s hand went up to respond except mine. I walked home with some of the neighbour’s children every day but soon they began to walk in a strange line and did not talk about TV shows or games anymore. 



Four bottles of black milk were sitting on our doorstep. My parents stopped talking and drank an entire bottle each before heading off to work. I decided to stay at home and I don’t think they even noticed. Everyone was turning into robots. The TV stopped showing anything fun. All the channels showed lines of strange symbols and made a weird ticking noise that hurt my ears. I began to feel so lonely. Nobody forced me but in the end I decided to drink the milk. After that everything felt better. 



I am happy now and you will be too once the new milkman starts his rounds where you live.

1pqmxf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqmxf7,The Hardest Truth About Markets Nobody Wants To Hear,"Let me teach you the single most important lesson I’ve ever learned about markets.

If you’re new to investing, you probably spend a lot of time glued to the news. That’s natural – humans are wired to look for explanations. *Surely there must be a reason the market moved today,* right?

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

>**There is no reason.** At least, not in the way most people think.

Once you understand the real forces at work, the idea that markets move *because* of headlines falls apart.

# Snakes & Ladders

The first thing you need to understand is that markets have **structure**.

There are specific price levels that trigger predictable behavior:

* Short sellers capitulate
* Longs hit stop losses
* Cash on the sidelines moves in, or new liquidity is unlocked
* Profits get taken

When price reaches these levels, moves can accelerate suddenly – not because of “news” but because **positioning is being forced to unwind or expand**.

This makes the market resemble a game of *snakes and ladders*. Price can climb or fall rapidly simply because it landed on the wrong square.

To make matters worse, institutions and retail traders focus on **different levels**. Institutions care about levels most retail never even sees. 

Did I mention that different traders use different timeframes? That adds a fractal element of complexity, on top of all the existing confusion.

The result is overlapping layers of structure that are messy, nonlinear, and nearly impossible to cleanly interpret in real time.

# The Drunken Walk

Between snakes and ladders we get a choppy, low-volatility regime. The market behaves like a drunk man stumbling home from a bar.

In this phase, degenerates buy calls and puts controlling thousands of shares, all expecting volatility to increase – until one side is eventually wiped out, determining a new direction.

What drives this behavior? I’ve seen it all:

* Betting *on* the news
* Betting *against* the news, hoping to squeeze those betting on it
* Betting based on a “psychic”
* Betting based on whether their fried egg split that morning
* Market makers, rebalancing their book for ""maximum pain""

And here’s the key insight:

>**The market rarely moves with the news.**  
If it’s in the headlines, it’s almost always already priced in.

# Reflexivity

*This is where things get truly interesting.*

Sometimes the drunken walk morphs into **fear**. The market thinks it sees a ghost – an imagined threat – and bolts irrationally in the opposite direction. Volatility spikes, narratives multiply, and prices overshoot.

More often than not, **this is a buying opportunity**.

At other times, the drunken walk turns into **avarice**. Confidence hardens into certainty, risk feels invisible, and everyone believes they’re a genius. This is your cue to stop celebrating and start managing risk.

# Price Discovery

Eventually, even drunkards need to sleep.

Somewhere deep in our reptilian brain lies an instinct for *fair value*. Without understanding how they got there, the drunk man eventually passes out at roughly the right spot.

Congratulations... that’s price discovery...

However, the next morning the drunkard wakes up again, drinks his coffee – and the reflexive, fractal insanity starts all over again...

1pqmv46,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/1pqmv46/algorank_2025_v2_ssbmrank_boogaloo/,AlgoRank 2025 v2: SSBMRank Boogaloo,"A little under a week ago, [I released the first version of AlgoRank 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/1pm6sa8/presenting_algorank_2025/). Quite to my surprise, there wasn't really any pushback about the rankings, despite what I considered to be some controversial placements (e.g. lloD at 4th, Fiction at 7th, etc.). Maybe part of it is that no one was particularly invested in arguing about placements on an unofficial, algorithmic ranking. Moreover, I knew that a lot of the results were wonky just due to the dataset being largely unrestricted, and thus containing a lot of throwaway matches that I couldn't reasonably hope to completely prune out of the database.

However, when [the official SSBMRank 2025 eligible player list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/1pnrqfv/official_ssbmrank_2025_eligible_player_list/) dropped, I did want to use my rankings to sanity check the player list and make sure that no one had been accidentally left out of consideration (that was always the main purpose of AlgoRank). This led to a very fruitful discussion with u/DarkGenexSucks, who graciously provided me with very detailed feedback and exactly the information I needed to bring my rankings more closely in line with SSBMRank.

To that end, I am now releasing [AlgoRank 2025 v2: SSBMRank edition](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aN2UO2EiKy9szNQ2sQhPCLGTH-1Yxnx76f18BMsXp74/edit?usp=sharing). 

I have made the following changes from v1:

* The database has been pruned to include only main-bracket events from [SSBMRank's tournament list](https://pastebin.com/d2jJhkjn).
* For the purposes of attendance requirements, Full Bloom, Luminosity Makes Moves Miami, and S Factor 12 were all treated as majors (despite not being on the Liquipedia majors list), to accord with some affordances that SSBMRank made when crafting their ballot.
* In the final version of AlgoRank 2025 v2, eligible monthlies do factor into the ratings, but they *do not* contribute towards the minimum attendance requirements. At present, my best understanding is that this results in seven SSBMRank ballot members (Cilan, Free Palestine, HPR, Kacey, Namzerra, OkayP., and Sirmeris) failing to meet the attendance requirements. Accordingly, I also ran an alternative calculation with monthlies counting towards the minimum attendance requirements, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c0lcJ9bFY7TqRM94pRhi6iM773ZK2maEYcCrCv8QiFI/edit?usp=sharing). If the SSBMRank panel later clarifies that these seven players are eligible for reasons I'm currently unaware of, I'll rerun the calcs and amend the rankings (though it won't be until the end of this month).
* As per SSBMRank's methodology, if a player has a single DQ loss at a tournament, that tournament does not count toward their minimum attendance requirements. If you're interested in seeing what the rankings look like without this restriction, I ran alternative versions of the calculations, both [without monthlies counting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MKmAYNVU5fDu3-yDAfaVZJtygz6OG6HvNHqsSGfYVd4/edit?usp=sharing) towards attendance and [with monthlies counting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JdCy43fGRqHRBpe7txQM4JJ_3vDme_-6ltNm1eaTK0k/edit?usp=sharing).

Now, here are some of my personal observations and takeaways when going down the list:

* Zain is a clear favourite for number 1, but it's not a sure thing. By the ratings, he has a 60% chance of being 1st (you can view this in the ""Rank probabilities"" sheet), which makes him a 3-to-2 favourite over Cody, who has a 40% chance of being 1st.

* The most certain result of the entire list is that Hungrybox is almost definitely 3rd, with a 92% chance of being at least 3rd but only a 2.5% chance of being 2nd.

* moky and Joshman are the clear standouts for 4th and 5th, with moky being an approximately 2-to-1 favourite for 4th (31% to Joshman's 16.5%).

* At 7th place, I think lloD fared significantly better than most people expected. When I read [people's predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/1plv5sv/let_the_speculation_begin_who_do_you_have_in_the/), it seems like many people did not have him in their top 10, and virtually no one put him as high as 7th.

* Ossify is another clear standout at 9th, with pretty much no one having put him in contention for top 10.

* Probably the biggest difference between these results and popular opinion is Jmook, who comes in at 10th (but only just barely, being virtually tied with Wizzrobe). I saw many people putting Jmook in contention for 4th, and I think many more people had him somewhere between 4 and 6, but the numbers do not bear this out: he has only a 12% chance of being top 6 and only a 2% chance of being top 4.

* Players who made top 100 but are not (at least at the time of writing) on the official ballot are Beezy (78), Younger (84), and Khalid (88). 

* Other players who placed above the lowest-rated ballot player but are not currently on the ballot are DannyPhantom (104), cliché (106), Redd (109), Reesch (111), Jada (112), Mooshies (115), regEx (117), Ferrety (118), HOBORG (120), Electroman (121), rainy (122), I'm Michael BTW (123), Grab2Win (124), stavino (125), OkamiBW (126), Suidt (127), lumor (128), s-f (129), Abel (130), Jacklyn (131), SwebBy (132), Porkers (133), Stockholm Syndrome (134), Greenstach (135), FM (136), and snake (137).

Beyond that, the rankings all look pretty reasonable to me at a glance, but feel free to weigh in if anything seems really surprising or controversial to you. If you feel that a particular placement is super objectionable, I encourage you to check the ""Matches"" sheet to review players' best wins and worst losses. If you find any matches that you think should not be in the dataset, please let me know and I'll take a look.

Happy to address any questions, concerns, or criticisms in the comments, though please note that I won't be able to run any further calculations until at least the 28th, as I'm away from my desktop.",9,1766155535.0,SSBM,12,0.85,False

But once others try it, like u/remingtonrivers did, they become obsessed and message me immediately about how much they enjoyed it and how it changed their lives, like Remy did. I'm now going to describe all the different ways I make coffee to make y'all cry from happiness! I'm willing to try it with ice cream, too!

And other fellow users!

So you see, we are full of spark, not snark. We should, in fact, rename the sub to r/RomantasyCircleJerkOfNonToxicPeople to signal what a welcoming community this is.

Thank you for being the loveliest folks. Don't forget to be on your best behavior since Carissa is here with us 🥰 ",42,1766155459.0,romantasycirclejerk,32,0.93,False

1pqmpqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LunchboxDupes/comments/1pqmpqd/what_we_packed_on_a_9hour_drive_the_best_road/,What we packed on a 9-hour drive: the best road trip snacks for gluten-free families,"I grew up thinking road trips equals mystery crumbs and gas-station roulette. Then I found out I was gluten intolerant and my 4yo has celiac, so we learned the hard way that finding safe food on the road isn’t a sport.

These are the grab-and-go heroes that survive kid handling, long miles, and the “I’m not hungry; actually I’m starving” switch. A couple are DIY and most are toss-in-the-tote easy.

**1. Rudi’s Bakery Sandos** 

We did these for the drive back since I couldn’t find any where we live. 

They are real-meal energy without a drive-thru detour. I threw a couple of these in the cooler and called it lunch. 

My kid is obsessed with the PB&J version, and I like that it feels like a proper sandwich and not “sad bread with filling.” 

They’re not fancy, but when you’re somewhere between Amarillo and “are we there yet?” they hit the spot.

**2. DIY “snackle box”** 

Grab a clean tackle box or bento, fill the sections with apple slices, baby carrots, cheddar cubes, rice crackers, olives, or whatever works. It’s like a snack vending machine for the back seat, and it keeps you from ripping open seven different bags while one kid naps.

**3. Rudi’s Bakery wraps & tortillas pinwheels**

Spread cream cheese or hummus, add turkey/cucumber, roll, slice, done. The wraps are flexible enough that I don’t end up with tortilla confetti everywhere, and they actually hold up in a lunchbox. Big win for small hands.

**4. Jerky & meat sticks** 

As long as it’s clearly labeled GF, jerky is my road-trip go-to. It doesn’t melt, doesn’t smell weird, and you can hand a stick back without pulling over. It’s a great hit of protein the help quiet the “I’m still hungry” chorus.

**5. Fruit & nut butter squeeze packs**

Apples with almond butter, bananas with sunflower butter. These little packs are like magic for staving off hangry meltdowns without the sugar crash.

**6. Popcorn & mini rice cakes**

Popcorn is a morale food: light, crunchy, and easy to portion into little bags. Rice cakes do the job when you need something plain and filling. 

On the trip, we loved LesserEvil popcorn and Drizzilicious mini cakes. 

Neither is truly “mess-free” because, let’s be real, a toddler could glue air to your car if given 30 seconds, but these snacks are less likely to turn into permanent upholstery art.

**7. Hummus & veggie dippers**

For a fresh break from salt-bomb snacks, single-serve hummus cups with carrot sticks and snap peas are great. It’s crunchy and protein-rich, which hopefully calms your kids. Pro tip: bring a towel kit. Hummus fingers will find the window glass.

**8. Yogurt tubes or drinkable yogurt** 

Freeze overnight so they double as ice packs. By mid-morning, they’re slushy and perfect. Check for gluten-free status on your preferred brand, and keep an eye on sugar. 

Opt for the lactose-free or vegan kind if you’re dairy intolerant.  

**9. Rudi’s Bakery gluten-free sandwiches or rolls**  

If you’re a “real sandwich” person who refuses crumbly bread, the brioche and sourdough loaves behave like bread is supposed to. 

I usually do turkey-apple-cheddar or just classic grilled cheese. If you freeze the loaf and pull out slices the night before, they hold together fine.

**10. Salty-Sweet trail mix (homemade = safer)**

DIY is healthier. Simply pre-bag pretzels, seeds, coconut chips, and chocolate chips so you’re not refereeing “who got more M&Ms” at hour five.

**11. Applesauce & fruit pouches**

Twist, sip, done. Great for toddlers and adults who forget to eat fruit when “are we there yet?” passes 50 repetitions. Keep a small garbage bag clipped near the door so empties don’t roll under seats until the next spring cleaning.

**12. Lentiful bowls** 

These were our “real food without a kitchen” backup. All you need is hot water, so we packed a thermos and suddenly had a warm, filling meal at rest stops.

It’s gluten-free, hearty, and way more satisfying than another snack bar. Coconut curry was my favorite; homestyle chili was kid-approved.

**How to choose road-trip snacks without losing your mind**

Think trio: protein, crunch, fruit because it helps keep moods even and prevents a sugar overload.

Pack by zones: glovebox = your emergency stash (jerky, trail mix, fruit pouches), tote = dry stuff you’ll grab every stop (popcorn, rice cakes, napkins, wipes), and cooler = drinks and “real food” that needs to stay cold (sandwiches, yogurt, veggie cups). 

Label check before you go coz nothing kills a trip faster than squinting at “malt flavoring” in a parking lot.

Save treats for the last hour: yes, it’s bribery, and yes, it works.

**Little hacks that saved us (after mistakes)**

* Thermos of hot water = instant oatmeal cups for breakfast or when you need a hot cup of coffee/tea.
* Condiment minis make everything feel less “sad lunch in the car.”
* HOTLOGIC food warmer is a must for long trips, and I’ve ordered one for our next adventure. 
* Carabiner with a trash bag means empties can be thrown away immediately.
* Sticker codes on snack bags prevent sibling raids.

**So what’s the best gluten-free road trip snack?**

The best gluten-free road trip snacks are the ones you, your partner, and kids will actually eat. 

My short list: Rudi’s Sandos, tortilla pinwheels, jerky, popcorn, Drizzilicious mini rice cakes, fruit with nut butter, and a couple “Snackle Box” surprises.

1pqmn8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1pqmn8m/i18f_am_jelaous_of_my_boyfriends20m_sister22f/,I[18F] am jelaous of my boyfriends[20M] sister[22F],"Hey, so I’ll just get straight to the source of my problem. I’ve been jealous of my boyfriend’s sister for a while now, and we’ve been dating for 1.5 years. At the start of our relationship, everything was good until his sister transferred from a college far away to a college in our city and moved back home (that was about 4 months ago).
They were never super close before she came back, but they started seriously hiking together (him, her, and their dad) about a year ago, which I thought was fine until he started choosing to go hiking with them instead of seeing me. For context, we can’t see each other every day since I’m still in high school, he’s in college, and we live on opposite sides of the city. So it really hurt when sometimes he would, for example, go night hiking with her alone and we wouldn’t talk for an entire day.
I also love hiking. One time, he was supposed to go hiking on Sunday with his family (and they are serious hikers, so when they go, they leave for the entire day and sometimes longer). On Saturday, we were supposed to go hiking together as well, but not to an extreme mountain. The problem occurred when he said they couldn’t go on Sunday and wanted to go on Saturday instead, and he promised me that we would go on Sunday. I don’t even know why I agreed, because I don’t really have a bus early enough to go hiking on Sundays. In the end, we didn’t go at all.
They talk all the time and have inside jokes that I don’t understand, which makes me feel left out and alone. They watch movies together almost every day and go for coffee three times a week, even though they live together. He often goes out of his way to go pick her up at 1am from a party or bus station but when i need a favour like that i have to persuade him to do it (i just asked him one time in 1.5 years and had to persuade him to help me)
I honestly don’t know if I’m jealous because there’s a real reason to be, or if it’s because I don’t have a family like his. My family has always been dysfunctional, and we can’t talk normally without screaming at each other. I also have two younger brothers—one is my half-brother and one is my biological brother.
All I know is that I can’t take seeing them together, and I hate when he doesn’t respond to my texts when he’s with her. How can I tell whether my feelings are coming from insecurity or from a real problem in the relationship?",1,1766154976.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

I got tired of trying to find buddies within the game so that's why I am here! I want a reason to log in and do the dailies because I truly love the game. I am 100 all combat jobs and can omnieverything. If you even just need help navigating the game or want fast queues for leveling. Or even PVP! I can do that for you! I do not mind as long as I can bond with people. The friends I do have don't play the game as much and have no interest so I am left hanging. As an intro for myself, I love cats! I also like to make art and joke around. I don't really take games super seriously and love to make jokes. I also love anything to do with coffee, energy drinks, or tea.

1pqmj2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pqmj2a/i_know_the_truth_behind_santas_workshop_the_elves/,I know the truth behind Santa's workshop. The elves aren't making the toys.,"The truth is, I was a bad kid. Not just mischievous, but calculatingly cruel. I chose easy targets whose suffering I could measure. There was a boy in my class, Thomas, short and scrawny, always wearing clothes that looked too big or too small. He came from a family so poor, the school waived his lunch fees, and everyone knew it. I thought he was pathetic. 

I still remember his face on the day of the class Secret Santa. He opened his gift and pulled out a cheap football. He held it like it was solid gold, his eyes shining with pure joy. That football was likely the best gift he would receive that Christmas. 

Later, in the muddy school courtyard, I walked up to him, said some casual, vicious thing about his mother’s thirdhand clothes, and snatched the ball right out of his hands. I booted it in a soaring arc until it landed squarely on the inaccessible section of the gymnasium roof. I watched the joy drain from his face and felt a temporary, hollow satisfaction bloom in my chest. It made the weight of my own mediocre life slightly lighter. 

It was sometime after midnight. I was asleep, dreaming about the next insult I could deploy, when I heard a faint whisper on the other side of my bedroom door. Curiosity pulled me out of bed. I opened the door, and the whisper grew louder, drawing me down the staircase. It sounded feminine, soft, and angelic. I tried to wake up my parents, shaking my dad’s shoulder, but his breathing was deep and unnatural, almost like a coma. 

Something subconscious within me forced me downstairs until I stepped into the living room. The first snow of the season was falling outside, and the white glow of a nearby streetlight made the room feel alien and cold. On the coffee table, the cookies my mom had left out for the fat man in red were gone; only a few crumbs remained on the plate.  

The whispers were coming from the granite hearth, vibrating from deep within the chimney. I stared into the dark opening, and the sound suddenly cut out. A red stocking cap was shoved violently over my head, blinding me. Then a powerful vacuum materialized in the fireplace, dragging me toward the opening. The metal flue was still hot, and the residual heat bit into my bare skin as I was sucked inside. 

I started feeling lighter until I was practically falling upwards, as if gravity had reversed itself entirely. I struggled, my fingernails scraping against the rough, soot-covered walls, and my arms became bruised from being squeezed through a narrow section of the chimney. The heat finally receded and was replaced by freezing air. I landed inside a massive hemp sack, heard a drawstring being pulled tight below me, and then everything went black. 

I woke up to a dozen eyes staring down at me. I was lying on a thin mattress in a crowded room. The light was sickly yellow, and the air smelled of old wood, varnish and mold. 

“Where… where am I?” I gasped, pulling myself up. My clothes were covered in soot, and my arms stung, but the bruises had been replaced by just a few faint red marks. 

A boy, maybe eight years old, with huge, vacant eyes and a perpetually sad expression, shuffled closer to the edge of the top bunk. “You’re in the workshop, same as the rest of us.” 

A girl, with hair the color of tarnished brass continued: “This is where you work off your debt."" 

Before I could demand an explanation, a loud, high-pitched bell chimed three times. Every child in the room instantly shoved themselves into their bunks and buried their faces into their threadbare blankets. 

The door flew open. Standing there was not a man, but a short, grotesquely thin creature with olive-green skin, spindly fingers, and a snarling grimace. It looked like the Grinch, had the Grinch been starved for a decade. 

“LINE UP!” The creature shrieked. 

We marched down a dim corridor until it opened into what I would come to know as the Lacquer Hall. It was impossibly vast, stretching farther than any building I had ever seen. Wooden beams loomed overhead; polished stone walls fitted with countless wooden doors and above, a glass roof revealed a moonless night sky. Hundreds of children, none older than twelve, stood in silence at long, grime-coated workbenches, their faces pale and hands dirty. On a raised platform in the center sat a taller figure draped in red, impossibly still, as if carved from wood. It had a long, red, pointed hat and sat with its hands resting neatly in its lap. The children looked down, focusing on their work to avoid its gaze. 

The revolting elf pointed a long, bony finger at me. “No talking. No playing. No taking. Every item must be immaculate. If Inspection finds fault, the debt is not forgiven, but increased. Any disruption, any failure, and you will be taken for correction. Understood?” 

I nodded dumbly. I was shoved toward a bench near the middle of the line. Before me lay an endless parade of raw footballs, the exact model I had kicked onto the roof. My task was to paint the black pattern onto the white fabric. 

A little ways down the line, a small boy working on a chessboard accidentally elbowed a pot of black paint, sending black drops onto the white squares. He whimpered. The bell chimed again, and an elf appeared instantly, grabbing the boy by his arm. 

The child screamed, ""I'm sorry! I'll fix it! Please, I'll fix it!"" But the elf merely dragged him away toward a big wooden door. 

""What... what happens to him?"" I whispered to the boy next to me, who was methodically varnishing a wooden train. 

The boy didn't look up. ""They... They come back. But they're different."" 

Hours later, the bell chimed again. We were marched back to our rooms and given a thin metal bowl of flavorless porridge and a single, perfectly segmented orange slice. 

I sat on my bunk, scraping the bowl. “How long have you all been here?” 

The boy from earlier, named Peter, answered first. ""We don't know the counting. It’s always dark outside; we call it the Longest Night."" 

I swallowed. “The truth is… I was a bully. I made fun of people, stole their things… I regret everything I’ve done.” 

Andrew, sitting across from me, looked up and said with a serious tone: “It doesn’t matter now. You devastated another child's joy. We are all here for the same reason.” 

Peter continued with a hollow expression. ""I took the alms from the church poor box after the Christmas Mass. I took copper and silver both”. 

""I took the comfort doll belonging to someone in my class and cut it into pieces. She took it everywhere, and I thought she was too old to still be carrying it around. She lost her only friend”. Andrew said, now clearly ashamed of his actions. 

I shook my head. “There must be a way out. Some mistake. Some rule we don’t know.” 

“There isn’t. Not unless you do what he cannot see… something no one has ever done.” 

Cycle after cycle, the bell chimed, the elves shrieked, and we were marched out to the benches to finish the impossible debt. I painted the black pattern onto the footballs with mechanical precision, trying to mimic the perfect obedience of my peers who had already begun to physically pay their debt. 

The boy who had spilled the paint now sat painting tiny chess pieces, his work flawless. But his skin had taken on a faint, green tint; his once-dark hair was patchy and dull, and his eyes were sunken in and lifeless. He didn’t look like a person anymore; he looked like a machine wearing a dead boy’s skin. 

Peter whispered to me: “He is a part of the system now. We turn the joy we stole into the service that keeps the joy circulating for others. That's how we all end up if we stay long enough."" 

I glanced up at the raised platform. The overseer on the shelf remained still, its face frozen in a sickly smile. I realized its gaze was not merely punitive. It was tracking our despair, waiting for the moment the last of our joy was extinguished, preparing us for the final transformation. 

In our sleeping cell, the despair was the most palpable around a girl named Mary. She was perhaps the smallest among us, perpetually silent and clung to her bunk. Each cycle, she wept herself to sleep, her hopeless sobs a terrible contrast to the silent acceptance of the older boys. Whatever her sin, her suffering was deeper than the rest of us. 

As the next cycle started, a batch of exquisite, small wooden angel figures, classic Christmas symbols, passed by on the assembly line close to my bench. Suddenly, the bell chimed across the Lacquer Hall. An elf rushed toward a child who had accidentally dropped a toy soldier and broken its fragile arm. Every head, from the long-term-debtors to the freshly corrected boy, looked toward the ensuing commotion. Most importantly, the gaze of the overseer was fixed on the child. In a swift move that felt like screaming without a sound, I grabbed one of the small, beautiful angel figures as it passed by and tucked it deep into my pants pocket. 

That *night*, after the rations of porridge and the single orange slice, the cell fell silent except for the sound of Mary’s quiet weeping. I crept out of my bunk and ripped off a piece of my soot-stained shirt and used it to awkwardly wrap the angel figure. 

I walked over to her bunk. ""Mary,"" I whispered, holding out the present. ""For you."" 

Her face, tear-streaked and pale, turned toward me. She stared at the small gift and after a moment that stretched into an eternity, she slowly took it from my hands. Her small fingers trembled as she unwrapped it. 

She saw the angel. She didn't examine its quality or size; she looked at it as though it were the only glimmer of light in her endless night. She raised the wooden figure gently, and then she did something that felt louder than any factory bell: she smiled. A small, genuine, expression of wonder and gratitude. 

The moment a selfless gift was given and received in the heart of the Workshop, I had introduced a variable that the system could not categorize or measure. 

An overwhelming wave of cold hit me where I stood. My vision blurred, the sickly yellow light warping into long streaks. My head spun and I felt like falling again, but this time downwards, until I hit the cold ground. I lay in a pile of fresh, powdered snow in my backyard.  

My bruises had healed, but my clothes were mangled and covered in soot and paint. I stood up, ignoring the deep chill that had begun to settle in my bones. I presumed my debt, for now, had been paid. I had been given a second chance, and I wasn't going to waste it. The only thing on my mind was to find Thomas. ",15,1766154677.0,nosleep,3,0.95,False

True health isn't about subtraction; it’s about substitution. It is about making small, intelligent swaps that upgrade the nutritional value of a meal without compromising on the joy of eating. This year, the smartest resolution one can make is to return to the roots. By reintroducing ancient grains into the modern diet, anyone can achieve their wellness goals effortlessly.

Here are five easy, delicious millet swaps that can transform a daily diet and set the stage for a vibrant, energetic 2026.

# 1. The Comfort Breakfast Swap: Golden Grains Over White Rice

In many South Indian homes, a heavy breakfast is a staple. Dishes like Pongal are beloved comfort foods, often laden with white rice and ghee. While delicious, white rice can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar, leading to a mid-morning energy crash—the dreaded ""food coma"" that makes one want to crawl back into bed rather than start the workday.

The solution is not to stop eating Pongal, but to change the base grain. This is where[ **Thinai / Foxtail Millet**](https://srivarahafoods.com/products/foxtail-millet-thinai-pongal-mix-200g) comes into the picture.Foxtail Millet is a golden-hued grain that has been cultivated since ancient times. Unlike polished rice, which is stripped of its nutrients, Thinai is packed with protein and dietary fiber. By swapping traditional rice Pongal for a Thinai Pongal mix, one preserves the creamy, savory texture of the dish but adds a layer of complex carbohydrates. This ensures a slow release of energy. A bowl of Thinai Pongal keeps the stomach full and the mind sharp until lunch. It allows a person to enjoy the hug of a warm breakfast without the heavy aftermath. It is the perfect start for a year focused on productivity and vitality.

# 2. The Savory Snack Swap: Crunch Without the Guilt

Let’s address the elephant in the room: snacking. No matter how disciplined a person tries to be, the craving for something salty and crunchy around 4:00 PM is biological. Most people derail their diets here by reaching for processed potato chips or deep-fried snacks made from refined flour (maida). These offer zero nutrition and only serve to clog the arteries.

For 2026, the goal is to snack smarter. The swap here is to move away from maida and embrace the hearty crunch of[ **Kodo Millet**](https://srivarahafoods.com/products/varagu-kodo-millet-ribbon-pakoda-murukku).Specifically, swapping standard snacks for Varagu (Kodo Millet) Ribbon Pakoda is a game-changer. Kodo Millet is known as the ""diabetic grain"" because of its incredible ability to manage insulin levels. When used as the base for a savory snack like Ribbon Pakoda, it provides that essential, shattering crunch that the brain craves, but it comes with a dose of fiber and antioxidants. It turns a ""guilty pleasure"" into a functional snack. Hosting a movie night? Serve Kodo Millet crisps. It satisfies the urge to munch without undoing the hard work of the day.

# 3. The Morning Rush Swap: The 2-Minute Nutrition Fix

Modern mornings are chaotic. Between getting children ready for school and rushing to meetings, breakfast often becomes a casualty. Many people resort to sugary energy bars, instant coffee loaded with syrup, or worse, skipping the meal entirely. This sets the body up for stress before the day has even begun.

The swap for the busy individual is to replace these empty conveniences with a traditional[ **Health Mix**](https://srivarahafoods.com/products/multi-millet-health-mix-500g).A Multi-Millet Health Mix is a powerhouse of nutrition. It is a blend of various millets, pulses, and nuts, roasted and ground to perfection. It takes mere minutes to whisk this powder into hot water or milk to create a warm, nourishing porridge. Unlike a caffeine spike that drops you later, a Health Mix porridge provides sustained stamina. It is rich in iron and calcium, essential for both growing children and working adults. Making this swap is an act of self-care. It ensures that no matter how busy the morning gets, the body is fueled with premium, natural ingredients.

# 4. The Dinner Swap: Light, Airy, and Digestible

Dinner is often the trickiest meal. After a long day, decision fatigue sets in, and it is easy to default to heavy, carb-loaded meals like white rice dosas or heavy wheat parathas. Eating heavy carbohydrates late at night interferes with sleep quality and digestion, leading to weight gain over time.

The intelligent swap for 2026 is to introduce[ **Barnyard Millet**](https://srivarahafoods.com/products/kuthiraivali-barnyard-millet-dosa-mix-200g) into the dinner rotation.Barnyard Millet, or Kuthiraivali, is one of the most easily digestible grains available. It is low in calories but high in fiber. A dosa made from Barnyard Millet is lighter, crispier, and sits gently on the stomach. It prevents that bloated feeling before bed. By using a ready-made Barnyard Millet Dosa mix, the transition becomes effortless. It tastes almost identical to a regular dosa—perhaps even nuttier and more flavorful—but it works *with* the body’s circadian rhythm, promoting better digestion and deeper sleep. A good night’s sleep is, after all, the foundation of a healthy new year.

# 5. The Sourcing Swap: Authenticity Over Convenience

The final and perhaps most important swap is not about *what* one eats, but *where* it comes from. In 2026, consumers are becoming more aware that ""healthy"" labels in supermarkets can be deceptive. A packet of millet cookies loaded with preservatives is not a health food.

The swap here is to move from mass-produced, factory-made health claims to authentic, heritage-based nutrition from[ **Srivaraha foods**](https://srivarahafoods.com/).Choosing Srivaraha is a choice for purity. Located in the culinary hub of Kallidaikurichi, this brand understands that the processing of millets matters as much as the grain itself. They ensure that the flours are fresh, the mixes are balanced, and the snacks are fried in high-quality oils. There are no hidden nasties. When a person swaps their generic grocery store brand for Srivaraha, they are swapping a product for an experience. They are ensuring that their ""New Year, New You"" journey is supported by ingredients that are as honest and committed as they are.",1,1766154480.0,u_Unlikely-Comment-381,0,1.0,False

Even if you fix the date, time, weather, tree, and branch, what are the odds that a leaf falls in the exact same manner two years in a row?

One of the things I enjoy most is sitting on the porch in the quiet of a Sunday morning with a book or stack of magazines and a pot of coffee. I read a little, sip a little, watch the trees, and ponder.

One Sunday morning, I watched a leaf fall from a branch, tracing its flipping and fluttering journey all the way to the ground.

That falling leaf caught me in a contemplative frame of mind.  

I reflected on the fact that this simple event had never  occurred before in all of history — and would never occur again.

Had I not glanced up from my magazine at that exact moment, it would have been, to quote Batty, “a moment lost in time, like tears in rain.”

I wondered: what are the actual odds that a leaf on the same tree, from the same bud, at the exact same time, would ever fall the same way twice?

Well I am glad you asked… 

First we lock in the following parameters:

Same tree

Same limb

Different leaf grown from the same bud

Drop height: ~20 feet

Date & time: November 20th, 8:00 AM

Temperature & weather: Average conditions for my location.

Requirement: Same release behavior, same trajectory, same rotations, same landing orientation

“Exact same” means physically identical, not “looks similar.”

Part 1 — Frozen World (Physics Only)

First, we cheat in favor of repetition.

We freeze biology and environment:

No tree growth

No bark change

No ground change

No biological variability beyond the leaf itself

Even under these generous assumptions, we still have:

Slight differences in leaf mass distribution

Microscopic differences in shape and stiffness

Chaotic air interactions during a 20-foot fall

Using very conservative assumptions, the probability that the second leaf follows the exact same fall is roughly:

~1 in 10¹⁵ (one in a quadrillion)

That’s comparable to:

Flipping a fair coin and getting heads ~50 times in a row

Winning Powerball about five times consecutively

Making a perfect NCAA tournament bracket

Already well past “unlikely.”


Part 2 — Real World (Unfreeze Reality)

Now we let the real world back in:

The tree grows (microns matter)

Bark texture changes

Leaf shape and stiffness change year to year

The air is never in the same microscopic state twice

Tiny thermal and wind differences exist even on “the same weather” day

These don’t add uncertainty — they multiply it.

Revised probability:

~1 in 10³¹

That's 1 in 10 nonillion of a chance.  Have you even heard of a nonillion before?  Not this guy!

At that scale, the number might as well be zero.

For comparison:

That's winning every major lottery on earth every week for a thousand years.

The odds that intelligent alien life exists anywhere in the universe are far better than this.

Even the emergence of any life at all on an Earth-like planet—single-celled organisms, multicellular life, or advanced intelligence—has odds that are dramatically higher than the exact repetition of a leaf’s fall.

The difference becomes even starker as you consider the probability of complex life or intelligent civilizations, which still remain far more likely than a leaf reproducing its fall exactly.

We are more likely to have aliens land and ask to be taken to our leaders.

In Short — Odds Comparison

Here’s a quick percentage-style summary for intuition:

Event Approximate Odds
Exact leaf fall in frozen world~0.0000000000000001% (1 in 10¹⁵)

Exact leaf fall in real world~0.00000000000000000000000000000001% (1 in 10³¹)
Winning Powerball jackpot once~0.0000003% (1 in 300,000,000)

Perfect NCAA bracket~0.0000000000000001% (1 in 9 × 10¹⁸)

Being struck by lightning in a given year~0.0001% (1 in 1,000,000)

Existence of any life somewhere in the Universe likely >50%

Existence of intelligent Civilization likely higher than exact leaf repetition, but far less than certain

The Tipping Point Insight

Nature doesn’t repeat states — humans repeat categories.

Physics is continuous and chaotic.

Human perception is imprecise.

We mistake similarity for identity because our brains don’t track microstates.

Final Thought

What appears simple is shaped by countless forces — gravity, air, growth, and chance — converging in a way that will never be repeated. 

As you go through your day, remember that even something as ordinary as a falling leaf is extraordinary.

I had just come from a heavy therapy session, hadn't eaten all day, and my To Do list of errands was just beginning. I needed sugar, caffeine, and something out of the ordinary as a reward and motivator for surviving.

There was an elderly couple, probably in their late 70s, in front of me. It was no longer the pandemic but I was about 6 feet from them. They were conversing and I didn't mean to eavesdrop but they were speaking to each other with a tenderness that you rarely see anywhere. The husband asked his wife what he wanted and ordered it for her. When the barista asked what he wanted, he simply said, ""oh nothing for me, thanks. This is a special treat for us to be able to enjoy and I'd like my wife to have it. I'm just so lucky I get to be out with her this afternoon, that's my treat. We've been together for 60 years this week! We didn't really get to celebrate so this is us celebrating."" So I moved in closer and apologized for intruding, but told the man that I'd love to celebrate their 60th anniversary if he would let me and told him to choose his treat too (and I said it better not be just plain black coffee lol). His wife said that was like something their daughter would say and didn't think younger people even noticed ""old timing geezers who slow everything down, which is why we rarely go out anymore.""

Anyway, he protested, and I asked if he could accept it as something someone's daughter would do for someone's parents instead of as a stranger. As the universe sending congratulations for 60 years with the love of his life! He relented and both he and his wife got exactly what they wanted. I added my drink order and we all waited for our drinks. I got them seated at a table, we toasted with our drinks, I wished them many more moments of pure joy and days of good health and adventures, thanked them for letting me be a part of their celebration and showing the world some much needed visible love, and then I went off to face the rest of my day. 

Getting to spend some time with such lovely people gave me much more than anything the barista could have whipped up. I was in line for something to fuel my body but ended up with my spirirt renewed instead. With hope that people do matter to each other. Love does last. Softness through the spirit is still present in the harshness of life. Old age doesn't mean only misery and poor health. And a pun to walk away with that I helped an older couple have a safe, public afternoon delight to celebrate their anniversary. 😂

1pqm9zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vending/comments/1pqm9zk/instant_coffee_vs_espresso_vending_machines/,Instant Coffee vs Espresso Vending Machines – Advice for a Beginner?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seriously considering getting into the vending business and would really appreciate some advice from people with experience.

My initial idea was to start with snack and drink vending machines, but after talking to several suppliers, they strongly suggested that as a beginner I should start with **coffee vending machines**, specifically **instant coffee machines**. Their main arguments were that instant machines are:

* cheaper to purchase,
* easier to maintain,
* less prone to breakdowns,
* and potentially more profitable for someone just starting out.

I’ve done some research and I like the general idea. My plan is to start with **one location**, test how it performs, and then possibly scale up if things go well.

However, most of the **instant coffee machines** offered by local suppliers seem quite outdated in terms of design (at least to me). The machines I personally like are models such as **Saeco Oasi 400/600** and **Saeco Evo 400**, but as far as I understand, these are **espresso machines** (or espresso + instant), not pure instant coffee machines.

The reason suppliers advise against espresso machines for beginners is that:

* they require more frequent cleaning,
* have more moving parts,
* are more sensitive to maintenance,
* and generally break down more often than instant machines.

So my questions are:

* Is maintaining an **espresso vending machine** really that much more complicated compared to an instant one?
* For someone starting with a single location, is an instant coffee machine objectively a safer choice?
* Would you recommend starting with instant and upgrading later, or is it reasonable to start with espresso if quality and design matter to me?
* Are there specific models you’d recommend for a beginner?
* What locations should I look for when offering a coffee machines?

Design and overall look of the machine are quite important to me, especially since placement and first impression matter a lot.

Any advice, real-world experience, or lessons learned would be greatly appreciated.

Hi. I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

I'm open minded about relationships and believe trust, consent, and respect matter more than labels. I'm hoping to meet a nice woman who enjoys talking, sharing thoughts, and building something slowly. Friendship first, connection next, and we see where it goes.

If this sounds like your kind of pace, I'd really like to hear from you.",1,1766154013.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
