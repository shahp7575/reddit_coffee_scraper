1n1yfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1n1yfxm/networking_and_burnout/,Networking and Burnout,"So I left a job with nothing lined up because my physical safety was put at risk by an abusive manager. And I‚Äôm, mentally speaking, gone. I can function for an hour a day. Maybe. Half my meals are takeout and I‚Äôm not sleeping through the night. It‚Äôs a miracle if I can brush my teeth and shower. 

All this to say, the very idea of ‚Äúproactive networking‚Äù makes me want to vomit. But we live in a society that doesn‚Äôt accept ‚Äúextreme burnout‚Äù as an employment gap reason, so I have to suck it up and try. 

Any way to start networking that doesn‚Äôt make you want to cut your own arm off? Something that‚Äôs slow and manageable? I‚Äôve only met one person who is open to a coffee networking thing, and every other person I tried to talk to before I burned out was very kind, but overall it was unhelpful because they weren‚Äôt the ones hiring (I can never seem to actually find those people). 

What is sustainable and not as painful as it could be? Realistic for someone like me that won‚Äôt make me immediately give up on everything and live in the woods? ",1,1756342252.0,GetEmployed,0,1.0,False

Well, it was interesting ü§ì ppl are super nice, the community is very friendly, welcoming and supportive of each other (in general).
I saw a lot of posts on Instagram about the winners, idk why but nobody mentions accounts past the 3d place, I think places 4-13 worked hard too. So, here I am, I decided to find all the accounts. Originally I posted it on FB, but the moderators just didn‚Äôt approve my post üí© I don‚Äôt see how it can be against rules, it‚Äôs a win-win, useful info for roasters, some help for hardworking ppl in fincas.

I‚Äôm considering breaking up with my girlfriend, and I‚Äôd like some outside opinions from people who have been in similar situations.

We‚Äôve been together for 2 years. It‚Äôs my first relationship and her second. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs, but there were two moments that really changed how I see her:

	1.	Early in the relationship, she made me choose her over my friends of 9+ years. She was very insecure about them and would have full-on breakdowns whenever I went out with them. I tried to compromise, but she wouldn‚Äôt budge. So i ended up ditching them.

	2.	Later on, I went on a coffee break with a female coworker (someone she had already met and was fine with before). But after I changed work locations, she suddenly got very upset about it and called it ‚Äúa step below cheating,‚Äù which really shocked me.

She‚Äôs generally a high-maintenance person. She expects a lot from me but doesn‚Äôt always put in the same effort. For example, I‚Äôve been asking her for over a year to apologize sincerely when she hurts me, but she just says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and moves on.

I honestly don‚Äôt know if I can handle this relationship anymore. I love her, but I feel drained and not fully respected.

If you‚Äôve been through something similar, I‚Äôd appreciate hearing your experiences or advice. Should I break up or try to work on this? Happy to answer questions or provide more details.

I'll be visiting BC for a few days, specifically Vancouver, and I'd love some help with budget-friendly recommendations for food and some pet-friendly spots.

Food:

My budget is a maximum of $25 per meal. I know it's tough to find something for around $10, but if you have any hidden gems, please don't hesitate to share! I'm not a picky eater at all, so feel free to recommend your personal ""go-to"" place and your favorite dish there. I'm open to anything! FYI I'm not a coffee or drinks person‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt eat desserts (unless is small and cheap)

Any deals or happy hours are very welcome!!! I'm open to suggestions (specially in Vancouver)

Nature/Activities & Pet-Friendly Spots:

I'm also looking for recommendations for nature spots that don't involve a lot of hiking. I have a knee issue, so I can't do much uphill or downhill walking. Any easy-to-access parks, scenic viewpoints, or hidden gems would be amazing. Also, if you know of any places that are pet-friendly, I'd really appreciate the suggestions.

I'll be using the SkyTrain and will be getting a Compass Card for it.

Particularly ""drive ins"". I liked dishes like pork cutlet and gravy, beef stew, hamburger steak. And that American diner retro feel.  
  
Perhaps some of you here are 30...40...50+ years old.  
  
You might recognize some (or all) of these restaurant names:  
Columbia Inn  
Flamingo  
Garden Court and Gazebo (both at Liberty House)  
KC Drive Inn  
Like Like Drive Inn  
Wailana  
Wisteria  
  
If not, feel free to add any nostalgic mentions that you can think of.  
  
I would add, what Rainbow Drive Inn tasted like some 15 years ago. I still think Kapiolani Coffee Shop does a good job. Zippy's is same as ever.  
  
Of places I have not been, that I plan to go. I have listed Richie's Drive Inn, Highway Inn's Waipahu location, Papa Ole‚Äôs in Hau‚Äòula, Hannara‚Äôs in Waianae. I know places like the original Liliha Bakery and Sekiya, but have left a lot off this post.  
  
If anything still exists that fits this criteria, please give input. To rephrase the idea, I am looking for a certain recipe and cooking that has somehow survived until now.

We‚Äôve been married for a year and some change, and we married a few months after she got pregnant. Life moved very quickly for us but we were and still are incredibly happy together. Her and the baby are the greatest things that have ever happened to me. I love them more than life. 

The married dad life is VERY different than my previous life. I was a spontaneous bachelor that valued my independence above all else. Traveled, partied, dated a lot and hung out with friends often. All of that came to a dead stop and I really never looked back. I‚Äôve focused on work and family and nothing else ever since. 

The baby did not sleep well for most of her life so far, but over the last few months has started falling asleep early and through the night‚Äîleaving some free time before bed. My wife reads in bed so I started going downstairs a few nights a week to watch TV alone. She frequently gives me crap about it and kinda huffs and puffs when I don‚Äôt stay in bed while she reads. I usually will spend 2 hrs or so downstairs before coming back up to bed but occasionally it‚Äôs longer and she‚Äôs asleep when I come back up. She now says I don‚Äôt like spending time with her bc I do this and we should be using this as quality time together instead of being in separate parts of the house. I did start doing it more frequently recently so I get why she feels this way but it‚Äôs honestly the only time I can spend alone and decompress.

For more context: my wife works from home and a nanny comes to watch the baby M-F 8am-4:30. Her job is often very hands off and she gets a lot of free time to use as she pleases during her work day. I on the other hand have a very high stress job that requires being on job sites or my office most days. I do make my own schedule so I WFH when I can and typically use my mornings to spend time with my wife and have coffee/breakfast together. But it‚Äôs a demanding job and my days are littered with meetings, calls, and solving stressfull problems. I pay most of our bills and my wife‚Äôs salary essentially covers the cost of our nanny. 

I love spending time with my wife but this small window at night is my only chance at alone time. As someone who valued independence it‚Äôs hard for me to accept almost never having time alone. I feel like she gets a lot of alone time during the day so she doesn‚Äôt really understand how draining not getting it can be. But I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and I do agree that we are also deprived of having quality time together so I agreed that I would start spending this time with her instead and only spend this time alone on occasion.

Is there like‚Ä¶ a lighter version of this vibe? I gravitate toward smells that are spiced, earthy and dimensional, maybe even herbal but not too grassy: vanilla, coffee, tobacco, that sort of thing.

1n1y5d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1n1y5d6/boss_swears_its_clean/,Boss swears it‚Äôs clean‚Ä¶,"I picked up a summer gig at a restaurant and honestly, the place is absolutely disgusting. That‚Äôs my biggest gripe. I‚Äôve tried numerous times to clean things, but my boss (let‚Äôs call him Omar) is constantly praising himself for how ‚Äúclean‚Äù the restaurant is. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs the grossest place I‚Äôve ever worked.

The freezer is a perfect example. The door doesn‚Äôt shut because it‚Äôs covered in ice, so it never fully closes. It‚Äôs inside a cooler, and I guess Omar justifies it by saying the cooler somehow keeps it cold. (He did attempt to have it fixed and it broke/got covered in ice again within like 5 days.) But the temperature definitely changes because every time I go to get ice cream, it‚Äôs half melted. And the whole process is ridiculous. The freezer is outside of the restaurant, so to get ice cream you have to walk out, go into the cooler, open the broken freezer, grab it, bring it back inside, transfer it to another container, then put it into a different freezer inside the restaurant. Other servers leave the ice cream out for 30+ minutes at a time until I get in the back and see it has turned to a literal puddle. I'm not allowed to throw it away at this point. I‚Äôve told people over and over that constant temperature change is dangerous and can make people sick. Eventually I got fed up and yelled about it, and instead of fixing the problem, I was just told to be quiet.

Then there‚Äôs the dishwasher, which is never cleaned out. At the end of the day, nobody bothers to remove the food, so when I come in the morning, yesterday‚Äôs scraps are still sitting in there. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even get cleaned at all. This isn‚Äôt even a restaurant dishwasher. It‚Äôs the kind of machine that‚Äôs meant for a bar, just washing glasses. It‚Äôs way too small for the volume we do. The glass racks don‚Äôt fit our coffee cups properly, so the mugs just kind of balance on top of the glass racks. They come out filthy. I usually scrub them myself, which I don‚Äôt mind, but I know no one else bothers because I come in and they are always covered in old coffee or lipstick.

If that‚Äôs not enough to gross you out- the bathroom is worse. There is constantly shit on the toilet. I‚Äôve asked Omar to clean it, (no on else will), and he‚Äôll go in there and just wipe it down with toilet paper without using any chemicals. I have literally watched this happen. He says something like, ""oh it's just a little poop""... we're a restaurant. I end up bleaching it.

Maintaining excellent oral health is more than just a cosmetic concern ‚Äì it's a critical component of your overall well-being. A good oral hygiene routine can prevent numerous dental problems, boost your confidence, and contribute to your general health. Every day, millions of people struggle with dental issues that could be easily prevented through proper care and attention. From tooth decay to gum disease, the consequences of neglecting oral hygiene can be serious and far-reaching. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about creating and maintaining an **optimal oral hygiene routine** that will keep your teeth and gums healthy for years to come.

Why Oral Hygiene Matters

Oral health is a window to your overall health, with numerous studies linking poor dental hygiene to serious medical conditions. Research shows that bacteria from gum infections can enter the bloodstream, potentially contributing to heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic health problems. A comprehensive oral hygiene routine is your first line of defense against these potential health risks.

Key Components of an Effective Oral Hygiene Routine

1. Brushing Techniques
‚Ä¢ Brush at least twice daily
‚Ä¢ Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
‚Ä¢ Brush for a full two minutes
‚Ä¢ Use gentle, circular motions
‚Ä¢ Clean all tooth surfaces ‚Äì outer, inner, and chewing surfaces

Choosing the Right Toothbrush and Toothpaste

Selecting the appropriate dental tools is crucial for maintaining optimal oral health. Consider the following when making your choices:

Toothbrush Selection
‚Ä¢ Soft bristles to protect gum health
‚Ä¢ Comfortable handle grip
‚Ä¢ Appropriate head size for your mouth
‚Ä¢ Electric vs. manual options

Toothpaste Considerations
**Fluoride is essential** for preventing tooth decay
‚Ä¢ Look for ADA-approved products
‚Ä¢ Consider specific dental needs (sensitivity, whitening)
‚Ä¢ Check for additional protective ingredients

The Importance of Flossing

Many people underestimate the power of flossing, but it's a critical component of a good oral hygiene routine. Flossing:
‚Ä¢ Removes plaque between teeth
‚Ä¢ Prevents gum disease
‚Ä¢ Reduces bad breath
‚Ä¢ Reaches areas brushing can't touch

Recommended Flossing Techniques
‚Ä¢ Use 18 inches of floss
‚Ä¢ Gently slide between teeth
‚Ä¢ Curve floss around each tooth
‚Ä¢ Use clean sections of floss for each tooth

1n1xyik,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTonySays/comments/1n1xyik/full_article_worker/,"full article, worker","Auburn 'Ladies Man' Tony Johns popular with many, but problematic to others

Tony Johns, of Auburn, has attracted a significant following online.

Kevin Rivoli, The Citizen

AUBURN ‚Äî Maybe he was introducing himself as ""Ladies Man"" and knitting his sharp, dark eyebrows like Derek Zoolander.

Maybe he was powerwalking down Grant Avenue wearing a paper Burger King crown atop his closely shaved head with inscrutable confidence.

Or maybe he was doing something decidedly less innocent.

Whatever he was doing, Tony Johns has most likely streaked down your social media feed at some point in the last few months.

Full name Anthony Michael Johns, 29, he may be the closest thing Auburn has to a local celebrity. He went viral in 2018 with a video about doing community service for a DUI in Utah, and has maintained a significant following ever since with a 24/7 stream of content and high-profile podcast appearances. He even has his own Reddit page, @s--ttonysays, with more than 6,700 members.

That celebrity has made the wiry 6-foot-3 Johns a walking selfie destination in Auburn, where he moved in 2022. He posts several of his own, mostly with youth, at places like Auburn Plaza and Wegmans.

But his popularity with youth is one reason Johns also has his share of critics, both online and in the community. Many of their concerns stem from the photos and videos he posts of himself nude. He has been accused of acting inappropriately toward underage girls as well, along with harassing the staff of the local businesses where he records content, among other unwilling costars.

His behavior has raised additional concerns about his mental health, which reportedly led to his April 15 arrest for violating an order of protection and subsequent six weeks in the Cayuga County Jail. 

Johns addressed those concerns in a recent interview with The Citizen at State Street Plaza, where he reflected on his life and celebrity ‚Äî and the sometimes unhealthy relationship between the two.

""Ladies Man"" Tony Johns, of Auburn, hopes to use his online celebrity to star in Hollywood movies.
David Wilcox, The Citizen
'I got a DUI, baby!'


While his Utah drawl might suggest Johns lived out west his whole life before coming to Auburn, he was actually born in Syracuse.

He was adopted when he was 5 by the late Jeri and Steve Johns, he said, and taken by train to live with them in Salt Lake City.

Growing up, Johns wanted to join the FBI or the military. Heavy drinking closed those doors. But after he posted the video about his first DUI on Twitter (now X), another one opened.

""My ass is gonna be doing community service for the state of Utah. Wooh! I got a DUI, baby!"" he told the camera, wearing assigned yellow coveralls, sounding either sarcastic or completely oblivious. ""If you guys see me up on the freeway picking up trash and all this bulls--t, feel free to honk your horn. Feel free to say, 'Hey, Tony Johns, Ladies Man!' out the window, and I'll wave back.""

The X account where Johns posted the video has since been deleted ‚Äî many of his social media accounts have, due to policy violations. So the total number of times it's been viewed is unknown. But the video has been reposted, and continues to be viewed, across the internet. One of those reposts, by comedy podcast ""Your Mom's House"" on Instagram, has more than 83,000 views.

The podcast, hosted by married comedians Tom Segura and Christina Pazsitsky, has since featured Johns as a guest several times. YouTube clips of his appearances have tens to hundreds of thousands of views. Segura and Pazsitsky even flew him to Texas and arranged for him to film a porn scene with a professional actress in Las Vegas, but his jail sentence this year postponed that.

Asked if he feels the podcast took advantage of him, laughing at him instead of with him, Johns said that he did at first. But then he decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered him.

""They really do know how to take care of a man,"" he said. ""Everything was comped. When I got in the hotel room, I kind of teared up. Because it was like, 'I actually made it.'""

But celebrity has come with costs as well, Johns said. One was his first serious girlfriend in Utah, a stripper seven years his senior, who left him because of the attention he received from women.

Around that time Johns stopped drinking, he said. He was strongly encouraged to do so by his adoptive mother, whom he lost to breast cancer in 2022. He lost his adoptive father four years earlier.

Then, Johns decided to come back to Central New York to find his biological parents. 

'A trailer park tornado'


To this day, Johns has never met his biological father.

He wishes he hadn't met his biological mother.

Johns wouldn't say much else about her, except that their relationship ""went south."" She did not respond to requests for comment by The Citizen, which is not identifying her to protect her privacy.

At one point she and her boyfriend's brother obtained an order of protection against Johns ‚Äî and on the afternoon of April 15, he violated it.

According to affidavits filed in Auburn City Court, Johns texted her boyfriend throughout the day, becoming increasingly agitated. He then said he was going to Walmart to buy boxing gloves, and asked the boyfriend to meet him on Market Street to fight. When the boyfriend refused, Johns went to his residence despite knowing his brother was there, and began yelling at them both.

""See this is why I don't like mother f--kers like you because you know that they both have a restraining order against me and you won't box me,"" Johns told the boyfriend in a voice recording.

The boyfriend said Johns even texted him a picture of white Everlast boxing gloves he purchased for the fight.

He was arrested later that afternoon, and charged with second-degree criminal contempt. His six weeks in the Cayuga County Jail weren't as hard as the time he did for his second DUI in Utah, he said, but they were hard nonetheless. He believes he's an easy target, and said he was attacked and robbed of his clothes, jewelry and wallet in June in Syracuse for the same reason.

Jail was also hard on Johns because of his mental health. He said he has been diagnosed with anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as anger issues.

His star-making DUI video is actually the result of an episode of high anxiety, he said.

""When it triggers, I act wild,"" he said. ""Like a trailer park tornado.""

In their affidavits, his mother and her boyfriend said Johns has been diagnosed with another disorder ‚Äî paranoid schizophrenia. They said he has not taken his medication in about a year, and the boyfriend said he told him on April 15 that he needs to resume taking it and ""follow through with his treatment plan."" Johns denied the diagnosis and dismissed them as liars.

""I don't want nothing to do with them. I've moved on,"" he said. ""There's a reason why I was adopted.""

'Acting a fool for money'


Since his last jail sentence, Johns has tried to stay out of trouble. But he found himself in the back of a police car again on Aug. 8.

According to TikTok videos he posted, he was at Clift Park in Skaneateles that afternoon, ""acting a fool for money,"" when a man told Johns to leave. He responded by telling a woman next to the man, ""Why doesn't your girlfriend hit me up?"" The woman was the man's mother, making him angrier. Village police responded to the confrontation and gave Johns a ride back to Auburn.

He recorded one of the videos from the back of the police car. An officer even asked where to find him online, and he said his TikTok account is @TonyMichaelJohns. 

Johns appears to have deleted another video showing the confrontation itself. But it played out like many of the ones he has with strangers. He calls women ""sweetie"" and men ""bro"" or ""sir"" with trollish frequency, stoking the tension. Insults and threats inevitably ensue ‚Äî like when he told an operator of Cafe 108 he was ""a pile of trash"" for asking him to leave its outdoor seating area. 

Asked about these confrontations, and specifically the allegation that he harasses strangers, Johns said, ""I'm a free spirit.""

""I like to have fun,"" he said. ""Don't ever judge a book by its cover. I don't know you and you don't know me.""

Johns said he gets ""fired up"" and does things he regrets because of not only his anxiety, but the amount of coffee he drinks. He begins every day with a large cup, one of the beverages he has coined ""big swigs"" as part of a meme lexicon that also includes his ""Ladies Man"" and ""worker"" monikers. When he's banned somewhere he's ""86'd,"" and his followers maintain the ever-growing list.

He affords his beverages, and whenever possible a hotel room, with donations he collects through Cash App and Venmo. He solicits them on TikTok, SnapChat and other social media. Additional money comes through personalized video service Cameo. His videos cost $10, and 76 out of 77 reviews gave him five stars. The other said Johns got their name wrong and asked for more money.

Whether it's a Cameo video, a few bucks on Cash App for a big swig or a selfie with him, Johns is heartened by the support of his followers, he said. 

""I haven't had the best life,"" he said. ""Having my social media and fans, it helps me. I've been bullied my whole life. I have a lot of people who have my back for once and it feels good.""

A regular site of the content Johns posts is the weekly karaoke night hosted by DJ Bryan Throw (Bryan Schlenker) at Harley's Pub on Wednesdays and Shep's Brewing Co. on Saturdays. He said the DJ ""is the absolute man and knows how to show Auburn a good time,"" and Schlenker told The Citizen he understands why followers of Johns see similar entertainment value in him.

""I'd wager he has so many followers because most folks know you shouldn't walk into a business and ask if they're hiring wearing a bandana and a tank top. Most of us know it's rude to walk in the middle of the road with absolutely no concern about the line of cars forming behind you,"" Schlenker said, noting Johns is polite to him but has needed to be reminded to keep his shirt on.

""It's entertaining to watch while wondering how he got as far as he did in life without picking up any social cues or general empathy along the way.""

But having that following in his head at all times can be hard as well, Johns said. The problem isn't posting enough videos to keep them entertained ‚Äî that comes to him naturally.

The problem, he continued, is being among people he knows love him and hate him in comparative measure.

""It's almost like everywhere I go, at least one person knows me,"" he said. ""It's hard for me to figure out what girls like me but what girls don't. What guys really like me but what guys don't."" 

'I got a lot of testosterone'


Some girls like Johns so much they flash him from their cars while he's walking down Grant Avenue, he said.

His own nudity is the reason many other girls, and guys, don't like him. He posts photos and videos of his genitalia, including him masturbating in public bathrooms, on subscription service OnlyFans as another source of income. But that content has found its way to his X and Instagram accounts, leading to the latter's deletion. Asked about such posts, he was anything but apologetic.

""I'm the kind of dude that I want to get my name out there,"" he said.

""I'm very confident in myself. I'm a very young, handsome man. I got a lot of testosterone. I want to show girls and people that I got a nice body and this is what I do for work."" 

Those posts make critics of Johns uneasy about his proximity to underage girls who follow and take selfies with him. Some even find him exposing his chest or not wearing a shirt at all.

He insisted those critics have nothing to worry about ‚Äî because he likes older women like ""cougars"" and ""MILFs.""

""I would never do anything wrong to someone who's 18 and younger,"" he said. ""They're my fans. All these young kids are all just fans.""

But Johns is also accused of making problematic comments about the age of consent, including a Monday video about taking out a 17-year-old, as well as sexual remarks toward teenage girls.

Perhaps his most toxic behavior has been directed toward some of the women he has been involved with sexually. His posts have made their names well-known to his followers, and without their consent. One of them did not respond to The Citizen's request for comment, and another declined comment due to her fear of worsening the damage Johns has already done to her reputation.

Another woman who was involved with Johns sexually, Amber Guyett, 28, of Auburn, told The Citizen he's ""a scumbag.""

Guyett said she met Johns last year, while the two were working at Lowe's. Though nice at first, he became ""disturbing"" and sexually demanding, she continued.

After she ended the relationship, Johns began stalking Guyett, she said. On several occasions he has slept in a tent in the yard of her apartment complex, making her feel unsafe. While some online have called him out for that, others have made jokes and memes. But that doesn't surprise her, she said, as she believes there's a method to the compulsively followable madness of Tony Johns.

""He manipulates people to feel sorry for him,"" she said. ""He really needs help.""",4,1756340909.0,ShitTonySays,1,1.0,False

I work a typical 9 to 5 in a gray-walled office wedged between a refinery and a cold storage depot. It was nothing glamorous. Just payroll, inventory, and data entry.

Just a blank space where there should have been something. Or someone.

From my second-floor office window, I had a clear view of the backloading dock.

That‚Äôs when I saw the truck.

A large, white freight hauler‚Äîunmarked, the kind that smells like bleach and cold sweat‚Äîbacked into the far bay with its lights off. It rolled in slow, deliberate, like it didn‚Äôt want to be seen. A man in a reflective vest emerged from the cab, then opened the rear doors.

And then‚Ä¶ they stepped out one by one.

Four women. At first glance, they looked like human girls, but they had unusual features. I couldn‚Äôt quite make them out as they each wore oversized coats they pulled tight around their bodies, as if they were trying to disappear into the fabric. Their eyes were wide searching the shadows, like prey searching for their predators. One stumbled slightly as she hit the concrete, catching herself with trembling fingers.

I should‚Äôve called someone.

But something stopped me. Something about their faces.

They were beautiful. Almost too beautiful. The kind of beauty that feels more *designed* than born. I squinted against the glass, trying to parse what I was seeing.

For example, one woman‚Äôs skin had a faint reddish hue, not from blush or windburn, but something deeper. She had undertones that shimmered when the light caught her cheek just right. Small, curling horns poked through the top of her head, as her dark black hair was cropped short just below her neck.

They looked too connected to her forehead to be prosthetic.

I told myself they were costumes. Makeup. Some kind of elaborate viral stunt. A haunted house promo maybe, or one of those weird immersive theater things rich people pay thousands for.

But what kind of show leaves its actors looking like they‚Äôre terrified out of their minds? What kind of role demands fear that raw?

One of the girls looked right at me.

I caught the longing in her eyes, the fear, and the desperation. And in that moment, I knew she wasn‚Äôt playing a part.

None of them were.

A few men emerged from the yawning darkness of the warehouse. Their movements were slow, casual, like this was routine. No shouting, no barking of orders. Just calm, practiced movements. They didn‚Äôt have uniforms, but they wore dark jackets and work gloves. One of them held a clipboard, as if this was just another delivery to log.

The girls hesitated at the edge of the truck‚Äôs shadow, but a sharp gesture from one of the men sent them filing inside in a single, obedient line. No protest. No resistance. Just the slow, hollow shuffle of sandaled feet on concrete as they filed one by one single file into the warehouse.

Something about their silence made the hair rise on my arms.

Without thinking, I grabbed my keys and left the building. My heart jackhammered in my chest as I went to the back of the building, out of sight, where my vehicle was parked. I slid into my car and pulled away from my usual spot, circling around the far end of the lot, just past a rusted chain-link fence, where many unused vehicles remained in an unpaved lot. I tucked in beside a few of them, out of view, and killed the engine.

From there, I had a clear line of sight to the warehouse‚Äôs open bay.

The men were stripping the girls.

They peeled away the oversized coats like they were shedding packaging. The garments hit the floor in limp piles, revealing the girls' barely clothed bodies. Just jean shorts and bikini tops were covering them. The warehouse lights glared down on their skin, sterile and unflinching.

Each girl stood stiff as a statue. Eyes shut tight, arms locked at their sides like it might protect them, or maybe because they‚Äôd been told not to move. Their bodies trembled slightly in the chill, but they didn‚Äôt make a sound.

And then I saw them.

Really saw them.

The green-skinned girl was the first to break my sense of disbelief. Her hair was writhing, coiling. At first, I thought it was some kind of clever prop, but my blood chilled when I now got a better look. Each strand of her hair was alive, wriggling independently like it had its own mind.

Snakes! Her hair was made of snakes!

They hissed and coiled, agitated, though she stood perfectly still. Her skin wasn‚Äôt painted. It was smooth, lime-colored, patterned faintly with scales that shimmered under the fluorescent lights. Her pupils were vertical slits, and I swear‚Äîwhen she opened her eyes for a flicker of a second‚Äîshe looked directly at me.

The red-skinned girl beside her was slightly taller, her horns curling back over her head like ram's horns, polished and dark. Her skin was a muted crimson, not firetruck red but more like old blood. There was something subtly wrong with the air around her, like heat shimmered off her body even though it was cold. Her expression was blank, distant, but her lips parted slightly, showing two elongated canines.

She had to be a succubus.

The aquatic girl, blue as sea glass, stood next to her. Her skin had a faint iridescence, and her collarbones bore subtle ridges where her gills fluttered, as if testing the air. Her eyes were wide and silver-flecked, and her feet, fully webbed, shifted on the concrete like she didn‚Äôt know how to stand upright for long. She had long, elaborate dark blue hair that cascaded down her back. She looked... newer. Less hardened. Her arms were mostly human, but around her elbows the scales thickened, hinting at something underneath that didn‚Äôt belong on land.

She looked a lot like a mermaid, only with legs.

And then there was the third woman, the fairy.

God, she looked fragile. And she was so small. She had to be no taller than five feet. The kind of thin that suggested she hadn‚Äôt eaten in weeks. Her skin was a cold shade of ivory with almost runic veins etched all over her body in elaborate patterns. Her mouth was clamped shut, but when she turned slightly, I caught a glimpse of her wings. They were long, slender, not the cartoonish kind, but real, elaborate and elegant. Her normally happy expression was absent, replaced by a cold, gaunt look.

One of the men walked up behind them and began fastening black zip ties around their wrists; tight, unforgiving. He moved mechanically, as though binding exotic animals for transport. He looped their ankles with chains, thin enough to walk in, thick enough to control. The girls flinched at the contact but said nothing. The succubus winced as the plastic bit into her wrists. The mermaid‚Äôs eyes welled slightly, but the tears didn‚Äôt fall.

Then the man did something that made my blood run cold.

He slapped the gorgon across the ass, hard. The sound echoed through the empty lot like a gunshot. She didn‚Äôt react. She didn‚Äôt cry out or turn her head. But I saw the snakes recoil violently, hissing, writhing with fury she couldn‚Äôt show.

The men herded them deeper into the warehouse like livestock.

I just sat there, trying to process what the fark I was seeing.

Because in that moment, one horrifying thought lodged deep in my skull:

These girls weren‚Äôt just being trafficked.

They weren‚Äôt even human.

My fingers were frozen on the steering wheel, heart pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. My brain was screaming at me to call someone. Anyone! But who the hell would believe me? Hey, officer, I just watched four mythological monster girls get taken into a warehouse at the center of the city.

Yeah, because 911 wouldn‚Äôt tell me not to tie up the line.

As they were led further inside, the light grew dimmer. The warehouse swallowed them, but not entirely. A single floodlight buzzed overhead, casting a broad yellow cone over a low, makeshift couch positioned just beyond the bay entrance‚Äîcobbled together from old cushions and tarp-covered padding. It looked like something torn from a brothel or holding cell. Stained. Improvised. *Used*.

The girls were sat there in a silent row, facing the lot. Facing *me*.

I sank lower in my seat, heart pounding again. From the shadows of the junked patrol cars, wedged between a rusted pickup and a hollowed-out school bus, I prayed they couldn‚Äôt see me.

But something told me they could.

The men who brought them in moved to the back of the warehouse. One flipped a switch. The bay doors began to roll shut with a slow metallic groan, but they stopped just shy of closing completely. Maybe five or six feet off the ground. Enough to let in air. Or maybe to let something else out.

Then they left the girls alone.

And in the silence that followed, the girls sat motionless‚Äîlike artifacts on display, too exhausted to cry and too hopeless to run. Their heads drooped, and their limbs, still bound, trembled subtly. Some stared at nothing. Others scanned the warehouse‚Äôs rusted walls with the expression of someone already dreaming of escape.

Then, all at once, their eyes locked with mine.

It was almost imperceptible. No sudden movement. No gasp. Just a shift subtle, mechanical, instinctive‚Äîas their eyes aligned with mine. As if they‚Äôd known I was there. It wase the whole time. As if they‚Äôd been *waiting*.

Their gazes didn‚Äôt move from me. They didn‚Äôt dare turn their heads, didn‚Äôt twitch or gesture or alert their handlers. They stayed perfectly still, communicating only through their eyes. A look passed between them, brief, but barely perceptible. Then back to me.

And what I saw in their expressions wasn‚Äôt malice or hunger.

It was *grief*. Unfiltered, soul-flattening *grief*. The kind you don‚Äôt fake.

The gorgon girl sat with her knees pressed tightly together, her wrists zip-tied behind her back, shoulders curled forward like she was trying to hide her form. Her snakes no longer moved‚Äîthey hung limp, defeated, as if they, too, had been broken. Her green skin was mottled now, blotched along her arms and thighs, and there were bruises and deep purple welts just below her bikini line. Her eyes locked on mine. And behind them, desperation.

The succubus looked older. Not by years, but by mileage. Her light red skin shimmered faintly under the light, not glittery but *raw*, like an open wound healing over. Her horns curved back like polished obsidian, beautiful but scarred‚Äîone chipped at the base, like it had been cracked with a blunt instrument. Her chest was bound by a fraying bikini top that looked too tight, clearly not designed for comfort. Her lips moved slightly, whispering something I couldn‚Äôt hear.

The mermaid girl sat with her legs drawn up, feet tucked beneath her. Her blue-scaled skin looked drier than before, as though the air was hurting her. The edges of her gills twitched, struggling to take in oxygen, and her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her bikini top was damp in places, stained with something that didn‚Äôt look like water. There were red rings around her wrists, deeper than the others, like she'd struggled the most. Her silver eyes welled with tears that never fell.

And the fairy girl‚Ä¶

She sat straight-backed, as if posture was all she had left. Her legs were crossed at the ankles, but the chain dug into her skin, leaving little bloody half-moons. Her skin was paler than the others, almost translucent now, the veins beneath glowing faintly blue in the dark. Her eyes, glimmering like diamonds, glinted as they found mine. She looked at me the longest.

It wasn‚Äôt hunger. It was *recognition*. Like she knew who I was. Or had known someone like me once. And still, I didn‚Äôt move. A part of me *wanted* to. To leap from the car and scream at the men, alert law enforcement, rush in there with a tire iron like some kind of bargain-bin savior. But another part, deeper, colder, hesitated.

Because I *knew* things. I‚Äôd read the stories. The reports. The conspiracy threads.

Succubi don‚Äôt need consent. They drain you while you sleep. Medusas turn men to stone‚Äîsometimes only from the waist down. And mermaids? The old kind, the *real* kind? Much of mythology says they pulled sailors into the deep just to watch them drown. And lastly, not all fairies were benevolent.

These women could have lured dozens to their deaths. Maybe more. Could I really afford to take my chances? But if that was true, if these weren‚Äôt victims but predators..

Then who were *those men*?

I glanced back at the warehouse. No insignias. No badges. No containment gear. Just gloves and zip ties. Who do they work for anyway?

If they were from the SCP Foundation, or the Global Occult Coalition, or whatever black-budget monster-hunting agency the internet whispered about, why were they *here* of all places? Why a rotting warehouse off I-95 in the industrial epicenter of North Miami? Why not a deep-sea lab or some forest bunker where no one could see? It didn‚Äôt make sense. But it was more reason to believe that this wasn‚Äôt containment. It was commerce.

And I had a suspicion as to precisely what kind.

My hands moved before my conscience could catch up. I pulled out my phone, my heart was still pounding, and didn‚Äôt even bother opening Google. This wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd find on Yelp.

So, I downloaded Tor. Because whatever those girls were, they weren‚Äôt the only ones being sold. And I guarantee you I wouldn‚Äôt have found them anywhere else.

Within minutes, I was browsing the dark web and it wasn‚Äôt long before I discovered the classifieds. I wont go into detail of what else I came across, just know I found what I was looking for.

It surprisingly did not take too long. Within minutes I was browsing escorts on an exclusive dark web form. And I found women of various ‚Äòexotic‚Äô subspecies on a website not normally accessible on google. They had fairies, pixies, succubae, harpies, and even the bird-like sirens all available for ‚Äòrent‚Äô on their site. They have clients of all kinds, ranging from human to non-human.

Confirmed.

My only question was, if they were being trafficked from other dimensions or worlds, then it would stand to reason that some kind of government agency would be watching stuff like this. Getting curious, I decided to look up the instructions needed to ‚Äòbook‚Äô a session.

But before I could type a single letter, something happened.

A low mechanical whine filled the air outside my vehicle, coming from across the lot. I looked up from the phone to turn my gaze immediately upon the warehouse. I saw the door yawning open. Thick shadows peeled away as halogen lights spilled out from within. And there they were.

The girls. All four of them. Led out in single file, like livestock.

The two men from before‚Äîheavyset, pale-skinned, wearing nondescript utility jackets‚Äîushered them forward with quick, mechanical hand gestures. I could hear faint commands muffled through the air: ‚ÄúKeep your eyes down.‚Äù ‚ÄúMove.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo noise.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt need to threaten. The girls were already broken in.

Each of them was bound now. Not just zip ties around their wrists like before, but full restraints‚Äîankles shackled together with thick, black iron cuffs, arms trussed behind their backs with heavy leather belts. And this time‚Ä¶ each one had a **ball gag** strapped into their mouths, tightly enough that their cheeks bulged and their breathing rasped through their nostrils.

Their outfits‚Äîif you could even call them that‚Äîwere degraded even further. Small bikini tops stretched taut across their chests, barely covering anything. Short shorts clung to their hips like afterthoughts, riding high between their thighs. They weren‚Äôt costumes anymore. They were *uniforms*. Assigned. Dehumanizing.

The **gorgon woman** walked at the front. Her green skin shimmered slightly under the fluorescent light, and her snake-hair writhed weakly, like it had been sedated. Her eyes scanned the area as she walked, darting left and right in brief jerks. She looked for an escape route, maybe. I watched her gaze pass over the lot. And then, it hit my car. Her pupils sharpened. Locked. Our eyes met.

Behind her, the **succubus** shuffled forward, her crimson skin marked with bruises along her ribs. Her horns had been shaved down since I last saw her. Roughly. Unevenly. A punishment, maybe. Her tail twitched behind her like it was trying to hide.

The **mermaid girl** walked in stiff, halting steps, her webbed toes curled in shame. Her gills flared weakly with each shallow breath, irritated from the dry air. She winced with every step, like the asphalt burned her feet.

The fairy, or nymph-like girl was the last to be loaded. She was tiny‚Äîno taller than 4‚Äô11, but the way she moved, the way her body trembled with each step, she looked even smaller. Fragile. Breakable. Her translucent wings had been cruelly pinned‚Äîfolded tight against her back beneath a leather harness that pressed down hard, the wing joints visibly strained and twitching under the weight. Every few seconds, they fluttered instinctively, as if trying to open, only to be jerked back down by the restraint.

They were loaded into a large white truck again‚Äîsame model as before, only now without the subtlety. The rear doors were wide open, revealing a padded interior with low red lights, a bench lining either side, and steel rings bolted to the walls‚Äîanchor points

One by one, the girls were pushed up the small ramp and chained inside. The doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb.

I made a decision.

I threw my phone into the passenger seat and turned the key in the ignition. I didn‚Äôt care about the form anymore. I needed to *know* where they were going. I pulled out slowly, keeping three car lengths behind the truck as it rolled out of the warehouse lot and onto the main road. I killed my headlights.

The city was quiet at this hour, nothing but low neon glows and the occasional flicker of a crosswalk sign. The truck didn‚Äôt move fast. Like it had no fear of being followed.

It took me less than ten minutes to realize where they were going.

**The Strip is just outside the Miami International Airport.**

A ring of sleazy motels, gas stations, hourly-rate rooms, and concrete towers baking under yellow-orange streetlamps. I passed a billboard advertising ‚ÄúFantasy Island Spa‚Äù and another offering discounted ‚Äúcompanionship services.‚Äù Every building seemed to lean sideways with mildew and regret.

The truck pulled into the back lot of a one-story motel that didn‚Äôt even bother hiding its purpose. No signs. No lights. Just faded brick and boarded-up windows. The kind of place where you checked in through a thick glass slot and never asked for towels.

I parked again, this time behind a shuttered laundromat across the street. I watched the men open the back doors to the truck.

First came the **gorgon woman** again. Still at the front. Her feet dragged as they pulled her out by the arm. She tried to resist, but her shackled legs gave her no leverage. One of the men *shoved* her forward, and she fell hard onto the gravel, the gag making a wet, choking thud against her lips. She whimpered. A sound I could barely hear but *felt* in my teeth.

The snakes on her head twitched frantically, like they were trying to fight back. Two men got out of the vehicle and hoisted her up. She walked gingerly on two feet barely covered with sandals, the two men guiding her up the paved sidewalk.

The motel itself met every definition of ‚Äòseedy‚Äô you could think of. It was only one story, and the building itself couldn‚Äôt have had more than a dozen rooms carved into it. The overhead sign was gone, and the neon-lit vacancy light was only half lit. A single row of doors lit by flickering amber bulbs that hummed with bugs

The faded green paint peeling like sunburned skin and security bars warped from age or misuse. The overhead sign was gone, torn off or collapsed long ago. Only a skeletal frame remained, rusted through and straining against the wind. Beneath it, a busted neon *VACANCY* light glowed half-lit and stuttering, casting the letters *V-A-C-C-Y* across the parking lot like a joke no one was in on. The place looked like it was functional, but barely.

I saw them take the gorgon woman to one of the doors, I faintly made out the number 12 just above as the door opened and she was escorted inside. I looked back down at my phone, and reopened the Tor browser. My eyes went to the unnamed website where I found the escort services. I adjusted my location accordingly to Miami.

I waited a few minutes.

And then, I found her. It was the gorgon woman. I texted the number below. I waited a few more minutes before I got a response. The reply came in a green text bubble. Simple. Too simple.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

That was it. There was no name or greeting. Just a blunt set of instructions. It felt less like an invitation and more of a transaction.

I stared at the message for a while. My thumb hovered over the screen. A part of me kept waiting for a second reply. Or a clarification. Or maybe even a joke, but that was wishful thinking at this point. I wanted a reason not to go in there, and there were too many to list. I wanted to believe that the gorgon lady wanted to eat me, or turn me into stone. But I just couldn‚Äôt.

I glanced back across the street.

Room 12 was dark again, the window light had been clicked off. The only thing marking it from the other rooms was the faint, uneven scrawl of the number above the door, its paint chipping off.

The parking lot was still empty. No cars, pedestrians or other signs of life, except for a single curtain twitching in one of the rooms further down the row. I didn‚Äôt like that. Someone was watching. Or something was. I sat back in the seat and tried to breathe, but my lungs were tight.

This wasn‚Äôt curiosity anymore. Not really. It was something colder, heavier. Like I‚Äôd seen too much already, and now I wasn‚Äôt *allowed* to look away. No. I *couldn‚Äôt* look away.

I stared at the message again.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

I took a deep breath and exited my vehicle, making my way across the street and to the motel. I walked up to door number 12. I knocked twice. I technically was a brown belt in BJJ and had light striking skills with taekwondo, so in that department I had some kind of plan should someone want to get physical with me.

After a few minutes, the door slowly opened, and the gorgon woman looked up at me. I saw that she was covered in a silky smooth, see-through bathrobe. She tucked a few snakes behind her ear as she let off a meek, yet nervous smile.

‚ÄúPlease come in.‚Äù

I nodded as she took my hand and guided me into the room. Her hand was cold.

Her 5‚Äô2 frame he gently guided my 5‚Äô10 self to the bed. The snakes coiled behind her ear twitched once more as if whispering something I wasn‚Äôt meant to hear.

The door shut behind me with a soft click that sounded louder than it should have in the silence. The room was dimly lit, only by a bedside lamp with a cracked shade. The air was thick with a strange mix of scents: cheap rosewater, stale sweat, and perfume that had a rosy, yet pungent odor. It was inviting, yet it stung my nostrils.

There was no music, or TV. Only the sounds of her and my breathing filled the room.

She gently sat me down on the bed an stood over me. She then very slowly undid the sash, dropping it to the floor, letting the robe fall open. She was wearing a tight-fitting thong and a bra. It wasn‚Äôt long before I noticed the cuts, bruises and welts along her body. Her eyes were heavy.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

She forced a smile and nodded, then straddling me on the bed. She begun to ravish my neck, purring like a kitten.

‚ÄúSo strong. So handsome.‚Äù She giggled.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have sex.‚Äù

She then looked at me like I killed ten people. I then picked her up and gently laid her on the bed. She sat up to look at me as I sat down next to her.

‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ talk?‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúTalk?‚Äù

I nodded.

Her eyes went wide as she pressed her fingers to her temple. ‚ÄúT-talk? You w-want to-you want to talk?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúTo get to know you better.‚Äù

Her eyes widened as she just stared at me like I was the president of the United States.

‚ÄúNobody has ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.‚Äù she stammered, and then shook her head. ‚ÄúIm not allowed to answer questions.‚Äù

I then heard a pounding on the door.

‚ÄúAlina! You better not be telling anyone anything about us!‚Äù she heard someone scream.

‚ÄúOh no. He sounds drunk.‚Äù She raved, and then turned to me. ‚ÄúYou need to-‚Äù

The door slammed open and a tall man about my height came out.

‚ÄúYou! Outside! Me and the lady need to have a little talk.‚Äù

I glanced at the gorgon woman. Now the fresh tears were streaming down her face as she clutched the blanket from the bed to her chest.

I got up from the bed, frozen and I just stared at the man, my stupid neurodivergence not knowing what to do.

‚ÄúAre you deaf?! Leave now!‚Äù he then stormed over to me.

His breath hit my face, sour and hot, as he grabbed a fistful of my collar. My brain lagged for a split second, choking on the sudden pressure, the shouting, the chaos.

And then everything snapped into place. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI *reacted*. I went for a straight body lock and tackled him to the ground. I immediately got into position and executed a perfect heel hook

I dropped low, my arms wrapping around his midsection like coiled steel. A deep *body lock*. My hips turned, and I drove him backwards off his balance, tackling him hard onto the dirty motel floor with a hollow *THUMP* that shook the lampshade.

We hit the ground. He tried to scramble, but I was already repositioning.

I grabbed his leg‚Äîcontrolled the heel‚Äîdropped my weight sideways, and twisted. Fast. Brutal. A perfect heel hook. There was a pop. Then a scream. High-pitched, animal, involuntary.

He flailed, slamming his fists on the floor, howling in raw, guttural pain as his knee exploded under the torque. I moved over to his head and executed an anaconda choke around his neck. He was out cold in seconds.

I stood, chest heaving.

The gorgon woman was still on the bed, shaking, her snakes hissing low and defensive around her face like a living halo. But she was staring at me differently now, with widened eyes filled with awe and admiration.

‚ÄúYou-‚Äù she stuttered. ‚Äú-You fought for me.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess I did what anyone would do.‚Äù

She let off a slight smirk, looking up at me like a lost child who just found her mother. She let out a breath that was almost a laugh, and a small, trembling smile curled at her lips.

I turned to her, helping her off the floor. ‚ÄúAlina, we don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù

She took my hand slowly, like she was afraid she‚Äôd wake up if she moved too fast. Her fingers were cold and delicate, but they gripped mine like she didn‚Äôt want to let go, a light smirk playing on her lips.

I peaked out the door. I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Then I turned back to Alina.

‚ÄúCan you walk?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù She then winced. Her balance swayed as she stood, her hand slapping against the wall to steady herself.

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôre leaving. Right now.‚Äù

We stepped out into the heavy, damp night air. The parking lot was still empty‚Äîno headlights, no engines, no sign of the other traffickers. We both emerged from the room. But she was still wobbly, holding onto the doorframe for support. I turned back to her.

‚ÄúUgh. My head.‚Äù She said holding a hand to her head.

Without thinking, I moved back to her, and swept her up into my arms. She was lighter than I expected‚Äîlike she was made of silk and bone and smoke. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my neck, her face resting just under my chin. I felt her breath on my collarbone. Soft, yet Shaky. The snakes on her head curled quietly, docile now, like they too had calmed.

After a few steps, I felt her shift slightly in my arms.

‚ÄúYou smell like‚Ä¶ laundry detergent,‚Äù she murmured, voice barely audible.

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ that a bad thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ warm,‚Äù she said, slightly giggling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre warm.‚Äù

I glanced down. Her cheeks had gone faintly pink, and she was staring up at me, eyelids heavy. That little smile returned, slightly drowsy, but undeniably real. Something soft bloomed between us, buried beneath the fear and bruises and neon motel lights.

As we walked over to the car, she reached up with her hand to trace my jawline, her touch featherlight‚Äîlike she wasn‚Äôt sure I was solid. Her smile brightened, a flicker of something radiant breaking through the haze of everything she'd endured.

I opened the passenger door for her. She hesitated only a moment before slipping in, curling up against the seat like it was the first real rest she‚Äôd had in days. Maybe weeks. As I pulled away from the laundromat, the silence in the car felt different. Not empty. Just‚Ä¶ full of things we couldn‚Äôt say yet.

The cite rolled past in blurred halos of orange and blue. Traffic lights blinked on empty corners. Planes cut across the sky far overhead, heading to places that still felt like fiction to people like us. Every now and then, I could feel her eyes on me. Watching. Studying. Not in fear, but in curiosity. Like she was trying to memorize me. Each time I glanced over, she‚Äôd quickly look away, but not before I caught the edge of a smile playing on her lips.

Outside, the streets of Miami drifted by, quiet and gleaming with midnight sheen. But inside that car, something had changed. This wasn‚Äôt a rescue anymore. It wasn‚Äôt survival.

It was the start of something else.

Something far more nefarious than a local escort ring.

I pulled into the quiet suburban street just after 2:00 a.m. The neighborhood was still, with only the hum of distant sprinklers and the occasional wind chime from a neighbor‚Äôs porch disturbed the silence. The house sat near the end of the cul-de-sac. I always found some comfort in its symmetry allowing me a clear view of the whole circle.

I parked in the driveway, shut off the engine, and turned to Alina. She was asleep the whole ride, her head resting against the passenger window.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù I said flatly.

She got up and opened her eyes. Her snakes twitched softly under the dome light.

I got out and opened the passenger side door for her, offering my hand. She looked up at me tenderly, her snakes hissing quietly, sniffing my hand with their forked tongues. She reached up and took it with a smirk, fluttering her eyes up at me as she stumbled out of the vehicle and onto her feet.

She winced once when her bare foot touched the concrete, but she said nothing. Her arms clung to mine as they moved, probably still getting over the effects of the drugs. She gradually, however, regained her footing.

Inside, the house smelled faintly of lavender fragrances and books. The kind of place that held warmth in the walls and memories in the carpet. It was a typical suburban home.

‚ÄúMy dads in New York with his fianc√©e,‚Äù I explained, leading her down the hall. ‚ÄúAnd my mom‚Äôs in Texas visiting my aunt. I‚Äôm house-sitting. Keeping things in shape. Paying rent. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say a word as her eyes went all around the house, quietly taking in the framed photos, the soft lighting, the reality of it all. She looked like she didn‚Äôt know whether to cry or collapse. I stopped at the guest room door and opened it for her.

There was a clean queen-sized bed with folded gray blankets, a small desk, a reading lamp, and a single dresser. But compared to where she'd come from, it might as well have been heaven. She walked in slowly, running her fingers along the blanket, like she was scared it would disappear. Then she turned to me.

""Martin?"" she said softly.

I tilted my head from the doorway. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you‚Ä¶ stay with me?‚Äù Her voice cracked just slightly. ‚ÄúJust for tonight. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be alone.‚Äù

I hesitated for a beat. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to‚Äîbut because of the way she looked up at me. From her 5'2 height, tilted her chin, her golden-green eyes wide and shimmering under the soft hallway light. Her snakes curled slightly inward, almost bashful, like they were reflecting her nervousness

I rubbed the back of my neck. ‚ÄúOh-Ok.‚Äù

She smiled, an actual, genuine smile, gleaming pearly whites. The tension in her shoulders dropped. She climbed onto the bed slowly, curling up near the pillows but leaving space beside her.

I slowly sauntered over and sat down at the edge of the bed, unsure of what to do. I felt awkward, towering beside her, my 5'11 frame making the bed dip slightly. But she didn‚Äôt seem to mind. If anything, she scooted closer.

‚ÄúAre you gonna lie down?‚Äù she pouted, looking up at me with longing eyes.

I nodded, then slowly rested next to her. She immediately snuggled up next to me and buried her face in my neck, wrapping her arm around my torso. She curled gently into my side. I could feel her smiling and giggling

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre warm.‚Äù she purred.

I looked down at her, and then really noticed how delicate, yet beautiful she looked under the lamplight. Bruised, but strong. Shaken, but resilient. And‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ she was gorgeous.

I just reached over and pulled the blanket up around us both and killed the light. Her breathing slowed. Her snakes finally went still.

I laid back with her, letting the silence wrap around us like another layer of warmth.

And just before sleep pulled her under, she murmured, almost inaudibly:

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù I half smiled.

And in the dark, with her hand on my chest and her cheek against his shoulder, she finally closed her eyes. I did too.

That was probably the best sleep I have had in a while.",1,1756340852.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Image gallery of the machine, included parts: https://imgur.com/a/jb6O52A

Includes videos of the standard pump action as well as the dimmer mod, and steam action.
More images and videos are available upon request.

It comes installed with:

* PID (Pre-2018 Kit from Shades of Coffee)
* DIY dimmer switch mod for flow control
* Rancilio Silvia (V1/V2) Steam Wand
* Slim drip tray and long vent tube (from Shades of Coffee)
* Stainless steel dispersion plate (from Shades of Coffee)
* IMS Precision shower screen GA200IM
* Cafelat silicone gasket 8.5mm (blue)
* Insulated boiler using a high heat silicone mat (https://a.co/d/9q27Iu7), self cut DIY project

The OPV has been adjusted for 9 bars of pressure at the group head.

Note that all mods performed are 100% reversible to stock, with the exception of the Rancilio steam wand replacement but only because I had to destroy the original steam wand to get the locking nut. If you buy a new Gaggia steam wand, the wand can be swapped back. I am selling the machine as is in its modded state.

History:

* I purchased this locally used in March 2021 in great condition.
* Model and date of manufacturing is not clear as part of the identifying sticker has been torn off and I only have the serial number left as reference. But it's definitely a pre-2009 model (maybe late 90's?), using the hex-key adjustable OPV (not springs).
* Maintained with regular water backflushes, Cafiza backflushes every couple weeks, and boiler descaled twice a year using the Durgol special descaler.
* Only ever used custom brew water. 60ppm hardness from magnesium, and 20-90ppm buffer with sodium bicarbonate depending on what I was brewing.
* Freshly descaled and backflushed with Cafiza before I removed it from my countertop and into storage (ready to sell).

Additional accessories and parts that will come with it:

From left to right, top to bottom. https://imgur.com/kinmeaD

* 10 piece upgraded service kit -gaskets & o-rings (https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/parts-and-accessories/gaggia-classic---10-piece-upgraded-service-kit--gaskets-o-rings). Purchased this as part of an order but I have not used any of the parts yet, just have them around as backup.
* Metal backflush disc
* DIY pressure gauge and adapter. You can screw this on the threads of the Gaggia spouted portafilter to have your own at-the-group pressure gauge. This is what I used to calibrate the OPV to 9 bars at the group head.
* Random unmarked metal tamper that came with the machine. Appears to be 58mm.
* Brass dispersion plate, six hole variant
* Original shower screen, group head, and rubber gasket.
* Stock portafilter basket, and the stock pod compatible basket
* Original Drip tray and vent tube
* Spare parts from the Shades of Coffee PID kit.
* Rancilio steam wand securing nut (have to use the original nut that comes with the GC to fit the Rancilio want)
* Original Gaggia spouted portafilter with shot splitter.
* Gaggia bottomless portafilter, purchased from Whole Latte Love
* One full container of Durgol special descaler
* Upon sale, I will also send the Shades of Coffee PID kit installation instruction manual (PDF).",2,1756340250.0,coffeeswap,1,1.0,False
1n1xpuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1n1xpuh/help/,HELP,"So I work at a really weird restaurant/cafe that opened a couple of years ago. My manager who I have worked 2 jobs with in 4 years put in his 2 week notice. The weird thing about this place is I am the lead barista but there is no one else there that works for the cafe so I am really just in charge of myself. I just began learning how to roast beans and will now be the ONLY PERSON who can do it for the restaurant, and the people we sell coffee too. The problem is I don't know when/if there will be someone hired in to replace him, or if they will promote someone I work with. The chances of me being promoted are slim because I am not 21 and they have strong feelings towards that, but truthfully no one else knows what they are doing. I can kind of make latte are, I know most of the different types of drinks (Although I am terrible at Cappuccinos) and I am trying to learn more about the coffee roasting process, but now that my manager is leaving, and I may be taking on extra tasks (without a raise or promotion I will assume). No one put effort into the cafe part of the business so all of my training has come from the internet and I am DESPERATE to know the proper way of running a cafe and being a barista.

1n1xpfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n1xpfe/the_spare_room/,The Spare Room,"Four years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure. When I was younger, I drank more alcohol than water. I learned that selfishness hurt me more than anyone else ever could. Over time, I slowed down, not because I wanted to, but because partying in your thirties with college kids, as Freddy put it, ‚Äújust isn't a good look‚Äù The yacht parties my dad kept throwing didn‚Äôt help either. Honestly, I wish I had a gambling addiction instead. At least then there was a chance of winning something. All I got was loss of time, health, and any humanity I thought I had left.

My liver was so damaged that there was no chance it could heal on its own. Apparently, my eyes were so yellow it looked like I ‚Äúused pee as eye drops,‚Äù as Freddy joked. I was losing weight rapidly too. I was immensely relieved when I found out my dad had signed me up for Hemacare‚Äôs¬†*Life Vault*¬†package when I was a toddler. All they needed was a blood sample. It‚Äôs supposedly far superior to other organ-printing hospitals, but also significantly more expensive. I guess second chances are only for those who can afford them.

My doctor explained that while traditional transplants always carry a risk of rejection, Hemacare‚Äôs printed organs supposedly have a 100% success rate. They also promise the healthiest possible version of each organ. I called in for a transplant and was scheduled immediately.

When I arrived, a few weeks later, the facility felt more like a luxury hotel than a hospital, aside from the ever-present sterile smell in the stagnate air. The waiting room was quiet and cozy. I waited only a few minutes before a young asian girl entered. She had short black hair and wore high-end designer clothing. She dropped into the chair like she was visiting a friend‚Äôs house. She kept rubbing her left eye, which was covered by a surgical eyepatch. I kept some distance between us in case whatever she had was contagious. Eventually a nurse approached me.

‚ÄúHello, welcome to Hemacare. May I have your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam Jones.‚Äù Of course, this is an alias. Given the nature of this event, sharing my real name would be‚Ä¶ unwise.

‚ÄúAll right, Mr. Jones. You‚Äôre on the¬†*Life Vault*¬†plan. Please follow me so we can get you changed into your hospital gown.‚Äù

The click of her heels echoed through the empty hall with each step, with the awkward silence I couldn't help but admire the polished dark wood floor and the walls painted a warm tan. The sterile scent only grew stronger as we walked. The nurse led me to a small changing room. I swapped my expensive, rumpled suit I'd slept in for a few days, for a surprisingly soft gown. The gown didn't come with slippers, leaving my bare feet to press against the cold floor, each step felt like walking on ice.

When I looked into the mirror it was hard to recognize myself. My eyes were piss yellow, my face and stomach thin. My hair that I‚Äôd kept clean and short was greasy and disheveled. I hardly had the energy to get out of bed most days, forget showering and shaving. I was hopeful that this surgery would give me the motivation I needed to get my life back.

‚ÄúWould you like us to have this cleaned for you?‚Äù, she held it out with both hands as if the suit was radioactive.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. I couldn't blame her. It was filthy, and I‚Äôd been too exhausted to change.

‚ÄúOf course. Please follow me to your room.‚Äù She sealed the suit in a clear garment bag and led the way.

Halfway down the hall, we were stopped at an intersection by two male nurses pulling a cart carrying a large red container about the size of a coffin. The shorter of the two men paused for a moment to look at his clipboard. As he scanned the page, a soft thud came from the container. He looked fearfully at the other nurse, who swiftly grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it down the hallway, walking as fast as he could without running. The shorter nurse scrambled to follow him, throwing a nervous glance at me.¬†

I gazed down the hall they had come from and noticed a door labeled¬†*Spare Room*. It was the only one with a badge scanner. I could see a red light glowing from under the door. Curiosity tugged at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in there?‚Äù I asked.¬†

The nurse looked briefly toward the door, clearly shaken by what just transpired. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laughed nervously, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the spare room. We store emergency equipment and replacement supplies there. Now, please follow me, we've almost reached your room.‚Äù¬†

As we walked, I couldn't stop thinking about that room. I glanced back, the red light was gone, but my interest wasn't.

When we reached my room, I noticed it had the same ID scanner as the spare room door from earlier. The nurse swiped the card hanging from her neck, and the door clicked open. When I entered the room, I was genuinely surprised. I‚Äôve stayed in hotel rooms far less luxurious than this. The bed was all white, the room dimly lit and stylishly modern. Gray leather couches, a dark marble coffee table, a door to my own restroom, a huge flat-screen TV, and even a sleek mini-fridge humming quietly in the corner.

‚ÄúThis is where you‚Äôll stay while you‚Äôre being treated. The duration depends on how your body responds. You‚Äôre free to leave the building, but we¬†*strongly*¬†recommend you don‚Äôt, especially before and after the surgery. Please make yourself at home. I‚Äôll go call your surgeon.‚Äù

Naturally, I checked the fridge first. It was stocked with soft foods; applesauce, pudding, protein shakes, and an assortment of jelly. I took a cherry jelly cup and a plastic spoon, sat on the couch, and took my first bite of real food in days. You know you're at rock bottom when jelly is the most nutritious thing you've eaten in a week.

The translucent jelly glowed an unnatural red under the warmth of the overhead light . It brought back the memory of the light seeping from beneath the spare room door. I decided to go take a look around the hospital but when I made my way over to the door and turned the handle, it didn't budge, it was locked.

A short while later, a man in a white coat knocked and entered, leaving the door open.

‚ÄúGood evening, Mr. Jones. I'm Dr. Mathew Ross, and I‚Äôll be performing your surgery. But first I need to explain your situation. Your body shows clear signs of Decompensated cirrhosis, but luckily there‚Äôs still plenty of time to prepare. Your new liver will be ready soon. Until then, please do not eat anything for the next eight hours to avoid complications. Your surgery is scheduled for 10:00 PM. Also, please don‚Äôt leave the room. We‚Äôll need to be able to reach you in case of an emergency. Do you have any questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why is my door locked?‚Äù

Dr. Ross pulled a keycard from his coat pocket. ‚ÄúThis is my access card, it gives staff access to any door within their clearance level. We keep certain doors locked to prevent patients from wandering while undergoing treatment. Surgery can be stressful, and sometimes patients get disoriented and start walking around. Our building is huge, full of winding halls and identical rooms. If someone has a medical emergency and they're not in the right room, we might not be able to reach them in time. Of course, you‚Äôre free to use the restroom that is attached to your room, and you can leave the facility at any time. Just let us know so someone can escort you safely. Any other questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that makes sense. Actually, I do have another one‚Ä¶ Where exactly does the liver come from? And why is it supposed to be better than the organs from other hospitals?‚Äù I didn't actually care for the answers, I just needed a distraction.

‚ÄúThe liver is actually grown from your own blood. When you were a child, your parents enrolled you in our plan. Unlike most hospitals that freeze blood and grow organs only when needed in a womb-like environment, we grow all vital organs immediately after receiving the sample. Maintaining them is extremely expensive, but there are benefits: your body accepts the organ as if it‚Äôs always been there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by accepting? Does the body try to refuse organs?‚Äô I asked while slowly walking over to the empty jelly cup.

The doctor paused, ‚ÄúYes, traditional organ transplant rejections are fairly common. The immune system doesn't recognize the organ and attacks it. Ours don‚Äôt have that risk, which is what sets us apart from other organ printing companies.

‚ÄúBut if they can freeze blood why don't you guys just freeze organs too? That way you can thaw them when needed‚Äù, I took the jelly cup‚Äôs aluminum seal off the table.

The surgeon smiled and said, ‚ÄúThat is a great idea, blood cells frozen for many years could lead to DNA damage, so other companies run that risk. To reduce this risk, they split the blood into multiple vials since it doesn't take much blood to start the organ growing process. However, organs are much larger, and a lot more complex. Freezing and thawing will almost always result in the organ being damaged severely. Preserving it in a false body apparatus keeps the organ growing and healthy without the need of freezing.‚Äù

I was still a bit confused but I think I got the gist ‚ÄúYeah, Yeah I guess that makes sense, one last thing if you don't mind, while i was in the bathroom the faucet wasn't working, could you please take a look at it‚Äù

The doctor hesitated. ‚ÄúUh, sure‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not exactly handy. If there‚Äôs a problem, I‚Äôll call for assistance.‚Äù He set his clipboard on the table and walked into the restroom. The moment he left my view, I moved quickly and quietly to the door, stuffing the aluminum cover into the slot where the door lock would go into. ‚ÄúIt seems to be working fine‚Äù I quickly went back to where I was standing, Dr Ross's voice becoming louder as he left the bathroom ‚Äúif you have any more issues with the faucet, just press on the remote near your bedside and a nurse will be with you right away‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you so much, I really appreciate your help Dr Ross‚Äù I tried for a polite smile but it came off as condescending. His own smile faltered a bit ‚ÄúYou're very welcome, I‚Äôm glad I could help. I‚Äôll get everything ready for the procedure. Please, enjoy your stay.‚Äù

He left, and I was alone again.

Bored of endless scrolling through streaming services, I sat in silence, waiting for the coast to clear. Eventually, I decided it was safe to leave. I had to know what the source of that red light was, and what made that noise from inside the container.¬†

I got up and turned the door handle slowly, careful to not make noise. The hallways were just as empty as before, but without the nurse's rhythmic steps. I wandered through the repeating hallways, the only indication that I wasn't going in circles were the room number signs. While I was walking around trying to find the red room, a nurse walking backwards with an empty cart bumped into me. They were the nurses from before, I instantly noticed his ID card clipped onto his pants pocket, I could barely make out the name ‚ÄòReginald‚Äô.

¬†‚ÄúOh! I‚Äôm so sorry...‚Äù He paused, his eyes fixed on my face, like he couldn‚Äôt quite understand what he was seeing.

It felt like he was scanning every inch of me. The taller nurse gave him a sharp nudge with the cart and let out a cough. The short nurse blinked in succession, then forced a smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, sir. Please return to your room and wait for your treatment.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôm not much to look at. I'm stricken with jaundice, skinny and sick, but you‚Äôd think a nurse would be used to it. The short nurse whispered something to the tall one, who nodded and took the cart while the other walked off in the direction they‚Äôd come from.

Curious, I followed him, keeping my distance. He kept glancing over his shoulder, failing at being inconspicuous. He picked up his pace. After a final turn, he reached the¬†*Spare Room*, pulled out a keycard, scanned it, then entered a code into the keypad. He slipped inside.

Going in with him would be risky, so I thought if I hid and waited I could try to steal his badge discreetly. So I hid behind a corner watching the door and waiting. Only a few moments later the red light returned and immediately after the nurse walked out, sighing a breath of relief, but quickly looked up. A jolt of panic hit me‚Äîhad he seen me? I desperately looked for a hiding place so I crouched behind a large plant in an alcove. I was surprised that I was small enough to fit.¬†

His footsteps were quick, they drew closer, growing louder until they suddenly slowed. I held my breath, praying he didn't notice me. His footsteps stopped entirely, but after a¬† few moments he muttered ‚Äòget it together, man‚Äô. Then his footsteps continued, completely unaware that I was there. I knew that if I was¬† found, they'd tighten up security. Then I'd have no chance of knowing what was in that room. And I'd be mortified that I'd been found crouching half naked behind a plant like a lunatic.¬†

After a minute of silence, I sprinted to the door. Miraculously, the nurse left his card in the scanner, I looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was around, and reached for the door handle, but the closer my hand got to the metal handle, the colder the air around my fingers became, I hesitated for a moment, doubts crawling down my body like spiders, but curiosity pushed through, and I gently open the door.¬†

The room was very dark and freezing, each breath let out visible fog. It was mostly empty except for a blue-lit screen glowing softly on a podium in the center. Above me, rows upon rows of large glass chambers hung like meat hooks in a butcher shop.

I approached the screen. It asked for a patient's name or ID. I entered my name.

**Result found.**

I selected my profile.¬†**Name:**¬†Adam Jones¬†**Age:**¬†35¬†**Sex:**¬†Male

more data such as blood type, medical history, etc were listed. On the right side of the screen was a large green button:¬†**SPARE**. I immediately pressed it.

A second profile appeared:¬†**Spare ‚Äì 7370617265**¬†**Age:**¬†33¬†**Organs Available:**¬†All green-listed, except one:¬†**Liver ‚Äì Unavailable**.

I felt something churn deep inside

Then I saw another button:¬†**Retrieve**\-in bright yellow.

And I, of course, pressed it.

The glass chambers overhead started moving on tracks, clanking and shifting until one hovered above the center platform. Beneath it, a circular platform lit up white the chamber slowly descended, like a claw-machine lowering a fragile prize.

When the glass chambers stopped, I looked closely into it. A pair of white eyes stared back at me.

I froze. Terror became a dark oozing liquid, clinging to me. The figure had long brown hair, and wore a breathing mask with a tube covering most of his face. Wires coiled around his muscular frame suspended in fluid, curled in a fetal position.

Its gaze followed me no matter where I moved. Not alert, just instinctive. Infantile.

Whoever this was, I had to help him.

I pounded on the glass. Nothing. It was stronger than I expected. There had to be a way to open it.

‚ÄúHey, can you understand me?‚Äù I asked the man desperately, but he stayed silent. I stared at him hoping that he would show some sort of awareness, but the longer I looked the more familiar he became.

The hair color, the eyes, the face shape. I noticed two small moles on the man's curled hands. I quickly turned my wrist to look for my own two moles. For a moment I could not even fathom it. It was me.

I jerked my head back to the terminal. The yellow button was now red:¬†**Drain and Extract**.

Before I could press it, I heard voices approaching. I ducked into a shadowed corner.

The two nurses stormed in, wheeling in the cart along with them, with the large red container from before.

‚ÄúYou idiot! How do you forget to pull your ID from the scanner?‚Äù the tall one hissed.

‚ÄúI know, I know! But it was that guy‚Äôs fault‚Ä¶ he got into my head, when I left the room I swear I thought I saw him again at the end of the hallway so quickly I ran to catch him but no one was there-‚Äù

The two froze when their eyes locked onto the tank.

‚ÄúYou forgot to PUT BACK THE SPARE?‚Äù

‚ÄúI¬†*did*! I swear! Th-there must‚Äôve been ah-a glitch or something!‚Äù I couldn't tell if he was stuttering from the cold or from anxiety.

The tall nurse crossed his arms and took a deep breath, ‚ÄúYou forgot your keycard and blamed it on a hallucination, then you didn't return the spare, and you expect me to believe there was a glitch?‚Äù, he finished, nearly shouting.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶¬† I know how this looks, but please don‚Äôt tell K-Karla. She‚Äôll kill me. I swear this won‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù, he said pleadingly.

The tall one's anger dissipated, melting into sympathy. ‚ÄúFine. The system automatically tells her when spares are retrieved but not by whom, I‚Äôll say I retrieved the spare three times, I'll make up a dumb reason. But¬†*you*¬†tell her about bumping into the patient and the keycard.‚Äù

The short nurse nodded rapidly, eyes full of tears. The tall man pressed a button, returning the man in the chamber to its place.

The tall man sighed ‚Äúalright, which one is next‚Äù, he said, his breath turning to fog in the freezing room.

The shorter nurse wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and pulled out a clipboard from the cart

The short nurse cleared his throat ‚Äúuhh, Tammy Warren, ID number is 6579650d0a, female, 24, severe eye damage‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother one? There have been so many eye replacements recently, is there disease or something to worry about?‚Äù the tall man spoke as he typed on the screen, ‚ÄúIt looks like one eye is already unavailable, is the patient sick?‚Äù

The capsules moved again, ‚ÄúNo, I looked into it, almost 90% of the eyes we remove from patients have the same strange residue on them. It's caused by this new hallucinogenic on the market, ‚Äòeye candy‚Äô. Apparently, because new organs are more accessible than ever, people have started experimenting with it. It causes extremely vivid hallucinations but almost always destroys the eyes. The worst part is, the people who get a transplant after wrecking their vision almost always relapse. But unlike necessary organs, eyes don't need to be put into the spares to acclimate.""¬†

He finished speaking when a new capsule lowered. It contained a young asian girl, her hair black and shiny, swirling around her like a cocoon. The taller man shook his head, ‚ÄúThose damn junkies, you'd think having a second chance would stop them from self destruction, what if something happened to the meat fridges, has the thought never crossed their minds? They're taking their organs for granted.‚Äù he spat.

After a few moments of silent scribbling on the clipboard the taller nurse spoke again, ‚ÄúAlright get the cart ready, I'll drain and extract.‚Äù He tapped on the screen again, this time the whole room lit up deep red, like a photographer's dark room.

My stomach dropped.¬†*They'll see me.*

The chamber drained of liquid, the girl descended slowly until her frail naked body met the floor. She laid there, motionless, as the chamber glass slid to the side, granting access to their ‚Äòmeat fridge‚Äô. The short nurse gave a button at the side of the cart a long press, lowering it until the top reached his ankle.

¬†‚ÄúAright,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike usual, I'll get the hands and you get the legs,‚Äù the taller man ordered. The shorter man stretched his back and bent down to pick up the girl‚Äôs legs and dropped them, ‚ÄúDamn.. sorry, She's slippery.‚Äù The taller man took a deep, steadying breath and patiently held onto her arms, used to his partner's incompetence. The shorter nurse grabbed a towel from the cart and wiped her legs dry. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, he muttered again. The two men slowly picked her up and placed her gently into the red container.

There wasn‚Äôt even the faintest trace of resistance in the girl, she was more corpse than human. Just looking at her turned my stomach. I had to get out of there, and fast.¬†

The tall man walked back over to the computer and pressed the screen again. ""Alright, which room?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoom 411‚Äù, the short nurse said, as the empty chamber ascended back into the rafters. The two nurses left, pulling the cart behind them.

The silence in the room was palpable. I rushed over to the screen and pulled up my clone‚Äôs profile one last time. My index finger quickly moved to the right side, but I hovered there, shaking, above the¬†**Retrieve**¬†button.

¬†They‚Äôd know it was retrieved a 4th time. Why risk it? What if I needed another organ like Tammy?

Yeah, I know how bad that sounds. I mean, I could get another organ grown, but what if it's my heart and they couldn't grow it fast enough, or what if my body rejects it?

I slowly looked up at the capsules, listening for even the slightest murmur for help, but the room was a silent graveyard. I could see faint eyes watching me from all around. A few had one eye. Even fewer had both.

These weren‚Äôt real people, I told myself. They were¬†*storage*. If I opened the capsules, they‚Äôd probably just collapse helplessly too.

I held my hand reluctantly over the ‚Äòx‚Äô icon and closed my eyes‚Ä¶ and pressed down.

Maybe someone else will help them. Walking out of that room, I‚Äôd convinced myself I couldn‚Äôt, that I wouldn't even know how. Now, 4 years later, I know that that was bullshit. I even knew it then, but I still walked away. I‚Äôm hoping that by writing this, and telling the world, that someone will see this and do what I couldn't. I couldn't help then, and I can‚Äôt help now. I can‚Äôt go back. I can‚Äôt face those lifeless eyes that I left behind.

1n1xm9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n1xm9r/the_spare_room/,The Spare Room,"Four years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure. When I was younger, I drank more alcohol than water. I learned that selfishness hurt me more than anyone else ever could. Over time, I slowed down, not because I wanted to, but because partying in your thirties with college kids, as Freddy put it, ‚Äújust isn't a good look‚Äù The yacht parties my dad kept throwing didn‚Äôt help either. Honestly, I wish I had a gambling addiction instead. At least then there was a chance of winning something. All I got was loss of time, health, and any humanity I thought I had left.

My liver was so damaged that there was no chance it could heal on its own. Apparently, my eyes were so yellow it looked like I ‚Äúused pee as eye drops,‚Äù as Freddy joked. I was losing weight rapidly too. I was immensely relieved when I found out my dad had signed me up for Hemacare‚Äôs¬†*Life Vault*¬†package when I was a toddler. All they needed was a blood sample. It‚Äôs supposedly far superior to other organ-printing hospitals, but also significantly more expensive. I guess second chances are only for those who can afford them.

My doctor explained that while traditional transplants always carry a risk of rejection, Hemacare‚Äôs printed organs supposedly have a 100% success rate. They also promise the healthiest possible version of each organ. I called in for a transplant and was scheduled immediately.

When I arrived, a few weeks later, the facility felt more like a luxury hotel than a hospital, aside from the ever-present sterile smell in the stagnate air. The waiting room was quiet and cozy. I waited only a few minutes before a young asian girl entered. She had short black hair and wore high-end designer clothing. She dropped into the chair like she was visiting a friend‚Äôs house. She kept rubbing her left eye, which was covered by a surgical eyepatch. I kept some distance between us in case whatever she had was contagious. Eventually a nurse approached me.

‚ÄúHello, welcome to Hemacare. May I have your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam Jones.‚Äù Of course, this is an alias. Given the nature of this event, sharing my real name would be‚Ä¶ unwise.

‚ÄúAll right, Mr. Jones. You‚Äôre on the¬†*Life Vault*¬†plan. Please follow me so we can get you changed into your hospital gown.‚Äù

The click of her heels echoed through the empty hall with each step, with the awkward silence I couldn't help but admire the polished dark wood floor and the walls painted a warm tan. The sterile scent only grew stronger as we walked. The nurse led me to a small changing room. I swapped my expensive, rumpled suit I'd slept in for a few days, for a surprisingly soft gown. The gown didn't come with slippers, leaving my bare feet to press against the cold floor, each step felt like walking on ice.

When I looked into the mirror it was hard to recognize myself. My eyes were piss yellow, my face and stomach thin. My hair that I‚Äôd kept clean and short was greasy and disheveled. I hardly had the energy to get out of bed most days, forget showering and shaving. I was hopeful that this surgery would give me the motivation I needed to get my life back.

‚ÄúWould you like us to have this cleaned for you?‚Äù, she held it out with both hands as if the suit was radioactive.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. I couldn't blame her. It was filthy, and I‚Äôd been too exhausted to change.

‚ÄúOf course. Please follow me to your room.‚Äù She sealed the suit in a clear garment bag and led the way.

Halfway down the hall, we were stopped at an intersection by two male nurses pulling a cart carrying a large red container about the size of a coffin. The shorter of the two men paused for a moment to look at his clipboard. As he scanned the page, a soft thud came from the container. He looked fearfully at the other nurse, who swiftly grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it down the hallway, walking as fast as he could without running. The shorter nurse scrambled to follow him, throwing a nervous glance at me.¬†

I gazed down the hall they had come from and noticed a door labeled¬†*Spare Room*. It was the only one with a badge scanner. I could see a red light glowing from under the door. Curiosity tugged at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in there?‚Äù I asked.¬†

The nurse looked briefly toward the door, clearly shaken by what just transpired. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laughed nervously, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the spare room. We store emergency equipment and replacement supplies there. Now, please follow me, we've almost reached your room.‚Äù¬†

As we walked, I couldn't stop thinking about that room. I glanced back, the red light was gone, but my interest wasn't.

When we reached my room, I noticed it had the same ID scanner as the spare room door from earlier. The nurse swiped the card hanging from her neck, and the door clicked open. When I entered the room, I was genuinely surprised. I‚Äôve stayed in hotel rooms far less luxurious than this. The bed was all white, the room dimly lit and stylishly modern. Gray leather couches, a dark marble coffee table, a door to my own restroom, a huge flat-screen TV, and even a sleek mini-fridge humming quietly in the corner.

‚ÄúThis is where you‚Äôll stay while you‚Äôre being treated. The duration depends on how your body responds. You‚Äôre free to leave the building, but we¬†*strongly*¬†recommend you don‚Äôt, especially before and after the surgery. Please make yourself at home. I‚Äôll go call your surgeon.‚Äù

Naturally, I checked the fridge first. It was stocked with soft foods; applesauce, pudding, protein shakes, and an assortment of jelly. I took a cherry jelly cup and a plastic spoon, sat on the couch, and took my first bite of real food in days. You know you're at rock bottom when jelly is the most nutritious thing you've eaten in a week.

The translucent jelly glowed an unnatural red under the warmth of the overhead light . It brought back the memory of the light seeping from beneath the spare room door. I decided to go take a look around the hospital but when I made my way over to the door and turned the handle, it didn't budge, it was locked.

A short while later, a man in a white coat knocked and entered, leaving the door open.

‚ÄúGood evening, Mr. Jones. I'm Dr. Mathew Ross, and I‚Äôll be performing your surgery. But first I need to explain your situation. Your body shows clear signs of Decompensated cirrhosis, but luckily there‚Äôs still plenty of time to prepare. Your new liver will be ready soon. Until then, please do not eat anything for the next eight hours to avoid complications. Your surgery is scheduled for 10:00 PM. Also, please don‚Äôt leave the room. We‚Äôll need to be able to reach you in case of an emergency. Do you have any questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why is my door locked?‚Äù

Dr. Ross pulled a keycard from his coat pocket. ‚ÄúThis is my access card, it gives staff access to any door within their clearance level. We keep certain doors locked to prevent patients from wandering while undergoing treatment. Surgery can be stressful, and sometimes patients get disoriented and start walking around. Our building is huge, full of winding halls and identical rooms. If someone has a medical emergency and they're not in the right room, we might not be able to reach them in time. Of course, you‚Äôre free to use the restroom that is attached to your room, and you can leave the facility at any time. Just let us know so someone can escort you safely. Any other questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that makes sense. Actually, I do have another one‚Ä¶ Where exactly does the liver come from? And why is it supposed to be better than the organs from other hospitals?‚Äù I didn't actually care for the answers, I just needed a distraction.

‚ÄúThe liver is actually grown from your own blood. When you were a child, your parents enrolled you in our plan. Unlike most hospitals that freeze blood and grow organs only when needed in a womb-like environment, we grow all vital organs immediately after receiving the sample. Maintaining them is extremely expensive, but there are benefits: your body accepts the organ as if it‚Äôs always been there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by accepting? Does the body try to refuse organs?‚Äô I asked while slowly walking over to the empty jelly cup.

The doctor paused, ‚ÄúYes, traditional organ transplant rejections are fairly common. The immune system doesn't recognize the organ and attacks it. Ours don‚Äôt have that risk, which is what sets us apart from other organ printing companies.

‚ÄúBut if they can freeze blood why don't you guys just freeze organs too? That way you can thaw them when needed‚Äù, I took the jelly cup‚Äôs aluminum seal off the table.

The surgeon smiled and said, ‚ÄúThat is a great idea, blood cells frozen for many years could lead to DNA damage, so other companies run that risk. To reduce this risk, they split the blood into multiple vials since it doesn't take much blood to start the organ growing process. However, organs are much larger, and a lot more complex. Freezing and thawing will almost always result in the organ being damaged severely. Preserving it in a false body apparatus keeps the organ growing and healthy without the need of freezing.‚Äù

I was still a bit confused but I think I got the gist ‚ÄúYeah, Yeah I guess that makes sense, one last thing if you don't mind, while i was in the bathroom the faucet wasn't working, could you please take a look at it‚Äù

The doctor hesitated. ‚ÄúUh, sure‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not exactly handy. If there‚Äôs a problem, I‚Äôll call for assistance.‚Äù He set his clipboard on the table and walked into the restroom. The moment he left my view, I moved quickly and quietly to the door, stuffing the aluminum cover into the slot where the door lock would go into. ‚ÄúIt seems to be working fine‚Äù I quickly went back to where I was standing, Dr Ross's voice becoming louder as he left the bathroom ‚Äúif you have any more issues with the faucet, just press on the remote near your bedside and a nurse will be with you right away‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you so much, I really appreciate your help Dr Ross‚Äù I tried for a polite smile but it came off as condescending. His own smile faltered a bit ‚ÄúYou're very welcome, I‚Äôm glad I could help. I‚Äôll get everything ready for the procedure. Please, enjoy your stay.‚Äù

He left, and I was alone again.

Bored of endless scrolling through streaming services, I sat in silence, waiting for the coast to clear. Eventually, I decided it was safe to leave. I had to know what the source of that red light was, and what made that noise from inside the container.¬†

I got up and turned the door handle slowly, careful to not make noise. The hallways were just as empty as before, but without the nurse's rhythmic steps. I wandered through the repeating hallways, the only indication that I wasn't going in circles were the room number signs. While I was walking around trying to find the red room, a nurse walking backwards with an empty cart bumped into me. They were the nurses from before, I instantly noticed his ID card clipped onto his pants pocket, I could barely make out the name ‚ÄòReginald‚Äô.

¬†‚ÄúOh! I‚Äôm so sorry...‚Äù He paused, his eyes fixed on my face, like he couldn‚Äôt quite understand what he was seeing.

It felt like he was scanning every inch of me. The taller nurse gave him a sharp nudge with the cart and let out a cough. The short nurse blinked in succession, then forced a smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, sir. Please return to your room and wait for your treatment.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôm not much to look at. I'm stricken with jaundice, skinny and sick, but you‚Äôd think a nurse would be used to it. The short nurse whispered something to the tall one, who nodded and took the cart while the other walked off in the direction they‚Äôd come from.

Curious, I followed him, keeping my distance. He kept glancing over his shoulder, failing at being inconspicuous. He picked up his pace. After a final turn, he reached the¬†*Spare Room*, pulled out a keycard, scanned it, then entered a code into the keypad. He slipped inside.

Going in with him would be risky, so I thought if I hid and waited I could try to steal his badge discreetly. So I hid behind a corner watching the door and waiting. Only a few moments later the red light returned and immediately after the nurse walked out, sighing a breath of relief, but quickly looked up. A jolt of panic hit me‚Äîhad he seen me? I desperately looked for a hiding place so I crouched behind a large plant in an alcove. I was surprised that I was small enough to fit.¬†

His footsteps were quick, they drew closer, growing louder until they suddenly slowed. I held my breath, praying he didn't notice me. His footsteps stopped entirely, but after a¬† few moments he muttered ‚Äòget it together, man‚Äô. Then his footsteps continued, completely unaware that I was there. I knew that if I was¬† found, they'd tighten up security. Then I'd have no chance of knowing what was in that room. And I'd be mortified that I'd been found crouching half naked behind a plant like a lunatic.¬†

After a minute of silence, I sprinted to the door. Miraculously, the nurse left his card in the scanner, I looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was around, and reached for the door handle, but the closer my hand got to the metal handle, the colder the air around my fingers became, I hesitated for a moment, doubts crawling down my body like spiders, but curiosity pushed through, and I gently open the door.¬†

The room was very dark and freezing, each breath let out visible fog. It was mostly empty except for a blue-lit screen glowing softly on a podium in the center. Above me, rows upon rows of large glass chambers hung like meat hooks in a butcher shop.

I approached the screen. It asked for a patient's name or ID. I entered my name.

**Result found.**

I selected my profile.¬†**Name:**¬†Adam Jones¬†**Age:**¬†35¬†**Sex:**¬†Male

more data such as blood type, medical history, etc. were listed. On the right side of the screen was a large green button:¬†**SPARE**. I immediately pressed it.

A second profile appeared:¬†**Spare ‚Äì 7370617265**¬†**Age:**¬†33¬†**Organs Available:**¬†All green-listed, except one:¬†**Liver ‚Äì Unavailable**.

I felt something churn deep inside

Then I saw another button:¬†**Retrieve**\-in bright yellow.

And I, of course, pressed it.

The glass chambers overhead started moving on tracks, clanking and shifting until one hovered above the center platform. Beneath it, a circular platform lit up white the chamber slowly descended, like a claw-machine lowering a fragile prize.

When the glass chambers stopped, I looked closely into it. A pair of white eyes stared back at me.

I froze. Terror became a dark oozing liquid, clinging to me. The figure had long brown hair, and wore a breathing mask with a tube covering most of his face. Wires coiled around his muscular frame suspended in fluid, curled in a fetal position.

Its gaze followed me no matter where I moved. Not alert, just instinctive. Infantile.

Whoever this was, I had to help him.

I pounded on the glass. Nothing. It was stronger than I expected. There had to be a way to open it.

‚ÄúHey, can you understand me?‚Äù I asked the man desperately, but he stayed silent. I stared at him hoping that he would show some sort of awareness, but the longer I looked the more familiar he became.

The hair color, the eyes, the face shape. I noticed two small moles on the man's curled hands. I quickly turned my wrist to look for my own two moles. For a moment I could not even fathom it. It was me.

I jerked my head back to the terminal. The yellow button was now red:¬†**Drain and Extract**.

Before I could press it, I heard voices approaching. I ducked into a shadowed corner.

The two nurses stormed in, wheeling in the cart along with them, with the large red container from before.

‚ÄúYou idiot! How do you forget to pull your ID from the scanner?‚Äù the tall one hissed.

‚ÄúI know, I know! But it was that guy‚Äôs fault‚Ä¶ he got into my head, when I left the room I swear I thought I saw him again at the end of the hallway so quickly I ran to catch him but no one was there-‚Äù

The two froze when their eyes locked onto the tank.

‚ÄúYou forgot to PUT BACK THE SPARE?‚Äù

‚ÄúI¬†*did*! I swear! Th-there must‚Äôve been ah-a glitch or something!‚Äù I couldn't tell if he was stuttering from the cold or from anxiety.

The tall nurse crossed his arms and took a deep breath, ‚ÄúYou forgot your keycard and blamed it on a hallucination, then you didn't return the spare, and you expect me to believe there was a glitch?‚Äù, he finished, nearly shouting.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶¬† I know how this looks, but please don‚Äôt tell K-Karla. She‚Äôll kill me. I swear this won‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù, he said pleadingly.

The tall one's anger dissipated, melting into sympathy. ‚ÄúFine. The system automatically tells her when spares are retrieved but not by whom, I‚Äôll say I retrieved the spare three times, I'll make up a dumb reason. But¬†*you*¬†tell her about bumping into the patient and the keycard.‚Äù

The short nurse nodded rapidly, eyes full of tears. The tall man pressed a button, returning the man in the chamber to its place.

The tall man sighed ‚Äúalright, which one is next‚Äù, he said, his breath turning to fog in the freezing room.

The shorter nurse wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and pulled out a clipboard from the cart

The short nurse cleared his throat ‚Äúuhh, Tammy Warren, ID number is 6579650d0a, female, 24, severe eye damage‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother one? There have been so many eye replacements recently, is there disease or something to worry about?‚Äù the tall man spoke as he typed on the screen, ‚ÄúIt looks like one eye is already unavailable, is the patient sick?‚Äù

The shorter man stretched his back and bent down to pick up the girl‚Äôs legs and dropped them, ‚ÄúDamn.. sorry, She's slippery.‚Äù The taller man took a deep, steadying breath and patiently held onto her arms, used to his partner's incompetence. The shorter nurse grabbed a towel from the cart and wiped her legs dry. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, he muttered again. The two men slowly picked her up and placed her gently into the red container.

There wasn‚Äôt even the faintest trace of resistance in the girl, she was more corpse than human. Just looking at her turned my stomach. I had to get out of there, and fast.¬†

I'm an extrovert and I kinda have a lose mouth and S figured that out. I don't know what she saw in me but she decided to tell me her deep secret (which even her roommates don't know). I don't know why she trusted me. I've told her I will keep it a secret and guard it with life.
Later she was also telling me about the resources in the college and how I should be using it judicially. She really did her homework before coming here and was kind enough to give me advices on how to proceed. 
She even asked me to find a place in the town for a cup of coffeeü•πü•π
We really had a good talk and after reaching our apartments, we decided to take a break, have a snack and meet after 15 minutes.
I texted her after 15 minutes but S told me she's tired so we called the plan off.
The very next day we had another orientation in college. I saw her there with her friends, we exchanged Greetings and she told that she'll talk to me later. I told her let us catch up after the orientation and she said okay. After orientation she was going ahead with her friends i followed her to a coffee shop. I was right behind her but she ignored me and went with her friends. (- Auraüò≠)
I texted her later the evening that can we meet for a walk but she told she's busy. That reply felt as if she's ignoring me. Idk what to do now. ü´†
Should I try talking to her again soon in person. Why would she tell me a secret and suddenly avoid me. Why would she give me advices? Please help, am I overthinking? ",0,1756339877.0,AskIndianWomen,0,0.5,False

Chapter 1

As my husband and I were returning to pay respects at my parents' grave, I ran into Clara Vance, who had cared for me for many years.

Wiping her tears, Clara asked if I had seen Mr. Sinclair after coming back. She said he had been waiting alone at that house for me to return.

She was referring to my uncle, who had looked after me after my parents passed. He had also been my secret lover.

For eight years, we maintained a relationship that was both tender and secretive.

It wasn‚Äôt until the day of my university graduation that he sent me a message saying he couldn‚Äôt bear pretending anymore.

That evening, at a gathering, I shyly kissed the corner of his lips in front of everyone.

But the next moment, he harshly pulled me away and said, ‚ÄúIs this how I taught you about propriety and respect? Go back to your own house.‚Äù

The guests' gazes felt like they could pierce me.

They stared at me like I was some kind of spectacle, standing there humiliated.

In a moment of pure devastation, I fled the hall, leaving the home I had lived in for eight years that very night.

""Has he really been waiting there all this time?""

I laughed softly, pulling my husband closer.

‚ÄúClara, I‚Äôm not going back. I‚Äôm married now, and it would be inappropriate to stay in someone else‚Äôs house.""

When I returned to the country, I did so quietly, not telling a soul.

So when Clara saw me, she dropped the basket she was holding in surprise.

I stood frozen for a moment, my heart pounding painfully, unable to speak for a long while.

Then Clara rushed to me, tears streaming down her face, and scolded me for being heartless.

‚ÄúYou troublemaker, where on earth have you been all these years?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just left without a word, not even bothering to contact me. I thought I would never see you again before I die!‚Äù

I laughed through my tears, using me sleeve to wipe her tears.

She finally calmed down, patted my head, and then asked, ‚ÄúHow have you been all these years?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen Mr. Sinclair since you returned? He‚Äôs been waiting alone in that house for you all this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúClara is getting old, I don‚Äôt know what happened between you two, but you were together for so many years, surely nothing is beyond repair?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can see that he‚Äôs been thinking of you these years, often staring at your photos, lost in thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou used to like him so much, maybe when you return this time‚Äî‚Äù

My smile faded as I interrupted, ‚ÄúClara, that‚Äôs all in the past. I don‚Äôt like William Sinclair anymore.‚Äù

Saying his name, once filled with tender affection, now felt completely calm.

It was as if my years of infatuation had never existed.

Clara raised an eyebrow, looking at me with a puzzled expression.

I knew she didn‚Äôt believe me.

After all, no one had known better than her how much I had liked William.

Back then, she would laugh and pat my back, telling me to be more reserved as a young woman.

But I believed that life was too short, and love was something one had to seize for oneself.

So, despite the rumors, I had passionately followed William‚Äôs shadow from the age of eighteen to twenty-three.

I had always believed he liked me too, especially since he was so indulgent and gentle with me.

But that illusion was shattered the year I graduated.

That afternoon, William handed me a paper bag.

I thought it was a gift for me, as he liked to surprise me.

But when I opened it, I found several boxes of anti-inflammatory medicine.

William ruffled my hair, his voice warm as he said,

‚ÄúLetty, please give these to your roommate Lily Harper.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat. Without thinking, I asked, ‚ÄúWhen did you meet my roommate?‚Äù

He paused for a moment, then frowned slightly as he looked at me.

‚ÄúLetty, she was the one who took you to the hospital when you were sick at school.‚Äù

I relaxed, but there was still a lingering sense of unease.

I knew Lily had taken me to the hospital, and I had sent her a thank-you gift afterward.

But this had happened a month ago.

That meant that during this entire month, William had been in contact with Lily behind my back.

The thought made my heart turn sour.

‚ÄúWilliam, it‚Äôs just some medicine. Was there something so special about it?‚Äù

He seemed to understand what I meant and chuckled, pinching my cheek.

‚ÄúLetty, what‚Äôs going on in your head? I‚Äôm just thanking her for helping take care of you.‚Äù

I scoffed and, refusing to let it go, stomped on his foot hard.

He let out a dramatic groan, and I couldn't help but laugh as he pulled me into a tight hug.

The closeness was a bit too much for our relationship, but at the same time, it felt almost too distant compared to what I secretly longed for.

I fell silent for a while, until his sigh broke the quiet.

‚ÄúLetty, you‚Äôve grown up. Stop being so impulsive all the time.‚Äù

He paused, then added, ‚ÄúTry learning from Lily. She‚Äôs more reserved and composed.‚Äù

I froze, staring at him in disbelief.

Feelings of hurt and helplessness flooded me.

But William didn‚Äôt notice.

He just repeated his reminder for me to remember to give Lily the books.

Chapter 2

After that day, I fell into a deep slump that lasted for a long time.

I couldn‚Äôt forget the look on Lily's face when I handed her the books‚Äîthat mix of shyness and smugness in her smile.

I couldn‚Äôt forget William‚Äôs words, telling me to learn more from Lily.

But to him, these were probably just my usual little tantrums.

No matter what, I would still become the same Scarlett Caldwell, the one whose heart and eyes were full of him.

It wasn‚Äôt until my birthday that I was still feeling down, lacking the usual joy.

William sighed, meeting my tearful gaze.

‚ÄúLetty, please don‚Äôt make a scene, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your birthday today, and I remember you said last year that you wanted me to make you a cake.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe only person in this world who could make me go into the kitchen to learn how to bake is you.‚Äù

Those words, spoken with such unique affection, successfully made me smile in surprise.

I couldn‚Äôt help but want to hold onto his arm.

But William quickly raised a finger to my forehead, his face filled with restraint.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre grown up. Stop acting like a child.‚Äù

I lowered my head, feeling a pang of disappointment.

William reached up, gently patting my head.

I instinctively leaned in and nuzzled his hand twice.

But my nose betrayed me, and I felt tears welling up.

I could clearly feel his affection for me,

but he would never take a step closer, not even an inch.

I tugged at his sleeve, trying to say a few playful words,

but just then, a friend called out, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù

I turned my head, and to my dismay, there she was.

Lily Harper, wearing a waitress uniform, was bowing repeatedly, apologizing.

A large chunk of what was supposed to be a cake was splattered on the floor.

Her eyes were red, and she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I slipped and lost my balance.‚Äù

My friend turned to me, ‚ÄúLetty, it‚Äôs your birthday. What should we do about this?‚Äù

Before I could respond, Lily looked at me like I was her only hope.

‚ÄúLetty, I‚Äôm really sorry, it‚Äôs my fault, but could you not report me to my supervisor? I‚Äôm still in my probation period...‚Äù

I stood there, staring at the ruined cake on the floor, my eyes also turning red.

That was the cake William had made for me with his own hands!

‚ÄúLily, are you out of your mind? If you‚Äôre clumsy, then don‚Äôt take jobs that require precision!‚Äù

Her face flushed bright red.

‚ÄúLetty, I‚Äôm sorry! I... I can compensate you...‚Äù

I felt my heart ache, and tears started to fall.

‚ÄúLily, can you really afford to compensate me? Do you know how much I was looking forward to this cake?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough, Letty!‚Äù

William suddenly stepped in, placing himself between Lily and me.

He grabbed my trembling wrist, his voice low and firm.

‚ÄúLetty, calm down.‚Äù

The anger that had filled my head immediately felt like ice water was poured over me.

I stared at him in disbelief.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre defending her?‚Äù

William furrowed his brows.

‚ÄúLet it go, Letty. She didn‚Äôt mean to. Don‚Äôt take it out on her.‚Äù

I choked on my words. ‚ÄúShe ruined my cake! You know how much I was looking forward to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWilliam, you can‚Äôt treat me like this.‚Äù

Behind us, Lily suddenly spoke up,

‚ÄúMr. Sinclair, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll pay for it, but please don‚Äôt argue with Letty on my behalf.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll work an extra shift next month to make up for it.‚Äù

An indescribable feeling of frustration and helplessness rushed through me.

Hearing Lily‚Äôs pitiful voice made it worse.

‚Äú Stop pretending like it‚Äôs not your problem!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou messed up, and now you‚Äôre acting like the victim? Disgusting!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough, Letty. I‚Äôve never taught you to act like this, with no regard for others.‚Äù

William scolded me coldly.

He turned to Lily,

‚ÄúYou can leave now. This doesn‚Äôt concern you anymore.‚Äù

After Lily left, William tried to say something,

but I wiped my tears and pushed him away.

‚ÄúYou disgust me!‚Äù

I silently endured a cold war with him for what felt like a long time,

but surprisingly, it was the closest we‚Äôd been to a typical uncle-niece relationship during this period.

I felt somewhat disoriented, a little lost.

Then one day, Clara handed me a small red box, smiling.

‚ÄúThis is from Mr. Sinclair. He insisted I give it to you.‚Äù

I looked at the square red box, my throat tight with nervousness.

When I opened it, there it was‚Äîa ring.

I looked at Clara with tearful eyes.

Clara gently patted my head.

‚ÄúI told you, Mr. Sinclair definitely likes you. He just wanted to give you enough time to think it over.‚Äù

I stared at the shiny silver ring, and suddenly, I longed to see William.

I wanted to hold him and tell him,

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been afraid of what others say. The only thing I fear is that you won‚Äôt listen to what I have to say.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt see William.

Instead, I saw Lily at his company.

Chapter 3

She was holding the lucky pouch I had given to William the day I confessed to him on my coming-of-age. She was about to throw it in the trash.

My heart clenched and I rushed over to snatch the pouch from her hand.

With one hand holding the pouch, the other gripped the ring tightly.

I wanted to say something, but all I could do was stand there, frozen, unable to utter a word.

A wave of weariness and confusion overwhelmed me like never before.

William walked out of his office and exchanged a few words with Lily, telling her to leave. Then he bent down, looked at me, and smiled.

‚ÄúDid you get the gift I sent you?‚Äù

I nodded silently and opened my hand.

The joy I had once felt when seeing this ring was completely gone, replaced by a deep emptiness.

William didn‚Äôt notice. He placed his hand gently over mine, his eyes soft with tenderness.

I withdraw my hand away and, with a calm tone, asked him,

‚ÄúWhy is Lily Harper here? Why does she have the lucky pouch?‚Äù

I opened my left hand, revealing the pouch now stained with dark coffee liquid.

William frowned as he examined the pouch, then walked to the side and made a phone call.

‚ÄúTerminate Lily‚Äôs internship contract.‚Äù

After hanging up, he turned back to me and explained seriously,

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how the pouch ended up in her hands.‚Äù

I gave a bitter smile,

‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd keep it close to you, but it got ruined by Lily, and you didn‚Äôt even know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt like her, yet you let her intern at your company.‚Äù

Tears slowly streamed down my face, numb to the pain.

For the first time, I looked at William with a cold yet hollow gaze and asked,

‚ÄúWilliam, do you really like me?‚Äù

William‚Äôs brows furrowed deeply, almost painfully.

He pursed his lips and looked at me without saying a word.

It was always like this.

He never responded to my feelings, never rejected me.

It was like my love was just a one-sided performance.

I wiped my tears and let out a soft, sarcastic laugh.

Then I pulled his hand and placed the ring in his palm, turning to leave.

William reached out, trying to stop me,

But the moment his fingers touched my hand, they froze in midair.

I closed my eyes, turned around, and entered the elevator.

The ring reappeared in my room the next day.

I stared at the box for a long time, then hid it in the bottom drawer of my desk.

Just like my relationship with William,

It was forever kept out of sight.

I began to reflect on my feelings for William.

He had probably noticed how often he would look at me, wanting to speak, but always holding back.

He‚Äôd often reach out, almost instinctively, to hold me.

I learned to imitate his behavior, pushing him away, rejecting him.

I watched his eyes become more forlorn,

But no matter how much I saw it, my heart tightened with longing.

I still loved him desperately, but I felt like I no longer had the strength to keep fighting for it.

So I stayed in place, waiting for the day my love would be slowly worn away.

But then, on the day of the graduation party, I received a message from William.

‚ÄúLetty, let‚Äôs make it official. I‚Äôm waiting for you.‚Äù

My hand shook as I held the phone,

I ran to my room, crying and laughing at the same time, as I put the ring back on.

I wore my best dress from the closet and went to find William.

He looked genuinely surprised, his eyes shining as he gazed at me.

When the dance ended, I smiled at him, and he smiled back.

Taking a deep breath, I mustered the courage to stand on tiptoe and kiss the corner of his lips.

His lips were just as soft as I had imagined.

But before I could feel any more of that longing, a sharp force shoved me roughly.

I stumbled and fell hard to the floor.

Then came the angry roar of William, ‚ÄúScarlett, what are you doing?‚Äù

I looked up at him, my mind blank.

He wiped the corner of his lips, his gaze filled with subtle panic and shame.

The eyes of everyone in the banquet hall burned into me, like spotlights.

I heard people whispering that I had no shame,

Others murmured about how a child without proper upbringing lacked proper manners.

I curled up on the floor, feeling utterly humiliated, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from clutching William‚Äôs pant leg.

‚ÄúWilliam, wasn‚Äôt this your idea to go public?‚Äù

‚ÄúScarlett!‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this how I taught you about propriety and respect? Look at you now!‚Äù

‚ÄúGo home, now!‚Äù

My hand hung limply on the floor as I stared blankly at William‚Äôs cold expression.

Behind him, Lily waved at me with a smug smile.

I suddenly understood. Stumbling to my feet, I staggered toward her and softly asked,

‚ÄúWas it you who set me up?‚Äù

Her face was full of fear as she quietly muttered, ‚ÄúMr. Sinclair.‚Äù

I laughed bitterly, grabbed her hair, and slapped her hard.

She screamed,

But I ignored her, slapped her again.

Before long, a stronger slap landed across my face.

I stood frozen, my cheek burning with pain.

The pain was so sharp, the tears I had been holding back suddenly spilled uncontrollably.

William‚Äôs voice was strained,

‚ÄúScarlett, you‚Äôve gone too far.‚Äù

He turned and, pulling the weeping Lily along, walked away.

I watched them leave, my eyes unfocused, as their figures disappeared from view.

William never once looked back at me.

At fifteen, he had taken me away from my parents‚Äô funeral, ignoring the whispers of others.

At twenty-three, he left me to drown in other people‚Äôs gossip.

I numbly removed the ring from my finger.

The sound of metal clinking against the floor was sharp and clear.

But nothing was louder than the sound of my suitcase dragging through the dark night.

That night, I moved out of the Sinclair estate.

I left, and that was the last time.

Eight years had passed.

Now, Clara told me that William had been waiting at that house for me all this time.

We all know this show has things that happen or are said repeatedly in episodes, and probably enough to make a card or two. So what would you have on a little house bingo card?

Examples:

* Charles takes off his shirt
* ""More Coffee""
* There's a fire
* ""Oh manly""
* A infant dies
* ""For Land's Sake""
* Hester Sue sings
* ""MorPHEEN""
* EJ Andre guest stars

The only guardrails I'll add is: must be something that is said in at least 2-3 episodes (more is better), and must be short in length. I'll also stop taking suggestions on 9/4 (so a week from today, 8/27).

I'll take the best ones and/or most upvoted and make a bingo card (or two if we have enough replies!). Then when the show resets on plutotv/roku/cozi we can all play to see who wins first :D",3,1756339522.0,littlehouseonprairie,14,1.0,False

On February 9, 1964 the evening The Beatles made their legendary Ed Sullivan debut John Sebastian met Zal Yanovsky for the first time at Cass Elliott‚Äôs house. Soon after, the two played alongside Cass and Denny Doherty in a short-lived folk-rock group called The Mugwumps (yep, the same Cass and Denny who would later form The Mamas & The Papas).

When The Mugwumps dissolved, Sebastian and Yanovsky decided to form their own Beatles-inspired band, bringing in Steve Boone and Joe Butler. Sebastian named the group *The Lovin‚Äô Spoonful,* borrowing it from a line in Mississippi John Hurt‚Äôs *‚ÄúCoffee Blues.‚Äù*

Now they needed a breakthrough song. Sebastian had already written *‚ÄúDo You Believe in Magic,‚Äù* a breezy ode to the joy of music itself. They cut a demo, landed a deal with a brand-new label called Kama Sutra Records, and released it as their debut single.

By October 1965, *‚ÄúDo You Believe in Magic‚Äù* had climbed into the Top 10 sitting right alongside The Beatles‚Äô *‚ÄúYesterday.‚Äù*

Pretty fitting that a band born the same night The Beatles hit America would score their first hit just a year later. Do you think *‚ÄúDo You Believe in Magic‚Äù* is the ultimate ‚Äô60s feel-good anthem?",1,1756339281.0,SongMeaningsTop40,0,1.0,False

Worse? I didn‚Äôt notice. I was screen-sharing my slides, happily talking for a good five minutes while my entire team (including my boss and the new intern) got a front-row seat to my boxer parade.

It feels karmic in a good way. I feel like I know him my whole life. I‚Äôve seen him. I don‚Äôt know what to think. But God, I trust you and I know that this is greater than me. I just want to thank you for this experience, and at least I have something to laugh about. Laugh about the way I fell in love with my soulmate. I met him, and then I realized that I can‚Äôt have him. Sometimes, things are just like that. In life, maybe we just get a glimpse of a universe that exists, but it‚Äôs not the one you‚Äôre living in. Or sometimes, you just need to figure out how to get the things you want. But why does love have to be like a puzzle when my feelings are so clear?

This is for you. These are things I wish I could tell you. I want to give you a hug. A hug that makes your mind relax and bring you peace. That‚Äôs what I want to be for you. I don‚Äôt hate you. I don‚Äôt want anything bad for you. Thank you, I found the motivation to finish my master‚Äôs degree, and maybe that‚Äôs all that you had to be for me. At least.

I should have left well enough alone and just did better in school all together. It wasn‚Äôt like I didn‚Äôt like it here, I just think if I applied myself I could have done better.



There was a story about a friend of my fathers. He constantly regurgitated the story, telling us how driving away from your worst nightmare will drive you straight into it‚Äôs arms. His army buddy had served in a blood war before he joined. He would tell my father horrific stories, who then told us. But one particularly of a younger man who was only following out orders. The details aren‚Äôt very clear. The grotesque image of melting flesh and flame, in the name of some silly cause was burned into that poor mans eyes, his mind. Every day after that, the moment replayed constantly in his vacant moments of free time. But even that didn‚Äôt cut it. It followed him back to the states, to his bedroom, in the dark and soon even the back of his eye lids. An unescapable nightmare.¬†



His poor dumb luck, he was diagnosed with stage three brain cancer, a large tumor sitting comfortably in his brain. When they finally removed it, it messed a few things with his vision, and soon his immune system got a hold of his eyes. Taking them from him. Now all he ever saw was the dark, and all there was to see in the dark was that poor boy, burning alive and melting to the floor.¬†



I try very hard not to let anything haunt me like that, for fear of being stuck with it forever. I took my own father‚Äôs words very literally a lot of the time. Thinking as the son I am, I must obey every command. I would have made a decent enough warrior, only I can‚Äôt run for shit.¬†



Well into my twenties, I lived in a one bedroom cabin on the edge of a cattle ranch. I didn‚Äôt necessarily work there, but I was called upon a lot. I had never experienced heat, as I did in those summers in a rural town in New Mexico. It wasn‚Äôt quite all desert, but not all trees either. The ranch sat at the bottom of the Florida Mountains, which was fine and dandy in the morning but a scolding hot bitch in the setting hours.¬†



Sometimes I helped round of cattle when fences would bust, and then therefore fix the damn fence. Help transport cattle, clean horses, pick up all kinds of shit, run errands. A lot of the times I just watched. Especially at night. When coyotes saw the land as a plate of meat. At night, and nights when there wasn‚Äôt a moon, when you‚Äôve been up all day and part of the night before, your mind can start to place tricks on you. That came with the job. But even before that I didn‚Äôt have the best sleeping habits. I‚Äôm not sure what it was. My eyes never really felt heavy enough to stay asleep. I‚Äôd find myself sitting up in bed already at different hours of the night. Sometimes it was damn near impossible to go back to sleep. So I figured to get ahead on certain chores, to get them out of the way if this be the case.¬†



On nights when the moon was out, the tall yuccas standing far enough from me would start to look like another man. Watching me. At first it might make your stomach hurt and your heart heavy. Until you realize there isn‚Äôt anyone else here but you and the cows.¬†



The owner of the ranch didn‚Äôt like his life, it seemed. After a days work he‚Äôd head off down the road. Now let me explain something to you. The town was already small, but it was a collective of ranchers and farmers. People who lived almost 20 minutes out of town. Because of this, the solution was to make an even smaller town in between ranches and main town. Basic things of course, a small farmers market with fresh eggs and milk and small essentials like that. So there wasn‚Äôt such a long back and forth in case you ran out of toilet paper. A bar is essential too I suppose. There wasn‚Äôt any certainty whether my boss had family or not, I doubt it. If he did I didn‚Äôt think he would leave them all alone at night when he went drinking.¬†



I took a break from digging out the post hole. The post hole diggers I had fabricated were maybe a bit much. Throbbing came from my shoulders and the mid section of my back. But it beat working out in the mid day sun.¬†



The moon was barely peaking above the mountains, sure as shit not enough light to see. In the field, the head lamp I worse was the only light out there. I was too far away from my cabin or even the main house on the property. I was running on almost 30 hours of no sleep. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone in a good while, because whatever sleep I did mange was during the day.



The cows enjoyed rubbing their backs on the rust metaling piping, causing it to bend and erode after time. It was time for a new fence anyways. I had squared them well enough away and started digging three feet deep holes. I was only on my second hole.¬†



It wasn‚Äôt unnatural to hear rustling in the yuccas or the weeds around me. Mice and rabbits played their part in this neck of the desert. Any noise that came from anywhere didn‚Äôt usually startle me. At this point my head lamp died, my eyes squinted to get adjusted to the now sudden darkness. I though to myself, this is probably how dad‚Äôs friend felt. One day all the lights went out and never came back on. I thought this was as good of a time as any to refill my jug of water and get some new batteries. When I stepped into the cabin, the slight cooler air hit me and I was washed over with a wave of sleepiness. I couldn‚Äôt fit it, nor did I want to, so I fell asleep.¬†



A knock thumped at my door, waking me up from the deep sleep I thought I was in. In a half asleep mind I got up to answer it. The sun was blinding, feeling like it was cutting through my eyes. ‚ÄúHey, George‚Ä¶ I promise I was going to-‚Ä¶‚Äù I stopped. Yet no one was there. A yawn escaped from me as I searched for George‚Äôs pick up. Only there weren‚Äôt any tire tracks either. Everything felt undisturbed.¬†



I closed the door and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. I though now was a good time to get up anyways. Putting some coffee on, I checked my phone of any missed calls. None, as usual. That was the longest I had gone without sleeping, clocking in at around 32 hours, no naps, no dozing off, nothing. There‚Äôs nothing I can ever say that explains why this happens.



Well into my later teen years, I had seen over fifteen specialists, all claiming at first I needed a better diet and to get some exercise to naturally tire my body out. The next solution was taking drugs and my mother wouldn‚Äôt have me do that. I guess I didn‚Äôt even want to sleep that badly.¬†



When I came here to New Mexico, I somewhat felt at home. The solace between the mountains and the land had it‚Äôs own calming effect. No one to bother me out here and yet I still made money.¬†



Off in the distance I finally saw George‚Äôs pick up pull into the property. It was well after lunch when I saw him in a different change of clothes.



When I did finish my lunch, my phone rang.¬†



‚ÄúHello?‚Äù



‚ÄúHey bud, I was checking to see if -‚Äú



‚ÄúOh right, sorry, I did intend to fill the holes. My head lamp died and I finally felt tired.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow long did you go this time?‚Äù He asked. George was twenty years my senior, I think he worried sometimes I would one day pass out in the field and no one would know.



I sighed rubbing my eyes. The mid day light was starting to feel a bit much for my eyes, even through the windows of the cabin. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ maybe thirty sum hours, I can‚Äôt be for sure. But uh listen I just finished lunch and I am about to head out there to finish the poles‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúYeeep okay sounds like a deal. I just called to make sure so I can keep the girls on this side of the house.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah good idea.‚Äù



‚ÄúBalright I will catch ya later.‚Äù And he hung up.¬†



I grabbed a hold of my welding jacket and set off back outside. After a while the dirt beneath my shoes started to feel like hot fumes. Underneath me it was a mix of hard rocks with powder like sand. Every step I took would kick up a cloud.¬†



Before the sun went to set down, I had finished the corner lot. Waiting for the concrete to set before welding the finished H braces. My eyes started to burn, from the heat, from the floating particles of dirt, anything and all was bothersome. In the distance by the property line, stood a dark silhouette in amidst of mesquite bushes and yuccas.¬†



With the inside of my shirt I rubbed my eyes, only to realize it was a deformed yucca. Growing in a shape I hadn‚Äôt seen before. It made my stomach hurt looking at it, the place it decided to grow was not among the rest of the yucca. All the other yucca bushes grew on the other side of the property, it just seemed unnatural.¬†



My ears were ringing with a faint buzz, the blood rushing through my head as sweat was dripping down my face, down my back. It was clear I wasn‚Äôt from here, I was just an outsider who couldn‚Äôt sleep and I think my mind was starting to play tricks on me.¬†



The horse stables were clean, the horses had their brushings, chickens were locked up in their coup, pigs were fed for the night. I had finished what I had set out to do for the day. When I was walking back to my cabin, I noticed George‚Äôs truck was gone again. Any longer, I would start to wonder who was running this joint.¬†



He seemed like he was gone a lot. I didn‚Äôt leave the property very often so it wasn‚Äôt like I saw him anywhere else. I didn‚Äôt really go out to drink, I enjoy drinking in the comfort of my own home, knowing if I were to fall down drunk on my floor I would be safe enough to do so.¬†



Needless to say after work, the beers were going down good. Each one felt like a refreshing taste of what should have been water. More and more I felt that warm buzz grow inside me. I sat comfortable on the little porch I had, watching the sun go down, seeing the cows migrate back and from in their temporary lot, and hearing the soothing coos of the desert.¬†



I had woken up with the sun gone and still outside on the porch. A little disgruntled I managed to get my drunk ass off my chair and stand up, though it wasn‚Äôt very steady. As I was trying to make my way inside, I heard what I thought was a truck door closing. My head turned to the darkness, my eyes not yet adjusted.¬†



‚ÄúGeorge?‚Äù I called out, thinking I‚Äôd see his figure come out of the shadows.¬†



Nothing, no response, no movement. I stood there swaying from side to side as I tried to get a better look at who was in the dark.¬†



A rustling of bushes moved around in the darkness, my eyes couldn‚Äôt focus any faster before I saw what looked like a yucca running full force into my direction. Without hesitation I turned around and I headed inside, locking my door and blocking it with my body. I was pushed with a deep thud as whatever it was on the other side was eager to come in. There was no way of knowing what it‚Äôs intentions were.



With my back against the door I started to laugh, oh I see what is happening here. I am having one of those silly dreams, being so sleep deprived it‚Äôs almost like a fever dream. Knowing my door was locked, I wobbled to my bedroom, still hearing the banging on the other side of the door.¬†



I crawled into bed and that‚Äôs it.¬†

I woke up the next morning with a crazy hangover and a weird soreness on my back. It feels very much like a dream, or a weird nightmare. Now that the sun is up, I can‚Äôt find any evidence of it not being a dream.

1n1x8es,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1n1x8es/6_months_no_wine_the_benefits_are_real/,6 months no wine! The benefits are real,"6 months ago I was sitting in a waiting room waiting for my name to be called for a license. I was in so much pain feeling swollen and hungover. I don't know how it happened but I had an ""AHA"" moment. I told myself that I don't want to live like this anymore and only one person can make this change. It was weird. It went from loving my wine to viewing it as the enemy of my happiness. I used to think to myself that I cannot go to bed without drinking. Every night since I was 20, I would drink until I passed out. I was drinking 2-3 bottles of wine on average. 37 now and needed to change.

Before I stopped drinking, I would lurk through the sub and get motivated through other peoples gains when they stopped drinking. Here are some of mine:

1. Weight loss. I've always been on the skinnier side but with the amount of drinking I achieved, I looked like a pear with skinny legs. My belly was so swollen that someone at work said I was ""showing"". I lost almost 35 lbs just by cutting out booze. I have a 6 pack now and I can't explain how.

2. Gut issues gone. Chunky coffee bowel movements have transformed into a product I'm proud of! Finally I don't have the urge to shit myself after the first bite of food. I'm not busting ass every 5 minutes either. 

3. My health. Blood pressure is normal. I work in health care and I was scaring myself with my heart rate and high BP. I would explain to patients what to do if they have chest pain while I was having crippling chest pain! 

4. I'm getting shit done! Basement and house cluttered? Rent a dumpster, get that cleaned out in a day. Backyard a mess? Attack the fence line and dig out the weeds and trees. Plant a garden that I'm proud of.

5. I'm feeling at peace. Sometimes I just smile and feel proud of myself randomly. I think to myself how happy I am with being alive and the opportunity to look forward to tomorrow rather then drinking time. Not being extremely hungover every morning during that start of your 12 hour shift makes life so much easier. 

It's only 6 months and I can't say it's been a breeze. But whenever I think to myself it's okay to start boozing again I always remind myself: You stopped drinking for a reason, your behavior was unacceptable and something needed to change. It is up to YOU to make this change. No one else. 

This sub has helped my immensely. So many good quotes I have used like ""play the tape forward"" and ""alcohol is just happiness that you pay with steep interest."" If you are reading this and you are on the fence about quitting just know that you can do this! You owe it to yourself to live a life that isn't anchored by booze.

1n1x3ql,https://v.redd.it/u0mzb2uufnlf1,Built an AI tweet optimizer after job hunting failed - needed to prove it works so I used it for my own launch,"Hey r/sideproject!

Graduated from ASU with my CS degree last December. Sent out 200+ applications, got maybe 10 interviews, zero offers. The tech job market is brutal right now, and I realized I needed to stand out somehow.

My plan was simple: build my personal brand on Twitter, showcase my technical thinking, and hope someone would notice. Problem was, my tweets were getting like 5-15 likes max. I'd see other developers with similar backgrounds pulling 10K+ impressions on posts that weren't even that insightful bro.

**I became obsessed with figuring out why.**¬†Started tracking everything - timing, hashtags, thread formats, you name it. Spent a month manually testing different approaches and discovered some wild patterns:

* **Word choice was everything.**¬†""How to debug faster"" got 12 likes. ""The debugging mistake that cost me 6 hours"" got 800+ likes. Same advice, completely different framing.
* **Questions crushed statements.**¬†But only certain question formats worked - ""What's your biggest X?"" performed 3x better than ""How do you handle X?""
* **Odd numbers consistently outperformed even numbers**¬†in headlines. Seriously. ""7 ways to X"" beat ""6 ways to X"" every single time.

After collecting tons of data (had to scrape myself), I realized I could probably build something to automate this testing process. So I did.

**Built a system that predicts which tweet variations are most likely to perform well.**¬†The technical pipeline was actually pretty fascinating to put together:

The system takes your draft tweet and generates multiple variations using AI. I trained it on thousands of high-performing tweets to understand patterns like emotional triggers, question formats, and psychological hooks that actually drive engagement.

Then comes the prediction part: Instead of just guessing, I built a dual-scoring system. First, a ML model trained on historical Twitter data predicts likes, retweets, and replies for each variation. But here's what I thought makes it interesting - I also simulate thousands of different AI user personas (different ages, interests, industries, behavioral patterns) and see how each would theoretically respond to each tweet version.

The system then blends both prediction methods to rank the variations. So you get both data-driven ML predictions AND simulated human behavioral responses before you post anything.

Took me 4 weeks of obsessive coding, learning prompt engineering, and way too much coffee.

**The results since I started using it consistently:**

* Average engagement up 300%+
* Got reached out to by 3 potential clients
* Actually have some interesting conversations in my DMs now

But here's the real win: I'm getting noticed. Had a recruiter reach out last week specifically because of my Twitter presence. Another founder wants to discuss a potential collaboration.

I'm realizing that maybe the traditional job hunt isn't the only path. Building in public, even with projects like this, seems to be opening doors I didn't expect.

**Also, to prove all this works and is accurate, I needed my launch post on Twitter to explode (at least for my following).**

If you wanna check if the tweet actually got more engagement (results) -  [Launch video](https://x.com/Atmiasri03/status/1960582467892756614)

It was something he'd imagined for years‚Äîbut now that it was here, his nerves had taken over.

Lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, Oswald thought to himself, ""Hmm... I wonder if I‚Äôll be able to make any friends in high school."" His stomach churned with both anticipation and dread.

Suddenly, he glanced at the small clock on the table next to his bed‚Äîhe was already late! Panic jolted through him.

""Oh no!"" he gasped, throwing off his blanket and scrambling out of bed. He rushed to the bathroom, washed up in record time, threw on his school uniform, packed his bag, and dashed downstairs like a whirlwind.

Down in the dining room, his dad, Ralph, sat at the table, calmly sipping coffee. Breakfast was set, and a neatly packed lunchbox sat waiting.

Ralph raised an eyebrow, smirking. ‚ÄúWell, good morning, son. You‚Äôre late for school... we should get going.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, Dad!‚Äù Oswald said, catching his breath. ‚ÄúI guess I was still in party mode after my birthday. Slept longer than I meant to.‚Äù

Ralph sighed but gave a warm smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, son. Now eat up so I can drive you to school.‚Äù

Oswald dropped his bag onto a chair and wolfed down his breakfast. He gulped his coffee like it was water.

‚ÄúYou full?‚Äù Ralph asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Oswald said, his eyes wide with urgency. ‚ÄúBut we gotta go! It‚Äôs my first day!‚Äù

They headed to the front door, stepped outside, and Ralph opened the mansion gate. They jumped into the car and took off.

Thankfully, traffic was light, and they reached the school quickly.

Before Oswald got out, Ralph gave him a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúHave a great day, son. You‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

Oswald smiled nervously. ‚ÄúThanks, Dad,‚Äù he said before rushing toward the school building.

He ran up the stairs, trying to remember where his classroom was‚Äîbut had no idea what room number it was supposed to be. He wandered the hall, anxiety rising in his chest.

Then he spotted a teacher and hurried over.

‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam... do you know where Room 12 is?‚Äù

She looked kindly at him. ‚ÄúOh, dear, it‚Äôs just down that hall to the right.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù Oswald said, bolting in that direction.

When he arrived at Room 12, the door creaked as he pushed it open. All eyes turned toward him‚Äîclassmates and the teacher stared. His heart skipped.

He swallowed hard and stepped inside.

‚ÄúAhem‚ÄîOswald Miller, I presume?‚Äù the teacher said. ‚ÄúYou're late.‚Äù

Oswald looked down, embarrassed. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm new here, and I got lost trying to find the room.‚Äù

The teacher smiled gently. ‚ÄúNo worries, Oswald. Just find your seat.‚Äù

Relieved, he walked to his desk, sat down, and placed his bag beside him, trying to catch his breath as the class began‚Äîmath was the first subject.

By lunchtime, everyone flooded into the cafeteria. Oswald followed along, quietly observing groups of friends chatting and laughing.

He spotted an open seat and approached a nearby table. ‚ÄúUm, excuse me‚Äîcan I sit here?‚Äù

A student glanced at him and replied curtly, ‚ÄúHuh? Sorry, this seat‚Äôs taken.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh... okay,‚Äù Oswald muttered, backing away.

He finally found a lone empty chair, sat down, and opened his bag. Inside was his favorite‚Äîa peanut butter and jelly sandwich, lovingly made by his dad. As he was about to take his first bite, a soft voice interrupted.

‚ÄúHi... um, sorry to bother you,‚Äù said a girl standing beside him. ‚ÄúI forgot my lunch at home. Could I maybe... have your sandwich?‚Äù

Oswald blinked in surprise. A girl? Talking to him?

He hesitated, cheeks warming, but handed the sandwich over. ‚ÄúSure. You can have it.‚Äù

Her face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù she said, sitting beside him. Oswald stared at the table, too nervous to look her in the eyes.

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-well... it‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he stammered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sachie Kida,‚Äù she said cheerfully. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúO-Oswald Miller,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúOswald Miller?‚Äù she echoed, raising her brows. ‚ÄúThat sounds American! But you look Japanese. What‚Äôs the story?‚Äù

Oswald smiled faintly. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs American. He adopted me and gave me that name.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù she said with a grin. ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù

Oswald blushed. ‚ÄúWell, I could say the same. You‚Äôre really... pretty.‚Äù

Sachie‚Äôs cheeks turned bright red. ‚ÄúH-hey! Stop that‚Äîyou‚Äôre embarrassing me!‚Äù

Suddenly, Oswald‚Äôs stomach growled loudly. They both laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hungry!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äîlet‚Äôs share the sandwich. I‚Äôll give you half.‚Äù

She tore it neatly and handed one half to him.

They ate together, and Sachie smiled. ‚ÄúThis is delicious! Did you make it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dad made it,‚Äù Oswald said proudly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù

Sachie looked down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry... I shouldn‚Äôt have asked for your lunch.‚Äù

Oswald shook his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. You forgot your lunch, and I‚Äôm happy to share. It‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

She gave him a bright smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really nice, Oswald. Can we be friends?‚Äù

Oswald froze. A girl like her... wants to be friends with me?

‚ÄúY-yes! Of course!‚Äù he said, still stunned.

‚ÄúYay!‚Äù Sachie clapped softly. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt made any friends yet, so I‚Äôm really happy!‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Oswald said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really have any friends in my neighborhood...‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Sachie asked. ‚ÄúMe neither. People always ignore me... I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

Oswald looked shocked. ‚ÄúWait... that happens to you, too?‚Äù

She nodded sadly. ‚ÄúYeah... it does.‚Äù

They shared a quiet, understanding moment.

Soon after, the bell rang, and everyone returned to class.

First Colonoscopy 2023, second one today. Same prep.

Sunday & Monday ate very light. Only had plain pasta, bananas, pretzels, toast with peanut butter, plain yogurt, one piece of chicken within those two days. Drank coffee in the AM and drank water the rest of the day, all day. 

Tuesday, liquids: black coffee, one orange jello, chicken broth, ice pops, water. 

Prep: (4) 16.9oz water bottles with (5) tablespoons of miralax in each (8.3oz/238g bottle divided). 
Took (1) 28oz lemon lime gatorade and poured it into two of the water bottles. Took (1) 28oz zero sugar clear cherry gatorade and poured it into the other two water bottles. Shake & DID NOT refrigerate. 

2023 did refrigerate but putting all the cold liquid into an empty stomach made me want to throw up. 


230PM (2) dulcolax tablets. 430PM drank one lemon lime & one clear cherry gatorade/miralax mixture. Alternating flavors definitely makes it easier. Room temp wasn‚Äôt bad and used diet cream soda as a chaser. The consistency is a little syrupy but doable and got it all down within 15 minutes.

Normally I intermittent fast so eating light/not eating wasn‚Äôt that hard and never really felt hungry.

5PM-11PM had a handful of trips to the bathroom and was running clear by 11PM. I did not wake up at 530AM and drink the other 1/2 of gatorade/miralax mixture this morning and never had another sip of anything after 8PM. Anything that goes in will come out. 

Took a xanax at 12AM, woke up at 730AM, arrived at facility at 930. Used the bathroom once in the morning only to pee. Never had the urge to go again.

Today, Weds, 1030AM procedure and my GI said I was completely cleaned out and ended up with Grade III hemorrhoids and a ten year warranty.

I do believe if you eat less, light, low fiber leading up to the procedure does make it a 100% easier. I will never dread doing this again!!!

Hi there! I‚Äôm kind of looking for someone who can keep me company online while I‚Äôm away in Manila. Someone I can share little updates with, be a bit clingy to, and just enjoy casual conversations throughout the day. Not in an NSFW way, but more of a genuine companion I can laugh with, rant to, and feel connected with even from a distance.

1st time posting in here and I can cook if I have instructions/video, but I am working on a alternate version of a video I saw and I need to see if this is possible.

  
So the video was bacon wrapped cheese sticks (not breaded)  Tried a few different versions and either bacon is still under-cooked or the cheese completely oozes out.  Plus the time and effort it takes to wrap each cheese stick does not make it worth it.

  
So in another video shows a guy taking a cheese stick, dredging it in egg, then flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, then back into the egg, then over bacon bits, freeze, then deep fry at 350F for 90 seconds.

  
So I want to remove the flour and breadcrumbs.

  
So my idea is what if I grind or blended up some bacon bits into semi-powder.  Like put them in a coffee bean blender or in a pepper grinder.   Then go:

* Cheese
* Egg
* Grinded up bacon bits
* Egg
* Normal bacon bits
* Freeze 1 Hour
* Deep Fry 90 seconds

  
Do you think that would work in the same fashion or am I chasing a dream?",0,1756337710.0,cookingforbeginners,1,0.5,False

Alcoholism kind of runs in my family, so does general addiction. While my mum isn't an addict, and neither is my big sister, both keep alcohol in the house that they drink maybe once every year--the addiction is more on my dad's side. Dad was both a meth addict and alcohol addict, but he's been doing better for years now. Mental illness is also a common trait, on both sides. As a result, I've got some rather intense anxiety and a somewhat obsessive personality. Whenever I'm home alone, and I think too much, I go through the cupboard or the fridge to find clear alcohol that can easily be somewhat replaced with water. It feels like I just impulsively do it, watching my limbs move, not in control.

I used to just dip a (clean) finger and taste it, solely from curiosity, but it's recently escalated and I've been taking enough sips to feel dizzy and ""soft"" if that makes sense. Not enough to be terribly hungover, but enough to relax. It works a gazillion times better than any anxiety med I've ever been on, and usually I don't even have to take much. I feel miserable. Not only am I technically committing a crime, I am also breaking my promise of never repeating my dad's mistakes, and I am ALSO stealing alcohol from my family. The biggest bit of guilt is how sad my dad would be. Not angry, not disappointed, but sad. I know he'd blame himself. And yet, I still want to keep doing it. I don't wanna believe I'm addicted but I get stressed easily when it's been awhile. 

If I'm not napping or lounging outside, I'm just much more chatty when I have a drink. If family comes home, they don't suspect anything, because I'm simply acting nicer. I'm calmer. Drinking my coffee outside and smiling at the sky, music playing, I must look so happy. Barely anything makes me feel so calm. I just say my meds must be working really well. They don't suspect a thing, from what I can tell. The truth is, my pills don't do shit and I'm turning into my father. I've been unbearably upset lately. I'm lying to friends and family left and right about everything. I lie to my therapist, too. I just keep lying. I tell them that I feel better but I don't, I never do. The relaxation always ends and when it does I'm miserable all over again. I'm stuck. I can't tell anybody about what's really going on ",1,1756337405.0,venting,1,1.0,False

But our parents didn't aprove, and we had many people not wanting us to be together. At the end she broke up with me, saying I'm young and I need to live before comitting to someone long term. And when she hugged me for last time she whispered ""maybe in few years we try again"".

Back then that sentence sounded so dumb to me, because she was 29 already and I expected her to get in some serious relationship soon after me.
But I was broken after that relationship, I was solo for 2 full years before I even flirted with another girl after her.
I also worked a lot on myself, finished college, got a good job, found my style, trained until I got my dream body, dyed my hair, got 25 tattoos and 4 piercings. When I was with her I was baby gay, my hair was just brown and long with messy undercut, and I wore everything either super baggy things or skinny jeans and button up. She was allways really femme so I tryed to be more masc. After breakup I realised thats not me and now I'm really femme, and I feel so good in my skin.
Also I didn't date much after honestly, I had one casual relationship after her and that was it.

But then month ago I was in coffee shop with my friends and first I heard familiar voice, so I turned and few tables away from me was her and her friend group. I could tell she didnt notice me so I got up and went there to say hi as I didnt want to be rude. So I go there and she took few seconds before she noticed me. She immediatly got up hugging me, calling me beautiful, saying how I changed so much and how much she missed me. We had casual chat for few minutes, asking what's new and what stayed the same before I went back to my friends. Later that night I was back home when she sent me a request on instagram (she unfollowed me right after breakup,  I unfollowed her 6 months after). So I accept her and she immediatly texts me, she said how happy she is that she saw me and she would love to catch up. So we text casualy, but also I can tell she's flirty and she also immediatly asked me to meet for coffee. So we went and it was good, I was happy to see her again. She invited me out again, and she started asking if I'm single and then she started saying how shes also single for a year now. And then when we were saying bye she kissed my cheek (to close to my lips) and said that maybe we should try again. I didn't say anything I was to confused, I just smiled like I'm dumb probably. 

But when I came home I startes to think about it, and honestly I don't think I want her again. I was allways hoping that we would get back together as I was sure she was only one I could ever love. But now, Idk, she's still attractive but I just feel like I was in relationship with a player, and at this age I don't want to repeat that again.",3,1756337114.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

**Why should I care**: Robotics has never seen a foundational model able to reliably control robots zero-shot, that is without ad-hoc data collection and post-training on top of the base model. Getting one would enable robots to out-of-the-box tackle arbitrary tasks and environments, at least where reliability is not the top concern. Like AI coding agents; not perfect, but still useful.

**What they did**: 1 Franka robot arm, zero-shot pi0, a kitchen table full of objects, a ‚Äúvibe test‚Äù of 300 manipulation tasks to sample what the model can do and how it fails, from opening drawers to activating coffee machines. 

**Main Results**: 

\-Overall, it achieves an average progress of 42% over all tasks, showing sensible behaviour across a wide variety of tasks. Impressive considering how general the result is!

\-Prompt engineering matters. ""Close the toilet"" ‚Üí Fail. ‚ÄúClose the white lid of the toilet‚Äù ‚Üí Success. 

\-Lack of memory in the AI architecture still surprisingly leads to emergence of step-by-step behaviours: reach ‚Üí grasp ‚Üí transport ‚Üí release, but unsurprisingly also mid-task freezing. 

\-Requires no camera/controller calibration, resilient to human distractors.

\-Spatial reasoning still rudimentary, no understanding of ‚Äúobjectness‚Äù and dimensions in sight.  

**So What?**: Learning generalistic robotic policies seems‚Ä¶ possible! No problem here seems fundamental, we have seen models in the past facing similar issues due to insufficient training. The clear next step is gathering more data (hard problem to do at scale!) and train longer.

Before you make ANY decisions. This is very important. My name is Marcy McKinnon and I have been missing for three months. Or not at all. I‚Äôm not sure which is true.

It all started when I found a notebook in the Great Oaks Woods. I know, I know, no one is supposed to be in the Great Oaks Woods the community has been abandoned for years and the state says there is no public access. It‚Äôs peaceful though and I like‚Ä¶ liked going on walks there. The notebook. I found it on one of the walks, usually I would have ignored it but something stood out to me about it. It had my name on it.

So I took it home with me. Obviously I don‚Äôt live in the Great Oaks Community, but I live nearby. If you park at the meet up lot just off the highway the west side of the woods its only a short walk to enter this off limits zone. They don‚Äôt keep security on guard, I think they figure the stories were enough. I thought the stories were a bunch of shit. Something kids tell younger kids to scare them at sleep overs. I believe now that I was wrong.

When I got home I started reading the notebook. It might‚Äôve been my next mistake but I was hooked. It told me about a place like our world but different in so many ways. A world of peace and true freedom.

The notebook boasted about people willing to help each other just to be helpful. Workers took to jobs out of enjoyment and sense of purpose and not money. The trade of cash for good and services deserted long ago because all of the needs were provided too the citizens by the government so that the pleasures of life could be explored by the citizens without worry.

I continued to read unbelievable accounts of the best painters to ever exist because they didn‚Äôt need to worry about financially supporting their families. Hunters and Butchers hosting town wide feasts once a week for the sake of the betterment of community. Musicians performing concerts at town centers for all to enjoy.

It wasn‚Äôt limited to food and arts. Architects, Laborers, Plumbers, and Electricians building the most elaborate, ornate buildings and houses to perfect their craft.

This was a great story of the perfect oasis hidden in some far off world. I was impressed, whoever the author was had skill and was convincing. What I couldn‚Äôt figure out was why they had left it in a notebook, with my name on it, in the middle of the woods to a town that was long abandoned.

I couldn‚Äôt figure it out until I read the last line.

If you don‚Äôt believe me. Come see for yourself.

After I read that last line a door in my room opened up. It was where my closet stood but it wasn‚Äôt my closet door. It was larger ornate carved carefully, by hand, out of cherry wood. It opened into a cavern of pitch black. The darkest black I had ever seen, darker than an oil spill. A chill filled my room and I was overtaken with the desire to enter the wholly black abyss that opened before me.

It seems unreasonable, looking back on it, for me to want to enter an unknown gaping hole that just appeared without reason in my room. Even with this logical thinking I was still driven by something deep within myself to explore. To find out if the wonderful word of bliss was real.

So I entered the threshold of the door, stopping to run my hands along the ornate frame of the cherry wood. Spectacular. That‚Äôs what it was, absolutely spectacular. I had never seen anything so finely crafted, so much detail in the twirls of the vines and leaves carved into the wood.

I took a deep breath and walked into the inky black that engulfed my vision.

I emerged on the other side to a version of my room, light filtering in through the windows that were framed with the same delicately carved cherry wood. All the furniture was in the same spots, bed along the wall across from my dresser. My desk sat under the window, and the bedroom door was open. It was my room but larger by two or three times and all of my technology was gone. No tv on the dresser, or laptop on my desk. No alarm clock on my bedside table. Instead a baby grandfather clock stood in a corner that usually sat empty.

It was beautiful. I took it all in. The linens that were nicer and softer than anything I could ever afford, the multicolored floral dresses that hung in the closet. After I felt comfortable with the room I wandered into the rest of the house. Or McMansion judging by what seemed to be the never ending hallway that greeted me. It was as beautiful as my room. Gold flecked filigree wallpaper, hand carved baseboards, paintings so lifelike the portraits could‚Äôve walked from behind the frames and I wouldn‚Äôt have batted an eye. Doors lined the hallway, a half dozen on either side and at one end a staircase that lead down to the main floor.

‚ÄúAh. Welcome. We‚Äôve been expecting you, Marcy.‚Äù

The woman spoke softly but with intention. I had no idea how she knew who I was but at the time it didn‚Äôt put me off. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that you decided to come.‚Äù She spoke as she glided a few steps closer. ‚ÄúI would recommend that you go out and see the town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù I asked finding my voice.

‚ÄúHome, Sweetheart.‚Äù She said looping her arm in mine. ‚ÄúYou are welcome to stay for as long as you like. If you wish to go back just tell me, and I‚Äôll see to it personally.‚Äù She gave a polite smile. Something about the lady eased me. She was older, no younger than sixty and comforted me like a grandmother. She also looked familiar in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain but her blue eyes were dreamy, not bright but soft and inviting. ‚ÄúFor now explore. See the town for what it is. Talk to the people. Dinner is when the bell chimes six.‚Äù She spoke as she lead me to the front door.

So that‚Äôs what I did. I went out and explored the town. It was lovely. Wide roads made of bricks paved the way winding between buildings and leaving openings for grassy parks with tall trees I didn‚Äôt recognize. Flowers sat in window boxes that lined the exterior of almost every window. The air was clear of the fumes and dust of our world. No pollution from cars, trucks, buses, and planes. None of that seemed to be here. Children and adults alike travelled either by foot or on bicycles and scooters.

I explored book stores, coffee shops, and the occasional clothing store. All were ran by people who loved what they did and were more than happy to help with whatever I needed.

‚ÄúThat there is a beautiful piece.‚Äù The local blacksmith told me as I handled a hand crafted knife. ‚ÄúTook me two weeks to forge it. A nice addition to anyone‚Äôs collection. Even royalty.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is beautiful.‚Äù I said as I inspected the waving patterns of steel that layered between shiny silver and near jet black. ‚ÄúBut I wouldn‚Äôt have a use for it.‚Äù I admitted setting it back on the table.

‚ÄúEveryone has a use for well crafted tools.‚Äù The man countered. ‚ÄúEven a princess.‚Äù He proposed raising his brow.

‚ÄúPrincess?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúYes. You are one of the royals, aren‚Äôt you? You look exactly like the family.‚Äù He said with a waiving gesture.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I said perplexed.

‚ÄúSorry, Miss.‚Äù He said slightly embarrassed. ‚ÄúYou just look so similar to the Royal Family I thought you must be one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. A simple mistake.‚Äù I said reassuring him everything was alright.

‚ÄúEither way, take the knife. It‚Äôs perfect for you.‚Äù He offered again.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with it.‚Äù I retorted with a giggle.

‚ÄúEveryone has a use for a well crafted tools. In good times. And in bad.‚Äù He countered.

I walked back to the house as the sunset into beautiful oranges and yellows. The bell hadn‚Äôt tolled six but the setting sun was enough to set me on my way. I stopped at the gate of the McMansion I left and took the whole building in for the first time. It wasn‚Äôt the mansion I was expecting but instead an overwhelming castle. How had I missed that before?

It must‚Äôve been four story‚Äôs tall put together with giant limestone blocks in order perfectly. The windows glistened in the light from the sun setting behind it.

‚ÄúMarcy.‚Äù The lady greeted me when I walked through the front door. ‚ÄúPerfect timing. Would you mind wearing one of the dresses in your closet for dinner? You are more than welcome to wear what you are now but you might be more comfortable.‚Äù She offered.

‚ÄúYes, of course. The dresses looked lovely.‚Äù I said because I really didn‚Äôt mind changing. My blouse and jeans had felt more tight than when I left my world and a nice flowing dress sounding very comforting. ‚ÄúMiss‚Ä¶ um I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt get your name.‚Äù I spoke realizing I hadn‚Äôt learned anyone‚Äôs name that day.

‚ÄúYou may call me Grandmother. Or Macy if you prefer. Either Is fine by me.‚Äù She said with a smile.

‚ÄúYes. Grandmother Macy. Are‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated as the words were working their way out. ‚ÄúAre you the queen of these lands?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome would say so.‚Äù She said simply. Her inflection never changed.

‚ÄúSo-‚Äù She cut me off.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be more than happy to answer any questions at dinner, my dear. It is closing in rather quickly if you plan to change.‚Äù She kindly reminded me. We were at the foot of the stairs. I took the hint and headed back to my room.

I pulled off my now too tight blouse and removed the knife from its hiding spot tucked in my waistband. The tiny useless pockets would‚Äôve done nothing to hold the sizable blade especially with the sheath that had a built in strap. The blacksmith told me he worked with a leather-man that made the sheath and strap special. It was designed to be strapped around the thigh and concealed under a dress. I didn‚Äôt know why someone would need to do such a thing. Not in a place as wonderful as this.

I found a nice dress of pink and orange flowers on a white backdrop it slipped on and fell into place perfectly. I stashed the knife under my pillow and made my way for dinner.

The dinner laid out before me was unbelievable. The kind of dinner you would expect to see in a movie about medieval times. Fruits and vegetables by the crate full, roast chickens, pork ribs, soups, and salads.

‚ÄúWell I may have overdone it.‚Äù The Queen laughed. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, all this food yet we were the only ones at the table. In fact I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone but her in the castle at all. No other family, no servants, no cooks, or cleaners.

‚ÄúIt looks amazing.‚Äù I said in awe of the spread.

‚ÄúWell dig in.‚Äù She said motioning to the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry the rest of the family couldn‚Äôt join us. They had their own plans today. Usually we eat as a family with new comers but they were convinced you weren‚Äôt coming.‚Äù She explained as she scooped food onto her plate and I did the same.

‚ÄúSo this place.‚Äù I started but I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say. I had so many questions but didn‚Äôt know where to start.

‚ÄúIs our home.‚Äù She said not looking up. ‚ÄúThe family is extensive so the castle had to accommodate everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe family?‚Äù I questioned as I looked at my too full plate.

‚ÄúYes. My children and grandchildren. Unfortunately my husband died years ago but we still manage a happy life.‚Äù She spoke looking up for the first time since sitting down.

‚ÄúSo I am?‚Äù It was all I could work out.

‚ÄúMy granddaughter.‚Äù She spoke with ease. ‚ÄúI have been tracking down every member of the extensive family and inviting them to live here since your Grandfather died.‚Äù She started cutting into a whole roast chicken. ‚ÄúSome of my children, and thus grandchildren, have dispersed amongst other worlds. You are one of those grandchildren.‚Äù She smiled a loving smile at me that warmed my heart. ‚ÄúI invite everyone but it is their choice. Some come. Some don‚Äôt.‚Äù She said simply and began to eat.

I followed her lead. The food was delicious. Better than anything I had ever eaten. Not tainted by hormones, pesticides, or preservatives. I knew I could get used to this.

After dinner I retreated to my room. After a long day of, well, of everything I needed to unwind. Could this be real? Did I have an accident and now lay in a coma in some hospital? Had I burst an aneurism and this is heaven? I had no idea. Honestly I didn‚Äôt care.

I looked in the stand up mirror next to my closet door. My curly brown hair, soft blue eyes, pointed noise. I did look like the queen. It was entirely possible that I was her granddaughter.

Sleep was amazing almost euphoric. I was up with the sun and ready to set on another day of exploring the town. I put on another dress, this time blue and purple flowers on a golden backing. I slipped the sheath of the knife onto my right thigh and tightened it down. If I was royalty I should have protection, right?

I visited with a nice lady who ran a bakery. Another who owned a flower shop. It turns out she did most of the floral work around town. I stopped by to see the blacksmith again but he was out for the day. his shop closed with a sign that said, ‚ÄúOut for now. Come again tomorrow.‚Äù

Another exciting day of meeting locals and sight seeing was followed by another dinner. This one was smaller, and thankfully so, with a few others to join us as well. The Queens son, Micheal. He was born and raised here, grew up in the castle. And a daughter, Mary, who like me was invited to the castle. She looked remarkably like me, her nose pointed, dark brown hair laid in curls that were formed rather than natural, but the eyes - same soft blue eyes as the rest of us.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so happy to have you here.‚Äù She said softly. She was probably in her late thirties or early forties. Smile lines and forehead wrinkles had started to form their paths and a few gray hairs peaked through the otherwise dark hair.

‚ÄúIt is nice of you all to be so welcoming.‚Äù I thanked scooping mashed potatoes onto my plate.

‚ÄúDo you plan to stay?‚Äù Micheal asked filling his own plate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen plenty come, and go.‚Äù He seemed serious. The business type. He would‚Äôve been successful on Wall Street. He too was at least forty and looked as businessmanly as he sounded.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I stumbled on my words. ‚ÄúI actually haven‚Äôt thought about it.‚Äù In reality I hadn‚Äôt. I had spent so much time enjoying the town and the exploring that I hadn‚Äôt considered whether I was going to stay or not. I guess that meant that I was.

‚ÄúWe would be very happy to have you.‚Äù Mary said still quiet. ‚ÄúIt was the best decision I ever made.‚Äù She pushed her peas into a pile before scooping them up on her spoon. ‚ÄúAnd there is still plenty of family to meet.‚Äù She smiled, it was a pretty smile I was surprised it was the first one I saw from her.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so happy and would love it if you stayed. At least for the big celebration at the end of the week.‚Äù The Queen spoke up again. ‚ÄúCan you give us that much?‚Äù

I told her I would. I didn‚Äôt want to seem to eager. I would gladly stay here for as long as I was welcome. If this was family, even if it wasn‚Äôt, the place was beautiful and full of peace.

1n1w924,https://i.redd.it/e1m74n7h9nlf1.jpeg,Best Buddy Award,"So every day for the last month I would have a web from my mirror to my door. I would get in my car and start driving. Without fail this cutie patootie would scramble out and hurriedly try to grab all of it's webs and bugs. The first couple times was me yelling at it to get back in the mirror until I could find a place to park or a red light as it held on for dear life on the lodge in Detroit (for those of you not from MI, the lodge is a death trap for humans so it had to be very scary for a spider)

 After that though we've come to an agreement, she or he??? feels the vibration of my car starting and waits until I'm in my car then they hustle out. I sit and sip my coffee and they cram the web and little bugs into their mouth then they climbs back in behind my mirror and off we go to work. I've been excitedly telling my husband about my passenger but I could never get a pic so I'm sure he thought I was crazy.

Today I had to speed out to get gas before I ran out of it so I'm sure the spider was very confused but I gave them plenty of time at the gas station to clean up their web/food and got this pic!!

They have to have so many stories and adventures just be-bopping around Detroit with me. My husband was researching and we think it's a spotted orbweaver? We don't know anything about spiders and are just excited they seem to be thriving and happy. If anyone knows what kind of spider they are or if they can tell if it's a boy or girl (is there a way to tell?) that would great!",8,1756336276.0,spiders,0,1.0,False
1n1w7ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1n1w7ox/journaling_has_helped_me_be_more_clear_headed/,Journaling has helped me be more clear headed,"It's been about 2 years now and I've been dealing with a lot of mental health stuff (anxiety, PTSD, panic attacks, visual snow, moderate depression, PPPD dizziness, DPDR, derealization, etc.) which has caused me to isolate myself inside because it's my safe place. I'm not on medication but got prescribed Zoloft last week and haven't taken it yet. 

Before my workplace incident 2 years ago that caused all of this, I was an outdoors person, going to clubs, always meeting new people, working a lot, etc. I never isolated myself but when you face a traumatic event that causes you to be out of work, that's what tends to happen.

Despite everything I've been trying to do (a lot has helped) such as meditation, CBD, praying, going for walks, supplements, etc. The one thing I finally found that has helped so far is journaling. I always procrastinated and just kept saying I'll start the next day but finally, 2 days ago, I started.

My first journal entry was everything that was on my mind. I struggle with occasional intrusive thoughts and worrying which clouded my head a lot so I wrote out all of those intrusive thoughts and worrying thoughts on paper. All of them. I read them again in my head and did another entry of each one of those thoughts and wrote out the worst case scenario. After that, I did new entries taking those thoughts and worst case scenarios and writing out best case scenarios. My final entries were how I can accomplish those best case scenarios.

I'm not going to go into detail about what I wrote but that evening, I went to the gym for the first time in a while. I usually dissociated in the gym so I would just stop going. That went well. No intrusive thoughts, no dissociation, no worrying thoughts. When my heart rate increased, I didn't worry. When I felt body aches from the weight lifting, I didn't worry. This was a big win for me.

Yesterday I didn't go to the gym or journal because I procrastinated which was a loss for the day. But today, I made a coffee and journaled for about 20 minutes outside on my balcony in direct sunlight. I then went to the gym and worked out for about 45 minutes. No issues once again.

It's a bit early to say this is the best thing ever but so far it has helped me be more clear headed. If you haven't started already, get yourself a blank notebook and just start journaling. Write everything that you're thinking about on paper. If you're unsure where to start, checkout on YouTube ""anxiety journaling.""

Hope this helps!",3,1756336180.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False
1n1w6fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n1w6fd/the_god_of_hunger_part_two/,The God of hunger - part two,"Getting to the end of the page and knowing better than to read past what Sam wants me to I set the book down on the table next to me and lay in bed, whether if it's being in a new place or being exited to be out here it takes me what feels like hours of keeping my eyes closed before drifting off to sleep. Waking up in the morning I quickly get dressed and head outside being first to get up means I get first dibs to the coffee. Slowly unzipping my tent door and peaking my head out i see Sam's and John's tents are both closed I quickly unzip the rest of my tent hop out to the campfire in the middle of our tents and as quietly as possible start brewing the coffee over the embers of last nights fire. John thankfully doesn't cheap out on the amenities when going on these trips probably to impress Sam but either way I enjoy having coffee out here. Once its done I pour myself a cup rase it to my mouth when a hand from behind me grabs it from me (Sam) ""ill take that"", ""uh fuck you I just made that"" (Sam)""I let you read what i found last time I was out here this is payment"" she walks around the fire until she is across from me and sits down as I pour myself another cut, finally being able to drink coffee I put it to my mouth when again a hand comes from behind me and grabs it from me, quickly turning I see John put the cup to his lips ""hey i was ab-"" he throws folded up paper at me (John) ""look at that"" he takes a sip from what was supposed to be my cup. Unfolding the paper its reveled to be a folded up map of the area with five circles labeled from AB-1 to AB-5 (John)""we are going to site 5 today its a 2 hour walk, pack light we will be back when the sun starts to set and bring those jars to fill with water"" pointing to the pile of stuff still not set up next to his tent,  following where he points ""sure"" (John)""sure Boss"" he reminded me, Sam laughing as he said it which made him blush I still don't know how he's managed to hide that. After everyone was ready for the trip and thankfully after I was able to get my coffee we set off. Nothing eventful during the walk other than the time I kicked a rock out of boredom it flew from my foot and right under John's as he was putting it down which caused him to trip Sam noticing laughs at him, John didn't find it too funny but i did. Finally getting to the site we set our gear down. John starts to set up the temporary camp as Sam heads to the corner of the clearing with a shovel I grab the jars and head down to the nearby river, thankfully this water was so clear I could tell I wouldn't have to filter the water in fact it was so clear that I could see right to the bottom of which was a formation a small stones encircling a large stone that was sticking out the water, the small stones where round where the large one was flat. filling the jars I head back up to the clearing where John was setting up a fire I set the jars down next to him and head over to Sam who was facing me with a smile on her face, (Sam)""look what I found"" pointing in a small hole with the shovel looking down I see a rock ""wow Sam wait until the museums hear about a rock"" she then hit me on the head with the shovel. Falling to the ground holding the top of my head in pain she says ""look around smart ass you see any rocks here they where here now I just got to look around to find evidence"" still holding my head I grunt out ""then why didn't you just go to the river"" I don't know the face she made my eyes where squeezed shut but I heard quick footsteps leave my side and in the direction of the river. When the pain started to numb I got up and locked around to see John staring at me with a shit eating grin I give him the finger and go to the river with Sam. Getting down to the riverbank she looks back at me with a smile not understanding the significance I wait for her to talk, ""this is it the paintings had this its where they left the food on one of the painting oh my god you found it"" she reaches out to hug me and I flinch expecting her to hit me again. She lets go of me and runs back to where she left her bag grabbing two notebooks out and running back ""look"" she shows me a page of her notebook in it is a polaroid photo, the photo was of a cave painting, the painting had five figures on the right of a formation of stones similar to the one Infront of us and across from them was what looked like a stick figure with very simple features like a kid tried to draw their family, the stones and other five where very detailed you could even see the eyes, thinking it was odd I look down from the photo to see another Sam noticing my gaze drop closes the book and quickly puts it back in her pocket. I only got a quick glace but it looked like another painting but instead of rocks it was a river in the middle the figures where all the same. She stares at me for what feels like minutes before from behind her I hear John call out ""lunch is ready in ten minutes get back here"" awkwardly leaving her side I walk over to where John is about half way i turn back and she hasn't moved still staring at me I don't know what the issue is but it creeped me out.

1n1w4v8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n1w4v8,Charge for Carpet,"Hi

I recently got a disposition that i was only getting $78 back from my security deposit of $625. For one they charged me for paint that was already messed up upon moving in and for damage to the carpet. I only lived here for a year. I don‚Äôt have a yet or I didn‚Äôt smoke. I was pregnant and had a newborn for my entire stay. The spaces where the damages are were occupied by beds and a closet. Not only that but two weeks after living there I was contacted and told that they needed to come conduct a move in inspection because they realized it was skipped. This meant that they would not have been able to check the carpet given my belongings were moved in and they also did not check it before I moved it. Is this right? Can I go against this? I left this apartment better than I found it. They gave me a dirty stove and a broken sink. That i had to beg to be replaced and it wasn‚Äôt replaced until May which was 2 months before I moved out. Also they said i messed up the floor and lifted the boarder. I was 9 months pregnant and could barely lift anything. This had to have happened when they switched the stove out. Is the carpet normal wear and tear? Are they able to charge me for this? I know for a fact i did not cause this damage and they can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt there before because they didn‚Äôt conduct an inspection. I know they didn‚Äôt because when I moved it there was still coffee grains in the cabinet and paper in the windows. They also charged me for not taking the paper napkin out the window i never put there that had been there since before I moved in. There were spots when I moved in but the carpet wasn‚Äôt pulled until I moved out. ",1,1756335983.0,Renters,6,0.66,False
1n1w4g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanFranciscoWeddings/comments/1n1w4g7/wedding_for_128_people_in_sf_budget_breakdown/,Wedding for 128 people in SF (budget breakdown),"Hi everyone! I found lurking on this page to be a really useful resource as we were planning our wedding this year. Here is a final budget breakdown of our event in case it might help anyone. I am happy to answer any additional questions! Our original budget was $42.5K, and we basically ended up exactly there until the week of when some random costs arose, and we gave additional tips for excellent service on a few of the already tipped services (eg catering team, rehearsal dinner staff, etc). Although our final costs were really close to our original budget, we estimated the costs of a few services quite incorrectly (we way underestimated the costs of rentals, for example, but we overestimated the cost of the dinner catering). I'll break the costs down piece by piece, as well.

**Venues**:

**Reception Venue** \- Webster Hall ($5090). This was a great venue, and it was one I first found through a reddit recommendation. Because I am vegan, we were really looking for a venue that let us pick our own catering. I really didn't want a chicken or fish wedding, so this was our biggest priority for the venue (as well as capacity). Webster Hall was the only place we toured, and it was great! Great ceiling heights, windows, layout, and the people responsible for the venue are amazing. The only required vendor you must use is Abbey Rentals, which actually worked out very well (see more below!).

**Ceremony Venue** \- Lafayette Park ($1241 for 5 hours of usage) We booked the park for 5 hours, although the actual ceremony is only like 25 minutes, so that we had enough set up and breakdown time. It worked out great. The park is super close to the reception venue (2.5 blocks). The place within the park where you have the wedding is really contained, so it doesn't feel overly public, and there are great views as soon as you leave the little cove for photos. It was a pretty misty day, which actually worked out for me as I was working off a migraine, and direct sunlight would have been pretty tough. Everything has an upside! My hair did get very big, though!

**Coordination:**

**Coordination** \- Events by the Bay ($1850.79). The venue and photographer required there to be a day-of-coordinator, and I'm really glad we got this team. I partly chose Janette because she was also able to hire a catering team, which made it all feel a bit more in house. As d-o-c, it was helpful to have deadlines to meet for her in advance of the wedding as it helped us structure our own planning. Day of, her and her assistant were very helpful and professional.

**Clothing:**

**Dresses** ($450) - I sewed all of my dresses for the weekend (the rehearsal dinner dress, the main wedding dress, a dancing dress with a large overskirt and a mini skirt reveal) and two of the bridesmaids dresses. My sister and cousin sewed their bridesmaids dresses with fabric I sent them. I sourced fabric from Fabric Outlet (RIP my favorite store in SF), Britex Fabrics, Mood Fabrics, and Discount Fabrics in SF. This was a really fun process for me, and it obviously was very cool to wear a wedding dress I made on my own. That said, it was a lot of work!! I also still have fabric leftover for some other cool outfits in the future.

**Suit** ($1295.9) - The suit was custom made from Suit Supply in SF. We chose a custom suit to have a dark green suit, which looked great both in person and on camera.

**Wedding Food**:

**Dinner Catering** \- Burma Love ($4,945.29). Burma Love is one of our favorite restaurants in the city, and they do really good vegan, gluten free, and nut free options. I actually had to coordinate a 30 person dinner a few months before the event for my work, and I chose Burma Superstar in the east bay with the added benefit of being able to assess the amount of food that was in each serving and how many people it seemed to actually feed. The food quantity we chose worked out really well (although we ran out of the Tea Leaf salad 85% of the way through the buffet), but it was the thing that was stressing me out day of. People were getting bigger servings than I was expecting because the food was so good, so I was a bit nervous while some people were still waiting to get their food. I suppose that's the upside to table service, but the buffet worked better overall here because we had lots of different options creating the full main course. We had some leftover, which we donated.

**Canap√©s Catering** \- La Med ($688.23). We weren't really here for this portion of the night, as these came out while we were taking photos during the cocktail hour, but I only heard good things. I was glad we had some little snacks to stave off hunger initially. La Med was really easy to work with, and they helped clarify a few things after we placed an order with them through ezcater.

**Alcohol** \- Standard Deviant and Total Wine ($2389.83). We got our beer from Standard Deviant Brewing. We really like this beer, and it seemed like everyone else did, too. We probably over ordered (enough for everyone to have 2.4 beers), so we have a lot left over. We got our wine and liquor at Total Wine and More, and the value here is great (much better than BevMo, eg). We did 2 signature cocktails (aperol spritz and mojitos), and we had lots of other spirits and mixers. We also have a lot left over - we definitely over estimated, but we didn't want to run out, and now we can throw some banging birthday parties and supply dinner parties with alcohol for the next year. This cost might have been 2/3 if we had estimated more accurately. We forgot to supply simple syrup, so remember this if you are doing your own bar. We also had to transport all of this back and forth from point of purchase to our apartment (up several flights of stairs), to the venue, and the leftover back to our apartment. We got a uhaul for all the things we needed to bring to the wedding on the Friday before the wedding, and we had all of my family helping.

**Cake** \- Timeless Bakery ($610). We got vegan cake from Timeless Bakery based in Piedmont in the East Bay. The cake was amazing (we did a 3-layer, 3-tier cake and a sheetcake). Technically this would serve 80, but we definitely got much more out of it, plus leftover which we donated. People kept coming up to us to tell us how good it was, and a lot seemed really surprised that it was vegan. Our Day of Coordinator's assistant handled the pick up, which was great.

**Ice Cream** \- Salt & Straw ($679). We got 50 pints of ice cream from the Salt & Straw on Fillmore St in lots of different flavors (including 2 vegan flavors). The challenge with this was just organizing when it was picked up and the ice at the venue. People seemed very happy with this element of the night.

**Catering Staff** \- Events by the Bay ($4254). I cannot speak highly enough of the team Janette hired here. They really made the night feel so seamless, and they were all so kind to us and the guests. High praise from us.

**Dry Ice/Ice** \- SF Ice ($156.57), super easy and handled delivery. We hadn't organized the ice until later in the planning process, and this ended up being so easy. Just a phone call! Super lovely!

**Supplies:** (excluding the random amazon orders)

**Rentals** \-  Abbey Rentals (7406.42). This was the biggest expense to stomach, but we felt in the end it was really worth it. We had to order chairs for both the ceremony and reception and all the other standard reception items (tables, cocktail tables, linens, plates, glassware etc). The ceremony chair delivery seemed difficult, and they handled it so well. The reception looked phenomenal. Abbey rentals runs Webster Hall, so the set up here was the opposite of stressful. We got there on Friday to do a bit of our own set up, and the tables and chairs were already delivered and organized. It looked just amazing. Olivia at Abbey is the best!!

**Design:**

**Flowers** \- Miguel's Flowers (SF Wholesale) ($443.12). We bought flowers wholesale from Miguel's Flowers. My mum and I scouted the types of flowers in May, I made an order in June, and my sister and aunt executed the florals the day before the wedding. My sister took a bouquet making class in advance of this, and the flowers all looked amazing. 6-7 people helped them for \~1.5 hours on the Friday while we set up the main Webster Hall things (bar etc). The morning of the wedding, my aunts made a few extra bouquets and did flowers on the chuppah.

**Chuppah** \- we bought two arches on amazon and combined them to create the chuppah. I built this almost fully in our apartment, and we got it to the ceremony space in four large pieces in the uhaul - walked to the hotel near the space - walked to the ceremony day of. We bought the cloth to go over the chuppah from discount fabrics in the color of one of the flowers (thistle).

**Signage** \- I painted most of the signage by hand, referencing our flower selection. I also hand painted the menus for the drinks and ice cream. I think the miscellaneous category includes our seating chart, which we printed via a website that does foam boards. I did a little border design in preview. It looked great! It might also include a Fedex trip to print the food signs.

**Entertainment:**

**DJ** \- DJ Big Kev ($2750). Worth every penny. Kevin really made the vibe of the night. He did a great job MC'ing, doing our introduction, pronouncing names correctly, and getting people on the dance floor. We were so glad we went with Kevin (on the recommendation of Webster Hall's Olivia!).

**Group painting** \- Blick Art ($40). I provided materials for an abstract painting that I planned to start before the event. Unfortunately, I had a migraine, so it started as a blank canvas. It turned out a fun activity with a really odd final product, and I have to decide how to make it work if we are to hang it somewhere.

**Photography:**

**Photographer** \- Apollo Fotografie (4,000), with Brittani as our photographer. The team and Brittani did a great job. We got a lot of planning documents from them which helped with thinking about the wedding structure/schedule/etc overall. Brittani was really great at organizing the photographs, talking to people, and hanging out with us during the event. I didn't feel overly observed throughout. We were glad to only have one photographer on site. I only slightly wish we also had video. Usually, I do a lot of video things, and I thought I would be able to organize something, but it all got too much on the day.

**Additional Events:**

**Rehearsal Dinner** \- Ramenwell ($2725.17). This included ramen, appetizers, and beer and sake for 40 people. The food, as always, was amazing, and so too were the vibes! The wait staff, cooks, and coordination was incredible. We highly recommend reaching out to them for an event if you have a time in mind that is not peak ramen season. After dinner, we walked to Standard Deviant for an informal welcome event that was really fun and well attended! We did not pay for these drinks.

**Day After Bagel Brunch** \- Boichik Bagels (424.58). We got 100 Boichik Bagels, spreads, and lox for a very casual brunch in Dolores Park on blankets. (Someone else bought the lox and coffee and juice, so it's accidentally not included in the budget here). It was a a really fun and relaxing way to say goodbye and thank you to people. The bagels were great. Probably half the guests (and most of those who came from out of town) stopped by to say hi and bye.

You'll notice a couple of standard costs that are not on this list, like hair and make up. I opted to do my own make up and have one of my bridesmaids do my hair. This was so helpful because we ended up having to do my hair in almost total darkness while I fought off the migraine. It also was quite a misty day, so hours of hair would have gone out the window in 20 minutes outside. We all did pretty natural make up that was just more everyone's style in my bridal party. Because I was wearing a dress I had made, I didn't feel much pressure to go all out on make up. I also don't normally wear any make up, so I felt that a little bit went quite a long way compared to my normal. I think it's definitely worth it if you want it. I did purchase waterproof mascara and a new foundation for the event, which are in our miscellaneous costs. We also choreographed our own dance and practiced it in our apartment in the couple weeks leading up to the wedding.

As you can also tell, there was a lot of DIY here, but we focused on what worked with our timelines. What could we do months or weeks in advance (dress making, sign making, etc)? For example, I didn't bake the cakes, even though I was tempted, because I just knew this wouldn't work for us with the rest of the schedule in the days before the event. I would recommend DIY'ing things if you enjoy the crafty side of things, but I wouldn't make yourself do it. For a lot of items, it's not much cheaper to do it yourself, especially if it feels like work.",13,1756335954.0,SanFranciscoWeddings,1,1.0,False
1n1w3oy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n1w3oy,BATTLE FOR TREE‚ÄôS WISDOM 15 ‚ÄúZom-Boned‚Äù,"Welcome to the fifteenth episode of BFTW! I‚Äôd like to thank you all for helping me reaching this milestone! But why is it a milestone? Well, just keep it in mind as you read the episode!

SPADOW: Peashooter is tending to Toag, when Wall Nut talks with Peashooter and ends up befriending him and Toag.

Fun Guys: It seems that most of the drama on Fun Guys has been alleviated, Sun Shroom seems to be upset at how fast the others have gotten over Puff Shroom‚Äôs elimination.

The Logs: Spikeweed decides to betray the saboteurs alliance and tells Threepeater that they were indeed behind everything. Threepeater leaks this information to everyone, exposing Tangle Kelp and Jalepeno.

Shining Stars: Blover feels completely left out since she fell out with Plantern. She ends up coping by ignoring Cactus‚Äô harsh final words and just focusing on when she was filling her ego. 

Team Pult: The team continues to celebrate their immunity streak and all vow to keep it for the honour of their teammates who are not with them.

The Best: With their honour restored, Con Cannon seems genuinely thankful and proud of his team. He seems especially supportive of Imitater, a fact that Spikerock has started to grow jealous of.

Time for SPADOW first elimination in a dozen episode! Congrats for the longest immunity streak ever too!

It seems Snow Pea‚Äôs leadership has paid off as she is safe with 2 votes! Along with Chomper! Repeater, Potato Mine and Cherry Bomb all survive with 1 vote!

Our bottom 2 is Peashooter and Wall Nut with 0 votes, to decide who will be eliminated, let‚Äôs bring in Toag to decide! Whoever Toag rams into first will pushed into the shovel and be eliminated!

Peashooter and Wall Nut both try reasoning with Toag, who somehow ends up staring at both of them. One thing Toag misunderstood however, he was choosing who‚Äôd go, not stay.




Toag mindlessly rams into Peashooter who stumbles helplessly into the shovel, eliminating him as he is unintentionally betrayed by the one who went put of his way to save.

Toag seems pitifully confused as Peashooter suddenly vanishes. No one on SPADOW really knows what to do with it, until Wall Nut stands up and decides to take Toag under its wing. With Toag glaring menacingly at him at the declaration.




Time for the next challenge! Your challenge will be to become the skib- wait‚Ä¶is that‚Ä¶some sort of‚Ä¶ robot zombie‚Ä¶? A zombot, dare I say? Also, who is that bigheaded brainiac maniac piloting this zombie mech? Maybe even a Z-mech?

References aside, the zombie inside the cockpit reveals itself to be Doctor Edgar George Zomboss. He is here to avenge the severe reduction in zombie production this competition has caused. Repeater tries to stand up for his friends, only to be instantly squashed by a fist. He then sends his army of zombies onto the plants.

Everyone then hurries in their own direction, getting zombified one by one. However a select few follow Tree Of Wisdom who ‚Äúknows a place‚Äù. Strangely, Zomboss does not follow them, but holds up what seems to be a piece of paper, a‚Ä¶‚Äùpermit‚Äù‚Ä¶?

After an endless amount of running, they finally found themselves in what seems to be a garden. Here they find what seems to be‚Ä¶the eliminated contestants!? Everyone is here!

Suddenly, a snail approaches them and asks what‚Äôs happening. After he is informed of the recent events, he lets them stay. He introduces himself as Stinky the Snail, the caretaker of Zen Garden, the area where the eliminated contestants are taken. With the reprieve, let‚Äôs catch up with the eliminated contestants!

As they do their newfound past time of yoga, the contestants are revived and reunite!

Coffee Bean sure is there, he‚Äôs been there the longest and he has wings! That‚Äôs cool, right?

Since he‚Äôs been gone, the mysterious hole in Split Pea has evolved into its own head! Who seems a bit‚Ä¶overly friendly.

When Peashooter was sent here, he and Sunflower went to a secret part of the Garden to catch up on everything.

The Pult Brothers reunite! For the first time in 10 episodes, everyone is back! Better yet, since Winter Melon was never officially eliminated, she is given the choice to return to the game. She takes it back and it‚Äôs official, Winter Melon is back!

Something, something‚Ä¶Lily Pad‚Ä¶

Ice Shroom seems to be quite chill as he meditates. Doom Shroom talks to him and says he happy he‚Äôs glad he‚Äôs still competing.

Marigold and Plant Pot work in sync during meditation and seem very happy to be back together.

Gloom Shroom talks with Gatling Pea, Twin Sunflower and Cattail. Spikerock would join in, but is too guilty to look him in the eyes.

No one talks Golden Magnet, not even his own allies bother, genuinely no one likes him, he is the worst.

Torchwood talks to his team and finds out about the traitors, but he says he doesn‚Äôt really care and would rather stay out of competitions for now.

Blover desperately tries to talk to Cactus, but upon realising the girl‚Äôs alliance fell apart without her. She completely ignores her, despite also not being too interested in the yoga.

Puff Shroom and Sun Shroom spend their whole time hanging out and talk and also agree to be an official couple!

With all that jazz out of the way, it‚Äôs time for a twist! Winter Melon will not be the only one rejoining! That‚Äôs right! One more player will rejoin the game! Decided by you viewers!

With that in mind, VOTERS! Despite the circumstances the show must go on! Vote for one of the 14 eliminated contestants to rejoin the game! The one with the most votes will return! But know, only ONE will be rejoining so choose wisely! Voting ends in 3 days and I‚Äôll see you all in episode 16!

PS: Might take a small break, no reason except I really want to and to decide somethings for the show.",1,1756335902.0,ObjectShows,4,1.0,False

I was cleaning out my glove box and I found this cool little time capsule of long-lost and much-loved places I used to eat at on the regular. I thought maybe some of you folks would find it interesting/amusing/nostalgic.

I think that I miss the Vegetarian place most of all, but only because Northern Thai is technically still there. But the Northern Thai menu is from the days of Sonny and Dora, and no meal in the city was more tasty to me than Sonny's Ginger Pork--dude was an artist.

1n1w0gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n1w0gi/cmv_westerners_have_it_too_good_to_revolt_for_the/,CMV: Westerners have it too good to revolt for the Global South.,"The reason why people in the West aren‚Äôt bothering to organize and revolt in any sustainable manner with the expressed goal being to overthrow the global capitalist system, isn‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt know who Karl Marx is, or because they don‚Äôt know about the uneven exchange between the West and the Global South, or because they‚Äôre not aware of the environmental impact that capitalism has on the planet, specifically on people in the Global South.

It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt care.

Westerners have too much to lose to engage in a gruesome struggle against the state on behalf of random people in Congo or Bangladesh that they don‚Äôt know, and they know this. No amount of leftist education is going to change this. Congolese child labor for an iPhone that Westerners can just barely afford has time and time again proven to be an exchange Westerners are 100% willing to make. Vietnamese sweat shop labor for cheap, mass produced clothing is an exchange Westerners have completely normalized and come to expect. 

Pivotal revolutions with international implications have historically been started by people with little to nothing to lose. Despite how much they complain, despite the fact that there could always be improvements, westerners enjoy some of the highest standards of living, working conditions, civil and governmental institutions, domestic human rights standards, healthcare etc on the entire planet. 80% of the world lives on less than $10 a day. Westerners can spend that much in a random cafe on any given day and not break a sweat. Sure, the coffee beans are sourced from poorly paid Brazilian harvesters, but why would a Westerner sacrifice anything for a bunch of Brazilians they‚Äôve never met? 

If Westerners revolt for anything, it‚Äôs going to be for even higher wages and even cheaper products for themselves. Not for child labor victims elsewhere. And because they do not care to work to dismantle the global capitalist framework that they benefit from, this will almost always be at the expense of people in the global south.

So my bf and I have a question. He's not a big coffee person, but always got the cookie crumble frapp, cream based. I know it was removed from the menu officially a few months ago, but here's our question -
You can still order it. So, why is it that when you order it, some baristas just do it normally and like write / add in ""cream based"" , but others are like ""oh, we have to build it then"" and do a Coffee Frapp + mocha + drizzle + whip + topping, etc  ?? Mind you, the ""builded version"" still doesn't even say no coffee ?! üòÇ

He‚Äôs 54, I‚Äôm 33. We‚Äôre both artists‚Äîhe‚Äôs a photographer. I was subletting an apartment in the building next to his, and we became incredibly close. His kids were with his ex wife on vacation when I was there. We hung out every day. We talked about art, family, addiction, loss‚Äîeverything. He taught me so much, and it felt like a truly formative friendship. I wa transparent about my boyfriend. 

The closeness deepened in fall 2023 when he came to New York with his son. He introduced me to his friends, and I met his son. It was the first time I saw him in a different setting, around the people in his life. I‚Äôve always had a boyfriend, and he knew that, but our friendship had this emotional intensity that felt rare. We never crossed physical boundaries, but we always met each other in deep, honest ways.

In summer 2024 we overlapped in Berlin for a day and we watched a movie, went drinking and then he admitted he has never felt this way about anyone since his ex wife.  I didn't know what to say because I was caught off guard. I have a boyfriend.
And we moved on from the topic and it got awkward, but then when he came to New York, a few weeks later, I tried to bring it up to discuss it and set up boundaries, but he denied that he felt that way or that he even said it.

This past summer (2025), we had another round of time together in Berlin. At first, I was cautious‚ÄîI only scheduled an hour with him when I arrived because I didn‚Äôt want to open the floodgates again. But my friends reminded me how special that friendship is, and I decided to see him again. I was also going through a rough time because I finished my gradual program and he used to work as a professor, and he gave me such amazing advice and helps me navigate my career.

The second day we saw each other, we ended up spending the entire day together. He told me about a woman he was seeing casually. We walked around Berlin, had a beautiful talk about family, and for the first time, I let him give me a ride on his bike. It felt symbolic of how safe I felt with him. He dropped me off quickly afterward, and that was the beginning of him becoming distant. It was such a fun day and he even posted a picture of a flower and tagged me on his social media, even though he doesn't post personal life things and then he texted me after and said that it was the best day as well for him

Even though we usually see each other every day when we're in each others cities, he didn‚Äôt reach out the rest of that week. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, so I stepped back too. He sent me a pic of my favorite book he got before I left Berlin but didn't ask to see me again.

 Then, for a month, we barely talked. But he kept checking in every now and then but I guess I felt weird he didn't reach out again since we hung out. (I tried to get coffee a few days before we left but he was busy and then didn't follow up which is unusual).  

A few days ago, I decided to break the silence. I sent him a couple of voice messages‚Äîlight, playful, and real. I talked about how I‚Äôve been deep in writing my novel, how I‚Äôve been hermittimg a bit, and how it feels like ten years since I last saw him (even though it was only a month ago). I laughed, shared some personal updates, and said I missed him. I asked how he was doing and just left the door open for him to respond in any way.

He listened immediately.
Then I saw the ""recording"" signal appear.
Then disappear.
Then it happened again‚Äîhe started recording a voice message‚Ä¶ then stopped.

I just don't get what's going on between us now, why he didn't see me again in Berlin. My friend said he's in love with me but if be is wouldn't  he have seen me again? We've been close friends for two years and I don't get the weird distance anymore, we used to talk every other day.
I just want to know how can I take care of this friendship? And make it normal again I care about him and love him so much.

UPDATE: he responded and said I love you and I was angry you didn't respond but I totally remember u said when I met you that you disappear sometimes. But he spent 10 min just talking about political news and how he's artistic again. Nothing personal lol ",2,1756335539.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

Firstly, Vyvanse is not very effective, like at all. It does little to nothing to help improve my focus/concentration.

I‚Äôm using coffee to mitigate the crash and get me through the day, which isn‚Äôt ideal. At this point, coffee is stronger than Vyvanse.

Hello all, new to this so thank you for reading first off.

Looking to find some like minded people to chat to / play games with and maybe meet up or something more we'll see how it plays out but don't want to jump into things too quickly. Currently most days consist of primarily just working and gaming, but I am open to just chatting and other activities. As far as gaming goes I am not really hard locked to one game or category of games, I've played a wide range from RTS to sim, to ARPG, MMO, indie, party or you name it I have probably played it and there are some gems out there!

Same goes with music, I'm quite happy to listen to every genre, there isn't much I've heard and thought I dislike it, so I am pretty easy going on that front. I also like to play badminton and can't pass up a good coffee, drink them a lot more often then tea and not sure when the last cuppa I had was actually, guess I'm failing the brit test lol.

Think that covers some base points and a few interests, don't want to waffle too much beforehand, I am open to have chat/discussions on pretty much any topic so feel free to reach out on reddit chat if you'd like to converse further and or maybe learn more whether they be meaningful or light-hearted conversations you can choose and I welcome them all and can also share pet pictures if that's something your interested in.
