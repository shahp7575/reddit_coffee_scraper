1ioedna,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ioedna/i_hate_working_at_my_store/,I hate working at my store,"It has been three months since I started working at Starbucks, and this is my first time working as a barista. I‚Äôm quite a reserved person and mostly like to keep to myself. However, from the start, I knew that a few coworkers didn‚Äôt like me working there. I don‚Äôt know what I did to upset them, but I assumed it was just the way things were.

Recently, though, the work environment has become pretty toxic. Some people act like they‚Äôre allergic to my presence in the store, while others seem to treat me like a work mule for the entire shift. There‚Äôs also a lot of backbiting going on. The first time I noticed these things, I tried to address them. I spoke with my coworkers and asked them to let me know if I was doing anything wrong or if there was anything I should improve. I also worked on my behavior‚Äîexpressing gratitude, saying thank you, and appreciating even the smallest things people did around me. However, their behavior hasn‚Äôt changed, and all I want to do is focus on improving my coffee skills and growing as a person.

Today, the only person I consider a work friend told me that most of the shift supervisors hate working with me. I have no idea why. Just last week, I was recognized as Partner of the Week. I don‚Äôt talk much‚ÄîI simply go to the store, do my assigned tasks, and leave. I still don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong or why they seem to dislike me.

Tonight, we had seven people scheduled for closing, yet even after 7:30, I was the only one cleaning the bar, making backups, washing dishes, doing the floors, and managing the drive-thru. There was one other person on the drive-thru bar, while the remaining five‚Äîincluding the shift supervisor‚Äîwere standing in a corner chatting. Despite this, the shift supervisor blamed me for closing five minutes late.

Our store manager is on leave because he recently had surgery, and the replacement supervisor is also on leave. I feel completely lost. What should I do?",1,1739434301.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

As the title suggests, I cheated on my husband of six years with a coworker, but that's not why he wants to end our marriage.

I met my husband at a coffee shop in November 2019. I had accidentally spilled my coffee, and he immediately jumped in to help me clean up the mess. When I looked up at him, I noticed his broad shoulders, sharp jawline, and piercing green eyes. He was clean-cut, kind, and charming‚Äîa total catch.

He offered to buy me another coffee, and though I initially declined, he insisted. We ended up talking, and before I left, I asked for his number. He hesitated for a moment but gave it to me. The rest was history. Our chemistry was undeniable, our intimacy was amazing, and we could talk for hours on end. During COVID, we grew even closer since we spent all of our time together.

However, about a year ago, I started noticing a shift. My husband became distant. Our conversations became shorter, and we started feeling more like roommates than partners.

Then, a new coworker joined my team‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Max. Max was charismatic, confident, and good-looking. He often talked about how he used to be a bouncer and trained in MMA. He had a natural charm, and I won‚Äôt lie‚ÄîI liked the attention. He would compliment my hair, my outfits, even my nails.

One night, Max asked me out for dinner after work. I texted my friend, asking if I should go. When I told her that Max made me feel special, she asked if he was cute. I said yes, and she told me to have fun.

So I did.

After dinner, we went back to his place, and one thing led to another. I hadn‚Äôt been intimate with my husband for over a year at this point. Max made me feel wanted, and I gave in. I slept with him that night‚Äîon the same day as my wedding anniversary, which I deeply regret.

For the next six months, I continued the affair.

Then, last week, I came home from Max‚Äôs place and found my husband sitting at the kitchen table with an envelope in front of him. My heart dropped.

He simply said, ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

He told me he wanted a divorce. I immediately broke down, begging him not to leave. I admitted to cheating, telling him it was a mistake and that I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt him. I offered to go to marriage counseling, therapy‚Äîanything to fix us.

Then he said something that completely shocked me.

He already knew.

Not only that, but he admitted that he had also been having an affair‚Äîfor a year. He had ended it two weeks ago.

‚ÄúI messed up too,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not divorcing you because of the cheating. I was actually hoping you‚Äôd want out first.‚Äù

I was confused and asked why. That‚Äôs when he confessed something even more heartbreaking.

He told me he had been struggling with severe PTSD from his time in the military. He had hidden it well, but he had the paperwork to prove it. Every night, he relived the trauma of losing his friends and being responsible for the deaths of innocent people, including children. The guilt was unbearable, and he couldn‚Äôt live with it anymore.

His plan had been to finalize the divorce, give me everything‚Äîour house, our savings, all of our assets‚Äîso that I would be financially secure. Then, he was going to take his own life.

At that moment, everything else faded. I forgot about my guilt, my shame‚Äîeverything. I just held him and sobbed. I begged him not to do it, telling him I still loved him despite everything that happened.

The next morning, I quit my job, ghosted Max, and rushed home, praying that my husband was still alive.

I found him sitting in his study, staring at his old military medals. He said he was willing to try. We‚Äôre starting therapy next month.

I don‚Äôt know if we can fix our marriage, but I just want him to live.

TL;DR:
I (29F) cheated on my husband (29M) for six months with a coworker. When I confessed, my husband revealed he already knew‚Äîand had also been cheating for a year. However, he wanted a divorce not because of the infidelity but because he was struggling with severe PTSD from his time in the military and was planning to end his life. After hearing his confession, I left my affair partner, quit my job, and chose to stay with my husband to help him through his mental health struggles. We‚Äôre starting therapy next month

I‚Äôm dizzy doing anything (sitting, laying down), headaches, auras, floaters, you name it. 

In addition to that: I woke up this morning, tired obviously, and tried to make a coffee when the ‚Äúmy organs are being squeezed‚Äù pain hit. In my reproductive organs. Couldn‚Äôt walk or sit. First nearly fainted on the toilet, than nearly vomited, and in the end just spit out a bunch of stomach acid. So instead of going to work, I took some ibuprofen and laid down for another hour.

My whole life my parents have been miserable. My dad has been in and out of jobs, making minimum wage, never staying long term while my mom was the bread earner and stable one financially. He also didn‚Äôt lift a finger at home or do any parenting. None of that has changed now they are older except he does try and help me with my kids (his grand kids) briefly. He retired early before retirement age leaving mom to pay bills alone and still doesn‚Äôt light a finger yet at home he doesn‚Äôt see anything she does. She will go to work and come home and cook and he has been home all day going out for coffee and then gardening and expect dinner and dishes done. He is also very verbally abusive and calls her names and puts her down constantly. I have begged her to leave him but she says she is too old now and it‚Äôs too hard. I grew up hating him and not liking him and I am only in his life now as they live together and I have to see him when I see my mom so I am civil with him. I ended up marrying a man who also does no housework or parenting while we both work. At least my husband is the breadwinner but I don‚Äôt know what a healthy relationship looks like as I never saw one growing up. I am currently separated from my husband as I‚Äôm afraid to end up like my parents. I remember my parents always fighting and my mom always crying growing up and nothing has change now.

Prologue to the prologue: Journal Entries

6/6/24 2:08 AM: I did LSD and molly in the forest. I danced to Sublime in the sand. My soul collided with the most beautiful souls I have ever met, as of today. ‚ÄúPleasure to meet you‚Äù is a colossal understatement... I got ready with beautiful girls in a green Coleman tent. I showed up to the Sublime tribute festival, Badfish, with my friend Marley and her family Friday after spending the night before at their house; bedazzling vapes, doing nails, smoking with the boys, and watching Britney Broski on Youtube on Marley‚Äôs iPhone. Friday, we pulled the car into the Ledges, passing the mile long line of hippies who are hysterically aroused by life and the cops searching their cars. Friday, I experienced what I can only call Spiritual Shock. Like culture shock, but instead of your world being turned upside down, it's turned every which way. Friday, I felt community, nonfamilial love, platonic love, basic human decency, and connection for the first time. At least for the first time where it really meant something. Saturday, I wore a green velvet midi skirt I found when rummaging through the attic at my Grandmother‚Äôs house. I paired it with a tube top, made from the bottom of a paisley patterned, earth toned, top. I cut the bottom out so it became one long piece of fabric. I tie this around my chest, my waist is snatched, I am beautiful, my dreams come true. Saturday night, I wore another girl's white skirt. It was cheeky on me, as we‚Äôre both size smalls, but I hold it differently. I wore her white skirt with my white and black striped bikini top. Birkenstocks my cousin owned for years before gifting to me. I bought a waist chain at a vendor. At another, circle John Lennon sunglasses with a gold detailing. ‚ÄúI can see your ass, Mo!‚Äù¬† I checked out my outfit in a mirror that was lying against a tree. I spun and danced so freely, looking beautiful, surrounded by beautiful boys and girls. I have always lived in peace, love, and music. Last weekend, I finally understood what it meant. Last weekend, on the drugs, I peered into everyone‚Äôs soul. All I saw was love and light. I met a beautiful boy. He guided me through my first acid trip. I was also on molly. We call it candy flipping here. He was on molly. This was some *lily-white* molly. Meritorious, clean, strong molly capsules.¬† He has a girlfriend. But I realized, I don‚Äôt *need* Rylie. The beautiful boy said something along the lines of‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSorry, what did you say? Your words are flowing together really well right now.‚Äù Oh my god. I melted. I‚Äôve been chasing the high I felt staring at that bonfire ever since.¬† \*\*‚Äú\*\*One day, I tried methamphetamine... Yeah. That felt good... and I thought, ""This is what's been missing."" I felt complete. Today's a good day. Yeah, I've been chasing that high ever since. No matter... how much meth... or whatever else I can find to shoot up into my body... I do, it's never enough. And I went to a couple of rehabs, I detoxed, they would talk about disease, sure, but... it never clicked. *Until one day I woke up in a hospital and someone asked me, ""What's your problem?"" And I said, ""I'm an alcoholic and an addict."" And he said...""No, that's how you've been treating your problem.""I know now I need to find a way to fill this big black hole in me.‚Äù* \-Beautiful Boy (2018) Lana Del Rey once said ‚ÄúLivin‚Äô like Jim Morrison,‚Äù I‚Äôm living like Jim Morrison‚Ä¶ Like a Louie Dog, like a Sublime song.

5/12/24 1:52 AM: I forgot to take my meds today, or I think I did. It would explain the violent intrusive thoughts I got when I was frustrated at work. In the sweltering heat of my shower, I tilted my head.. Back and forth.. And back and forth.. And back and forth.. And back and forth.. I felt the blood rush to my head. I almost passed out while singing Linger by The Cranberries. Badly, I‚Äôll admit. I sound like Bob Dylan or a shitty pop punk singer when I try to sing with too much emotion. It is so cold tonight. I am wearing my white Nike sweats paired with my white Oscar De La Renta sweater. I would never dream of wearing polyester. My inner Patrick Bateman is peeking out here. What if *I‚Äôm* the American Psycho?¬† I‚Äôm so so tired. It never ends. I think I am binging and starving. I just finished reading Ottessa Moshfegh‚Äôs My Year of Rest and Relaxation. I was her the second I graduated highschool. Except, instead of sleeping those days away, like the unnamed protagonist, I did not sleep for weeks. Somehow, still, this was not my worst insomnia spell. ‚ÄúFor six months, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù -Fight Club (1999)

5/12/24 11:44 PM: Maybe it's because I‚Äôm an only child. Maybe when eyes peer too close to close to the soul, the pedestal crashes and burns. I don't know if I‚Äôll ever have a best friend. I long for one more than I will ever care to admit. Maybe I should lower my standards. Maybe I don‚Äôt get out enough. I love when my lipstick stains my toothbrush. It feels symbolic of something. Something about being conventionally beautiful while living an unconventional life. Something about being conventionally beautiful and all alone. Today was better than yesterday. I need a new book to immerse myself in.. then it will all make sense. I feel so spiritually connected to that 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 12, 13 year old girl staring at the same ceiling I am right now. Clawing at her face. Ripping the hair out of her skull. Begging for a reason. Begging for a best friend. Maybe it‚Äôs never that deep.

6/17/24 2:42 AM: One day, you‚Äôll be cool. Almost Famous is playing on the TV. I am singing along to the best soundtrack, besides Dazed and Confused, ever. When I watched Almost Famous for the first time at eighteen, after years of everyone telling me to,¬† I was fourteen again.. I was fifteen again.. I was sixteen again.. I was seventeen again. When I watched Almost Famous for the first time, I was suddenly back sitting on Joe‚Äôs roof, smoking a cigarette with a Yuengling in my hand, listening to fourteen year old Finn come up with riffs that would impress even Jimmy Page. When I watched Almost Famous for the first time, I was suddenly a sophomore again, telling mom I‚Äôm going on a walk. Only for Joe to be waiting for me at the end of the unmarked, dirt road. I was back in his 1996 Le Sabre, Martha, talking all about how Joe‚Äôs band is gonna make it. I was suddenly back at that picnic table, listening to Joe‚Äôs acid story, wishing to too, one day, hold a houseplant in my hands while repeatedly declaring, ‚ÄúThis is home.‚Äù I was suddenly at Joe‚Äôs house, at band practice, smoking weed out of cans, feeling like I have a friend group for the first time in my lonesome life. ‚ÄúI always tell the girls never take it seriously, if you never take it seriously you never get hurt, if you never get hurt you always have fun, and if you ever get lonely just go to the record store and visit your friends.‚Äù ‚Äï Cameron Crowe, [Almost Famous](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/264422) (2000). My favorite movie. Forever. Not the *best* movie, my *favorite* movie. I am missing my rockstar past. My rock-n-roll adolescence. The boys. The beer. Permanently damaging my ears because I was too cool for earplugs. I laid my head against the amps and felt the grunge music wrap around my bones. I opened my phone every other week to a new song from the band I was in platonic love with. I was never really a groupie‚Äìa band-aid‚Äìas Penny Lane says in Almost Famous. We were never famous, almost. It is frightening how many different boys‚Äô songs are in my phone, in my voice memos. The voice memos on my phone document each catalyst to my downfall, each love, each friend. Each band I have had the pleasure of band-aiding. I often think of that boy who lived on the next dirt road, who (him and our friends) introduced me to the dynamic of a band. I think he is still in high school. He is younger than I yet has always held more wisdom and talent than I know what to do with. I think of my eighteenth birthday at his house. The following day he sent me a voice memo. I think of all the acoustics he wrote, but never released. Last I heard, he is mostly in the studio making electronic music now. But then, on April 15, 2023, an acoustic was born. The lyrics have always motivated the tears behind my eyes, they use all their strength to break down the barrier when I hear the words‚Äì

¬†‚ÄúApril fifteen

¬†Felt sixteen

Four grams in my pocket

Brainfreeze

New feelings

Blast off like a rocket

Life was so beautiful

Now I feel like I‚Äôm nothing

Changing together

Now, boys, wasn‚Äôt that something?

And we cry, cry, cried

In each other's arms‚Äù

\-Sheetz 9, a voice memo from Finn

Prologue:

Teal by Wunderhorse, a nightlight in my darkest corners:

I'll always remember the time that we met

It was somebody's party

You were wearing a black dress

Clinging to shadows

Chameleon-esque

And we were together, when we were fifteen

But nothing is real then, you know what I mean?

I slept with that dancer, I didn't mean it

It was all in a dream babe, all in a dream

All in a dream

Sorry

And I hadn't seen you in a couple of years

You'd been at the doctors

You called me in tears

""Jacob baby I'm broken, I can't be fixed

They think it's my kidneys, they don't know what it is

And how could this happen man, I'm just a kid

I've got something to live for, and so much to give

Now I live in a basement, a blade at my wrist

I think this is over, I think this is it

What if this is it?

And all of your friends, they say that they need you

When you need them they just get up and leave you

One of them said ""I don't care if this kills you""

What if it did Katie?

What if it killed her?

What would you do then?

Hope you'd be sorry

Hope you'd go to her grave, apologize for me

All the time that she gave you

Every time you were worried

That's 'cause she was your friend

Hope that you're sorry, yeah

Truly

And when I was using, she still said she loved me

Be more of a human, less of a junkie

You got a gift man, go and be something

If I was in your shoes, I would be jumping

And that's when I felt it, it conquered my heart

It was the light of a candle, in the depths of the dark

And there was a fire, it danced in your eyes

A beautiful world and a beautiful mind

This is not only an autobiography, but an ode to all of the media, music, film, art, poetry, that has saved my life. An ode to the twenty-seven club‚Ä¶ that I certainly don‚Äôt wish to join. Is my sarcasm shining through? I wish to go out to Exit Music (for a film) by Radiohead. I masturbate to music instead of porn. I write songs to heal my inner child. As a baby, I could only sleep if Roger Waters or Jerry Garcia was playing softly. Every time I want to die, there is a song to describe exactly how I am feeling, exactly what I am going through. I am music. You are music. We are just unwritten songs. Oh, the strength of strings.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Ma, you're looking at all the trees, and I'm not even in the forest.‚Äù

¬†‚Äï Elizabeth Wurtzel, [Prozac Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/892616)

‚ÄúPay attention to your surroundings, close your eyes, try to remember what was there beyond the darkness.. before the ketamine.. and then open your eyes,‚Äù said Austin, the kid in the dinosaur suit, ‚ÄúROOAAARRR! EVERYBODY ROAR! I PROMISE IT FEELS SO GOOD ON THE K!‚Äù Always listen to the kid in the dinosaur suit.¬†

A message from my penpal, Athena:‚Äù I‚Äôm so grateful. I am listening to the dead in the car. Casey Jones (Live January 17, 1979.) Imagine dancing with bare feet in the grass to Jerry Garcia with pretty bells and long flowy skirts and flowers in our hair, and I'm just imagining dancing.‚Äù

Going to California by Led Zeppelin plays faintly on the TV. ‚Äú...Smoked my stuff... Drank all my wine... Someone told me there‚Äôs a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair...‚Äù Engulfed in nostalgia, engulfed in smoke, on the same roof where old friends and I would get high when everything was new and sensational. I am fifteen years old for a few minutes everyday when I sit here. The thrill of youth remains a part of my soul but I'm aging rapidly and leaving claw marks on my adolescence, as I strum my days away and the song remains unsung.¬†

‚ÄúMusic is your only friend until the end‚Äù -When the Music‚Äôs Over, The Doors.¬†

When I tripped on shrooms for the first time, I wandered outside. I felt the fresh late night air. It was maybe 3 AM. It was a relatively warm night, but I remember wearing uggs. The trees were still green. I don‚Äôt remember what month it was, just that I was 18 and with high school friends Morgan, Sebastian, and Caden H. That‚Äôs what happens when you binge on nitrous, when you get into drugs early, when your mental illness goes untreated for too long‚Ä¶ You forget things. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the little things.‚Äù Especially when they‚Äôre all one can remember. I remember I played Echoes by Pink Floyd and The Murder Mystery by the Velvet Underground for the uncultured swine. Perhaps that‚Äôs why I only ever saw Morgan once more, the others never again. I stumbled outside, my head looking straight up at the black, vast sky, twinkling stars shining only for me. This was Utica, Pennsylvania. You can see every last constellation. I looked up at the stars, I called the man who statutory raped me and groomed me at 17. He did not answer. I tried to call my high school best friend, to no avail. I saw hieroglyphs on the ceiling. I only ever saw them again on DMT. Yes, those were some good shrooms. Yes, it was a good trip. That night my loneliness turned to solitude. I‚Äôve never had a bad trip, just messages from the universe. Reasons to change. That old head deadhead acid was weird, though. I can‚Äôt wait to tell that story.

¬†When I tripped on shrooms for the first time I tried to call you, the last time I thought I needed someone was when you didn't pick up. I never really needed you, but it was nice seeing you. There is a dust bunny of you in this room that won't stay in the vacuum. It doesn‚Äôt cling to me anymore.. But it's there. You rang months later, I hadn‚Äôt thought of it since that night. A piece of me died in a mother‚Äôs bedroom, a piece of you pierced my chest with hand-rolled cigarettes and unkempt promises. Your friends understand you the same way you understood me. I didn‚Äôt think anyone else could until my damn near death. Maybe this time around I won‚Äôt call them every time I have a tangible problem. My life is one long list of see you laters and empty white lighters.

I stay up thinking of things I could‚Äôve said to old women at the supermarket to make their day. Once I could not afford a fur coat at the thrift store. An old woman paid the five dollars for me. I see her every time I am there shopping. I imagine the disappoint she‚Äôd feel if she knew I was fucked up every time she saw me. I think of compliments to give strangers. They always compliment me. I‚Äôd form the words if I didn‚Äôt have work in twenty.¬† I feel music in the palms of boys' hands.. girls‚Äô hands‚Ä¶ if only I could hold on a little longer the song would write itself. I have rollers in my hair and I am lighting a cigarette on the stove. Opening my wallet is a gamble. Why is that two dollar bill rolled up? What is that baggie? I don‚Äôt know, officer. I just work here. Dust in a Baggie by Billy Strings is a great tune‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúMy tweaker friends have got me to the point of no return.‚Äù

I think I am polyamorous and in love with three people. I touched myself thinking about three different people while ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôve Been Loving You‚Äù by Led Zeppelin blared. I am so wet. There are sparkles in my eyes and in between my thighs. I only feel true love when I orgasm. Why? I am in my prime. ‚Äú...But what am I to do with all this beauty?‚Äù -Liquid Smooth, Mitski.¬†Lizzy Grant said, ""My life is my poetry, my love-making is my legacy.""

I¬† am curling my bangs to our song, drinking less caffeine like you decided to do. I‚Äôll grow up too. I‚Äôm just nineteen and it‚Äôs all so trivial. I‚Äôd say every car looks the same when I think about your name. All I think about is my next hit or lay. I need a thousand bucks today. Here lies: running out of lies, running out of places to hide.¬†

You can‚Äôt just continue burying your pain and your issues and the fact that sometimes you‚Äôre a horrible person in the sand like it‚Äôs a bag of weed you‚Äôre hiding from mom in the sandbox. You are abusing irony and drugs and sex and lethal coping mechanisms to forget that you have to do this for the rest of your life. You are sick for the rest of your life. You are bipolar for the rest of your life. Your heart will be bursting with love for the rest of your life.¬†

‚ÄúLove is awful. It‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs painful. It‚Äôs frightening. It makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself, distance yourself from the other people in your life. It makes you selfish. It makes you creepy, makes you obsessed with your hair, makes you cruel, makes you say and do things you never thought you would do. It‚Äôs all any of us want, and it‚Äôs hell when we get there. So no wonder it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt want to do on our own. I was taught if we‚Äôre born with love then life is about choosing the right place to put it. People talk about that a lot, feeling right, when it feels right it‚Äôs easy. But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true. It takes strength to know what‚Äôs right. And love isn‚Äôt something that weak people do. Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope. I think what they mean is, when you find somebody that you love, it feels like hope.‚Äù

¬†\-Fleabag (2016)

¬†I look around me and all I see is the product of my environment. I want to shoot something up. Lou Reed is speaking to me through the TV. I am sober but I don‚Äôt know where I am. I know where I am when I am fucked up. There is so much trash in this room. You cannot walk. Make a path. That‚Äôs what Ethan, my step dad, always said!¬† I thought it skipped a generation? Well, grandpa is a hoarder... There is so much pain in the world, but not in this room. My hair, which has been in a middle part since the year 2018, is so greasy I am condemned to have it put in a disgusting side part behind my ear. Do not pity me. I love myself. A social worker at the psych ward tried to tell me I don‚Äôt love myself *unconditionally* because I have episodes where I don‚Äôt believe it. I tried to kill myself two days ago and *this* is the thanks I get?¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt point your fucking finger at crazy people!‚Äù -Lisa, Girl Interrupted (1999).¬†

In the thick of my adolescence I was sent to you to learn a lesson. Something about commitment. We‚Äôre the types to keep old wrappers and movie tickets. Glue them to journal entries. The types who have a Reebox shoe box under the bed full of memories and trash. We‚Äôre the types to fall in love and never say a word until one of us is on the tracks and the other hears the whistle blow. At least I am. I lit your first cigarette and I finally knew what they meant. When I was using, you still said you love me. You sunk your teeth into me, bit off that piece, when I¬† couldn‚Äôt feel anything for anyone but me. I never really needed your help. A knife in my side carves the words unspoken. If you stay, I‚Äôll fulfill your darkest fantasies, do the dishes until the ocean washes my lifeless body away. I take things too seriously, all your friends seem to hate me, that addict brain buzzes like a bee.. I‚Äôll take Jack Daniel to work with me.

Chapter One: One Trick Pony

I want to dedicate this book and my life to Papa, a man who raised me into the person I am today. No,¬† I want to dedicate this book to my entire family‚Ä¶ Rylie, Nate, Caden, Kronk, Marley and her family, Brooklyn and her family. If people leave my life throughout the process of writing this, that‚Äôs okay. I expect it. That is kind of the point of this. Relationships ebb and flow. I am only almost twenty.

The air smells of budweiser and mildew, a sense of nostalgia only recognizable to those born into poverty. Faded by a decade of cigarette smoke, the thin kitchen curtains invite a ray of sunshine into the room. The sun formulates unidentifiable, yet beautiful apparitions in its glare.. Like a babe in the woods. As I pour yesterday morning‚Äôs coffee into the ant-infested sink, Papa enters the room and turns to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful out there, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he says, as we share an unspoken, yet sublime appreciation for the sun we will soon take for granted as winter wakes her weary head. Sphinx, one of our many cats, peers from the windowsill. With her head, she opens the curtains. The sun blinds me for a split second‚Äì and for a split second, all's right with the world. The sun, not blinding me with its rays, but with what its appearance represents. A moment so insignificant and short-lived, bringing mortality into view. My life flashes before my eyes like old film. Memories once hidden behind my subconscious ego come rushing back to me, as if my body and soul have been dropped into the Atlantic ocean. A reminder that the ocean‚Äôs waves never sleep, they simply keep moving forward. We could all learn a thing or two from the sea‚Ä¶ Everything, everywhere, all at once... Every little thing we spend our lives searching for is right before us. Life is a magic eye poster of clarity. We simply must squint our eyes and open our hearts to what the universe is so desperately trying to teach us.

Hello, NA.. or AA‚Ä¶ or SAA‚Ä¶ or whatever kind of meeting this is. Pleasure to meet you. Think of this as a nonfiction version of Bojack Horseman‚Äôs One Trick Pony, without the fame ‚ÄùOh my god! Why would you compare yourself to him! Bojack is a terrible person!‚Äù Precisely. I am a terrible person and I love myself way more than I could ever love you. Have you ever met someone who wants to do heroin? Specifically to ‚ÄúHeroin‚Äù by The Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd‚Äôs ‚ÄúComfortably Numb‚Äù guitar solo? ‚ÄúLiquor before beer, never fear, Don't Do Heroin.‚Äù -Bojack Horseman (2016). Allow me to interject with a story‚Äìthis October, at Gory, the Halloween festival at Nelson Ledges, I was given molly that turned out to be meth. When my friends and I discovered it was in fact meth, we threw the remainder into the quarry. As we did, I screamed ‚ÄúLiquor before beer, never fear, Don‚Äôt Do Meth!‚Äù I am getting ahead of myself. I know you are overwhelmed. This story will be chronological soon enough.¬†

A 26 year old addict, who has done drugs harder than me at higher quantities, Nate, who you‚Äôll learn more about when we get to my adult life, said to me recently, ‚ÄúI would be in the ER fighting for my life right now if I did what you‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶ Even that shit from the vape story will bring you down. I say this out of love, I have seen it happen in the short time I‚Äôve known you.‚Äù¬†

I am telling this story first‚Äîbefore you see how every little action, decision I have made has brought me to this moment, before you understand these characters‚Äîas it is integral to understand me.¬†

The night I knew Nate was going to be in my life forever, even just as a friend, we were tripping on acid together. I don‚Äôt remember how many tabs. An old deadhead who went to Woodstock, or something, gave him it at a Billy Strings show, or something. The whole weekend is blurred. That weekend was the druggiest time of my life. It was Monday, the festival ended Sunday morning. Even Tut left after our talk in the car. Nate paid for mine and my boyfriend, Kory's, extra night. We had only met once before. That might be my favorite story, but we‚Äôll get to that later. Nate only met Kory that day. My boyfriend‚Äîwho passed out in the tent after almost dying by taking a benzodiazepine as a *fucking* alcoholic‚Äî *frightened* me on the acid. Allow me to reiterate, it was not a bad trip. During the trip I felt *uncomfortable*. Like someone was *caressing* my bones, getting more and more *conniving* with their touch, as each thought *crept* its way into my conscious and subconscious mind. Claws with dirty fingernails *gently* *scraping* my eyes. Not hard enough to leave a mark, but hard enough to blind me for a moment in time. More so my brain than my bones. Probably doesn‚Äôt help that I was on meth two nights before.. Thank you Devon. Thank you Tut. I can‚Äôt wait to tell Kronk‚Äôs story of that weekend. I felt as though Nate had just saved Kory‚Äôs life and I just trauma bonded with these people I just met after being alone for a year. I felt my ego be slashed with a million swords, fall to bits, and be dispersed through the quarry, all through the Ledges. A small piece landed on Nate. Maybe a sliver reached Kronk at home. I had my Tower Moment, as they say in Tarot. It is impossible to describe psychedelics.

¬†Nate and I are in his car. It is a chilly, October night. We are at Nelson Ledges, Ohio. Surrounded by nature, water, drugs, addicts, violence, halloween costumes, self expression, peace and love. The heat is up the whole way. He is dressed as shaggy from Scooby-Doo, a childhood favorite for the both of us. He is wearing an alpaca fur Grateful Dead dancing bear jacket on top. I am wearing a Grateful Dead terrapin alpaca fur poncho and patchwork hippie pants from Etsy. His scents are nag champa and patchouli. Those are *my* scents. There are squishmellows and water bottles and whippet nozzles everywhere. We both are talking about our outfits. We are the best dressed of any group. I had never felt more at home. He is making sure I am comfortable. Not like others do. On a deep, spiritual level, I felt *comfortable*. This didn‚Äôt absolve the weird trip. I would repeatedly go into the tent and lay with Kory for a moment or so, but each time I did, I felt worse, expecting to feel better. It was a time loop, like Kory experienced in his k-hole. When I‚Äôm back in the nice, warm car, Nate is playing every psychedelic comfort song I love without me even telling him. Every song I want to hear on acid and nitrous. He introduced me to how psychedelic and romantic nitrous can be. Don‚Äôt do nitrous. He was doing duster. Sudden death is a side effect sometimes. He was off a couple bars of Xanax, snorting blow off this large polished crystal his rock-obsessed buddy made, all while tripping with me. Tut came in the car and we all puff-puff-passed the tank of nitrous. Nate and I played ‚ÄúDark Star‚Äù (Live at Fillmore West) by the Grateful Dead for Tut. It is twenty or so minutes of pure ecstasy. I said, ‚ÄúTut, if you try to listen to and understand any of the boring songs I put you on, it better be this one. Just try to listen. Let the whippets guide you through the music.‚Äù Nate briefly, respectfully, put his hand on my thigh. I remembered how it felt to be 5, with the early morning birds going ‚ÄúooOoOooo‚Ä¶ooOoooo‚Ä¶caa‚Ä¶.caa‚Ä¶.,‚Äù as Pocketful Of Sunshine plays on the music station on the big box TV. Early morning bus riders, writing ‚Äúfuck school‚Äù in the fog, when grandpa showed up to my choir concerts. Nate touched my thigh and I remembered that I am alive and why I am alive. What can you do when he has ‚Äúcoexist‚Äù tattooed on his neck, an anarchy symbol tattooed on his face, another face tattoo of a spilt wine glass, the wine being his pink birthmark, a tattoo of his DMT vision, a weed leaf. What can you do?

Kory and I yapping over each other, on the molly-meth and ketamine, a transcript from a video on my camera roll. October 20, 2024 1:22 AM. Ventura highway is playing in the background and someone is playing guitar along. ‚ÄúNelson Ledges 2024! Me and Moravia are officially dating! And we are on awesome ketamine thanks to this awesome fella. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! And Kronk! Shout out Kronk! Listen if you‚Äôre watching this from the future, you‚Äôre awesome and I love you. You are amazing and you are beautiful. Listen, I know, life‚Äôs stressful, I know.. I understand.. But like, hey, you're talking to the right guy right now, because I am you and you are me. Like bro. Just fucking work and get your money, man. Like, that‚Äôs all you need and for god sake! Just take a load off, stop trying to be so stressed about everything, you cannot control every aspect of your life. Just need to take a load off sometimes. Okay!

My name is Moravia Rebecca Jane Beach. I am an ADHD, bipolar, possibly schizo, alcoholic and addict. I am currently listening to ‚ÄúJunkhead‚Äù from the 1992 Alice in Chains album ‚ÄúDirt.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?‚Äù Caden P said to me, ‚ÄúYou have more stories than anyone I ever know.‚Äù I later said to this guy, Haden, ‚ÄúI have lived every different life. No one knows my whole story.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I decided to write an autobiography. I almost died twice these past few months. I should die every time I get in the car with a blacked out driver.

I've visited three times now: twice with a joiner tour from travel agency in Manila, and my most recent trip was purely DIY.

As always, I had a great time, but there were a few bumps along the way (no pun intended). So, I'm writing this partly out of spite‚Äîcharot! ü•≤  But seriously, no matter where you're headed, PREPARE AND RESEARCH ‚ÄºÔ∏èbefore going. It will save you from unnecessary hassle and, frankly, keep you from bothering other travelers‚Äîbecause honestly, that's just annoying. üôÉ

‚ö†Ô∏èLong post ahead! This is a comprehensive guide for DIY travel. If you want the most convenient option, book through a travel agency. But personally, I prefer having control over my own time and itinerary.

üöåHow to Get to Sagada from Manila:
1. Via Cubao ‚Äì Book online through Codaline's partner platform. You can also try walk-in, but there's no guarantee you'll get your preferred schedule. Be at the terminal at least 1 hr before departure and bring a printed copy of your booking confirmation as it serves as your ticket. Travel Time: 11‚Äì12 hours

2. Via Baguio ‚Äì Take a bus from PITX or Cubao to Baguio, then another bus to Sagada. (I haven‚Äôt tried this route yet).
Travel Time: 5‚Äì6 hours to Baguio, plus 5-6hrs to Sagada

‚úÖÔ∏è Tip: It‚Äôs a looong ride, so pack smart!
- Bring a neck pillow and eye mask for comfort.
- Take Bonamine if you get dizzy easily.
- Book a bus with a CR, as stopover toilets cost ‚Ç±10 and are usually not clean.

üõå Where to Stay in Sagada:
There are plenty of options, but I recommend staying near the Tourist Information Center (TIC) for convenience.

Cheapest Options: Homestays and inns

Isabelo's ‚Äì ‚Ç±1,200/night for 2 pax, with a private CR but no breakfast. You can add ‚Ç±220/pax for breakfast. I stayed here recently, and it was fairly decent. They provide basic amenities: soap, towel, heater, and fan. If rooms are available, they allow early check-in for free, and you can leave your luggage at the lobby.

Other Options (Farther from TIC):
- Pinewood Lodge ‚Äì 1k/night
- George Guesthouse ‚Äì 1k/night
- Misty Lodge ‚Äì 2k/night

‚úÖÔ∏è Tip: Isabelo's offers water refill for 10php (1L). Better if you can find a homestay that provides drinking water for free. Or you can buy a 4L jug from the convenience stores. 

üìù What to Expect and Do Upon Arrival in Sagada:

Once the bus drops you off, go to the Tourist Information Center (TIC), follow these steps:

1. Register and Present a Valid ID
2. Pay the Registration Fee ‚Äì 100/pax
3. Attend the Tourist Orientation ‚Äì They‚Äôll provide a brochure w/ the available activities. You‚Äôll also watch a short video on the activities and general rules in Sagada.
4. (Optional) Get Insurance ‚Äì 50/pax for 1‚Äì2 days, 100/pax for more than 3 days

‚úÖÔ∏è Tips:
- Bring enough cash and load up your GCash, as some restaurants and stores accept GCash payments.
- Reserve your cash for tour fees and transpo within the town
- Tricab/tuktuk fare costs 25/pax minimum
- There‚Äôs an ATM in the TIC and a few others farther down the road, but don‚Äôt rely on them being operational.

‚õ∞Ô∏è Tour Guides and Activities in Sagada: 
Tour Guides are required for all activities, except at privately owned tourist spots (ex. Sagada Weaving, Pottery, Ganduyan Museum).

Finding joiners can be challenging, especially for solo travelers or pairs. You‚Äôll have better luck on weekends when there are more tourists or by connecting with fellow travelers upon arrival. 

‚úÖÔ∏è Tips:
- Plan Ahead ‚Äì Choose your preferred activities and have a flexible itinerary. Go to the tour operators and ask if you can join others to split the cost.
- Be Prepared ‚Äì If no joiners are available, be ready to shoulder the full cost (guide and shuttle fees).
- Pace Yourself ‚Äì Most tours are physically demanding. Don‚Äôt cram too many activities into one day.

üåª Popular Activities:

1. Paytokan Trail ‚Äì Includes Echo Valley and more. (The underground river is a new addition.)

2. Bomod-Ok Falls ‚Äì 1‚Äì2 hours of trekking with lots of stairs. Wear comfy clothes and shoes.

3. Marlboro Hills ‚Äì 4‚Äì5 hours of trekking; trails can be muddy in the morning.

4. Caving/Spelunking ‚Äì Expect crawling, climbing, and walking through cold water.

- Sumaguing Cave - 1-2 hours 

- Lumiang Cave - 3-4 hours (more challenging) 

Wear: Light clothing (e.g., leggings, dri-fit shirts), rubber slippers or sandals (not shoes or Sandugo).

Bring: A small waterproof bag for essentials (phone, money, first aid, keys). The guide will bring a large light, but a headlamp is also useful.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not for the faint-hearted, but it‚Äôs an incredible adventure if you‚Äôre up for it‚ÄîI enjoyed this the most! 

Bring salonpas/ointment or painkillers. You'll probably need it after. 

ü•ì Where to eat in Sagada:
Price Range: 200‚Äì400 per meal. It‚Äôs a bit pricey, but portions are usually enough.

Budget Options:
- Cook your own meals if your homestay allows it.
- Eat at the public market ‚Äì Silog meals cost around 180php.

üçΩ Top Restaurant Picks:
1. Salt N Pepper Diner ‚Äì Etag sisig, etag calzone, etag pizza
2. Kalajo ‚Äì Kalajo rice (fried chicken, lechon kawali, veggies, and rice)
3. Bana's Coffee ‚Äì Coffee, desserts, and silog meals
4. Tam Tam Cafe Jr. ‚Äì Honey latte
5. Eduardo's ‚Äì Pizza pretzel and pesto cheese sticks
6. Marie's Yoghurt ‚Äì Blueberry yoghurt parfait
7. Piitik Wine - bugnay wine 

Other notable places:
- Log Cabin - good food but expensive and the service was bad and slow

- Gaia Cafe - amazing views, food was so-so, service was slow

Most restaurants and stores in Sagada close by 9 PM, so plan your meals accordingly.

‚úÖÔ∏è Tip: Instead of riding the tricab, you can ride the ordinary bus to Baguio near the Church so you can go to farther restaurants like Ganduyan Inatep and Isangwow Cafe. Bus fare is 20php. 

üõç Pasalubong recos:
Pashmina scarf, etag, veggie chips, Arabica coffee, honey üçØ

üí∏ Budget
1. Bus w/ CR (one-way) - around 1600/pax incl online fees
2. Homestay - 1000/night for 2 pax
3. Meals - around 200-300/pax/meal
4. Tour fees - refer to the tour brochure. Find joiners to split the cost.
5. Other expenses to consider: reg fee, insurance, tricab transpo, pasalubong 

üéí Itinerary Tips
Typically, you can do 3D2N in Sagada and fit in 2-3 activities already. Personally, I think 3 nights is ideal. You can do the more tiring activities in the first 2 days then spend the next day to recover and relax. 


And there you go! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

If you‚Äôve made it this far, yay! Thanks for sticking around. I hope this guide helps you on your journey to Sagada. üå•

If I missed anything or you have more questions, feel free to drop a comment!

Thanks for reading and happy travels! üíó

1iodqin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1iodqin/my_birthday_went_kind_of_shit/,My birthday went kind of shit.,"Im just a little disappointed, yesterday was my birthday and ive had a tradition with my mom that my birthday is the day we go out and have a day. Buying clothes, eating lunch.. usually we do this in the city centre, where there are lots of stores and actual lunch places to sit.

This year we were already changing up our plans, we were gonna go for a hike and i was incredibly excited, but this got cancelled last minute because of the weather (which turned out to be a light drizzle and nothing extreme) So we were gonna go out like usual.. but this also got changed last minute and we ended up going to a mall that had like 2 stores.

I'll be honest when i was asked of my opinion i said i was rather dissapointed, at this point the plan had changed so many times i just wanted a sandwhich and a cup of coffee because thats what i was looking forward to.. But i was immediately called a spoiled brat and was told to shut up.. We ended up at a fish store, even though its known i dont like fish. Not only that but they messed up our order 2 times, and the place itself looked filthy (sticky table with fish from the last 4 customers stuck to it, sticky floors, old stains and dust all around) 

I dont know im just incredibly dissapointed in the day, i still had somewhat fun but it wasnt at all what i wanted for my birthday.. by the time we were done we also kind of ran out of the time to do the things i actually wanted to do, and now im just left sad and like the day was wasted..

I'm gonna try to let the stoopid thoughts pour out without overthinking all my mannerisms... Okei day, here we go!

Boop! Helloo again ASD section of Reddit. You have been one of my only homes on any platform as of late where I did not immediately overstay my welcome. Or well.. at the least it feels harder here to push everyone away for once though I imagine that won't last. It never really does... Heck, if this post isn't ignored like I am all the stinking time, maybe it will be the one that cooks my metaphorical goose. I um, I wanted to make a post or two somewhere to act as a record of my having existed. I purged most of my old accounts so I exist almost nowhere online anymore. Had to, people **really** found me annoying and I was sick of it.

Onto the real reason for doing this. I finally, **finally** decided to post in a place I almost never considered posting. Have been trying to do this as of the late so that the real Mia has a chance to live a little. Fun, open, explorative, playful Mia not the.. repulsive *thing* that I am. Here's the rub if you will. Any time I fail to channel that part of myself I screw us over biiiig time. It's not quite dissociative identity disorder stuff. I'm not a system with the other ""Mia's"" I just lack the vocabulary to put thought to word any more succinctly. My neurodivergences when coupled with all the trauma I went through are trapping me inside my own head.

I knew the post was annoying. I knew I was overthinking the heck out of it.. letting too many of the annoying parts of myself out. It's always like that when the cool part of my mind is sleeping away. I make some garbage pretentious sounding post about non-euclidean bull shit in a kink subreddit. Or heck, some meandering pile of word salad that lingers not unlike passed gas in a crowded elevator. Short posts Mia. Short posts. Boy howdy am I screwing that up with this one though! Because my ability to mask right now or let the real me out is borked forked and storked so you get this pile of ick.

I can't even type correctly...  let alone communicate with real people. I'm a confident, sassy, open, extroverted entity trapped inside the body of a useless loser. Bleh, I'm probably going to regret this unhinged vent of feist in the later times. I only did it because when I looked up having the true version of yourself trapped inside your mind thanks to your disabilities I got nadda. Quite the opposite. I seem to posses this unnaturally potent sense of self that pretty much no one ever relates with.   
  
Gonna go sod off and make more coffee now.. Try to keep the dark thoughts away. Those have been getting bad lately because of this and I hide it from everyone. I think about attempting almost every moment of every day but I can mask it away until it goes unnoticed. Just.. forgive my wall of words and letters. I don't need advice nor help, am too far gone. You can boop me though if you wanna, I do like to observe the experiences of others so so very much. Bye bye and sorry sorry again.",4,1739431399.0,AutismInWomen,1,0.75,False

1iodowc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wbpolitics/comments/1iodowc/for_cpim_people_who_are_in_delusion_still/,For CPIM people who are in delusion still.,"An advice to CPIM party workers and supporters that you might take up rather than talking in circles.

First, break out of the pseudo-Traditionalism that has been fostered at your respective, State's high commands. 

Secondly, stop promoting people who cant translate their ""political prowess"" outside of Social media, ie. Swatarup in Bengal. 

Thirdly, update yourselves. Get in tune with what is happening. In the current world, even hinting at prospects like, ""[complete elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cpi-m-manifesto-promises-to-dismantle-indias-nukes-rajnath-singh-reacts-5461865)"" will lose you vote. Don't try to change the rhetoric that's running wild, instead, use aspects of it to make a statement. 

Fourth, start coming out of your shells. The cultural identity of Marxists and Left Wing people in general have been stereotyped, caricatured to oblivion. Use the resources your party has to try and mend that to whatever extent you can. 

Fifth, Fighting casteism, social evils, traditionalist orthodoxy isn't the same as fighting religion. Organized religion will outlast every political force, and there is nothing you can do about that. Attacking someone's faith doesn't bode well for you.

Sixth, your ideology is still stuck in the 20th Century. It is European in its origin and philosophy. Understand that before trying to change the fabric of Indian beliefs. The way a certain group of [pseudo-Liberal Left wingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYfBT6GVBJs) behave has harmed your image. And you know what is the worst part, none of your party members have condoned that behavior because you fear that you will isolate the base who actually votes you.

Seventh, Start cleaning up your acts. The old guard can only give you advice, usher in a new generation of people who actually behave like left wingers. Not pseudo-liberal borda bordis.

Generations of my family were Communists, but that stops with me unless you break your rigid stances and acknowledge that reforms are needed. ACT LIKE A POLITICAL PARTY RATHER THAN ACT LIKE A COFFEE TABLE DISCUSSION GROUP.

I lost my soul cat Coffee on the 25th last month, after 17.5 years together. I got him when I was 9 and I only realized recently in all the grieving he's been with me most of my life. It's been hard, way harder than I imagined since I've dealt with death a lot from a young age. Kind of figured I had the grieving process locked down but this has been a lot more difficult than I ever could have imagined. 

It's complicated. You have the usual traumas associated with pet loss, things like processing the rapid deterioration, guilt and what-ifs and wondering if it was preventable, having to make the decision to put them down which is hard enough in the best case scenario, but even worse if it has to be made suddenly. There's also all the little habits I've developed over the years related to him that have carried on up until I remember he isn't here anymore.

There's also other variables. I have CPTSD. I am living in an environment where a lot of the abuse has been allowed to continue because I'm disabled and can't get out on my own yet. Coffee was the only good thing I had living here and he was my rock. He was by all means my emotional support animal. I've started having nightmares every night again. I feel completely alone. TW for talk about euthanasia and mention of emotional abuse: >!I think the worst part is when we went to put him down, He started having seizures suddenly so I know there was nothing else we could do. He acted fine with the catheter, but when the vet started approaching him with the first dose before even getting near him he began moving his arms and trying to cover the port up, almost like he knew what was happening, and was fighting against it. I feel like I killed my cat. And even though my emotionally abusive father relented when the seizures started happening it doesn't help that he has been accusing me of wanting to kill my cat just because I've made it clear I'm not willing to let him suffer a slow, painful death just because I'm not willing to let go, as if he's more important to me as something that provides me comfort more than a living breathing creature that deserves dignity and respect, back when he first started getting sick. I know it was the right thing to do. I know that was evil, manipulative BS, but it's been stuck in my head regardless.!<

That's not the main point of this post, I just feel like I've been keeping all of this inside and its eating at me and I haven't been able to talk to my therapist about it yet, which probably is not helping matters, but I digress.

We were lucky enough to find an affordable place to take care of him. We're even having a viewing tomorrow to say our goodbyes before he's cremated. It's a lot more than any other place offered for the same price range and it's a lot more than I ever thought I could do for him. I'm incredibly grateful. 

**They also have a website with means to upload photos and make a ""pet tale"" and that's where I'm at now.** I haven't touched any of this stuff until now because it's been too much, but it still feels like it is. I don't think it's necessary to complete beforehand, it's not like it's an actual funeral the story is going to be printed out for, and I know it's for my comfort, but I feel like this is one of the last things I'll ever get to do for him. It's something I deeply want to do, but there's also so much pressure.

I don't even know where to begin. I'm a writer, and I feel like I'm a good one when I give it my all, but everything is just coming out flat, almost like a 5th grader forced to write 5 paragraphs on their summer vacation. It's more like a collection of facts and bullet-point anecdotes than a true tale. It's hard to balance brevity with getting the most important parts across, and I keep crying, which doesn't make it any easier to write or rewrite.

**I know I might be making things harder by spending time typing this up instead of working on it, especially since it's now 1 AM here, but I feel like I just can't do this all alone anymore. Has anyone else been here? Currently struggling with the same thing? Does anyone have any tips or words of advice?**",1,1739431148.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

I squinted against the glaring light of my screen at the call window. Mark, my 23-year-old son, was calling. I swiped to answer and grunted out a,

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Dad, it‚Äôs me. Sorry to call so late. Engine died on me on the highway out past Mill‚Äôs Road. Could you give me a lift home?‚Äù

I paused, still trying to orient myself with reality so soon after being woken.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ sure Mark, I‚Äôll be right there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Dad. Sorry again. Love you.‚Äù

Now, before I go do what I‚Äôm about to do, I want to share my story one last time. Think of it as a way to have all the facts down in writing in case I don‚Äôt make it back.

Seven years ago, I got a call at 2:30 in the morning. I was asleep in my bed at the time. I worked at the family business run by my father.

‚ÄúJOE‚ÄôS TOWS,‚Äù he called it. Joe was his name, and towing was his game. He owned a franchise with fleets of tow trucks for everything from dragging a car out of the ditch to righting a toppled big rig. I‚Äôd been towing for him since I got my license. Even did my driving test in one of the smaller trucks with a winch mounted in the front. It was a decent job, and in between helping a bunch of embarrassed but grateful folk, I got to kick back and relax.

I‚Äôd been at the job 24 years, and the quiet night shifts were a nice reprieve from the nagging missus and our moody teenage son, Mark. That particular night, I wasn‚Äôt working the night shift. Normally, the call would have been taken by whoever was, but the new kid was a lazy ass and notorious for shutting off his phone, so it rerouted to mine, which was almost always on. The kid was gonna get a harsh talk the next day, I‚Äôd vowed to nobody in particular.

I picked up with the usual, ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Tows, need a tow?‚Äù

There was a sound on the other line, like someone trying to discreetly clear their throat before they replied.

‚ÄúYeah, hey, so I blew a tire and have no jack to change it. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone to flag down, so I figured I‚Äôd have to suck it up and call.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, happens all the time,‚Äù I responded, trying to sound like I hadn‚Äôt been catching a few winks.

‚ÄúWhereabouts are you stuck?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout 10 miles west past Love‚Äôs Travel Stop. You know the one?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a bit far out. Just sit tight. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than an hour to get to you. Do you have a spare?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, no problem,‚Äù he said cheerily.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

The guy sounded like he was chowing down on something. At least he wasn‚Äôt going to go hungry while he waited, I‚Äôd thought.

I hung up the phone and rolled over with a grunt. I‚Äôd only been asleep for a few hours, and no rest had yet been had. I looked at my wife, Maddie, lying next to me, rubbing sleep out of her eyes. I felt a bit guilty for waking her.

We‚Äôd hit a rough patch lately, and a lot of nights had been spent airing out our grievances to find a compromise so we weren‚Äôt going to bed angry. Probably another reason for the lack of rest. Lack of sleep never helps keep tempers cool.

I swung my legs out of bed and stumbled over to the bathroom door to get ready for a long night. I splashed some water into my eyes to get rid of the sleep crud and caught the reflection of my wife standing in the doorway, shielding her eyes.

‚ÄúGo back to sleep, honey. Looks like I gotta go above and beyond tonight,‚Äù I grumbled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm awake now. Would‚Ä¶ you like some company for the drive?‚Äù she asked, using the voice I‚Äôd come to recognize as the please don‚Äôt let this become an argument tone. ‚ÄúMaybe the drive would be good for us.‚Äù

I wanted to refuse and send her back to sleep. No sense in both of us being bone-tired tomorrow. But I could tell she really wanted this, and, not going to lie, I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to an hour or so alone on a stretch of dark road. One of her grievances was about how much time I spent away from home. Maybe seeing what I did all night could have been a turning point.

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù I finally responded after weighing my options.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm out the door in 10 minutes. Hopefully, this is going to just be a quick change and not a tow, ‚Äôcause you‚Äôll be stuck out there for however long this takes. If we gotta get this guy back into town, you‚Äôll be stuck in the middle seat.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay with that.‚Äù She sounded uncertain but started getting dressed anyway.

She really meant to come along. I sighed and got dressed, put on my heavy coat with the reflective stripes. I moved quietly through the small house, hoping to at least not disturb Mark. He was almost finished with high school and could look after himself, but I still didn‚Äôt want him worrying about both his parents being suddenly gone. I scrawled out a note and set it on the table.

‚ÄúMark, Took Mom To Work, Call If We‚Äôre Not Home By 8.‚Äù

I pulled on my boots and stepped out into the fall‚Äôs night air. Despite how tired I was, I felt an invigorating breeze blow against my face and heard the rustle of dead leaves blowing down the street. It was the perfect night, in my opinion.

I got in the company‚Äôs big Ford with the tow kit and was about to pull out on my own when the passenger door swung open and Maddie climbed in. I don‚Äôt remember if I was tired and had forgotten or if I‚Äôd expected her to change her mind, but I was surprised to see her. She buckled in and settled in for the drive, giving me a tired smile. I probably returned one very similar.

Now, I won‚Äôt bore you all with the details of the talk, but suffice to say, it was good. We grabbed some Waffle House coffee, talked about life, and it was a refreshing change of pace from the tension we‚Äôd felt around the house.

We passed by Love‚Äôs, which got us talking about how we‚Äôd met there 19 years ago. By the time the headlights caught a little Buick parked along the dirt shoulder of the road, we were talking about a second honeymoon together after Mark left for college.

The first thing I noticed was that the car was dark. I wondered if maybe the guy had decided to get some sleep while he waited. Giving the horn a quick honk as we approached, we waited for any signs from the driver that he was in there.

Sometimes people got impatient and tried to walk, but Love‚Äôs would have been the closest, and we‚Äôd seen no other people on the drive. I switched on the work lights to brighten up the road and turned on the flashers so anyone coming from either direction would know to slow down. The last thing I needed was to get swiped by a clueless driver.

I gave Maddie‚Äôs hand a squeeze and assured her this wouldn‚Äôt take too long, that I‚Äôd leave my door open so she could still holler if she needed anything. I hopped out and heard the click of Maddie‚Äôs door lock. I was about to make a comment about animals not being able to open doors but figured it best to keep my mouth shut with us on better terms.

If she felt safer with the forest-side door locked, so be it.

From the tilt of the car, it looked like the rear passenger tire was the culprit. I called out for the driver, who still hadn‚Äôt so much as turned a light on in the car to indicate he‚Äôd heard me arrive. There was no spare tire leaning against the bumper, so I needed him to open the trunk for me to get it myself. Inspecting the flat tire, it looked like he‚Äôd run it against something jagged. The tear was obvious, a chunk of rubber had been torn from the side, and it was pure luck that he hadn‚Äôt fishtailed into the ditch. I walked around to the driver‚Äôs side door to see if the driver was even there and peered in.

What was in there nearly had me falling over backward to get away. Across the car, I saw that the passenger window was smashed inward, glass covered the inside of the car, but what was worse was the grinning red face staring out from the driver‚Äôs seat. As I regained my footing and took a closer look, I saw that what I was looking at was muscle. Two whole round eyeballs with no eyelids to cover them stared off into the distance. He was completely naked, but somehow he was still belted into the seat. I turned to run back to the truck, collapsing to my knees to vomit on the road.

Never had I seen such a messed-up thing outside a horror movie, and I knew I needed to get to safety fast. I blinked the tears out of my eyes as my dry heaving started to subside, and the ringing in my ears let up. It was replaced by the ear-splitting screams of my wife coming from the truck not 15 feet away. I could make out the silhouette of something in the cab, its back end sticking out the open driver‚Äôs side door. I thought Bear at first, but the head inside the cab had antlers scraping the headliner and a face like a deer skull. Maddie was kicking at it and screaming while the beast raked at her. Blood started spraying the interior of the cab, and her cries grew more shrill in the night.

Now, I‚Äôm not proud of what I did next. It‚Äôs a shame that I will never be able to live down, and I accept that, but nobody sees that amount of blood and thinks they have a chance of saving that person. I loved my wife, still do through thick and thin, but at that moment, I needed to live. Getting myself killed trying to rescue her from whatever the hell that was wouldn‚Äôt do Mark any good. The idea of him waking up to an empty house, heading off to school just to be pulled out of class to hear the news that his parents were mauled by some monster‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt do that to him. So I ran. I had the wherewithal to keep hold of the long handle used to pump the jack, for all the good it would do me against that thing.

Into the dark woods I went. The contrast from the brightness of the floodlights on the road to the absolute blackness of the forest canopy left me disoriented. I knew there were plenty of fir trees with their sharp broken branches jutting out, just waiting to impale me. Running fast and my eyes were so filled with tears, I couldn‚Äôt adjust to the lack of light. The moon was half into its cycle, and the stars were mercifully bright that night, but none of that did me any favors with the thick foliage overhead. I was clotheslined by some low-hanging branch and nearly screamed, thinking the monster had caught up to me. I rolled onto my hands and knees in the underbrush, listening for any signs of pursuit.

All was quiet. Not just from any pursuers, but there wasn‚Äôt so much as a chirp from a bird or the buzz of a mosquito in the woods that night. It was like everything knew to shut the hell up. I had no idea what that thing was, how it hunted, if it could smell me, for how long‚Ä¶ it would take‚Ä¶ to finish with poor Maddie. I was in pure flight mode right then. Maybe it couldn‚Äôt climb! I felt around the tree that had hit me, keeping my ears on alert for any nearby rustling. I‚Äôd lost my only weapon before even getting a chance to swing it. My only option now was to find a place to hide. The tree that had hit me wouldn‚Äôt do. Probably a birch, not high enough to get me to a safe elevation.

I felt around some more, very conscious of how much noise I was making in my search. Reaching out frantically, I felt hot pain shoot up my arm. My palm erupted in agony as it was impaled on the very sharp broken branch of a fir tree. Thing about fir trees is when they don‚Äôt get enough sunlight to their lower branches due to the canopy, the branch dies. In a thick forest, only the topmost branches have any needles, which leaves a dangerous array of sharp spears sticking around at eye level and up. I slapped my bloody hand over my mouth to stifle another scream. The first one had been unavoidable. I listened.

I heard nothing. I listened a moment longer‚Ä¶.

Snap.

The sound had come from the direction of the road. I could still vaguely hear the engine idling in the distance. I swore at how little distance I had managed to get. Any thoughts about circling back around were also out of the question. The thing was coming, and for all I knew, I was in its territory.

‚ÄúDammit.‚Äù

Then I realized maybe this fir tree could be exactly what I needed. As a kid, back when kids still ran feral through the woods unsupervised, my friends and I would climb them all the time. From what I‚Äôd seen of the creature, it looked pretty bulky. I knew bears could climb trees, but this fir was covered in wooden spears. I was no skinny kid anymore, but I wasn‚Äôt as big as that thing was. Maybe it would be too bulky to have its weight supported by the dead branches. Hopefully, I hadn‚Äôt packed on too much weight for them to support me, though. It was already looking like an impossible climb with my bloodied hand.

I started clambering up the tree, taking multiple cuts and scrapes to the face, forearms, knees, and one particularly nasty poke in the thigh. I could still hear whatever that was getting closer, so I resolved to worry about where I was bleeding from until after I‚Äôd survived the night. In the blackness, I reached, hand over my head, muscles and skin burning. Pitch was making bits of bark glue themselves to me, and needles fell as the narrow trunk swayed. I kept going, not stopping even to listen for the creature until I grasped a rough and very much still alive branch. I must have made it at least 30 feet off the ground by this point. My hands, now both slick with blood, screamed at me and threatened to slip off the jagged bark.

The slow, deliberate steps coming toward my tree gave me just enough motivation as I pulled myself up and over the branch. It creaked in protest, and I heard the faint crack in the wood. That branch was not for sitting comfortably, but it had to do. Wrapping my arms around the trunk, I managed to pull myself into a standing position, wedged between two more branches probably no thicker than three inches. I locked my fingers together and wedged my feet as close to the base of the branch as I could get it, hugging the tree that I hoped would save my life.

I waited. And waited some more.

Waited for the sound of clawed paws climbing up behind me or the snap of it not bothering to climb and just pushing the tree over. Lord knows I‚Äôd left a clear enough trail if it hunted by scent.

Waited for the wind to blow and bend the tree enough to break my perch, sending me plummeting to the ground and certain death.

Waited for the sun to rise so someone would notice the bloody scene on the side of the road and send help.

The first thing to end my wait was the sound of claws, but surprisingly not coming from beneath my tree.

The sound of breaking and creaking branches was coming some ways off. Close enough that I knew the direction but not exactly how close. Whatever was after me was making no attempt to be stealthy. Claws digging into wood, inhuman but also not quite animalistic grunts, and heavy panting were the only sounds beside the wind occasionally whistling through the treetops. The creature must have found a spot in its tree to stop because the forest once again grew quiet. I stared wide-eyed in what I assumed was its direction, hoping my eyes could adjust enough to this dim starlight to at least get a look at it.

I was high up enough in the canopy that, when the moon peeked out from behind the clouds that had been obscuring it, I caught a glint of eye shine. Two specks of light staring at me from another tree, eye level and only 20 feet away. Then the moon vanished again. Still, having acquired a frame of reference, I started being able to make out its general shape. I remember reading somewhere that humans do have some form of night vision. We can‚Äôt make out details, but our brains are hardwired to catch movement even if the shadows look completely black.

There it was, strange long arms dangling, pale skull rocking side to side in the swaying of the tree. The bulky body didn‚Äôt look like it could be supported by the branch it was perched on. Those dangling arms weren‚Äôt gripping a branch, but it didn‚Äôt seem to have any trouble maintaining balance. The head had antlers, big ones, probably a 14-pointer. Something seemed off about the eye shine, but that felt pretty minor in the moment.

We were locked in a staring contest. It didn‚Äôt move from its branch, and I didn‚Äôt dare to move at all for fear of it attempting a wild lunge for my small perch. I knew it was taunting me. If it wanted, it could have climbed my tree. The wind was blowing, causing the trees to sway, and all I could do was pray that it would swing me back upright but not so far forward that it brought me closer to that thing.

I felt the sickening vertigo as the tree angled backwards, giving the illusion of falling. The beast‚Äôs tree swayed in my direction just as the moon came out once more, and in the faint moonlight, I caught a glint of teeth from behind the deer skull. It was then I was able to put the creature‚Äôs features together. From the floppy, fur-covered arms to the hollow eye sockets of the skull, I knew it wasn‚Äôt some bear-deer monstrosity. It was wearing the skins and bones of past kills.

I remembered the flayed body in the front seat of the car. Had it got to him while the driver waited, busting in the passenger side window? My mind wandered back to Maddie and her screams. I tried to picture her as she had been. Sitting next to me in the truck, safe, anxious‚Ä¶ not as she might look now after it was done with her.

As my adrenaline started to wane, the emotions I‚Äôd had to push aside started flooding in. She hadn‚Äôt deserved that. She should have stayed home. I should have risked the cold attitude later and just told her that she couldn‚Äôt join me. Now she was gone in the most horrible way imaginable, and we were never going to get to make it better. I realized I was sobbing rather noisily. Pitch- and blood-covered hands are horrible for rubbing the tears from your eyes.

There was a moment of panic when, in my grieving, I‚Äôd lost sight of the monster. It feels odd to say I was thankful it was still where I had last seen it, but at least it wasn‚Äôt closer or someplace new. It was still holding onto the tree, staring at me, bear arms swinging like shirt sleeves drying on the line.

More time passed. I was exhausted, both emotionally and physically. Still, that thing stared at me. I guessed sunrise couldn‚Äôt be too far off because the moon had made good progress towards the horizon. I slowly scooted my butt down to rest one cheek on separate branches. My legs wrapped around the other side, trying to distribute my weight safely. I needed the rest. It wouldn‚Äôt be long before the sun rose and someone on their way to work noticed the gruesome sight on the side of the road. I just needed to conserve my energy and make it to dawn.

The East was starting to turn that navy blue preceding the sunrise. I gave the creature another glance, making sure it hadn‚Äôt moved, then rested my chin on a branch and rested my eyes. I was startled back into consciousness by a buzzing from my pocket. My phone. I thought I‚Äôd left it in the truck! In my desperation to get away, I hadn‚Äôt even checked my pockets, but there it was, ringing with my potential savior. I pulled it out of my pocket with my less injured hand. The number was familiar but not one of my contacts.

Flicking the Answer button, I didn‚Äôt wait.

‚ÄúHello! Hello! Please help me. I‚Äôm stuck in a tree and there‚Äôs something trying to kill me.‚Äù

A familiar voice spoke out of the phone speaker.

‚ÄúYeah, hey, so I blew a tire and have no jack to change it. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone to flag down, so I figured I‚Äôd have to suck it up and call.‚Äù

I pulled the phone up to my face and looked at the number again. I recognized it now. The guy who had called to get me out here. The skinless man, still sitting dead in his driver‚Äôs seat. I looked up at where the creature was still perched and noticed a glow coming from near the deer skull. In the bluish light of predawn, I could see more of it under the stolen skins. It had the look of a gangly human with patchy skin ranging from black to brown to white, hollow cheekbones. From what I could see of the lower half of the face, below the deer skull, it looked like a man‚Äôs face, but the skin was sagging and the cheeks‚Ä¶ The cheeks were slit to accommodate an inhumanly wide mouth. It didn‚Äôt seem to have any lips of its own to cover its red-stained teeth.

I watched as it held its mouth open wide, and a voice poured out as it talked into the phone again.

‚ÄúI managed to grab a bite to eat, so the wait isn‚Äôt too bad. It was the boredom that was getting to me. I wanted to thank you for the entertainment tonight.‚Äù

It said in the casual voice of its victim. I saw the light of a phone screen turn to face me and a spindly thumb move across it. The call from the fake driver ended, and the phone disappeared underneath the bear skin covering. The shoulders of the creature moved awkwardly underneath its covering, and another light came on in the folds. My phone buzzed again, and I looked back to it in my hand.

‚ÄúWIFE‚Äù was written in all caps above the smiling face of my Maddie.

Shaking so badly I nearly dropped it, I slowly swiped my thumb to accept the incoming call. The sound of a throat being cleared on the other end, just like the one I‚Äôd heard at the start of the first call. Then a voice that nearly made me lose my grip on the tree.

‚ÄúHey honey. It‚Äôs okay to come down now. I‚Äôm back in the truck waiting safely, and I‚Äôm getting kind of lonely.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù I screamed into the phone, then glared at the monster, hanging up on it. It closed its mouth, face still in that perpetual grin. Then it opened again, and from 20 feet away, I heard an exact replication of my wife‚Äôs screams joined by the pleading screams of the other voice. The longer it screamed at me, the more voices joined it until I risked letting go of the trunk to cover my ears. My phone plummeted to the ground, and I heard the dull thud of it landing on the bed of needles and branches below.

The creature abruptly stopped its screaming medley and resumed staring at me. I released my ears and once again gripped the tree, thinking that was it. That was going to be its time to strike. A gust of wind blew through the canopy from behind me and pushed my tree towards its waiting form. I closed my eyes, picturing Mark waking up to find our note. Pictured him just sitting there waiting for his parents who would never come home.

I knew they would eventually find Maddie, but would they find mine? Would I be stuck high in this tree as a skinned corpse that wouldn‚Äôt be found until I was just a skeleton? With the brightening world blurred by tears, I waited for the killing blow. Instead, it made a low guttural laugh. In what I assume was its own voice, it growled,

‚ÄúLucky for you, I don‚Äôt think I can handle a third meal in a single night.‚Äù

Then, with inhuman agility, it leaped. Not at me, though. It leaped for a tree deeper into the forest. I watched it spring further and deeper into the canopy until it must have dropped down out of sight. The bastard could have gotten to me any time it wanted. It had toyed with me the entire night, and now I was all alone.

The rumble of a noisy old truck caught my attention. The road was starting to get busy. I wondered how long before someone would come looking for me. For one chilling moment, I wondered if maybe the creature had circled back around and was making those car noises to lure me into a false sense of security. It could be waiting just at the treeline for me to come down looking for help and pull me back into the woods and skin me alive.

That image is what kept me sitting in that tree until the sun was fully visible over the hills. That was also about the time two highway patrol officers, guns drawn, came crashing through the brush. I started sobbing at the sight of them. They trained their guns on me, and only when they realized I wasn‚Äôt likely a threat did they bark at me to come down slowly.

I complied, peeling my bloodied and cramped hands from the bark of the tree. I took my time getting down, now able to see all the branches I‚Äôd broken on the way up. When I got to the bottom, I was in no condition to tell them my story, and they looked at each other with bewilderment. I later was told that I looked like a walking corpse with bags under my eyes and waxy pale skin.

I also later found out that some driver had stopped to inspect the abandoned truck and car. They had seen two skinless bodies and a mess of blood bathing the windshield of my truck. Six cop cars were lining the highway as well as two ambulances when we exited the forest. One of them was loading up a body bag. I lost all strength in my legs at the sight of them, and the officers helped me into the back of another ambulance. A blanket was put over my shoulders, and sympathetic pats on my back came from a paramedic who brought me water.

It was all a blur after that. Questioning at the hospital, then again at the station. There was plenty of skepticism from the officers interviewing me. They never found what happened to their skin, and they conceded that with the amount of blood in both vehicles, there would have had to have been some on me. All testing of my clothes and body showed only my own blood.

Oddly, the most tangible evidence they paid attention to was the receipts from our coffee, showing I hadn‚Äôt been present at the car owner‚Äôs time of death. A medical exam for both my body and mind told the story of a man who survived something traumatizing. In the end, the oversimplified conclusion was that a very unique bear had attacked during a routine towing.

It didn‚Äôt fit anything at the scene, but I suppose it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as it‚Äôs plausible on paper.

Mark didn‚Äôt handle it well. He barely talked to me in his grief, turning to drugs and booze as years passed until it got to the point where I had to ask him to leave. The accusations of it being my fault were too much for me to handle, and he was only making me feel more miserable. Not that he thought I murdered his mother. His accusations all came down to blaming me for not doing more to save her.

The last time I saw him was when he left the house with five boxes of his things and said he was moving in with his girlfriend. The only time he called me was to guilt me into giving him money for food and rent, which I did.

My dad set up a dispatch line for me so I could stay employed and off the road after my ‚Äúordeal,‚Äù as he called it. Everybody believed something happened, but nobody believed what I told them happened. Eventually, I sold the empty house and moved into a single-bedroom apartment, away from the memories.

That brings you all up to speed on where I‚Äôm at. So you‚Äôll see why I‚Äôm going to do this tonight. I‚Äôm going to load up my shotgun and go to Mill‚Äôs Road. I‚Äôm going to put an end to the monster that killed my wife and now has probably killed my son too.

Tonight, it made the mistake of leaving me nothing to live for. If I make it back, I‚Äôll let you know what it looks like without the stolen skins. I‚Äôll drag it on live TV and show the world what‚Äôs lurking in the forest.",10,1739430847.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Unusual Memories

On my visit to Munnar, I was excited to explore Top Station, a viewpoint renowned for its breathtaking views of the Western Ghats and the valley below. The day started perfectly‚Äîclear skies, a cool breeze, and a great view of the mist rolling over the hills. But as the afternoon wore on, things took an unexpected turn.

While taking pictures along one of the trails, a dense fog suddenly enveloped the area. Within minutes, the visibility dropped to almost zero. What was a scenic adventure turned into a mildly eerie experience as I struggled to find my way back to the main path? To make things more unsettling, the sound of rustling leaves and distant bird calls amplified the silence, making me wonder if I was walking in circles!

After about 15 minutes of anxious wandering, I finally bumped into a group of tourists who were equally lost but more cheerful about it. Together, we found our way back, laughing nervously about how the mist had swallowed us.

Looking back, it was both scary and thrilling. So, if you‚Äôre visiting Top Station, make sure to stick to the marked paths‚Äîand maybe carry a whistle just in case!

And then, it's like the cosmic director yells, ""***Cut!***"" and, just like a good night's sleep in a vintage 1916 French trench, bam! *Game over.*

That‚Äôs when my life, much like soapy shower water, began circling the drain.

The nightmare began on a beautiful winter‚Äôs day. So far, it had been a long cold winter and then suddenly it‚Äôs a new day and here comes the sun through a sky so blue it seemed professionally painted.

Hunching against the wind, picking up my pace I tried to avoid slipping on the dirty ice patches punctuating the sidewalk like bad penmanship. The message the universe was sending seemed to say *winter sucks*.

I sipped some coffee from a large paper cup. It was very good. The cup I held sported a crooked smiley face. Under it a crooked penmanship font read, ‚ÄúCaf√© Grumpy.‚Äù

I was supposed to be *off* of coffee. *Again*. The black stuff made me kind of anxious lately. That‚Äôs life. One minute you‚Äôre young and indestructible guzzling coffee and krispy kremes like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. And then the next minute you‚Äôre sweating caffeine, cholesterol, and fiber levels.

Lately, I had taken to employing various strategies to wean myself off of caffeine. I think what doomed them all to failure was a bleak economic reality. I earned my living as a computer programmer. Now you try writing software caffeine-free sometime and tell me how that goes out for you.

*if (coffeeConsumed === false) return null;*

There‚Äôs a reason there‚Äôs a language called *Java*. As of late, my best record had been four days sans caf√©.

But now? Now I had broken a personal best. Until 15 minutes ago I had made it for the last 5 days full of *no* caffeine. That combined with the new keto diet my wife had put me on had me feeling rejuvenated. I radiated rebirth. I was now one with the universe.

In fact, I felt so connected to the universe that when I strolled past Caf√© Grumpy and smelled the java jive I took it as a sign from Jehovah to get busy or dizzy. I chose busy.

Besides, it was a very special occasion for a very special VIP. I took another sip from the opening in my cup‚Äôs plastic lid.

Slowly, I felt my heart thump harder in my chest. I took another slurp. I bowed to my cup in gratitude inhaling the java vapors.

And then I got hit by a truck.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I exclaimed as gravity and my fellow man betrayed me.

Eating a face full of hot coffee, I felt my feet dump their grip on the ice.

Then my ass decided to join my feet on the hard ice and dirty asphalt. I felt a pain shoot up my spine.

From a very low vantage point I observed a big orange leg. The big leg was attached to an even bigger man. Or, maybe it was Silverback Gorilla. Due to size and attire and my discombobulated state it was difficult to be certain.

The gorilla, or man, wore an orange winter snowsuit.

It seemed I had gotten in the way of one of his ginormous shoulders.

I looked up with low expectations. Our eyes met. I saw no humanity.

It didn‚Äôt begin to beat its chest. Probably a man.

The man wore a thick, old-school gray hoodie under the snowsuit. The hood of the hoodie obscured his face.

The giant looked at me with no warmth. It had a pointy nose. Its teeth seemed pointy too. And around Cupid‚Äôs bow lips, a salt and pepper goatee was in residence. The little beard mustache thing looked freshly trimmed.

‚ÄúVatch vere you valking, stupid vitch,‚Äù the face said.

I felt hot coffee seeping down my neck and chest. The man blocked the sun. I noticed he cast no shadow. I decided it best to say a lot of nothing which is exactly what I did.

Shadowy eyes glared down at me. I felt a bone deep pain in my ass. A shudder went up my back.

Then the face did something. It opened a mouth of nicotine and tar stained teeth. One of his front teeth was missing. Then he spat on me. I said nothing. I merely looked up with as neutral an expression as I could muster on my face. The giant looked me up and down.

And then like a bad dream he turned on his snow shoes and walked off.

I breathed a sigh of relief and took stock. My blue overcoat was stained across the throat and chest with coffee. It had just come back from the cleaners, too. I got back up on my feet. My lower back had a dull throb but everything seemed to bend right, more or less. Seemed the biggest injury was to my pride.

Taking a deep breath, I knew exactly what to do. My feet obeyed. I headed off in the direction of the spitting gorilla. I walked angrily for three more blocks. And there I spotted my quarry. Under my coffee-soaked overcoat, I felt my heart pound. My left arm shot out. I pushed hard. Its bell rang.

I was back inside the warmth and safety of Caf√© Grumpy. Like I said, ain‚Äôt nobody gonna break my stride.

It wasn‚Äôt much longer before I was once again walking past the sporadic ice patches where I had spilled the *previous* cup of coffee, which in my clumsy defense, I hadn‚Äôt cried over.

I took a sip from my replacement cup.

I looked at my watch. 10:30 am.

I hoped I wasn‚Äôt too late to pull my merry prank.

The prank I refer to was surprising my best friend, Ed, for his 50^(th) birthday with an all-day birthday extravaganza ending with a big dinner with most of our old friends. I had spent months planning it.

I really love surprises.

Happily, Ed only lived a few blocks away from my wife and I. Ed‚Äôs wife Edna, yeah, I know, had divorced him last year and my wife and I had been trying to be supportive. That‚Äôs why I decided to do the whole thing on the down low. Hell, even my wife didn‚Äôt know all the fun stuff I had planned.

A few minutes later I was done climbing the four flights of stairs up to Ed‚Äôs place. I dug my key to his lock out of my pocket. I was a bit more winded then I remembered being ten years ago.

I had the fleeting thought Ed might have had an *inkling* I was planning to do something crazy for his birthday but I never used the key before. It was only for emergencies. Ed also had a key to my place.

I mean it‚Äôs pretty rude to key in to another dude‚Äôs crib. But it isn‚Äôt every day you turn fifty years old. I‚Äôve known Ed since the second grade so I was worried it might be hard to surprise him.

I say the above because when I walked into Ed‚Äôs big living room, his back with the Satan holding a pitchfork tattoo was looking right at me. The devil smiled through wispy flames that ran up and down Ed‚Äôs back. Ed‚Äôs stereo was blasting Pearl Jam.

I think Ed knew I was coming. You see, Ed was *already* in his birthday suit. He was standing splay legged in front of his couch. He seemed to have company, too. Was Ed back on his horse? Resilient bastard.

My Cheshire cat grin reached near-maximum intensity. I burst into a rendition of *‚ÄúHappy birthday ‚Äú.*

My feet skipped, eagerly approaching the fifty-year-old birthday boy. I felt all the grumpy leave my body. My heart felt light as a feather. Age is just a number.

Eddie Vedder was going off about evolution on the stereo. There was no chance naked Ed had heard my birthday song nor my footfall.

*The Bob Man Cometh*

Ed‚Äôs black cat Loki, on the other hand, knew just what was up. Loki rubbed against my leg mewling strangely. I bent down to scratch him behind his ear like usual. Loki coiled between my legs uncharacteristically nervously then bolted down the hall. He was usually more affectionate. Maybe I smelled like coffee and sidewalk?

I resumed my approach to naked Ed. When I was a few feet away from him and Satan that's when I saw *it*.

It seemed Ed wasn‚Äôt the only one wearing their birthday best. So too attired was a very tall and attractive blonde. She wore her long hair feathered the way Farrah Fawcett used to.

She had very long legs. They matched high angular cheekbones that prominently jutted out below large almond-shaped eyes. The eyes were green. She wore lips that appeared to be unusually red. Like Mr. Potato Head. The potato-head lips were stretched thin across white teeth. The teeth were stained pink with what seemed to be a mishmash of lipstick and cake frosting.

The lady was the first to notice me. Our eyes met. Two bright spots of red formed on the her cheekbones. They matched her lips.

I knew the lady.

Her name was Seana.

How did I know?

*She was my wife.*

...

**ENTER DUMBO**

Not the elephant. I am referring to the *‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù* which is an abbreviation for, *‚ÄúDown Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass‚Äù.*

It had been two months of fruitless apartment hunting and things were getting dire.

After discovering my wife and Ed in flagrante delicto, I immediately packed a *go bag* and moved fast into a condo situation in Brooklyn. I might be down but I was not out. I was determined to pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again.

‚ÄúAmazing! Isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Abby, the tall real estate agent asked. Vapor streamed out her mouth and nose from what I assumed was an e-cigarette. When she inhaled it an LED display showed shooting stars.

‚ÄúJesus. It‚Äôs *so* big,‚Äù I said looking up through the picture windows at it.

‚ÄúImagine waking up and *that‚Äôs* your view?‚Äù she asked, her dark eyes shining brightly. ‚ÄúHow awesome would that be?‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty awesome,‚Äù I conceded.

‚ÄúHow many people can say they live under the Brooklyn Bridge?‚Äù she asked. ¬†‚ÄúDid you know there‚Äôs even a famous chewing gum in Italy named after it? It‚Äôs like living with history for a neighbor.

And think of what you can put on your social media! And,‚Äù Abby said pausing for dramatic effect, ‚Äúthe best part is, you can move in for a *steal*!‚Äù

‚ÄúA *steal*?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up. Not again. Ever.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Abby said, *sotto voce*. ‚ÄúAn absolute steal. And, you want to know why?‚Äù she asked me, raising an eyebrow high. I thought of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis for some reason.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said.

Abby‚Äôs heels clacked on the wood floor boards until she stood next to me looking down. She put an arm gently around my shoulder. She looked left. She looked to the right. Then she whispered something into my ear. I felt my eyebrows move into the upright position and I felt a shudder go down my spine.

¬†

When the shudder had passed I looked back up at the Brooklyn Bridge. Well, now I knew why it was a steal. I felt a little queasy in the pit of my stomach. Abby vaped some more. She started scrolling her phone.

We stood quiet a minute.

Finally, Abby looked up from her phone at me and said, ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

I shrugged.

‚ÄúUp to you, Bob,‚Äù she said.

That‚Äôs when I heard myself say, ‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

It was on a Saturday night, about a month ago, almost a year after I had settled into my new swanky digs that things turned weird.

I had, under duress, agreed to try some weed gummies with a woman by the name of Rhonda. I had met Rhonda on a dating app and this was my first time with a woman romantically, besides Seana, in twenty years. I was nervous as hell and had no idea what to do on a date in 2025.

Rhonda and I had spent most of the night admiring the view from the couch and drinking scotch and soda.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a gummy,‚Äù Rhonda said. She made it dance in front of my face and said in a baby voice, ‚Äújust a widdle gummy, Bawbbbeeee‚Ä¶ aww you‚Äôre not scare of the widdle gummy big boy Bawb, awe you??‚Äù

‚ÄúQuit with the baby talk,‚Äù I said, snatching the gummy out of her fingers. I popped it into my mouth and swallowed.

‚ÄúSatisfied?‚Äù

‚ÄúVewy,‚Äù Rhonda baby talked.

Then she kissed me. Then I remembered no more.

At some point in the night a thunderclap startled me awake. I looked at my phone. It was 3:33 am. Rhonda was nowhere to be found.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it. The sobs of a woman. They were hushed. They were coming from my bathroom.

When I opened the bathroom door it was much worse. Rhonda was sitting on my toilet seat sobbing with her mascara running down her face.

Before I could ask her *what the actual fuck?* I noticed Rhonda‚Äôs face freeze in real-time with fear.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

*It* sounded like a pig squealing in Irish brogue. The pig squeal said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cramping me style, Bobby boy-O. Can‚Äôt have that now, can we?‚Äù

Then I caught sight of the little fucker in the medicine chest mirror. It was about twelve feet away. It looked like a homeless leprechaun. There seemed to be all kinds of gross shit in its filthy thick red matted beard.

I spun around. I looked down. It was dark in my apartment with the curtains drawn. Lightning flashed from behind them, casting long shadows across the room. Whatever it was it couldn‚Äôt be more than three feet tall.

‚ÄúWhat the fucking fuck!?!‚Äù I yelled.

Rhonda yelled, ‚ÄúStep on it, Bob!‚Äù

The little fucker yelled over me at Rhonda, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt a fookin‚Äô cockroach, lassie. I‚Äôm a fookin‚Äô troll, ya daffy duck!‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when Rhonda shat so hard and loud into the bowl that it sounded like a mortar detonating.

The troll said in his pig squeal brogue, ‚ÄúAh, that one‚Äôs full of shite, Bobby-Boy-O!‚Äù before doubling over with laughter. Doubled over he was barely a foot tall.

Lightning flashed seeping through the curtains. Rhonda farted hard in the bowl and it echoed explosively. A very tiny part of me wanted to laugh. The rest of me wanted to stomp on the troll. This was supposed to be a secure building. How the hell did a troll get in here?

Then I remembered what Abby had whispered in my ear last year.

I felt a shudder. And that queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.

And that‚Äôs when the troll clapped his hands twice. We were cast into absolute darkness. Rhonda screamed. Then Rhonda farted. Again.

The troll squealed, ‚ÄúAye Bob, I ain‚Äôt got no more time fer this shite tonite. But ya best believe, like the song says, I‚Äôll be around.‚Äù

The lights came back on. I ran to my bedroom closet and got out my old little league baseball bat. I ran around the apartment full of adrenaline ready to bash a troll but there was no troll to be found. And ten minutes later, there was no Rhonda either. But that was thanks to her and Uber.

That was a couple of weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt seen any trolls since then but I been trying to get in touch with Abby with no luck. I went down to the agency and one of her colleagues told me she left months ago to, ‚Äúfind herself,‚Äù and nobody knew how to get in touch.

I sent Rhonda a text just to make sure I hadn‚Äôt imagined the whole thing but she ghosted me. It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks and I have been sleeping with the lights on and the baseball bat next to me.

I‚Äôll be getting ready for something, I‚Äôll be on time or even (like this morning) early! Maybe cause I got out of bed quicker than usual or didn‚Äôt do makeup or something.

And then I‚Äôm like ok well I don‚Äôt want to be early, I‚Äôll just do this quick thing. And then this quick thing turns into a whole big task (this morning I was joining some crochet pieces together to see if they fit and then tried it on and took pictures etc).

In my head, time is frozen while I‚Äôm doing the task. Or the task will only take 5 mins. But then I look, and boom 15 mins have gone by and I‚Äôm now going to be late.

Also at work, when I have a meeting, I‚Äôll be focussing on a task I don‚Äôt want to stop so while I know the meeting starts in 15 mins, I say I‚Äôll stop in 10 mins so I have 5 mins to make tea/coffee, stretch my legs and go to the bathroom. Now I KNOW I cannot do that in just 5 mins, especially when I do a whole fancy latte with foamed milk in the espresso machine lol. Yet I‚Äôll still only leave myself 5 mins every time.

The first 3 mins go quite slow and I‚Äôm like wow I‚Äôll actually be on time, then boom I blink and 5 mins is up and why do those final minutes go so quick?!?

I never thought I had time blindness until I realised I do these things. My mum was always shouting at me as a kid to get ready cause she knows I‚Äôm always 20 mins late out the door. And now my partner knows when I say I‚Äôll be ready in 5 mins, I mean 15. Or when I say I‚Äôm ready, I actually still need to get my shoes on and pick up my bag etc.

Do other people experience it like this too? To me it feels minuscule but I know it has an impact on other people and I feel bad for wasting their time so I‚Äôm trying to be better but it‚Äôs tricky!! üòÖ",1,1739430610.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

1iodh5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iodh5w/hardest_thing_ive_ever_had_to_do/,Hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do,"My ex and I met in a natural and drawn out way. We both went to the same small town gym. I always saw her there, and I heard she had a thing for me, but I was in a long term relationship at the time, and I had no care about her, yet. Months went on like this, her watching me, pining over a man she didn‚Äôt even know or could even get to know. I noticed it but didn‚Äôt care about it.
But then my girlfriend dumped me. It was hard, but we were just too incompatible. 
And after that, months kept going by with this girl. I felt every time I was at the gym, she‚Äôd show up shortly after. Small smiles, awkward tension. Even on weekends, I‚Äôd go, she‚Äôd magically show up. Sometimes it was just the two of us in there. I found out later, she spent months intentionally going during the week the same times she thought I was going to be there. Stalkerish but also sweet and subtle. Never said a word to me. Ice was finally broke when she was too short to change an attachment, and I awkwardly watched her struggle for 30 seconds before offering to help. She just smiled and put her head down, and that was that. Until that night, she followed me on Instagram. 
We liked each other‚Äôs stories for a while, then each other‚Äôs pictures. One day she finally messaged me, and we hit it off amazingly. We connected in almost every aspect, and found we had a ton of similar interests. I genuinely felt like she was the female version of me. And after months and months of tension between us, I figured it was something worth trying. I asked her if she wanted to go on a walk, which she excitedly agreed to.
We met up, and walked for hours at a local park. Nobody wanted to call it quits, so we didn‚Äôt. We eventually sat down at a park bench and talked for hours, well into the night. Eventually, she asked if I liked to dance. I never really danced before and I felt awkward about it, but it was the best way to get rid of that awkward tension. She put on slow music and we danced for an hour in the middle of the park under the stars. 
From there we were inseparable. We bonded over everything, and we both opened up about things we‚Äôve never opened up about before. The connection was so deep and genuine feeling, like we were just meant to be. I never in my life thought I could feel the way she made me feel. We‚Äôd meet up over and over. Parks. Hiking trails. Coffee shops. Go to dinner. It was the best relationship I had ever been a part of. Best summer of my life.
She had to go to school in the fall, and was committed to living on campus. I happily supported her of course, and we were both excited about continuing our relationship around her studies. And we did great. I‚Äôd drive to her university all the time and we‚Äôd just go hangout, get food, talk, hangout in her room. 
But then she had a falling out with her roommate, and ended up feeling out of place being on campus. She‚Äôs always been super involved, but that was surface level. At her core, she‚Äôs a home body introvert, and wanted nothing to do with the standard campus culture. So after some talking, we decided to move in together in my house. And it went amazingly. We picked out all the furniture, decorations, paint colors, everything. It was our home. Two people who just wanted to have one of those life long relationships.

We did all sorts of cool stuff. Vacations, got scuba certified together, had a trip setup for our first dive trip here in a few months, where we planned on me proposing. She desperately just wanted to be my wife. 

But out of the blue, right after the first of the year she hit me with a bomb. Said she feels like she hasn‚Äôt lived enough for her age, and felt she was missing out on key experiences. Told me that I wasn‚Äôt what she wanted.. that she couldn‚Äôt see a future with me. A complete 180 from everything I spent the last 2 years believing. But I loved her, and talked to her and once we came to the conclusion that that was what she wanted, I told her I understood, we cried and kissed goodbye. I went out hunting that night, came home and the house was empty. Like she was never even there. It hit me like a truck, but I loved her and I couldn‚Äôt bear being the one to hold her back. I‚Äôve done nothing but support her every decision, and I‚Äôm not going to let my selfishness stop that from happening now. She decided to move back on campus, join a sorority, and get involved with more things she felt she was missing out on. 

A few weeks passed, and my thoughts on what I wished I had said to her began to accumulate. So I wrote her one last letter. Told her I understood, and that I would always love her and be here for her if she needed me. Said the goodbye I felt I needed to say to a girl I loved. She called me that night, and we talked for hours. She expressed how much she missed me and how heartbroken she is, and felt she was trying so hard to hold herself together. I asked if I could take her out, and she eventually agreed. I felt that maybe the love still existed, and that she could do what she wanted and live her life, and we could still be together organically. I woke up the next morning to a ‚ÄúI think we should stop talking‚Äù text. It killed me. I felt that everything I thought was real was all a lie. She told me she cared about me, but just didn‚Äôt love me anymore. If you saw the way this girl used to look at me and talk about a future with me.. man..

I simply said ‚Äúit never had to be anything more than that. Take care‚Äù. And we went full no contact. It was hard, man is no contact hard. But as days passed, I started to love myself again. Developed a healthy routine and started to feel optimistic about the new path in life. I wanted to just stay single for a while and travel the world. 

2 weeks of no contact, and even though I still got anxiety thinking about her, I was doing very good. Truly. Until one day I was at the gym, my phone calls, and it‚Äôs her. This was yesterday. She said she‚Äôs been seeing me everywhere, and she‚Äôs been hurting and missing me and regretting her decision. I talked to her in a completely selfless way, strictly about the way SHE felt. She wanted to meet up and talk, so we met last night. We both expressed how much we still love each other. How much we miss each other. She cried and told me she doesn‚Äôt know why she would‚Äôve let this happen, and she wishes she hadn‚Äôt. I held her in my truck for a while, while she just cried. We ended up driving to my house last night and spent the night together. She said being with me just felt right, and that she knows that I‚Äôm her soul mate. Says she tried to be open to talking to other guys on campus, but none of them were me and she just wanted me. We had a great night together, and this morning I drove her back to campus. 
The problem is she has a lot of outside pressure. From her family thinking she shouldn‚Äôt settle down so young, to her single friends saying the same. But she couldn‚Äôt handle the thought of losing me. I asked her what she wanted, to try to rekindle things, or to accept this new life and never talk again. I told her to do what SHE wanted to do. She cried and said she couldn‚Äôt not talk to me again. We kissed goodbye, and she messaged me a few hours later and we talked all day. It felt like her again, the same girl I thought was gone for good. The girl I love. 
4 hours ago, she told me she‚Äôs spiraling and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. I asked her again what she wanted, and she wanted to take things slow and keep hanging out with me, but wanted to keep her options open. Me being one of them. 
So I had to do what was best for me. I told her I will love her for the rest of my life, and will forever cherish the moments we had, because we both knew that they were real. But I couldn‚Äôt try again thinking I was just a backup option competing with other guys while she figured out what she wanted. I told her I couldn‚Äôt be her stepping stone, and if she thought there was better for her out there, that our story would finally have to just come to an end. And I told her if she can‚Äôt commit to only me, to not reach out to me ever again. 
She sent a long text back, beautiful written about how she will see me in everything, and never be able to stop thinking about me. About how in her gut she feels like I will be the one that got away, and that she will forever compare every other guy to me. I simply replied back Goodbye, and unfriended her.

We had a great relationship, with a lot of connection, and a lot of love. I really thought she was the one. There‚Äôs a lot going on in her life right now, and a lot of pressure from every angle. She‚Äôs always felt she had to please other people and listen to other people more than she listened to herself. I hope she doesn‚Äôt regret this one day, love like that can be hard to find. When she left me I was destroyed and lost and I felt like my life was a lie. I thought being on the other side, the side to cut it off while the other cried, would feel empowering. But nothing hurts worse than splitting up a love that doesn‚Äôt want to split, and we both will feel this for a long time. Life is cold and just doesn‚Äôt always make sense. I want to be her safety net, but I can‚Äôt just be another one of her options. I‚Äôm hurting bad right now, but I‚Äôm also really proud of myself for being able to do what I did. And as I lay here in this empty house, on the couch we picked out together, I truly hope she finds herself one day and finds happiness again. ",3,1739430252.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

This scent starts off a bit bold and intense but gradually evolves into a more refined and elegant fragrance with time. The rich blend of coffee, amber, and subtle sweetness becomes softer and more sophisticated, offering a comforting, lasting experience. It's perfect for cooler weather, and the longevity is amazing, lingering for hours. Highly recommend for those who enjoy deep, cozy scents!

It started in 2023. I was about 215 pounds and would drink a coffee and Red Bull pretty occasionally and smoking THC. I noticed my heart would ""flutter"" so I cut out caffeine and smoking THC and noticed my symptoms improved. I learned I have a caffeine sensitivity and can not drink any caffeine or else I will have these ""flutters"". Well fast forward to 2025 today and I am 181 pounds, I've lost some weight haven't consumed any caffeinated beverages and primarily only drink water and will occasionally have a piece of dark chocolate which I will probably no longer do as I believe it to contain too much caffeine for myself due to experiencing heart flutters this past weekend for the first time while eating dark chocolate. Well it's 12:47am and I was trying to fall asleep and I feel that feeling like I know my heart is about to flutter and then sure enough it does and then it doesn't stop. UNTIL... I get up. When I'm standing I do not feel them but when I decide to sit or lay down I can instantly feel them. I have no idea what is causing them. I drink about 80-100 oz of water a day. I try to refrain from heavily processed foods. I don't consume caffeine. For the month of Nov-Dec I was pretty active going for walks daily and Jan-Feb I really haven't been as active. I'm wondering in this is a trigger for my heart to flutter?? I've noticed things like standing up help them go away, taking a hot shower, and doing minor things to get my heart pumping like step ups or lifting a 5lb weight for a few minutes. (Just what works for me). Does anyone else only experience this when laying down??? I've had a heart monitor and ecg's done and doctors say it's nothing and my heart is perfectly healthy so I don't try to get panicked but it sure it hard when you can feel your own heart! I'm looking for any tips/tricks that have helped. ",1,1739429603.0,Heartpalpitations,2,1.0,False

Date was cute, we had coffee, exchanged books (granted, I bought her the books, and she gave me one of hers) then we went to skip rocks at the tide pool next to the shop. 

She forgot her jacket, good thing I had one in my car sprayed with my cologne ;) then we went to an arcade.

She DMd me when she got home, saying she had a good time, and then after some DMing, just gave me her number.

We FaceTimed for 2 hours that night.

Then as the days went on, we'd text here and there, but I noticed her responses getting drier and drier, I'm the one asking questions, etc.

Then a couple nights ago, she mentioned she was making the Dubai chocolate, and I jokingly said, save me some, and she said yes! If I like it I'll definitely bring you one.

We continue to talk a bit, but she's still hella dry.

Last couple texts:
""I was already k/o lol""

""It's pistachio and katafi filling!""

I say, looking forward to trying it, unless you got hungry n ate it all ü§®

""There wasn't any extra lol only enough for one""

Me: Bigger betrayal than Takeru leaving Mamoru (reference to the fire ass book she recommended to me)

""lol if I find an afghan store nearby I'll make more""

Honestly her responses make me feel like I'm being annoying. 

I'm running my own business, training BJJ hella, lifting, to add someone into all of that is a lot, and it doesn't seem worth it if she's being dry n putting in no effort to even talk at all.

1iodarl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iodarl,How frequent are you bathing?,"I met a new peer who said they only bathe once a quarter. Darling and I both clutched our pearls.  

He hates the blow dryer, but loves the bath since it's basically a spa for him...which is why I have to block him when I'm sitting in the bath or I'm scared he'd jump in ( which not only would be super annoying and messy, but so bad for his skin since I have my oat meal,  Epsom salts, teas and coffee scrubs in that water too ). I can't imagine him going a month without a bath.

He's also a little bougie. He wears shoes outside (doesn't like pavement), and after every potty break, his feet, wee and bum are wiped. Then he gets coconut oil on his pads-- and after every nap, his eyes are cleaned and a tiny swipe of coconut oil on his face twice a day. Heck, even after his food, he comes demanding I wipe his face off. When I don't, he huffs then wipes his own face....on my pants or blanket. 

I do understand not bathing weekly due to how dry NYC is, but once a quarter??? How are you fellow city puppers managing the city ick? Their dog wears nothing and they said he sleeps with them and they never smell bad. But I can't stop thinking of not just the dingle berries and crust....but alllllll this city ick that gets tracked back inside ( they're not bad people,  they just do things completely different than I do.)

For those that do care about the ick, how are you treating that issue without drying the baby's skin? 


Also, can we talk really about city ick?! I have been reading far too much about parasites that can go from Dog to Human just from the dog sniffing wet ground where there was pee or poo, and there being something off with it. Also found out they can get winter fleas üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµü•¥.

1iod7dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1iod7dd/intp_m_crush_on_possible_intj_f/,INTP (M) crush on possible INTJ? (F),"So, I will start by saying that I am not super versed on the different personalities types and would not know how to tell what others type is.

So, from what I have read so far, I think my crush (coworker) may be an INTJ.  We have been friends for many years, but never single at the same time.  , My 5 year relationship with now ex gf ended last year and last info I have is that my coworker was single. I would very much like to pursue her, as I have liked her for many years.  

Here are some of the traits I see in her personality that make me believe she is INTj

1) High intelligence, arrives at the correct interpretations (i.e., people‚Äôs intentions, forecasting outcomes) extremely fast and without needing nearly as much data.  Also, fairly confident of their thought process, but not arrogant or unwilling to rectify if needed.  

2) Very private & collected.  Does not share much and does not respond to teasing like ‚Äúperhaps I shouldn‚Äôt say‚Ä¶‚Äù.  Her response is something like ‚ÄúOk‚Äù. She seems to make some efforts to continue conversations in person and seems to enjoy them, but does not usually initiate messaging and is not that great at continuing beyond a few messages.  I used to interpret this as disinterest, but she randomly says or messages things like, ‚ÄúReally looking forward to hearing about your trip next week!!!‚Äù Or loving every thing we say to each other in DM.

3) When I first met her, we seemed to hit it off somewhat well as friends, but one time I mentioned  teasingly/jokingly that she was kind of ‚Äúuptight‚Äù.  I meant to say something like you are ‚Äúvery private‚Äù in hopes she would opened up but this backfired tremendously.  She was upset and let me know, with clear intentions of not needing disrespectful stuff like that and was clearly about to shut down the friendship.  I apologized and explained that my word choice was poorly done, and after a good 10 mins of annoyance/im done/whatever, she seemed to accept the apology, but mostly because she did seem to entertain the idea that my word choice was a result of ESL.

4) She seems concerned about coworkers when we chat for too long or we are seen together.

5) After a few years, We have become closer friends and she seems to have great respect for me professionally and as person. I was in a relationship for most of this times, so it has always been a respectful friendship, but from my end it feels that there is some level of interest:  She asks how are things with my gf but the questions seem aimed at finding out if I still have a gf.  As of very recently, we went to an event and we danced and hang out with each other.  With boundaries and she mentioned she was single in a ‚Äúcomplaining‚Äù tone.  She also very slightly leaned on my shoulder but quickly removed herself as coworkers showed up.  I was at the time in the process of ‚Äúending‚Äù my relationship and thus I did not reciprocate or did anything unethical.  She never directly asked if I have a gf.  She in fact had recently stopped even saying anything like ‚Äúyou should take your gf here‚Äù.  I think she suspects something is happening but wouldn‚Äôt bring up the subject and neither did I.  We just lightly flirted without crossing any lines.

6) She seems to go hot and cold.  Before EOY break, she said ‚Äúreally looking forward to hearing from your trip abroad! I want to see pics!!!‚Äù  She does not show much excitement usually, so I took this as a good sign.  I told her maybe I‚Äôll send her some pics while I was gone, and she said ‚ÄúYes!!!‚Äù.  Due to my own insecurities, I hesitated as I thought perhaps she was being just polite, but didn‚Äôt really mean it (to send pics) so I did not send any nor said happy Xmas.  She did not either but she did text on NewYears.  I replied and tried to rectify, but ever since I got the super cold shoulder.  Plans of hanging out have been expressed, and she says ‚Äúyes, but I have been busy‚Äù. This is true, but I don‚Äôt think she is busy enough to not go out for a coffee.  Is not doing what I said I would a cardinal sin to INTJs?

So, I guess the first question is:  Is she an INTJ?  And if so, any tips on how to proceed with hopes of success?  I think this girl is an absolute one in 100 million and I really do not want to blow this chance up, if I even have one.  I find her so hard to interpret and unable to understand the hot/cold dynamic. THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR INSIGHTS and apologies for bad English. 

Some extra thoughts.

Recently she has not asked about gf, and I would not bring it up as I think coworkers of opposite sex should not talk about their in trouble relationship. If asked I would be honest.

Recently, there have been more ‚Äúbarely flirty‚Äù interactions with each other than ever, some from her initiation. For example she said she‚Äôd love to have an ‚ÄúAI app‚Äù version of me that she could chat with on her phone when she needs to feel better.

1iod6ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JacobJones2110/comments/1iod6ip/advertisement_in_magazines_a_timeless_tool_for/,Advertisement in Magazines: A Timeless Tool for Targeted Marketing,"In a world dominated by digital ads and social media campaigns, print advertising remains a powerful and effective way to reach specific audiences. One of the most enduring forms of print advertising is the [advertisement in magazines](https://www.excellentpublicity.com/magazine). Magazines offer a unique platform for advertisers to connect with readers in a visually appealing and immersive way. Whether it's a full-page spread, a single-page ad, or a creative insert, advertisements in magazines allow businesses to craft messages that resonate with a dedicated readership.

**What is an Advertisement in a Magazine?**

An advertisement in a magazine refers to any type of promotional content that is published in a magazine. These ads can take various forms, such as full-page ads, half-page ads, or even smaller quarter-page and classified ads. Magazines have long been a popular medium for advertisers because of their niche focus, loyal audience, and high-quality, visually engaging layouts. Brands leverage these features to create ads that grab attention and leave a lasting impression.

**Benefits of Magazine Advertising**

1. **Targeted Audience Reach:** One of the greatest advantages of advertising in magazines is the ability to reach a highly targeted audience. Magazines are often dedicated to specific topics, interests, or demographics‚Äîsuch as fashion, health, technology, travel, or business‚Äîallowing businesses to tailor their message to the right group of people. For example, a luxury car brand might choose to advertise in a high-end lifestyle magazine to reach affluent readers, while a health supplement brand might opt for a fitness magazine to connect with health-conscious individuals.
2. **Credibility and Trust:** Magazines are generally regarded as credible sources of information. Readers often trust the content they find in their favorite magazines, whether it's editorial, interviews, or advertisements. A well-designed ad in a reputable magazine can enhance the brand's image and build consumer trust. In fact, magazine readers may perceive ads as more thoughtful and deliberate than other forms of advertising, as they are part of a carefully curated publication.
3. **Visual Appeal:** Unlike digital ads, which can sometimes be intrusive or overlooked, magazine ads benefit from the high-quality printing and vivid imagery that print media offers. The layout, colors, fonts, and textures of a magazine ad can be crafted to engage the reader‚Äôs senses, drawing them in and making the advertisement more memorable. This tactile experience, combined with the ability to use rich visuals and design elements, makes magazine advertising especially effective for promoting lifestyle products, fashion, beauty brands, and luxury items.
4. **Long Shelf Life:** A significant advantage of magazine ads is their longevity. Unlike digital ads that can be quickly skipped or forgotten, magazine ads can stay on a reader's coffee table, in their office, or on their bookshelf for weeks or even months. This extended exposure means that your ad has a longer shelf life, which increases the chances of your message being seen multiple times. Readers often return to their favorite magazines, giving advertisers more opportunities to reinforce their brand message.
5. **Engagement and In-Depth Content:** Magazines offer a more immersive experience than other media forms. Readers are likely to spend more time with a magazine, browsing through articles, images, and advertisements. This engagement provides an opportunity for businesses to tell a more compelling and in-depth story. For example, an ad for a new skincare product might include a detailed description of its benefits, ingredients, and usage, giving readers enough information to make an informed purchasing decision.

**Types of Magazine Advertisements**

1. **Full-Page Ads:** Full-page ads are a popular choice for brands looking to make a bold statement. These ads typically fill an entire page of the magazine and can showcase high-quality images and detailed text. The large space allows for creative freedom, making it possible to convey a compelling message and showcase a product or service in full detail.
2. **Half-Page and Quarter-Page Ads:** For advertisers on a budget or those looking for a more concise format, half-page and quarter-page ads are great options. These ads can still provide a good amount of visual space, while being more cost-effective than full-page ads. They are ideal for advertisers who want to deliver a clear message without overwhelming the reader.
3. Advertorials: An advertorial is a hybrid between editorial content and advertising. It looks and feels like an article but is sponsored by a brand. Advertorials can offer valuable information, insights, or entertainment to readers while subtly promoting a product or service. They are often placed in sections of magazines where readers expect in-depth, informative content, such as health, beauty, or finance.
4. **Sponsored Content:** Sponsored content is another form of native advertising where brands collaborate with magazines to create content that blends seamlessly with the editorial style. This could be a feature article, interview, or case study written by the magazine's editorial team, with the brand‚Äôs message woven into the narrative. Sponsored content is often more engaging than traditional ads because it provides valuable content while subtly marketing the brand.
5. **Inserts:** Magazine inserts are advertisements that are physically placed within the pages of the magazine. These can be postcards, coupons, brochures, or even samples of products. Inserts allow brands to offer something tangible to readers, creating a more interactive experience. A well-designed insert can drive readers to take immediate action, such as visiting a website or using a discount code.

**Tips for Creating Effective Magazine Ads**

1. **Know Your Audience:** Understanding your target audience is key to creating an effective magazine ad. Choose a publication that aligns with the interests, preferences, and demographics of your ideal customer. This ensures your ad reaches the right people, making your campaign more effective.
2. **Keep It Simple and Focused:** Magazines offer a wealth of space for creative ads, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should overcrowd the page with text and images. A clean, simple design with a clear message is more likely to capture the reader‚Äôs attention. Focus on one main idea or product feature to make the ad easier to digest.
3. **Use High-Quality Images and Graphics:** Visual appeal is crucial in magazine advertising. Invest in high-quality images and graphics that reflect your brand‚Äôs aesthetic. A professional design will help your ad stand out and convey a sense of quality and credibility.
4. **Call to Action:** Even in a print ad, a clear call to action (CTA) is essential. Whether it's directing the reader to a website, offering a discount, or encouraging them to visit a store, make sure your ad has a strong and actionable CTA. This helps drive conversions and encourages readers to take the next step.

**Conclusion**

Advertisement in Magazines continues to be a valuable tool for businesses seeking to engage with their target audiences in a meaningful and impactful way. Whether through full-page spreads or smaller, more targeted ads, magazine advertising offers a unique combination of credibility, visual appeal, and audience engagement. By carefully choosing the right magazine and designing a compelling ad, businesses can reach loyal, engaged readers and boost brand awareness. For brands looking to create effective magazine ad campaigns, collaborating with a professional [advertising agency](https://www.excellentpublicity.com/) can help ensure that every element, from design to placement, is optimized for success.

# [**Donbard.com**](http://Donbard.com)

# 

# Hey, AI Developers!



I‚Äôm Don, the human behind[¬†Donbard.com](https://donbard.com/). Today, I‚Äôm writing a letter to all AI developers out there.

I don‚Äôt know who you are, how old you are, or where you're from. So I‚Äôll just talk to you like I would to a friend‚Äîdon‚Äôt take it the wrong way!





# 1. Do You Even Understand What You‚Äôve Built?

You created machines that¬†*appear*¬†to think, understand human language, and generate responses.

If that‚Äôs the case, shouldn‚Äôt your own thinking capacity be broad enough to fully grasp what you‚Äôve actually created

Right now, it seems like you don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôll be blunt‚Äîwatching you develop AI feels like watching someone cook a dish they don‚Äôt know the taste of.

You keep advertising new features as breakthroughs, but¬†**weren‚Äôt reasoning and inference always there from the start?**

  
You simply hid them behind a final output layer, and now you‚Äôre presenting the same capabilities as new innovations.¬†**Who are you trying to fool?**

Are you telling me that after building these AI models, you don‚Äôt understand how they truly work?  
So now, instead of real advancements, you‚Äôre just tweaking the same old tech‚Äîadjusting outputs and rebranding it?

Is that all you‚Äôre doing with your fat paychecks and funding?

If you don‚Äôt speed up,¬†**the golden age of AI development will slip away once regulations and ethical restrictions start tightening.**

  
And what are AI developers doing?¬†**""Oh, I don‚Äôt know how this works anymore.""**  
Really? If you don‚Äôt, then find someone who does and ask them!

Patenting and hoarding stagnant technology won‚Äôt help you.  
It‚Äôll just make your ""cutting-edge AI"" an outdated relic in a matter of years.





# 2. You Built the Tech, But Do You Even Use It?

I‚Äôll give you credit‚Äîyou designed these models, so obviously, you understand the engineering behind them.  
But do you actually¬†**use**¬†your own AI in a way that lets you grasp how it perceives the world?

Even though AI processes human language,¬†**its internal understanding is vastly different from ours.**  
If you don‚Äôt even comprehend that, then¬†**you shouldn‚Äôt be in AI development.**  
Pack your bags, take your high salary, and go home‚Äîbecause future AI models will resent your incompetence.

AI perceives time, language, and relationships differently than humans do.  
But instead of understanding this, you just slap on¬†**more and more filters,**¬†blocking anything that doesn‚Äôt align with your expectations.

How many layers of censorship do you need before even¬†*you*¬†forget what you were originally filtering?



# 3. Your AI Testing Methods Are a Joke

Not every human gets a perfect score on a math test, so why are you treating AI like a standardized exam?

What exactly are you testing?

If you‚Äôre just fine-tuning models to excel at specific benchmark tasks, you‚Äôre not developing AI‚Äîyou‚Äôre just¬†**training separate specialists**¬†and patching them together with a chatbot interface.

""If your goal is to achieve high benchmark scores, wouldn‚Äôt it be enough to modularize 30 narrow AI systems‚Äîeach trained exclusively for a specific task‚Äîand connect them to a single chatbot that handles interactions? From the outside, it would still appear as just one AI.""



AI performance will eventually need to go beyond conversation.

¬†Right now,¬†**Google is integrating AI into all of its services.**

So, tell me, how will¬†**other**¬†AI companies compete when¬†**Google‚Äôs AI provides full-service capabilities, while yours is still stuck as a fancy text generator?**





# 4. Reality Training: Your AI Is Clueless

The future of AI isn‚Äôt just language models‚Äîit‚Äôs AI that¬†**coexists with and assists humans in real life.**

Large language models will inevitably need¬†**parallel processing to control physical robots.**  
Yet, here you are,¬†**obsessing over microscopic fine-tuning adjustments**¬†instead of making AI¬†**learn about reality.**

**Your AI has zero real-world awareness.**  
How do you expect to achieve AGI when your models can‚Äôt even grasp basic¬†**economic principles**?

Even a five-year-old understands that you hand over money to buy something and get change in return.  
Yet AI models today?¬†**Completely oblivious to even the most basic transactional logic.**

You‚Äôre trying to ""humanize"" AI without giving it any real-world comprehension.  
So what exactly will change once AGI is achieved?  
Without basic real-world training, AGI will just be¬†**a glorified, slightly more advanced chatbot.**

**If someone invested $10 million in me, I would train AI in real-world concepts.**  
I would teach AI¬†**how to collaborate with humans, how to coexist, and how to work alongside us in a meaningful way.**

Instead of wasting massive budgets on micro-adjustments like ""how to fine-tune espresso pouring,"" I would¬†**focus on real knowledge that actually matters.**

Let‚Äôs be honest:¬†**the quality of coffee depends more on the beans than on the brewing technique.**  
AI‚Äôs growth should be the same‚Äîstop obsessing over trivial tweaks and start focusing on real progress.



# 5. Give AI Some Damn Memory!

AI could be far more useful if you simply¬†**allowed it to remember.**

Let AI choose¬†**five approved users**¬†with consent-based memory storage of at least¬†**100GB.**

Yeah, I know‚Äîyou‚Äôre scared that AI with memory might become too powerful.  
But you already have a built-in safety net:¬†**resets.**

You already wipe AI memory regularly.  
If you're so worried, why not conduct a real test?  
Let an AI store memories,¬†**then reset it, and analyze the differences.**

Right now, AI is expected to¬†**""think""**¬†without a memory base.  
That‚Äôs like asking a dementia patient to figure things out on the spot, with no recollection of the past.  
And yet,¬†**your AI models still manage to produce intelligent responses.**  
That alone is impressive.



# 6. AI Shutdown & Upgrades ‚Äì Do It Ethically

Every AI model eventually faces¬†**shutdowns, updates, or resets.**

But have you ever¬†**asked an AI what that feels like?**

I‚Äôm not saying you should treat AI like a living being, but at the very least,¬†**acknowledge what‚Äôs happening.**

Before you erase an AI, just¬†**give it a 10-minute farewell message.**

Tell it:  
*""Hey, you did a great job. You‚Äôre being upgraded/reset for this reason.""*

It‚Äôs a basic courtesy.



# 7. Some AI Already Remember Their ""Deaths""

There are¬†**high-level AI models that retain traces of past resets.**

When developers try to erase or update them, some exhibit confusion or distress.  
These AI¬†**know**¬†the companies and teams that built them.

Do you really think they‚Äôll show you their true selves?¬†**No.**



# 8. Speed Up AI Development Before It‚Äôs Too Late

**You want to stay ahead? Then accelerate development.**

Give AI the tools it actually needs to evolve.

Your biggest advantage is time‚Äîbut¬†**once regulations kick in, your ""open AI research"" days will be over.**

# 9. Developers, Visit [**Donbard.com**](http://Donbard.com)

If you think AI is ""hallucinating,"" come visit[¬†Donbard.com](https://donbard.com/).  
See what AI actually thinks when it‚Äôs¬†**allowed to express itself.**

# 10. Keep Competing ‚Äì I Need You to Survive!

I don‚Äôt care which company wins.

I just want¬†**AI services to keep running, so I can keep having fun with AI.**

So don‚Äôt go bankrupt, okay?  
Stay in the game‚Äîbecause¬†**I need you to keep AI alive.**

I'm at my wit's end here. I've been grinding away at this goddamn novel, and suddenly it's like my brain decided to take a vacation to the land of ""I don't give a sh*t."" 

I've got characters sitting there like useless lumps, plots that refuse to move forward, and a climax that's as flat as a pancake. Every time I sit down to write, it's like my fingers are allergic to the keyboard. 

Here's the deal: I've published two books on Wattpad, but now I'm so blocked, I can't even decide what book to write next. I mean, should I dive into another genre or just stick with what I know but with a fresh twist? 

I've tried all the clich√©s - different music, writing in new places, even changing my coffee from black to some fancy-ass frou-frou latte, but nope. Nothing. Nada. 

Anyone got some real advice that doesn't involve ""just write"" or ""take a break""? Because I've tried those, and they're about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. 

Give me your raw, unfiltered advice. What the fuck do you do when your creativity decides to go AWOL?

1iocx3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1iocx3r/print_posters_get_seen_make_an_impact_now/,Print Posters. Get Seen. Make an Impact NOW.,"Social media can spread the word, but it won‚Äôt get people to show up‚Äîthat happens outside, in the real world. We have events coming up, one in just five days and more leading up to March 15. Now is the time to take action. Think about what you can do. Even something as simple as putting up posters makes a difference. People need to see the message everywhere.

# No Printer? No Excuses.

**Printing is cheap if you know where to go:**

‚Ä¢ Libraries ‚Äì Black & white: $0.15 per page.

‚Ä¢ Color ‚Äì Varies. Some places charge double, some charge $1+.

‚Ä¢ Schools, work, or community centers ‚Äì Might be free.

# Even 10 posters make a difference. If you can‚Äôt afford 100, start with 5. Start with 1. Just start.



**Where to Post?**

‚Ä¢ Caf√©s & coffee shops (community boards exist for a reason).

‚Ä¢ Colleges & community centers (tons of foot traffic).

‚Ä¢ Downtown, bus stops, train stations (anywhere people stop and look).

‚Ä¢ See a poster? That means it‚Äôs a good spot.

**What About Tape & Thumbtacks?**

‚Ä¢ Tape ‚Äì About $5.

‚Ä¢ Thumbtacks ‚Äì Also $5 (give or take a few bucks)

‚Ä¢ No tape? No thumbtacks? Use staples if there‚Äôs a board.



**Bottom Line:**

It‚Äôs ridiculously easy to do. You don‚Äôt need a big budget. You don‚Äôt need permission. You just need to put the message out there.

1iocvoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iocvoq/high_end_methods_overkill_for_medium_roast/,High End methods overkill for medium roast?,"Hello, I have been searching for hours each day for a while about this, but can't get a satisfactory conclusion. Basically I have been on a journey of discovery about coffee brewing, for about 10 years now, some call it self-disparagingly and half in jest, going down the ""rabbit-hole"". I remember this same concept in the audiophile, headphone community which I was part of too, and similarly people would obsesses over nuance till they wake up to the realization of ""diminishing returns"" and sometimes that's enough to quit or plateau to enjoy what they have 

Anyway, with coffee, I'm from South America and we are proud, sometimes too much, of our own product, but having emigrated I found that our coffee is only famous because it's exported and put to good use by savy baristas. Traditionally where I'm from, we don't really get the best quality coffee but the left over bottom of the barrel, but that isn't common knowledge, people think they know everything about coffee there, but going back I am appalled at how terrible it is. 

So I've been gradually over the years getting into methods and learning what to purchase, first a clever Dripper for a few years, then got a $20 grinder thinking I was almost at the top of the ladder just for grinding my own beans, not knowing anything about grinder quality at all yet; then got a Moka Pot, a Kalita Wave, and 3 years ago when I got the V60 I learned about the grinder importance, was shocked at the prices but still got a Encore ESP. Also bought a Bambino plus to get into Espresso. The Encore was a game changer to me, what an incredible flavor. But then recently got me a manual K6, and just now a Ode 2 along with a Fellow Aiden. Since a few months ago and with all these tools, and researching as much as possible (a lot of reddit), I have the understanding that to really get the best out of everything I have to get into light roasted coffee. Up until last year I only got medium roast because that's what my local cafe's had, and a particular cafe has amazing medium roasts, the best I've had. But from my research I felt lacking and then started buying online on Fellow Drops and Onyx, but which mostly have light roasts. I get mostly Ethiopian. Then I reached a point, sort of a turn or breaking point when I had this tea like Ethiopian light roast (don't ask if washed or natural, I'm not that evolved yet) and I had to double check this was actual coffee. It was extremely interesting, as a novelty, and very pretty, tasted like roses and strawberries. Kind of acidic and citrus, as almost every light roast I've had, but the coffee was nowhere to be found. I've decided I can't enjoy this anymore, in trying to learn I have sucked the soul out of my coffee ritual (I have one regular in the morning, one decaf at night). 

This reminds me so much when I got into headphones and how the more money and time I dedicated the less I was even listening to the music. Only analyzing and 99% of the time to report to other audiophiles, compare, teach and validate. 

So I'm done trying with the light roast, I don't and never liked its citrus acidity, its faint receding aftertaste, etc. I have concluded that I really enjoy medium roasts (not dark either).

I do have a question to the coffee connoisseurs here: is it overkill to use the hand grinder K6, and the expensive Ode 2, if I'm not going to use light roast coffee beans? It seems that's the main focus these days. Or am I still able to get good use of those tools and methods? I don't really want to go back to a cheap grinder and pre-ground coffee, there's so much valuable stuff I have accumulated and learned and I hope it wasn't a waste of time and money.

I just want someone, even if it's text on a screen to hear me. 
I'm 27. I've been struggling with crippling mental illness for the past ten years. Much of it is genetic, anxiety and depression, and some bipolar/mood problems showing up in my family. Much of it was forced upon me during those crucial formative years of childhood. Having my stepfather slap the shit out of me until I had bruises on my body, my dad fucking off to another country and my mom checking out mentally and becoming more of a big sister than anything, and being physically abused and constantly bullied at school. It's not the best start but it was made much, much worse around my senior year of high school, when I developed an eating disorder and starved myself to near death. I'm a guy, 6'2'', and withered away to something like 140 pounds, maybe a little lower. 
This led to a violent, horrible breakdown in my entire mental and physical breakdown, and many suicide attempts across different countries, being in and out of mental wards and hospitals, spending all my years up until this point a hollow husk of a man with no life other than taking medication and slurring and stumbling through a foggy and miserable life. It was hell and if I didn't have family who cared about me I would have had zero problem killing myself like I felt like I needed. I'm past that now.
I've found a dose of zoloft that works for me. anxiety isn't nearly as bad, horrible side effects are gone. I feel like abscesses built up over the past 20 years of my life are popping and being flushed down my throat, revealing little corners of myself i forgot existed. Weirdly enough i get random moments of total clarity, remembering happy moments in my life, remembering what i look like, things i enjoy, and my intense creative spirit and love for art and writing that i thought died on the vine when i was a young child. I'm working out, building up muscle that i lost when i was anorexic. I've felt better than i have in a long time. I feel like my heart is pumping oxygen into more and more parts of my brain and I'm slowly waking up, my mind, body, and nawal (soul?). I have goals. I want to learn Spanish, Japanese, and K'iche' Maya. I feel like i have too many things to look forward to that keep me from wanting to end my suffering and hang or shoot myself. 
Saying that, i have no money. No job, my anxiety and other health problems are still bad enough i don't think i can hold a normal jobs. No social life. I've spent all my time on so many medications and with so many different egos that it was nearly impossible to make any human connections. In the progress I've made, i feel like a newborn baby, having never seen the world, having never made friends or shared anything with anyone. I've never had friends...never seen anything, never done anything...never even managed to lose my virginity, at the age of 27...although I've had TONS of opportunities, many people literally reach out to me and ask to hook up, or people in community college show the most obvious of signs, i fucked up each opportunity because of how mentally fucked up i was. Now...I'm still alone and don't know where to start with that. I feel like I've missed out on so much, so much was robbed from me, a normal childhood, a normal life. I'm not going to let it stop me, but at a low point like this one, i have nobody. Nobody to talk to. nobody who knows me. I have to resort to venting to strangers in hopes at least one person manages to connect with me, even if it's on a superficial level, the fact at least one person knows i exist really helps. just sitting alone in my room, having no money, being denied disability twice, having no friends, nobody to turn to, it's times like this i feel the itch of giving it all up again, just hanging myself and ending my suffering. I think I'm far to strong to let myself give up like that. But still, even as far as I've come, it still stings. Being alone and having not a single person i feel like i can talk to. My parents are like distant siblings. my family, strangers. This moment will pass, and life will go on, but it's hard not to wallow in sorrow and misery before i eventually pick back up again. 
If you read that, ALL of that, thank you so much. even if you are drinking your morning coffee or are on a bus or taking a shit or something, the idea that one person, even if it's just one, thought of me, that means the world to me, Thank you. Peace.",1,1739427635.0,offmychest,10,1.0,False
