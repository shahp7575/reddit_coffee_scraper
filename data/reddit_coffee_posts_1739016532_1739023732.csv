While it does its job and stops it from leaking through before placing plunger.

1iknxyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1iknxyo/how_to_find_motivation_when_you_feel_completely/,How to Find Motivation When You Feel Completely Stuck,"**Ever have those days where your brain feels like it’s moving in slow motion, even though your to-do list is screaming for attention?** That was me last week. I woke up, realized my coffee tasted like dishwater, and immediately slipped into “Is this really how life’s gonna be?” mode. It’s like my motivation up and left for a tropical vacation, and I was stuck at home in sweatpants.

Honestly, it happens. But here’s what’s helped me snap out of it (most of the time!):

- **Set Tiny Targets:** Instead of trying to conquer the entire universe in a day, aim for a mini-goal first (like writing one paragraph if you're stuck on a project). Small wins add up faster than we think.  
- **Check Your Fuel:** Sometimes we’re just *hangry*. Or dehydrated. Or we haven’t moved enough. Doing a quick “body check” keeps our engine running better than wishful thinking.  
- **Be a Tortoise, Not a Hare:** Ever notice that slow, steady progress actually feels more *accomplished* than a burst of hustle followed by a massive crash? Turns out consistency might be underrated.  
- **Reward the Effort:** Finished that tough email? High-five yourself with a favorite snack or a mini-break. Positive reinforcement isn’t just for pets—it works for us too.  
- **Remember Your ‘Why’:** When everything feels pointless, I like to remind myself: *Why did I even start this project/job/hobby?* Sometimes revisiting your original spark can reignite the flame.  

Weirdly enough, sometimes motivation seems to magically appear after just *starting something*. Feels counterintuitive, right? But it’s like Newton’s first law of motion: objects in motion stay in motion, and objects on the couch stay on the couch… or something like that.

Ever found a weird trick that worked for you? Or had a moment where you realized you just needed the tiniest push to get going? Because I’ve personally discovered that even a cheesy motivational playlist can make all the difference.

I’m not an expert, just a regular person in sweatpants trying to figure it out too. Sometimes that’s all the reassurance we need: knowing that being stuck happens to everyone—and that it’s perfectly normal to crawl out of it one small win at a time.",1,1739023424.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I've hunted since I was 14yo so about 20yrs and the one that sticks out to me the most was about 3yrs ago during whitetail season in SE WI.

It was a morning after a snowfall and the temp was just enough above freezing to make a dense fog. I hiked out to my spot near a marsh in the dark and waited until sunrise, drinking my coffee and just enjoying the views.

Right around sunrise out walks an 8 pointer with the thickest neck I've seen in person, just a hulk of a whitetail only about 50 yards from my spot in a tree. The sun gleamed through the fog and shined down on this deer, he huffed a bit showing he knew i was there too and I locked eyes with him. Just cold enough to see his breath as he huffed and just stood there staring me down.

I sat my .243 on the branch next to me and just watched as he picked at some vegetation, admiring what a magnificent creature this was. I thought to myself ""what a fuckin trophy he'd be"" but for the first time in my years I didnt even line him up. Just watched for a few minutes until he heard something and darted back into the brush.

Its charcoal black finish and clean lines immediately drew my attention, offering a sleek yet rustic aesthetic that complements various decor styles. This coffee table isn’t just about looks, though – it’s packed with features that make it a versatile and practical choice for anyone looking to enhance their living space.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the materials. The engineered wood surface, combined with a sturdy metal frame, feels robust and well-made. Although it’s not solid wood, the table holds its own against everyday use. The soft-close lift-top mechanism is a stand-out feature – it’s smooth, quiet, and allows the tabletop to rise to a comfortable height of 27 inches, perfect for working on my laptop or enjoying a meal while sitting on the couch. I’ve tested this feature multiple times while watching TV, and the shock-absorbing mechanism has proven reliable and safe.

[Check WLIVE ACJ029DK Lift Top Coffee Table price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/wlive-acj029dk-coffee-table-review-b09z2l8fp3/)

The coffee table’s dimensions (40.87”W x 21.26”D x 18.27”H) make it an ideal fit for small spaces, like my apartment’s living room, without overwhelming the area. Hidden storage compartments under the lift-top and sliding top have been game-changers for organizing clutter. I’ve stored everything from remote controls and gamepads to magazines and snacks. As someone with two curious cats, having a space to hide items away from their prying paws has been a lifesaver.

That said, the assembly process was no walk in the park. While the instructions were detailed, the process required patience and some extra tools. I’d recommend using a power screwdriver instead of the included Allen wrench to save time and effort. A second pair of hands was also crucial when assembling the lift-top mechanism. It took me and a friend a couple of hours to get everything in place, but the end result was worth it.

**Pros**

* The lift-top feature adds versatility, doubling as a workspace or dining surface.
* Ample storage with two hidden compartments to keep the living room tidy.
* Stylish modern design that suits various decor themes.
* Durable materials, including a water-resistant and scratch-resistant tabletop.
* Sturdy metal legs that ensure the table doesn’t wobble even under heavy use.

**Cons**

* Assembly is time-consuming and requires at least two people.
* The alignment of the sliding top can be tricky to perfect.
* It’s made of engineered wood, so it may lack the premium feel of solid wood.
* The legs’ bolts may loosen over time if not properly installed.
* Although functional, the design might not suit ultra-luxurious interiors.

Compared to competing products like the Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table, this WLIVE model stands out due to its dual hidden compartments, which add significant storage capacity. While the Yaheetech table is slightly easier to assemble, it doesn’t offer the same level of versatility or the soft-close mechanism that I’ve come to appreciate. On the other hand, the WLIVE table falls short of the Walker Edison Modern Lift-Top Coffee Table in terms of material quality, as the latter uses solid wood and has a more premium finish. Still, for the price range, the WLIVE ACJ029DK hits a sweet spot in terms of functionality and affordability.

Speaking of price, this coffee table offers excellent value for money. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, the combination of features, design, and utility makes it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a multi-functional living room centerpiece. I’ve used it for everything from hosting game nights with friends to setting up a temporary work-from-home station, and it’s held up admirably.

The lift-top mechanism is particularly appealing. It allows for a comfortable workspace without requiring a separate desk, and the soft-close design ensures it doesn’t slam shut unexpectedly. The sliding top adds another layer of accessibility, making it easy to reach stored items without lifting the entire table. The water-resistant coating on the tabletop has also proven its worth, especially after a few spilled drinks – a quick wipe with a damp cloth, and it’s as good as new.

While the table boasts plenty of strengths, I can’t overlook some of its flaws. The engineered wood, though durable, doesn’t offer the same tactile satisfaction as real wood. Additionally, the assembly process might deter those who aren’t inclined toward DIY projects. Even with these drawbacks, I’ve found the WLIVE ACJ029DK to be a reliable and stylish addition to my home.

My blood is boiling because the property manager has been made aware of her peristent behavior but has not run interference.  It is impossible to talk to her as she refuses to stop ranting. I am so sick of people treating “seasoned humans” as if they have lost their worth.  I do have a voice but I cannot use it because she simply will not shut up.  The police have been called with regard to her so many times that they’ve lost interest. In this particular incident, the police officer asked if I was hurt and when I said I was not, I was told that there was nothing they could do.  Will they do something when she shanks me with her machete?
I intend to leave this note for her. Your thoughts please:

You’re pissed because I’m not afraid of you.  
Your life is powered by lies, intimidation and cowardice 
You ever come that close to me again and it will be YOU who is afraid of ME

You rant and you shout and you scream and you pontificate.  You’re just noise.  Nothing more than a lot of noise.

I recently matched with a guy while staying in a place I’m about to leave for a while. Because of my schedule, the only way I could see him was by asking him out late in the evening. He seemed a bit puzzled at first, which I totally understand, but we ended up meeting for coffee the next day, and it was great.

I’m curious—how do men generally interpret last-minute or evening date invitations? Do they see it as spontaneous and fun, or does it raise doubts about intentions? 

In other words: Can he ever take me seriously?

So, the year’s come to a close, cuffing season is upon us and I’m still single, I feel like it’s time to finally change that. I’ve been looking on and off for about a year now and I’ve decided to give it one more shot and I’m going about it with a better mindset now I think.

I’ll get to the point, I aim to date to marry, I’d say I bring a lot to the table, and my ideal man would be someone who feels similar too. I think a relationship is best when we both bring equal value to the relationship, even if we aren’t necessarily equals in every way. I prefer a man who can lead, but not one who is abusive, or unnecessarily bossy. I want something real and healthy, just also traditional.

I’m religious, however you don’t have to be as long as you can respect that I am. I lean conservative, however I’m not rabid in my views and if you aren’t either. That shouldn’t be a problem either! 

Day to day you’ll find me in a gym, at my desk, in a coffee shop, on a hiking trail, with friends or, when I’m very lucky, in a swimming pool. I’m a pretty active and outdoorsy person, so if you’re a man who can pitch a tent, build a fire, chop wood (yum) we will definitely get on. I also love the gym, but if isn’t your idea of fun, that’s okay, just as long as you’re healthy and in good shape overall. I plan on living a long time, and I want a big family, so I want a man who I can do that with!

Physically, I’m not super picky, I’m short so most of you reading this will be much taller than me. Pretty much just be put together, hygienic and a decent weight for your height. I do love a nice beard and smile though. I’m blonde, athletic and I can clean up nicely and rock a nice dress when the occasion demands it, but day to day I’m either in gym clothes or comfy clothes. 

Touched on this earlier but I want a big family one day, ideally at least 3-5 kids (hopefully more tbh) so hopefully that’s your dream too. I have a stable career currently but after kids I’d probably prefer to stay home, it’s what my mom did for me, and I think it’s best for kids and everyone else as well. Kids need a consistent parent around. My dream is to move into the country somewhere, with a good school nearby, a good community and nature right at our doorstep. Think a modern homestead type of vibe.

So I think that’s all for now, hope this interests some of you! Send me a chat if so! ♥️",1,1739022493.0,ImpregPersonalsLTR,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're running on a treadmill, trying to do a million things, but not really moving anywhere *meaningful*? Yeah, me too. That’s why I wanted to chat about something that changed the game for me: **The Art of Intentional Living.**

You ever sit down at the end of the day and think, ""Wow, I was super busy, but did I actually accomplish anything worthwhile?"" 🙃 It's easy to get caught in the hustle, but it's not always fulfilling. Let’s dive in:

**1. Identify Your Priorities:**  
  - Write down what *really* matters to you. Is it family? Health? That side hustle you're dreaming of turning into the real deal?  
  - ❤ Focus on what lights your soul on fire. It’s like decluttering your closet but for your life.

**2. Less is More, for Real:**  
  - Instead of juggling ten tasks, focus intensely on one or two that move the needle. *Quality beats quantity all day.*  
  - Anyone else feel like multitasking is just an exhausting way to suck at several things at once? 😂

**3. Mindful Choices Every Day:**  
  - When faced with decisions, big or small, ask yourself, “Does this align with my priorities?”  
  - 🙌 Saying ""no"" to one thing can mean saying ""heck yes"" to something that truly counts.

**4. The Power of a Simple Routine:**  
  - Develop a daily routine that aligns with your goals. Wake up, sip your coffee, and set an intention for the day.  
  - And hey, if your intention is just to make it through the day without falling asleep at your desk... *respect*. 👏

**5. Celebrate Small Wins:**  
  - Yes, dancing around your living room because you resisted hitting the snooze button counts. 🕺💃  
  - Every step forward is progress; don’t forget to pat yourself on the back for the little things.

Ever tried implementing any of these? How’s it going for you? It’s not about being perfect; it’s about being *present* and purposeful.

Every time I remind myself to live intentionally, it feels like I'm finally steering my own ship instead of being swept away by the current. 🛳️ What about you? How do you stay intentional in a world that thrives on distractions?

1iknibb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iknibb,Slow growth/ no growth on my propagated Hoya. Why? :(,"Hi all, in the summer time, around July I got 3 cutting of a Hoya and propagated them in water, they grew nice long, healthy looking roots, and I planted them in September in regular soil mixed with orchid soil. I first read that I’m not supposed to water it too much, so I didnt, then I read that’s false so now I’m watering it frequently, every week, and I let the roots sit in water ( or sometimes in leftover black coffee or black tea) for a couple of days, before I pour it out. It sits on a south facing window, gets plenty of light. I finally saw some new growth on one of the cuttings today when I was wiping the leaves, because I was actually getting ready to post a question about having zero growth 😅
Anyway, is it normal that my Hoya grows this slow? Well actually one of them grows slow, the rest is not growing at all. The roots look healthy, they keep growing because they are now suddenly sticking out at the bottom, but they are just very long,I think there is no huge root system yet. So I guess watering it more helped. The mother plant is big, couple of years old, maybe 8 years old and grows quite fast actually, but maybe because it already has a developed solid root system, also sits on a south facing window and gets watered whenever my grandma remembers about it, gets mostly leftover teas and some water, probably also sits in water a lot, because she never pours it out.

At the beginning of Covid (like April, remember when we all didn't know if there would be a zombie apocalypse and were praying for a vaccine, ah the innocence. And fear. ) I researched prepping foood and bought some stuff. I thought I had researched well, I got the mylar bags and those little air packets, the whole  nine yards. 

Well I did some things wrong and wanted to warn you. 

1. There are bugs in dry goods. Well eggs actually, when you buy them. It's gross, I know, but it's for real. You'd never know normally because you cook and eat what you buy in a reasonable amount of time and just get some extra protein. However! If you do not eat it quickly you will find gross little larva and then a ton of moths in your pantry. 

So think noodles, pancake mixes, etc, completely sealed, but after a while they'ill have bugs. One way to fix this, apparently, is to freeze whatever you buy for a bit. I haven't tried it bc who has that kind of space. But just a forewarning, do your research.

2. Check to see what you're willing to eat after the expiration date. Again, I don't know the answers here, but I've got stuff from 2020 that I'm pretty sure needs to be tossed, whereas other items are probably fine for another 10 years. 

3. I got a bunch of coffee beans, cause God help us all without that, only to find out that roasted ones don't last and you have to get green. 

I'm sure I've made other mistakes that i haven't even realized yet. I will say that I felt much better after knowing that I had at least enough to survive on if we couldn't go to the store, so I am a proponent of it for your mental health. Just know that it is kinda tricky and specific and you'll want to research whatever you're getting, proper storage, and length it'll last. (Before you buy ten pounds of unusable coffee beans.)

I’m in the process of setting up a small, family-owned convenience store in Ontario and could use some advice on finding suppliers and purchasing groups. This is my first time in the business, so I want to make sure I’m setting things up efficiently from the start.

The store will have a coffee/juice corner, frozen and refrigerated sections for essentials like meat, dairy, eggs, ice cream, and beverages (juice, energy drinks, soda, milk, yogurt, etc.), along with shelves stocked with typical Canadian convenience store items. While we’ll carry some international spices and specialty products, we want the bulk of our inventory to be locally made/produced in Canada, as we’re looking to put down roots in town and support local businesses. We’re also looking to have tobacco, lottery, SIM/gift cards, etc. 

We’ve already secured a full integrated POS system, and close to finalizing our retail space. Now we need to fill our store.

I understand that category management and a solid planogram are essential before purchasing, and I’ve mostly finalized my store layout. Now, I need to connect with the right suppliers to create my planogram and finalize product selection.

Since I’m new to this, I have a few questions:
	
1.	Should I be working with multiple suppliers, or is it better to streamline with fewer vendors?
	
2.	Are there any recommended supplier networks or purchasing groups for convenience stores in Ontario?
	
3.	What are some good wholesale distributors for Canadian-made products, as well as a mix of international specialty items?
	
4.	Any advice on setting up supplier agreements, negotiating pricing, or avoiding common pitfalls ?
	
5.	I’m considering registering as a corporation to protect my personal assets—does anyone have advice on whether this is the best approach for a small business like mine?

I'm not really sure where to start with this. I haven't come on here to seek validation for ""bashing"" my partner. So please don't take it as that. As I'm sure you're all aware there's more to a relationship than a single Reddit post. I guess I'm just looking for advice/reassurance on how to deal with this as I don't have many people to talk to irl.

So I've been with my partner for 10 years. I was obviously still fairly young when we got together, maybe a little naive and I probably didn't set boundaries that 30 year old me would now (if I was entering into a new relationship).

I don't have many friends (by choice?). As I feel I am constantly made to feel guilty by my partner. The small circle of friends I do have, I rarely see as again, I am made to feel guilty. I don't socialise with colleagues at work or participate in work events as I feel it will inevitably lead to an argument. Up until now this has always been an ""it is what it is"" thing.

So what's changed? Well, I'm currently 6 months postpartum and I'm not gonna lie, it's hard. It's become evident that I don't have many people around me to lean on (through my own self isolation - wanting to avoid arguments with my partner etc). And I'd really just like some friends 🥺

Here are some examples of how he makes me feel guilty -

1) I recently met with my best friend of over 15 years. I spent a couple of days working myself up to tell him I was meeting her as I was worried it would cause an argument (we only met for coffee). He knows her by name but kept referring to her as ""when are you meeting your FRIEND"" , as if he was implying I was actually meeting someone else but lying about meeting my best friend.

2) The very small number of friends I do have he will speak negatively of, often pointing out their flaws (mainly scenarios around them being single and dating etc). Almost as if to suggest I shouldn't be mixing with people like that. He will comment on my work colleagues being ""sluts and attention seekers"" which makes me then isolate myself through fear of him calling me that too?

3) When the baby naps, I will quite often chat to a couple of my friends through social media. He will then make a big deal of me ""always being on social media, chatting to people (often suggesting men) for validation""

4) I recently went to a mom and baby group to get us out of the house for a while. I met some lovely moms there but I tried to not be too friendly as I didn't want to run the risk of them inviting me for coffee etc. When I got home he said to me ""I suppose you've probably joined a WhatsApp group with all your new silly little mom friends"" 

5) He will often say to me ""I don't stop you going out. I don't stop you having friends"" but I know that if I do go out, it will be met with either silent treatment or accusations.

6) I will say I don't speak to any other men (only female friends). However an old (male) family friend recently messaged me to congratulate me on the birth of my child and now my partner constantly brings up that I am ""always chatting to other men (family friend)"" despite only exchanging about 5 messages with him. None of which I hid or deleted etc 

There's many more examples but this post is already long enough. I just feel like it would be nice to get out and about and meet some other mom friends (whilst also meeting my own friends) without feeling like I'm doing something wrong all the time?

My cousin recently gave birth and she's got so many people wanting to help her, spend time with her and the baby. A great support network of people that message her everyday and I can't help but feel jealous.

I did flair this 'tangent' since it isn't *technically* RV, but you guys are the target audience for this sort of thing. I hope it piques your interest as much as it has mine. 

I'll include the quote even though I'm sure the serious RVers are already aware of this interview, but Jake Barber made some comments recently during a Jesse Michel's interview

>One of the guys on our team has made a breakthrough recently and uses a system which is basically a non-intrusive ultrasound system that can target the brain and induce or at least take a lot of the edge and the struggle out of transitioning into that state. So he's one of the guys that works in our new organization that is assisting us with reproducing and demonstrating all of this stuff that has gone on over decades in the program

>How the ultrasound works is it can target, it can get through the skull and it can target parts of the brain to help you transition out of intellect and into your intuition.

>The experimentation that is done and the testing that is done in order to find the people that can serve in this role is done through a random number generator. So he runs a random number generator program, and then has the subject sit there and, hopefully I'm not butchering this whole process of how he tests it, but has the subject then has the ultrasound equipment run into the brain, the Consciousness is activated through heightening intuition and lowering intellect, and now the individual can impose its will on this random number generator that's running in a computer and can cause the number to move up if he wants, or causes it to move down

At first I was mostly focused on trying to get my hands on this ultrasound stuff, I looked up SEMA lab, etc. 

But this morning I'm relaxing, sipping coffee on my patio, and it hits me. 

Why not test this ourselves? We don't *need* the ultrasound, especially users here who practice RV regularly already. If your mind is capable of RV, why should this be any different? I didn't find a random number generator online as described, it sounds like you'd use one that streams the numbers consistently so you'd get a steady line like an ECG or something. Then you try to bump the line / change the z-score.

Or maybe we could just use a pair of dice? Anyway. I figured I'd throw this out there in case anyone else wanted to try it out.",2,1739020936.0,remoteviewing,0,1.0,False

1ikn1wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ikn1wi/why_the_bunn_vp171ss_pourover_coffee_brewer_is_a/,Why the BUNN VP17-1SS Pourover Coffee Brewer is a Game-Changer,"I’ve spent countless mornings fumbling with coffee makers that either take forever or fail to deliver that perfect cup. That was until I got my hands on the *BUNN VP17-1SS Pourover Coffee Brewer*. If you’re someone who values durability, efficiency, and a consistently good brew, this is worth considering. Whether it’s a busy Monday or a weekend brunch with friends, this machine has been my trusty companion.

**Design & Build Quality**

This coffee brewer isn’t your run-of-the-mill plastic machine. Its sturdy stainless steel construction screams durability, and it’s clear that this model is built to last. I’ve had a few coffee makers that felt flimsy or looked like they might crumble after a year. Not this one. Its sleek design adds a professional touch to my kitchen, making it look like a mini coffee shop. The splash guard funnel is a thoughtful addition, keeping hot liquids at bay—something I appreciate after a few scalding mishaps with older machines. However, it’s worth noting that the included funnel is plastic, but you can easily upgrade to a stainless steel one for a fully metal experience.

[Check if BUNN VP17-1SS fits your budget on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/bunn-vp17-1-coffee-brewer-review-b0000diwzc/)

**Brewing Performance**

This is where the *BUNN VP17-1SS* shines. It heats up so fast that I barely have time to finish pouring water before my coffee starts flowing. It brews a full 12-cup pot in just under three minutes, which is a lifesaver during my chaotic mornings. Speed aside, it’s impressively consistent. I’ve tested it with both cheap supermarket coffee and high-end beans, and the result is always a well-balanced, flavorful cup.

**Coffee Flavor**

Speaking of flavor, this machine doesn’t mess around. The coffee comes out piping hot, with a smooth, rich profile that rivals what I get at my local coffee shop. Unlike some other machines I’ve owned, there’s no odd plastic taste interfering with the flavor. I even had a friend comment, “Wow, this tastes like diner coffee!”—and yes, that’s a huge compliment.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning this brewer is straightforward but not entirely hassle-free. The stainless steel exterior wipes clean with ease, and the included cleaning wire makes descaling the water tube simple. That said, the interior does accumulate steam droplets, which require frequent wiping to prevent buildup. It’s an extra step, but honestly, I’ll take it over dealing with a machine that’s impossible to clean.

**Pros**

* Extremely durable stainless steel construction.
* Brews coffee quickly and consistently.
* Produces a rich, flavorful cup every time.
* Splash guard adds safety during use.
* Easy to clean with the included tools.

**Cons**

* The plastic funnel feels out of place with the all-metal build.
* Doesn’t come with a carafe—you’ll need to purchase one separately.
* Lacks modern features like auto shutoff.
* Water droplets can accumulate under the spray head, requiring regular wiping.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When stacked against competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster and Breville Precision Brewer, the *BUNN VP17-1SS* holds its ground in terms of speed and durability. The Moccamaster offers more refined temperature control but comes at a significantly higher price point. Breville’s Precision Brewer, on the other hand, is feature-rich with several brew settings, but its plastic components don’t inspire the same confidence in longevity. If you’re looking for a workhorse that lasts for decades, the *BUNN VP17-1SS* has an edge. However, if you’re someone who values programmable features, you might find this model lacking.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Sure, the initial cost might make you hesitate, but think about the long-term savings. I’ve gone through countless cheaper coffee makers that either broke down or didn’t deliver on flavor, ultimately wasting money. The *BUNN VP17-1SS* is an investment, but it’s one that pays off with durability and performance. The lack of included accessories, like a carafe, is a bit of a bummer, but those are relatively affordable add-ons.

**Features and Settings**

This coffee brewer keeps things refreshingly simple. It’s entirely manual, so there are no confusing buttons or settings to navigate. Just add water, and it does the rest. The one warmer keeps your brew hot without burning it, though I’d recommend not leaving it on for hours as it doesn’t have an auto shutoff. The machine is compatible with standard paper filters and comes with a starter pack. It’s also portable, requiring no plumbing or special wiring, which makes it great for events or offices.

Overall, I can’t imagine my mornings without this machine. It has its quirks, but the pros far outweigh the cons.

ive only recently started looking into fragrances. im 18 so i began with bath and body works then moved to decants of middle eastern ones. i always always thought if id wanna smell like anything it’ll be cake or brownies or chocolates. i tried bbw birthday mist(was my first mist ever. liked at the beginning until i tried other perfumes and now i cant stand it), al rehab choco musk, lattafa nebras (my go-to atm), bbw pumpkin swirl cake. i even tried lattafa khamrah (didnt like), lattafa khamrah qahwa, lattafa yara (no), al rehab french coffee, VS pure seduction (also didnt like) and sdj 71 (like but too sweet for warm days). Though i do love most of gourmands, sometimes i crave for something a little more mature maybe or just less sweet or cloying? 


i love vanilla. so do you guys have non gourmand vanilla recs? i have an aversion to heavily floral or too intense spicy perfumes. but aqua or clean type perfumes would work too (tho i havent come across any)


id also love perfume recs that are usually liked by people all around. i really really wanna try kayali vanilla 28 and i do remember liking sdj 62 but i tried it long ago. i am thinking about getting VS bare vanilla but im just waiting for it to be on sale. im scared of getting bare vanilla cashmere because ive heard it smells too much of patchouli but its more commonly on sale so should i get that? id be really grateful if your recs are more famously Designer or Middle eastern based since perfumes that are purely US based like from target and all arent easily available where i live.",0,1739020549.0,FemFragLab,2,0.5,False

The first time I felt an anxiety attack was in 2019, before having sex with a girl. At that time I didn't even know what anxiety was and attributed it to first time nerves. I had a hard time and threw up, but in the end, everything was fine. Fearing the same thing would happen to me the next time, I got anxiety again, and that's where the loop started. I know that my problem, if I had dealt with it in time, would be easily solved, but it has been like a snowball that has been getting bigger and bigger. I lived with this fear, having sex terrified me, but the fear only appeared in a clear sexual situation, like going to ‘see a movie’ at a girl's house. I had a girlfriend with whom I also had anxiety and panic attacks, but as time went by and the uncertainty of sex disappeared, so did the fear. But since I left her, my panic and anxiety attacks have increased, and are branching out to everyday things in my life. I can no longer meet a girl for coffee without thinking I'm going to die first, not even with a girl who may or may not have sex. It even affects me at work, or going out partying. How do you think this medication can help me? Also I am going to therapy with my psychologist in addition to medication.

Latest episode was yesterday evening. I agreed to meet Mom at the funeral home for a visitation - a family connection, the nephew of my paternal aunt's husband. Obviously not a close relationship, but it's a small town in the south, so you show up.

When I got to the funeral home, I had to park around the back. I've been to waaay too many funerals and visitations there, and had never seen it so crowded. Okay self, take a deep breath and prepare for it to be very people-y in there.

Met up with Mom and my brother. Signed the guest book. Made sure to do the appropriate: condolences and hugs for the mom and siblings and children of the deceased. My brother did the same. 

Mom, however, just held up the line. You don't spend 10 minutes reminiscing about that one time when your late husband's brother-in-law's brother (father of the deceased) stranded you when he got drunk some time in the seventies. This is not the moment. You tell the widow and the mother of the deceased son that you're sorry, and you make a damned casserole. 

Mom does the same in every social setting now. She's gonna buttonhole every grocery employee and waiter into a 5 minute conversation that could have been an email. Zero awareness that life is eddying along outside Mom's timeline. 

I get that the beloved battleaxe is lonely and needs more social connections. I do what I can to help with that. I'm very lucky in that one of my younger daughters (14) and her grandmother have a great relationship, so the kid is happily being spoilt rotten this weekend and doing the little jobs at her Grandma's.

Mom is lonely, but she won't do anything as radical as inviting her neighbor for coffee or going to church to visit people. She'll just completely try to take center stage at the least appropriate moment. (Is it a Heinlein quote about Lazarus Long? She wants to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.)",20,1739020227.0,AgingParents,3,1.0,False

Clarissa shuffled in with their breakfast tray.

At eight-months pregnant, she was not as graceful as when she was first sent to Jack. Jack wondered if he had made a mistake to not sign up for the Peterson Premium package. It offered a replacement mate free of additional charge guaranteed from the third trimester, until Clarissa was ready to mate, or three months post-partum, whichever was sooner, subject to medical clearance. But he had felt worried about finances with a baby on the way, and Clarissa had looked so sad, and he thought it might be bad for the baby, if he upset her. He felt he didn’t get enough gratitude for that. Ah well, he could wait a bit longer, she could make it up to him afterwards.

Clarissa poured the coffee. “How are you feeling babe?” he asked dutifully. Clarissa smiled- her figure might be distorted but her face was a beautiful as ever, and once again Jack was happy that he could afford the Tier 10 Peterson Program. Most his colleagues went with Tier 6 or 7, including his best friend Gary, and the difference was quite noticeable. Alison, Gary’s Tier 6 mate, had a distinctly Semitic cast to her features, even though she had presumably undergone all the required facial and body enhancement surgeries, and Jack often wondered how Gary could bear to mate with her.

No such thought would ever cross the mind of anyone who saw Clarissa, with a face like the proverbial Botticelli angel. Jack was well aware that before the government-enforced Peterson Program, he would have been wholly invisible to a girl like Clarissa - let’s be honest, even the Alisons of the world would have barely given him a second look.

But with mass shootings and violence against women in particular at an all time high, the government had finally -and thankfully- taken matters into their own hand, and instituted the Peterson Program about a decade ago, allotting women to mateless adult males through a complicated scheme matching resources to attractiveness. The effect in restoring stability had been miraculous. Jack had been in his early twenties then- still a virgin- and he still remembered the transition. Even many women had been, surprisingly, relieved. Turns out all the poor dears really wanted was to have a man with a good steady income take care of them while they took care of the house and family. Jack wasn’t sure if Clarissa was one of them or what she did before the Peterson Program, his contract forbade any discussion of gender issues and women affairs and the past with his mate.

Clarissa said “Sweetheart, Maria will be here soon. You’re going to be late”.

Maria was their cleaner. Women Tier 5 and below were all relegated to cleaning and caregiving.

Jack pushed down his intrusive thoughts of bedding Maria- he had lusted after her even before Clarissa’s pregnancy. Obediently, he kissed his mate and left his house.

As many of you know, I work on BodyState in my spare time while still having a full-time job. That’s why I can’t always reply instantly, and why development isn’t as fast as some would like. My dream is to work on BodyState full-time, and the moment it becomes financially viable, I will. While I deeply appreciate those who support the app by purchasing themes, it hasn’t been enough to make that leap yet. That said, I’m committed to **keeping the app free**, no ads, no forced subscriptions.

To help make full-time development a reality, I’m now offering an **optional way to support BodyState** through [Buy Me a Coffee](http://buymeacoffee.com/bodystate). It’s a creator support platform like Patreon, where you can do one-time donations or support monthly. Members get perks like:

* Exclusive posts and messages
* TestFlight Beta Testing
* Reddit Flair
* Work in progress updates
* Priority Support

* 500 Core Members @ $5
* 250 Plus Members @ $10
* 100 VIP Members @ $25

This won’t change the app’s free model but will allow me to develop and improve it much faster. If you have suggestions on cool perks to add to the memberships, please share and I will consider it.

If you choose to support, thank you so much, it truly means the world to me.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

So awhile back (like 2 months ago) I asked this girl out to coffee and she agreed. We went to a little coffee shop on campus but I honestly wasn’t really feeling a spark, we stayed for about 2 hours before she had to go.

then we texted a little about life and nonsense for a few more weeks, until I sent a really cringy message, got embarrassed, and stoped contacting her entirely.

the 2 months of no contact go by and I feel really bad for the way I acted, yesterday I sent her an apology tex that said “hey (name), I know it’s been a while, and I’ve been thinking about how I handled things. I want to apologize for going silent and for anything I said that might’ve come off poorly. That wasn’t cool, and I’m really sorry. I hope you’re doing well tho!”

she saw the message and hasn’t responded. I don’t want anything out of this. And I know I’m the bad guy in this situation but I thought this was the only way I could at least try and fix something.

idk I’m second guessing myself, but I’ve unfollowed her so I won’t be seeing her in my feed so that I won’t be tempted to message anymore, and I won’t message her again. Idk did I do the right thing?

I’ve been on quite a few adventures lately, and I gotta say, having the right travel apps can make or break your trip. So, I thought I’d share my top picks that have seriously leveled up my travel game! Let’s dive in! 🏖️

**Google Maps** 📍

Okay, this one’s a no-brainer, but hear me out! It’s not just for directions. Use it to find local restaurants, check out reviews, and even see what’s nearby. Plus, you can download maps for offline use, which is a lifesaver when you’re in a place with spotty Wi-Fi!

**Skyscanner** ✈️

If you’re looking for the best flight deals, this app is a must! It compares prices from different airlines and helps you find the cheapest options. Plus, their “everywhere” feature is perfect for spontaneous travelers looking for inspiration!

Whether you’re after a cozy cabin in the woods or a chic apartment in the city, Airbnb has got you covered. Plus, it’s great for meeting locals and getting that authentic vibe. I’ve made some incredible friends through my stays!

**TripIt** 📅

Say goodbye to messy itineraries! Just forward your booking confirmation emails, and TripIt will create a master itinerary for you. It even works offline, so you can access everything you need without internet. Super handy!

**XE Currency** 💵

Traveling abroad? This app helps you convert currencies in real-time, so you never get ripped off. It’s a little peace of mind when you’re shopping for souvenirs or grabbing a bite!

**Duolingo** 🗣️

Want to impress the locals? Download Duolingo and brush up on the basics of the language. It’s fun, interactive, and can make your travels way more immersive. Plus, you’ll get some serious street cred when you order your coffee in the local lingo!

**PackPoint** 🧳

Packing stresses me out, but PackPoint takes the guesswork out of it. Just input your destination, travel dates, and activities, and it generates a packing list tailored just for you! No more overpacking or forgetting essentials!

So there you have it! These apps have made my travels so much smoother, and I hope they do the same for you. What are your go-to travel apps? Let’s swap tips! Happy travels, everyone! 🌟✨

1ikme4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ikme4r/redcoffee_making_sonarqube_reports_shareable_for/,RedCoffee: Making SonarQube Reports shareable for Everyone,"Hi everyone,

I’m excited to share a new update for [RedCoffee](https://pypi.org/project/redcoffee/), a Python package that generates SonarQube reports in PDF format, making it easier for developers to share analysis results efficiently.

# Motivation:

Last year, while working on a collaborative side project, my team and I integrated SonarQube to track code quality. Since this was purely a learning-focused initiative, we decided to use the SonarQube Community Edition, which met our needs—except for a few major limitations:

* There was no built-in way to share the analysis report.
* Our SonarQube instance was running locally in a Docker container.
* No actively maintained plugins were available to generate reports.

After some research, I found an old plugin that supported PDF reports, but it had not been updated since 2016. Seeing no viable solution, I decided to build RedCoffee, a CLI-based tool that allows users to generate a PDF report for any SonarQube analysis, specifically designed for teams using the Community Edition.

I first introduced RedCoffee on r/python around nine months ago, and I received a lot of valuable feedback. Some developers forked the repository, while others raised feature requests and reported bugs. This update includes fixes and enhancements based on that input.

**What's new in the recent update ?**  
An Executive summary is now visible at the top of the report. This will highlight the number of bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells and % of duplication. This is based on a feature request raised by an user on Github.  
The second one is a bug fix where people were facing issues in installing the library because the requests package was missing in the required dependency section. This was also raised by an user on Github.

**How It Works?**

Installing RedCoffee is straightforward. It is available on PyPI, and I recommend using version 1.1, which is the latest long-term support (LTS) release.

    pip install redcoffee==1.1

For those who already have RedCoffee installed, please upgrade to the latest version:  
`pip install --upgrade redcoffee`

Once installed, generating a PDF report is as simple as running:

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} \ --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} \ --path=${PATH_TO_SAVE_PDF} \ --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

This command fetches the analysis data from SonarQube and generates a well-structured PDF report.

**Target Audience:**  
RedCoffee is particularly useful for:

* Small teams and startups using SonarQube Community Edition hosted on a single machine.
* Developers and testers who need to share SonarQube reports but lack built-in options.
* Anyone learning Click – the Python library used to build CLI applications.
* Engineers looking to explore SonarQube API integrations.

**Comparison with Similar Tools :** There used to be a plugin called SonarPDF, but it has not been actively maintained for several years. RedCoffee provides a modern, well-maintained alternative.

However in the past few months I’ve noticed the pressure has really diminished to the point where I can’t use the two shot portafilter at all, literally nothing comes out.

The video is using the one shot portafilter and even then you can see it straining. It quite often does what this video shows, seems like it is having a hard time and then something obviously changes and it pushes it through more easily. Other times very little comes out at all.

I’ve seen people replacing things like the OPV valve or the pump. Can anyone give me an idea of what the issue is? I’d rather fix this machine than buy a new one if possible.

As an FYI I have already:

- descaled the machine
- adjusted how fine I am grinding the beans
- reduced tamping to the point where I am barely tamping it
- run the machine through the portafilter with no coffee it before doing it with coffee

1ikmdec,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ikmdec,"1984 US MRE - Menu 12, Beef in Spiced Sauce Content Pics and Taste Review","Title says it all. Julian date code (4117) only showed up on 1 item, the main dish, was embossed on the cardboard box and stamped on the retort pouch as well. Main was glued to the box, intentionally, to avoid friction holes that may form if the main moved around too much inside the box.

Oldest MRE I've tried by a long shot and I was absolutely NOT disappointed!

This thing surprised on so many levels; that being said, the items I thought would be bad were VERY bad.

Let's start with the bad, the chocolate covered cookie and fudge bar were completely rancid. No surprises there as these contain dairy and certain fats. I actually ate a bite of the cookie, chewed it a few times, and then spit it out. Did not try the bar as it was worse smelling than the cookies.

Highlights: The freeze dried strawberries, PB, and crackers were the stars by far! Absolutely perfect in every way. There is a pic directly comparing these 41 year old crackers to some 2024 crackers from an FSR. It's a sad pic to see just how far modern MRE crackers have fallen. The old ones are nicely toasted, salted well, and super crispy/crunchy. I'm not sure I can ever even eat another modern MRE cracker.....and notice how the 41 year old crackers are 100% intact but the new ones are not? Amazing right?

The main dish was edible and I did eat all of it. Was it my favorite? No. Reminded me of small dried up beef jerky bits in a slightly more pungent sloppy Joe type sauce but I have to say, in the field 41 years ago, I strongly feel like this would have been a coveted menu because of the vinegar that makes it so tangy and the accompanying sides and dessert would have been perfect too. BTW, checkout the ingredient list on that main, about 10 ingredients, all of which we can pronounce and know what they are. Take a look at a modern main and see the difference (MCWs excluded because they have great ingredient lists too usually). YIKES 

Had the coffee with sugar this morning, it was great, no issues with that at all. On a personal note, I always make freeze or spray dried coffee in  a 1/2 cup of milk with a teaspoon (5 grams) of sugar and drink it cold. Just my preference. Even Bill's brew is great that way!

Gum was great too!

Anyway, I shared this experience with my 11 yr old son who ate the strawberries, PB, crackers, and even tried a small bite of the BAD choc covered cookies. He had a great time unpacking the MRE and helping with the pics!

In summary, when I started in this hobby I was very adamant I would not be eating something this old. All of your posts and reviews and those of our YouTube reviewer community changed my mind and I thank you all for that. I agree with RevolutionAlex, this will be an experience I remember for the rest of my life. 

Take care folks! Menu 4, 1984, on the way next week!

1ikmcy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1ikmcy8/being_boring_is_amazing/,Being boring is amazing,"Recently, a colleague of mine told me I'm the very pitcure of heteronormatitivy, when I declined a team drinks for the Xth time to run home to my husband and daughter. And I guess he's right,  I'm probably the most boring/mainstream/vanilla person ever.

I don't like alcool, parties, I like to be in bed before 11PM, never smoked anything and my only addiction is essentially my morning coffee.

I will take a homecooked, healthy meal with lots of vegetables over a restaurant 99/100 times. 

I don't have any kink and just love having sweet, loving, plain vanilla sex.

I also absolutely love my life.

My incredibly husband - caring, intelligent and smart but never pedantic, strong but gentle, kind but firm, confident but humble, and so many other things. I don't fantasize/swoon/crush over other men. Why would I? None can hold a candle to him.

My sweet, vivavcious, smart, empathic litle girl - the sound of her little feet pounding the floor as she runs to our bedroom in the morning for morning cuddles, the way she hugs me and tells me she loves me bigger than the entire planet, her little voice and non-stop chatter.

I even love my job - the way it challenges me, makes me leave my comfortable zone, and has made me so much more confident and the strongest version of myself that I can be. My only qualm with my job is that it keeps me away from the 2 loves of my life a couple too many  hours a day, but on balance it is great.

I'm not sure how wanting to ""spicen things up"" or wanting ""fun"" or ""excitement"" is supposed to be a good thing, when it's just a sign that one can't be content with what one has.

My mum died suddenly and unexpectedly of a spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage last weekend and it has destroyed me.

Her mum died the week before that, and though I wasn’t close to my nan, and she was often mean and manipulative to my mum, I went to the hospital when it happened to support my mum, who was very upset.

However, during the days after my nan’s death, my mum seemed OK and it was clear a burden had lifted.

I saw her on the Wednesday and we went for coffee. She held my youngest baby boy who is 4 months old. She was having some issues with differing opinions between her and her sisters on which songs to choose for nan’s funeral so I suggested setting up a WhatsApp group between the 3 of them so that everyone was included in any communications, and to make things easier. She seemed to like this idea and I was happy to be able to help.

On Friday evening, I received a call from my sister to say my mum was having a suspected stroke so I drove to my mum’s house as quickly as I could. The ambulance service had severe wait times and despite her being already unresponsive, they said they would not be likely to get there within an hour. So I called my sister and told her we would need to get her in the car and take her to A&E.

When I arrived at my mum’s house, I saw my sister and brother-in-law carrying her out of the house and at that point I knew it was not looking good - she was completely limp. I told her I was here and that I loved her but it was clear that she was not able to communicate.
Once we got her to the hospital, they took her to resus. An hour later they came to tell us she had had a major bleed on the brain and that she would either die or be left with a severe neurological deficit.

Two days later, they turned off the life support.
I loved my mum and I can only hope she knew just how much. I think I often didn’t show it well enough. I found out that at the time of the haemorrhage, she had been messaging her sisters about the funeral songs for my nan. They had a disagreement and she ended up on the phone to one of the sisters. At that point, she said she thought she was having a stroke and the line went dead.

I am struggling with the fact that I set up the group and this may have precipitated her death.
I just want to give her one last hug, kiss her and tell her how much I love her.

I have 3 kids and it has been a struggle finding time to spend time quality time together over the last few years. We were planning on going on holiday in the next few months and it hurts so much that I won’t see her again and my boys won’t have their nanny as they grow up. She was the most caring, loving person in my world, and everything just feels so unfair and hostile now that she has been taken away. 

I’m really struggling to process this loss. I’m feeling guilt that I didn’t help her more during what was a stressful time for her. Guilt that I didn’t show her how much I love her. Sadness that I can’t just pick up the phone and talk to her. She was so beautiful, so caring and kind. I just don’t know how I can carry on through life without her with me.",1,1739018241.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I've been sober curious because there came a point in my 30s where I just felt like alcohol was taking more than it was giving, and I always felt like hell after even a small amount of alcohol. 

Something I have always enjoyed is going out with my partner and enjoying conversation over a drink. We rarely go out without kids, and when we do it's so nice to go somewhere and have an adult beverage and talk for a while uninterrupted. I'm really struggling with giving this up. I know the alternative is to grab a coffee or something, but we aren't the type to sit and chat over coffee. Is there anything else I can try to replace this ritual? It honestly just makes me so sad to give it up, but even one drink leaves me feeling depressed and disrupts my sleep and I know it's something I need to leave behind.",5,1739017930.0,stopdrinking,5,0.86,False

We got some coffee and had a walk in her town which I’ve never been before. I got her some chocolate that she really liked. We didn’t kiss after the date but I really like the few hours we had together talking about what we graduated in our degrees in and such. She also told me this was her first date from Hinge.

I liked her alot after the date and she even texted me a little while later during the day that she really enjoyed herself and she even asked me for my number(which I was about to ask) 

She texted me saying she really enjoyed herself that day and she called me cute also ahaha! She said she really liked how I got her chocolate which was nice.

We both agreed to go for some sushi next Tuesday, In fact she is actually bringing me to the sushi place and she noticed I was somewhat stressed on what place to bring her for sushi as I never been to a sushi restaurant before. We have been texting ever since up till now.

I have a couple questions now:
What will I do differently for the next date?

I like this girl but part of me is saying to keep my options open but I feel bad talking to other girls behind my back and I’ve heard that to “not leave all my eggs in the one basket thing.” I’m more of the “one person at a time” person but what do you guys think?

I brought 2 fantas (one for me and my sister) and dry shampoo. about an hour after we got home my mum came home and said she'd put £5 in my sisters bank to make it fair. (it wasn't fair as my sister had asked for £5 on Monday which my mum sent, but she didn't send me any). at this point I was pissed because I've always been left out, both my parents have always favoured my sister (15f) over me. what happened next is very random lol, I asked my mum where she was getting her coffee from because we had none in the house but she still had some in her mug. she said she orders it on amazon. I told her I meant the coffee she's drinking right now. she then said that I should've given her context but like.. isn't it obvious? i see it come in the amazon box when it arrives.. whatever. I call her stupid and then she basically just calls me stupid, so I repeat whatever she said in a mocking tone and then told her to stfu. she then was like ""someone's in a mood and it's not me"" in a super annoying voice. I lost it and said something like ""no, it is you. you're always in a mood because you're always in pain you fat cow"". (she has to do exercises and take meds but she doesn't do anything because, this is going to sound mean, she likes the attention and likes complaining) I don't really remember what happened after that, some more arguing probably, but i heard her mutter ""I wish you were at your dads"". I kind of overreacted a bit but she always does stuff like this. she's so immature and childish. (examples; when I got my GCSE results she took me to McDonald's to get my fav drink and then asked if my sister likes it too.. like? this is for me because of what I did. ugh. they always get mcdonald's without me on Fridays because that's when I go to my dads - my sister doesn't go anymore. and one time I asked if we could have mcdonald's when my sister wasn't there and my mum said no bc she'd be missing out... uh yeah I can relate. but I said we could wait until she got back but she still said no :( there's loads more examples but you get the idea.) anyway, AITA?

edit: both of my parents have clearly always favoured my sister. my mum has been incredibly mean these past few years and I just snapped. I can't take it lol, especially because we used to be close but she just changed ? I'm constantly left out and made to do things my sister doesn't have to do. when I was like 8 I literally told my dad to his face i wanted to die because of how I'm treated haha

edit 2: another example is when my dad texts me to ask how my sister is and doesn't even bother asking how I am 🥲

edit 3: when I was doing my GCSEs my mum said she'd get me a maths tutor but didn't. but this year she got one for my sister :( but thankfully I passed maths anyway, idk how lol

edit 4: also a few weeks ago I asked for some money for shampoo (bc we had none) and she said I'd have to wash the dishes for it. so I was like uh okay I guess. anyways I got the money, washed the dishes and my sister did nothing and also got money. 

edit 5: I called my mum a fat cow because she bodies shames me, my sister and my friends even though she's the only one that's overweight. it was a bit uncalled for but my mouth was talking before i even know what I was saying lol

it's not just about me being ""ungrateful"" it's about how I'm constantly left out and having to work for things, when my sister gets me for doing nothing. ",2,1739017359.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False

Loving yourself and supporting your sisters in faith is not just a luxury—it’s essential for spiritual and emotional well-being. Islam beautifully encourages kindness, self-care, and deep bonds between believers. Allah reminds us:

“And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.” (Qur’an 5:2)

Self-love and sisterhood are not just “extra” in life; they are necessary for growth, healing, and strength. Here’s how to nurture both:

1. Speak to Yourself with Kindness

How often do we encourage others but speak negatively to ourselves? Your words matter. The Prophet ﷺ said:

“None of you should say: ‘My soul has become evil,’ but rather he should say: ‘My soul has become tired.’” (Bukhari)

Replace self-criticism with gentle words. Tell yourself, I am worthy. I am enough. I am loved by Allah.

2. Small Acts of Self-Care Are Worship

Self-care isn’t selfish—it’s necessary. Whether it’s a skincare routine, a quiet cup of tea, or taking a walk, these moments help you recharge. The Prophet ﷺ reminded us that our bodies have rights over us (Bukhari), so honor your well-being.

3. Strengthen Bonds with Your Sisters

Sisterhood in Islam is powerful. A simple “How are you?” message, a heartfelt dua, or a coffee date can uplift another soul. The Prophet ﷺ said:

“None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” (Bukhari & Muslim)

Support each other, celebrate wins together, and remind one another of Allah’s mercy.

4. Physical and Emotional Well-Being Matter

Sleep well. Eat well. Move your body. Prioritize your mental health. Our well-being affects our ibadah, relationships, and mindset. Take care of yourself as an act of gratitude to Allah.

5. Keep Playfulness Alive in Life

Just as the Prophet ﷺ played and joked with his companions, we should bring lightheartedness into our lives. Laugh, enjoy hobbies, and make time for joy. Life isn’t just about responsibilities—it’s also about cherishing the moments Allah has given us.

6. Lift Others Up

A kind word, a genuine compliment, or a helping hand can make someone’s day. The Prophet ﷺ said:

“A good word is charity.” (Bukhari & Muslim)

Be the reason someone smiles today.

7. Surprise Yourself & Others

Learn something new. Treat yourself to something special. Surprise a friend with a small gift. The Prophet ﷺ said:

“Exchange gifts, for it will increase love between you.” (Bukhari)

It doesn’t have to be expensive—a thoughtful note or a homemade treat works wonders.

8. Speak Your Own Love Language

Just like in relationships, we all have ways we feel most loved. Identify yours—whether it’s affirmations, acts of service, or quiet time—and honor it in your self-care routine.

9. Stay Connected to Allah

True self-love starts with knowing Allah loves you. Make dua:

“O Allah, fill my heart with peace, confidence, and gratitude. Help me be a source of goodness to myself and others.”

10. Be Gentle with Yourself

You don’t have to have it all figured out. Growth is a journey, not a destination. Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d give a loved one.

Conclusion

Self-love and sisterhood go hand in hand. When we care for ourselves, we show up better for others. When we uplift our sisters, we create a community of love and strength.

What’s one way you practice self-love or support your sisters? Let’s share and inspire each other! 🤍",10,1739017185.0,Hijabis,1,1.0,False

Additional info : he abuses his prescription ADHD medication and will consume a month's worth in 2-3 days and will not sleep. We fought about this two weeks ago because this is a regular occurrence. He agreed that this is a problem and since he wasn't taking the medication daily as it is intended he would just stop filling the prescription and not take the medication anymore. Easier said than done, I know. But he's a narc and if I didn't 'give him the Chance' to prove he could 'change' I would be a horrible person.

I did not bring this up at the time. 

Last night he was awake playing video games in the bedroom until at least 1230am because that's when I fell asleep. Then this man wakes me up at 530am to ask me if I want coffee, ON MY DAY OFF WHEN I CAN FINALLY SLEEP IN. He's already showered and turning on his computer to play video games again. I said 'you did not just a wake me up at 530 on my day off AND you're about to be mashing keys on the keyboard right beside me' and he let out a laugh. I did not respond, I did not laugh. After 5 minutes he quietly left the bedroom. Then left the house. We share location on life 360, he got coffee then went to his dad's. I text him calling him out on the no sleeping, which only ever happens when bed abusing these medications. Which he lied and said he never filled it. I called him out again and he said it's a new medication. But that's also what he said last time. I'm just done bromos. He's coming back shortly to collect his things and we're done.

Here's how it's looking so far. The night screenshot is low quality because I forgot to turn my graphics back up after rendering 12,000 objects ;\_\_;

I'm not entirely happy with the lowest level of the base, but I'd gotten too far to go back and fix it, so meh, it'll do!

My proudest accomplishment - the 1970s Space Invaders style stained glass window of the main hall (image 4). It took foreeeever to create.

The aim is for this to be an actual functioning zoo, so I've still got a lot of work to do. The Golden Dawn base will be a bird-themed area, with a variety of different bird enclosures. Peacocks are sure to feature heavily. :3

STAGE 2: Once the bird area is up and running, another quarter of the zoo will be given over to a Black Bulls base (which will be set in a Japan-themed area)

STAGE 3: Underwater temple (going to be an actual PITA to create) with water-themed animals

STAGE 4: Forest of Witches, should be the easiest stage once I've figured out how to make something that resembles the world's biggest tree-building.

Wish me luck and send coffees! :3
