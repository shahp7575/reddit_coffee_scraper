1hikjb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hikjb5/my_current_dial_in_on_coffee_chroniclers_5050/,My current dial in on Coffee Chronicler's 50/50 switch recipe,"I'll start by saying, I haven't used a refractometer... And that this tweak is of course 100% subjective. That said - I like the changes I've made so far, but could use some advice.

For those unfamiliar with Coffee chronicler's recipe its basically this:

>1:16 ratio 

>start with the switch open and pour half the water in

>close at 45 seconds (though with larger portions this may have to be later), and pour the rest of the water in

>open at 1.45

The recipe is many people's daily driver at this point and with good reason.

I found with my current set up that it felt both too watery and too bitter. I've had great results before with this recipe, and the only variables here are a) that recently I broke the glass cone on my switch and have replaced it with the plastic cone of a mugen (thanks again coffee chronicler for that tip) and b) new beans (well, exactly the same beans and roastery, but new batch)

Anyway... after a few days of playing with variables but using the same beans (fairly run of the mill ethiopian wash) this is the conclusion I've reached.

>Grind size: Mark 4 on the fellow ode (historically I've gone finer, but since I've switched to the zero bypass mugen I've been steadily increasing grind size). I'm using 14g.

>lower the coffee:water ratio to 1:14

>after the first pour, add a splash of cold water to the kettle. with the aim of hitting around 80C,

>proceed as usual, 2nd pour at 45s, open at 1.45

I've been really pleased with how this has worked out. It feels less watery, but juicy. The lower temperature on the second pour curbs some of the over extraction I think I was getting. But it's not perfect. I think I've had these beans taste more chocolatey in the past. Overall though, it's an improvement.

Anyway... try if you like! Would love to receive any other recipes recommendations. And, to any mugen enjoyers: how are you efficiently getting the paper onto the brewer without tons of air bubbles? I've been frustratingly inconsistent with it, although usually by the last pour the weight of the bed and the water smooths most of it out.

I did find these required a finer grind setting than the previous bag. Discussion points here: 

1. Is there a correlation between bean size and grinder setting, or is it just coincidental?

2. Is there a correlation between flavor and bean size? I find this bag to be a little less acidic.

1hikhdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hikhdd/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1hiketi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hiketi/how_do_you_breakup_with_someone_with_mental/,How do you breakup with someone with mental health issues?,"I (28F) have a sort-of friend (31F). We met at a job we both worked at about 5 years ago, but we didn’t really work a lot together, we just met at the occasional social gathering. She left the job after only a few months. We hung out outside of work about 4 or 5 times since then, so averaging about once or twice a year.

I’ve never considered us to be particularly close, we text occasionally and don’t hang out a lot. As time has gone on, we’re in very different places in life and I think our friendship has come to a natural conclusion.

Unfortunately, she has quite severe mental health issues (depression, anxiety, self-harming) on top of possibly autism. I have been somewhat supportive, like meeting for a walk or hanging out during particularly difficult times. I also tried to hang out more and just meet up for coffee etc. and we’d make plans but she is very notorious for just not showing up because she was sleeping or something. We had a mutual friend before who just blew up at her a few years ago for constantly cancelling and ghosting and it was getting pretty annoying tbf. I always said I was understanding and expected that I would receive the same understanding if I ever had to cancel, but this wasn’t the case and she’d actually get pretty upset even if I couldn’t do something incredibly last minute (like something in an hour but I live an hour and a half away). Generally, she’s inconsiderate of peoples’ time.

Due to the lack of consideration for my time, how our lives are in such different places, and hanging out with her being very draining (I had a mental breakdown a few years ago and I really have to protect myself from her being an emotional vampire), I think our friendship has just run its course. I have stopped making effort to hang out, and come up with excuses not to, and I don’t really engage in texts. I would have thought that after a year, she might take the hint and just move on anyway because of lives are so different. Instead, she’s got even more intense and is sending me hand-written letters even though we haven’t seen each other in a year.

It’s like trying to break up with someone who’s way more into you than you are into them, and because of her mental health issues, I don’t really know how to make it more clear I don’t want to continue a friendship. Clearly, the hints are not working, but I don’t want to send a message and potentially trigger some depressive episode. I know I haven’t been a great friend, but I never agreed to being as close as she seems to think we are, and I’m starting to think it’s cruel to just keep declining invitations and not replying to texts for days if she’s just not capable of taking the hint. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you",1,1734703309.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hik9to,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1hik9to/why_do_people_ignore_me/,Why Do People Ignore Me?,"For years, I’ve been struggling with connecting with people, especially when it is not in person.  Since graduating several years ago and reaching out to reconnect, I’ve been ignored a lot.  I would send a quick message and say I hope things are well or congrats on the marriage, job, kids, etc. and never hear back, even though it says they have seen it.

I just don’t get it.  You would think, even if I didn’t study with them or even know them as well, they would at least acknowledge it or say thanks.  I would think people of similar backgrounds or interests might want to spend a few minutes with it.  Likewise, I can’t think of me doing anything that would justify them going no contact.  I can only think of one time where I got upset at someone and told them to F off, before coming back a few minutes later and apologizing.  I know I shouldn’t have done that, but they must have pretty thin skin if that is the worst they have heard.

I know people are busy and have their own problems, but that excuse doesn’t impress me.  My life has been very easy compared to so many, but it still had its difficulties.  I’ve worked full time since I was 22, and was in school or working part time since I was 18.  I’ve struggled with OCD, migraines, job loss, work stress, school stress, rejection.  I grew up with loving parents, but money was often tight and this caused a lot of disagreement.  I think much of the issue was my dad had undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.  He lost his job after getting quite sick with Hep. C (back when chemo was the only treatment).  Thankfully, he got better.   My mom had breast cancer more recently, but thankfully it was caught early and treated.  Sorry if that was a bit of a rant, but it felt good getting it out.  And I should mention that I have never told anyone of those things, so it’s not like I’m trying to dump that on them.

But despite that, I still make time for people.  I would still get back to someone who reached out to me, even if it is just a sentence.  Sometimes I did it out of feeling interested.  Other times, it was out of politeness.

I feel like there are only two reasons that it could be:

1.  I come off as overly friendly.  Sometimes I might get a bit overly enthusiastic about talking with people.  I think it’s because I’ve often been shy in life, so feeling I can reach out to someone, and having the courage to do so can be somewhat exhilarating.  That and I like to inject a bit of passion into life.

2.  Sexuality.  Recently, I’ve come to the acceptance that I am at least bi-curious if not bi.  This was a tough road filled with confusion, anger, shame.  I still haven’t told anyone yet.  I never asked any one of these people out on a date, nor did I ever make any sexual advance or even joke.  The only thing I can think of is if I subconsciously displayed some more feminine traits at times, and they falsely thought I was asking them out if I said let’s hang out, grab a coffee, go to a party, etc.  I had no romantic interest in them.  And even if I was gay, I think it’s pretty bad to assume that every conversation I have is intended only for sex and that I am incapable of friendships.  

So, what do you think it is?  Should I take a more neutral approach to people, or is it just that some people don’t how else to say no?  Or am I just dealing with assholes?",2,1734702906.0,confidence,0,1.0,False

With the internal burr grinder setting to 6 (Default the machine came as), but when pulling the shot the needel would be in the center of the “Espresso Range” but one pull is moving slowly, while the other is almost completely stationary (dripping) depending on the grind setting (on the side).



I’ve also tried setting the internal burr grinder to 4, but the result is similar. The needle is still in the center of the “Espresso Range,” and the coffee comes out as drips or breaks in the stream, appearing thin.



In comparison to my previous Breville Barista Express, this unit doesn’t behave this way. It either drips or comes out as water by pinging on either side of the pressure gauge, rather than sitting in the middle witch would normal mean a good shot and flowing as it should.

As a disclaimer, I am from Europe, and as such things that may be standard for a lot of people on here that are from the US, it may not apply.

Firstly I'd want to ask if there is functionally a difference between demineralized water and deionized water. I know one is filtered, and the other is distilled. DeMi water usually still contains 0-5 ppm, whereas DeIo water is at 0. DeMi water is also significantly cheaper.

Where I am from, it is very difficult to buy 'food' grade purified water. It is either DeMi water where it's intended use is to clean appliances or used in other, non food safe environments, or DeIo water that is lab grade. The purifying of DeMi water is not held to any strict standards, and you have no idea what the state of the factories is that produce it. Since it's not intended to be drank, they can pretty much do anything to it as long as the ppm coming out is lower than a certain baseline.

 It also comes with a big warning label that says not suitable for drinking (although it does not differentiate based on if this is because the process is unsanitary, or because purified water is unhealthy to drink on its own because of its osmotic properties within the body).

Getting lab grade purified water is obviously a lot more difficult and pricey, and together with also having to buy the minerals separately, not financially viable.

I've know of the ZeroWater filter, however I have heard that it starts leeching the filtered contents back into the water much sooner than the intended maximum use (75L+), and that it doesn't always produce 0 ppm water regardless. Having to buy new incredibly expensive filters on biweekly basis seems rather wasteful.

I've also seen some people that have a home RO system, and have been looking into that as well. Price varies a lot from system to system but the baseline for one is about 350-500 bucks. What kind of results do people have with those; I am curious.

So I'm left to wonder, how do people over here solve these issues? Do you just buy unregulated purified water in the hope that it's made properly? Do you splurge for the lab grade water? Or does it not matter to you if the water still has some ppm baseline after filtering it at home?

*November 13, 2024*

Throwaway account . I appreciate if you give me your honest opinion as I’m being pressured from everyone ( except my aunt) to go against my wish . I’m a 30 year old woman. I have been with my fiancé Sarah for the last 5 years. We are the same age and we met at grad school. When I was 13 my loving dad passed away. He left a decent amount of money for us . 

My mom within 6 months got engaged to a guy named Bob. Bob had a daughter around my age . My mom married Bob within a year of my dad’s passing . Bob really hated me from the start and didn’t even try to hide it. 

He was saying stuff like how my mom should have sent me to a boarding school , how if it wasn’t because of my dad’s inheritance he wouldn’t have me in his house , or I’m a “bulldyke” because I was in our school sport team and very athletic . 

He multiple times told my mom he doesn’t feel safe when his daughter is around me . I wasn’t even yet ! Used this as a reason to exclude me pretty much from everything . 

My mom on the other hand was going above and beyond to prove to Bob that she is the new mom for Bob’s little princess . They ended up having 3 more kids. Basically I was a roommate who did babysitting for my mom and her New family . I never had a birthday party or a special day . My dad’s sister was amazing to me . I was at their place all the time . She and her family had birthday celebrations for me and my mom was making excuses not show up and of course rest of them never showed up ( I was really my aunt and uncle’s daughter! They were amazing to me ). 

When I left for university I contacted my mom a few times but she was always busy so I just gave up. Here is the issue , Sarah , my fiancé come from a very family oriented background. Family is everything to her. Her family asked about mine I said my dad passed away and my mom is busy with her family and lives across the country( she lives one hour drive from us but this is what Sarah told them so I just didn’t correct them ) . I didn’t entirely lie technically.

 Sarah asked me to invite my family to our wedding . I told her no. She said it’s very embarrassing not having only my aunt and her family on my side . 

I reluctantly invited my mom. She called and asked me to apologize to Bob and my step and half siblings for not inviting them and invite them all. I told her no ! She said I’m being ungrateful and Bob was a father figure to me. I had a big argument with my mom over this . 

My mom now says the only way she comes is if I invite Bob , his daughter and their kids. Sarah is now pushing me to invite them all because she doesn’t wanna feel embarrassed in front of her family .

 These people never even gave me card or said happy birthday to me so I see no reason to celebrate my big day with them. I on the other hand don’t wanna let my fiancé down. I just don’t know what to do ? Should I swallow my ego and invite my family so my fiancé be happy ? I suggested eloping but Sarah is a firm no. AITAH to ruining my fiancé’s day by not fulfilling her wish ?

Edit : Sarah knows everything about my life. My aunt even talked to her about how they treated me when I was growing up.

Edit 2: I will have a serious talk with Sarah tonight . I’ll try to update soon

>#[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gr57sz/update_fianc%C3%A9_pushing_me_to_invite_my_estranged/) 
*November 14, 2024, 1 day later*

Thank you for your comments and DMs. They really gave me perspective on my life. I sat Sarah down last night and explained my reasoning for not inviting my family. She kept saying, “That was a long time ago; they might not be the same people anymore.” I felt offended and said, “How on earth are you lecturing me when you’ve never even met them?”

Well, it turned out my mother has been in touch with Sarah. Sarah said they regularly meet for coffee dates and talk. I was about to cry because I was so angry. My mom changed the whole narrative, saying Bob was a father figure, a good, protective dad, and that it was me who didn’t love him back because, apparently, it’s my thing to play the victim. She claimed my aunt manipulated me and stole me from their family, trying to be a replacement for my mom. According to her, it’s all about my mother.

I screamed, “ARE YOU FOR REAL? Ask her next time on your coffee dates why I never had a birthday party growing up! Why was there never a gift under the tree for me? Ask Bob if he even knows when my birthday is, since he was such a loving dad! Why did my aunt have to pick me up before Christmas Eve because Bob wanted to spend the holiday with his kids, not with another man’s mistake?”

Sarah basically repeated what my mom has told me my whole life: “You just love to make a big deal out of everything, make yourself a victim, and push everyone away.” I told her she had no right contacting my mom. She said I was cruel and claimed she was just trying to help me mend my broken relationship. She even called my mom lovely and said Bob has changed a lot; he’s now an LGBTQ ally now that his princess is out ! I was floored. An ally? Maybe he should start by apologizing to me for terrorizing my entire childhood.

I told Sarah we are done. I can’t do this. Sarah sarcastically said, “You just proved your mom’s point! Go run to your aunt! Let that old witch run your life.” I told her she needs to find a new place ASAP, considering she’s not paying rent—I am. She got mad and asked what excuse I was going to make up this time to justify my “bullshit trauma.” I stopped replying. She went on a tirade, breaking our dinner plates. I didn’t care. I texted my aunt, and she asked if I wanted to spend the night at her place. I said I was fine.

I’m taking time off from work. I cleaned up the kitchen (which was full of broken dishware) in the morning because I didn’t want my cats to accidentally get hurt. Sarah is still sleeping. I’m going to see how I can legally evict her. I’m a complete mess, but I’ll talk to my aunt and uncle for help.

Yes, I am not starting to date again until I see a therapist and work on myself. I can’t keep going through this.

*December 19, 2024, 5 weeks later*

I still get DMs asking for an update.

 1- Sarah moved out ! Finally . Her family cursed me and my aunt and uncle as they were packing her stuff. I asked my aunt and uncle to be there because I was terrified of her family lol. Luckily, they didn’t do anything crazy ! just a lot of verbal attacks

 2-my mom left me a nasty voicemail. She said im a worthless human being and blew the best thing happened to me over some childish resentments . She said that’s who you are! Ungrateful spoiled brat! Her husband apparently raised me and I was ungrateful.. whatever mom! Leave me alone 

3- I met with a therapist that I liked but he is going to retire soon due to health issues.. fml.. he referred me to his colleague. So new year , new therapists ? 

4- I’m not dating ! I do a lot of social activities with my friends . Overall I’m very happy 

5- next step? Who knows maybe save my money to take my auntie to a nice vacation? I don’t have many plans tbh haha

1hik1nf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hik1nf,Velvet Smoke from Atelyer & Ashforde ,"I ordered Gentlemen's Velvet Smoke after seeing ad from Atelyer & Ashforde (new Indian Frag House) on FB. Received the order in 4 days.

I am writing this review after wearing this perfume for last 2 days consecutively. Initially, I did a test spray on my wrist and I could see that perfume has high level of oil concentration. A&A claims that their perfumes have 40% oil concentration and that's most likely the case.

This perfume opens up with a boozy (premium Rum) and spicy sweet cinnamon and I could smell faint aroma of nutmeg. As it settles, in the middle, I get sweetness from dates. The dry down is really amazing, I can smell smokey vanilla and perhaps some tonka bean as well. A&A have mentioned that scent profile has Citrusy and Coffee notes as well however, my nose couldn't detect any coffee or citrusy accords though.

I've Khamrah as well and I would say, Velvet Smoke is not a clone but a better version of Khamrah, it's a Super Khamrah according to me.

As for Performance, it has an excellent longevity, lasts more than 12 hours on clothes, nothing stays on my skin for very long and I typically avoid spraying perfumes on skin as well, however, test spray lasted more than 2.5 hours and post that scent vaqnished. It projects and leaves a scent trail for around 3 hours.

As for presentation, it was decent, came with a thick paper box however, bottle is of premium quality and atomiser is good as well.

If one likes sweet, spicy, and warm fragrances or a fan of Khamrah, Velvet Smoke will not disappoint. It’s quite affordable, luxurious, and long-lasting—a fragrance.

A&A have priced this at ₹899 however, I got a discount of ~ ₹235 as they had an offer, I paid ₹664 for 50ml.

I've ordered 2 more from A&A, waiting for the delivery and I will post my reviews soon.

I am a 38 year old entrepreneur looking for someone to spend time with—whether it's for coffee dates, casual travel (domestic or international), or just to have meaningful conversations. After a few rough experiences with relationships (including being cheated on), I have become disillusioned with traditional romantic connections. So, I am not looking for a full-blown relationship, but rather a companion to spend time with in exchange for compensation.

I am willing to pay for your time and company, and just to be clear, I am not looking for anything sexual. I am hoping to find someone who enjoys deep conversations, occasional hugs, cuddles, and simple companionship. It’s about connection without any expectations of a typical relationship.

It was not merely a trip from one place to another, but a voyage through time and space, a pilgrimage through the corridors of history and the expanses of imagination.  
  
My travels began in the cobblestone streets of an ancient European city, where the echoes of centuries whispered tales of conquests and revolutions. Each step I took seemed to awaken the spirits of the past, as if the very stones beneath my feet retained the memories of bygone eras. I wandered through narrow alleys lined with quaint shops, where artisans plied their trade just as their ancestors had done centuries before. The scent of freshly baked bread mingled with the aroma of brewing coffee, enveloping me in a comforting embrace of tradition and nostalgia.  
  
From the old world charm of Europe, my journey propelled me into the bustling metropolis of a futuristic city, where skyscrapers pierced the heavens and neon lights painted the night sky in vivid hues. Here, the rhythm of life pulsated with the energy of progress and innovation. I marveled at the sleek architecture and technological marvels that seemed like something out of a science fiction novel.

I’ve recently started studying law in a big city (in my country 19 is the most common age people start studying) It’s been only a couple of weeks but I’ve met some great people. Whole 1st year has been divided by the administrative into smaller groups (It’s a common practice meant to help us feel more comfortable) and literally everyone in my group instantly befriended each other and so my friend group of 10 people - including me - formed. We started going to malls, bars, zoos together and it felt like we were becoming closer and closer.

Every day after lectures we left the campus together and headed to our rented flats, a road down two people always enter their building and later when we reach the park we always split into 2 groups of 4 people and each group headed their way and later everyone went to their buildings.

Some time ago me (19M) and (19F) friend were falling a little behind the rest but like 4 steps at best. When we’ve reached the park and it was time to split. She quickly made sure others wouldn’t hear and asked if I would be interested in grabbing some coffee together (It would be hilarious if I just misunderstood and she didn’t mean a date at all) I didn’t know how to react but I’m famous for my easy going attitude so I said: sure so what I’m just gonna message you and we’ll agree on the time and place. She replied great and we said our goodbyes and split into fours like we always did. I didn’t say anything to the rest because I didn’t want to cause her any trouble and just normally headed home.

I feel like she is definitely in the top 3 of the closest people in the group but number one is my best friend (19F) and she is the only one who knows I’m asexual. I always thought of me as Ace but not AroAce because I hope I just haven’t met the right person. The girl that asked me didn’t know and now I don’t know how to break the news? I feel like I could try to be in a relationship but when I dated before I figured out my sexuality my ex girl said I’m emotionally unavailable and kissing me is like kissing a stone (looking back I should have figured it out then). So I don’t want history repeating and I don’t want things to be awkward after breakup. Other option: I could tell her the truth on the first date but I feel like things will still be awkward when we see each other during lectures. Personally I don’t want to be even in a platonic relationship right now but truth be told for 4 straight years I’ve been telling myself „I don’t want to be in a relationship right now but next year I will try„ but I also don’t want to end up alone

1. One of my relatives has a daughter, they live in another state and they usually come over during Christmas time. This girl is around 8, and my golden sister and NMother enjoy putting a show for this girl every Christmas (Last year they bought her some Barbies, hired a trampoline just for the sake of jumping together and posing for facebook as the perfect family, they buy her bags of candy,  new clothes, makeup, etc. Even my absent father joins this BroadwayTheare).

2. Staying around this girl and especially around the two narcs: it triggers my inner child. It makes her hurt and triggers her to be self destructive, especially because during my childhood I loved Barbies so much and was denied so much. I was barely able to dress pink, let alone dream with a trampoline! Never had it. During my birthday parties I had my awful narc mother's face staring at me making me feel guilty for having a cake, If I had one...

3. I already know they do this for narcissistic validation. But I can't and won't mask anymore. I don't wanna join their Christmas reunions, meetings, coffee afternoons and all that crap (It all starts tomorrow). I already been present for 26 years and this is the year 27 AKA the FIRST of me saying no. Yes it will hurt to celebrate alone, but will definitely hurt LESS than to be there masking and being a fake person.

4. I already don't join their Christmas night celebrations, but I would usually try to ""make it social"" during their visits and have casual conversations with relatives who know crap about me but only ask things about my life... I am the scapegoat, but they probably think I am the problem.  This year, I will be FULLY removing myself from this scene. I realized I don't like my family and I know they don't like each other because they are narcissistic and talk shit behind each others back all year: I am not fake anymore and will not engage in the fakery anymore. 

5. This year, I will be taking care of my inner child. Which means not engaging at all. I already communicated I don't wanna be solicited or bothered, and that I will not be leaving my room for joined activities. I will be out of the house, or inside my room, and I don't wanna be called or asked for.   
  
6. I know they will soon accuse me of hurting the ""little girl's heart"" just because I don't wanna play the theatre of cute cousin. See, I'm not a cute cousin. I don't like kids, and I'm a childish adult for obvious reasons: I was being parentified while I should be a kid. Now, I'm an adult meeting my childhood needs, and it's not easy to do it by myself. I also don't like sharing my makeup and absolutely don't wanna spend time with her and won't be doing it. I was masking in order to protect the family's needs, and one day she will grow up and maybe understand. Her mother is very narcissistic as well, and honestly will start despising me from the moment she realizes I decided to not interact with them anymore. 

6. The narcissistic family narrative: ""You are destroying our Christmas. How can you be so cold, unforgiving and ungrateful after everything we do to you on a daily basis?""  
  
7.  But what they really mean behind the mask is: ""Scapegoats should not have a right or voice to choose, and if you are having this, you are clearly creating us problems. You were not meant to reach this level of awareness, and we will, for SURE, make you pay for this, we will try to make you feel guilty.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but how much water in a day should you drink to truly transform your health and wellness? Understanding your hydration needs can significantly impact your overall well-being. Let’s break down what you need to know about daily water consumption and how it can enhance your health.

### Understanding Your Body's Needs

Your body is made up of approximately 60% water. This means staying hydrated is crucial for various bodily functions, including:

- Regulating body temperature
- Keeping joints lubricated
- Protecting your organs
- Transporting nutrients
- Improving sleep quality

When you ask, ""How much water in a day should I drink?"" the answer can vary based on several factors like age, gender, physical activity, and climate. However, a common recommendation is to aim for about eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, also known as the “8x8 rule.” This translates to about 2 liters or half a gallon.

### The Impact of Hydration on Your Health

Staying adequately hydrated can bring remarkable benefits to your health:

- **Enhances Energy Levels:** Dehydration can cause fatigue. By drinking enough water, you can maintain your energy levels throughout the day.
- **Boosts Cognitive Function:** Proper hydration supports brain function, improving focus, memory, and overall cognitive performance.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water helps dissolve nutrients and fiber, making it easier for your body to digest food.
- **Promotes Healthy Skin:** Drinking enough water can lead to healthier skin, reducing dryness and wrinkles.
- **Supports Weight Control:** Often, when you feel hungry, you might just be thirsty. Staying hydrated can help curb unnecessary snacking.

### Tailoring Your Water Intake

While the “8x8 rule” is a solid guideline, your individual needs may differ. Here are some factors to consider when determining how much water in a day you should drink:

- **Physical Activity:** If you're active or exercise regularly, you will need to drink more water to compensate for the fluid loss through sweat.
- **Environment:** Hot or humid weather can increase your need for water. Similarly, heated indoor environments will also require more hydration.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain health issues, like kidney stones or urinary tract infections, may require you to increase your water intake.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need additional fluids to stay healthy.

### Signs of Dehydration

Recognizing the signs of dehydration is essential to maintaining optimal health. Be aware of the following symptoms:

- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Dark yellow urine

### Tips for Increasing Water Intake

Finding ways to incorporate more water into your daily routine can be easier than you think. Here are a few helpful tips:

- Cary a reusable water bottle to track your intake.
- Set reminders on your phone to drink water at regular intervals.
- Add slices of fruit, like lemon or cucumber, to enhance the flavor of your water.
- Eat water-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables like watermelon, celery, and cucumbers.

By focusing on how much water in a day you should drink, you can make significant strides in your overall health and wellness. Hydration is not just a choice; it’s a crucial component for leading a healthy lifestyle. Make water a priority, and your body will thank you!

The Impact of Hydration on Physical and Mental Performance
----------------------------------------------------------

Staying properly hydrated is essential for both physical and mental performance. Many people underestimate how much water in a day they need to drink, thinking it only affects thirst. However, hydration plays a critical role in several bodily functions, thereby impacting how well we think and perform physically.

Water is crucial for regulating body temperature. When you sweat during exercise or physical work, your body loses water. If you don’t replace that lost fluid, your body could overheat, leading to exhaustion or heatstroke. This can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Therefore, knowing how much water in a day should I drink can significantly enhance how your body performs under stress.

Another key benefit of staying hydrated is improved physical performance. Studies show that hydration helps maintain endurance and helps reduce fatigue. Dehydration can lead to muscle cramps, dizziness, or even impaired coordination. When your muscles are well-hydrated, they can efficiently perform movements that require strength or speed. This means activities from running to lifting weights become more manageable and effective.

Similarly, hydration plays a vital role in cognitive performance. The brain is nearly 75% water, which means it relies heavily on hydration for optimal function. Lack of water can lead to mental fatigue, decreased alertness, and impaired concentration. When you ask yourself how much water in a day should I drink, consider not only your physical activity but also how you feel mentally. Proper hydration enhances memory, mood, and overall cognitive skills.

Here’s how hydration affects both areas:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Physical Tasks:** Adequate water intake boosts your stamina and strength. When you are hydrated, your heart rate stabilizes, allowing your blood to flow easily to your muscles.
- **Endurance:** For those engaged in endurance sports or long-duration activities, staying hydrated prevents early fatigue and enhances performance.
- **Mental Clarity:** Staying hydrated improves your ability to focus on tasks, reducing brain fog that often comes from fatigue.
- **Mood Regulation:** Hydration can influence your mood. Dehydration has been linked to increased perceptions of task difficulty and anxiety.

But how do you know if you're drinking enough water? Here are some signs you might be dehydrated:

- Dry mouth or dry skin
- Feeling fatigued or sleepy
- A headache or feeling light-headed

To maintain optimal hydration, many experts recommend drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day—known as the ""8x8 rule."" However, individual hydration needs can vary widely depending on factors like body weight, activity level, and climate. It is always a good idea to listen to your body; if you’re thirsty, drink water! Additionally, foods you consume also count towards your daily hydration—fruits and vegetables, for instance, are filled with water.

Always remember, hydration isn’t just about drinking water; it’s also about maintaining a healthy balance of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, which help regulate fluid balance in the body. Consuming sports drinks or electrolyte-infused water during intense physical activity can also help. Just be cautious of added sugars!

If you’re active or in a hot environment, it may help to drink more than the usual recommendation and adjust your intake based on your activities. This proactive approach can transform your health and wellness, leading to improved performance both physically and mentally.

The Role of Hydration in Weight Management and Metabolism
---------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is more than just quenching your thirst; it plays a vital role in weight management and metabolism. Understanding how hydration affects your body can help you achieve your health goals effectively. Let’s dive into the importance of drinking enough water and how it can transform your approach to weight loss and overall wellness.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Connection Between Hydration and Weight Management

Water is an essential component for various bodily functions. One of its key roles is in regulating your metabolism, which is the process your body uses to convert food into energy. By ensuring you’re properly hydrated, you can support this process effectively. Here’s how:

- **Boosts Metabolism:** Drinking water can temporarily increase your metabolic rate. Studies suggest that drinking about 500 ml of water can boost metabolism by approximately 30% for about 30 to 40 minutes. This means more calories burned without much effort!
- **Reduces Hunger:** Sometimes, we mistake thirst for hunger. Staying hydrated can help you determine whether you are actually hungry or just need a drink. Keeping a water bottle handy can minimize unnecessary snacking.
- **Increases Satiety:** Drinking water before meals can make you feel fuller, which may lead to reduced calorie intake. Adding a glass of water to your routine before eating could contribute significantly to your weight loss goals.

### Importance of Hydration for Metabolism

Your metabolism is influenced by many factors, including age, muscle mass, and activity level. However, hydration is often overlooked. Here are some ways good hydration contributes to a healthier metabolism:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Supports Digestion:** Water aids in the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients. When you’re well-hydrated, your digestive system works efficiently, preventing issues like constipation which can hinder weight loss.
- **Enhances Nutrient Use:** Proper hydration ensures that your cells have the necessary fluids to absorb nutrients effectively. This means your body can utilize the food you eat more efficiently, translating to better energy levels and metabolism.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Hydration helps control your body temperature, which is crucial during exercise. Maintaining optimal performance during workouts is necessary for burning calories and losing weight.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

Knowing how much water you should consume daily can be confusing. While the general recommendation is about 8 cups (64 ounces), individual needs vary. Factors that influence your water intake include:

- Your body weight: A common guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water each day.
- Your activity level: If you exercise regularly, you’ll need more water to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- The climate: Hot or humid weather increases your need for hydration.

### Practical Tips to Stay Hydrated

More water into your daily routine doesn’t have to be a chore. Here are some engaging strategies to help you stay hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a reusable water bottle:** Keep one with you at all times. Having water readily available makes it easier to sip throughout the day.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone to set hourly reminders to drink water. This simple act can help you develop a consistent habit.
- **Add flavor:** If plain water isn’t appealing, try adding slices of lemon, cucumber, or berries for a refreshing twist.

It’s clear that hydration plays a crucial role in weight management and metabolism. By prioritizing your water intake, you can unlock potential weight loss benefits and improve your overall health. Remember to listen to your body—if you feel thirsty, grab a glass of water and enjoy its numerous advantages. A small change in your hydration habits can lead to significant transformations in your health and wellness journey.

### Conclusion

Embracing the right amount of water each day is fundamental for nurturing optimal health. When considering how much water you should drink, keep in mind that hydration plays a vital role in both physical and mental performance. Sufficient water intake can enhance your focus during tasks and boost your energy levels, allowing you to achieve your best in daily activities.

Implementing innovative strategies, like carrying a water bottle or infusing your water with fruits, can easily help you maintain daily hydration goals. Always listen to your body and recognize the signs of dehydration, such as fatigue, dry skin, and headaches, so you can act before it impacts your well-being.

""First Impressions and Build Quality""

The moment you pick up the Herb Ripper, you realize this isn't your typical grinder. Crafted from medical-grade stainless steel, it has the kind of heft that makes you wonder if it could double as a self-defense tool (not recommended). The matte finish isn't just for looks; it gives the grinder a premium feel that makes my other kitchen tools suddenly feel somewhat inadequate.

What immediately stands out is the engineering precision. The threading – oh, the threading! It's like the designers looked at regular grinders and said, ""You know what? Let's make this actually enjoyable to use."" The fire hose-style thread design means you're not sitting there spinning it endlessly like you're trying to open a childproof medicine bottle after a long day.

""The Daily Grind""

In use, the Herb Ripper performs with the kind of consistency that would make a Swiss watchmaker proud. The teeth are sharp enough to efficiently process your herbs without turning them into dust (unless that's what you're after). The deeper basin means you're not constantly refilling it like some sort of herb-grinding hamster on a wheel.

The four-piece design (I opted for the full setup) includes a kief collection layer that actually works as intended, thanks to a clever stainless steel ball agitator system. It's like having a tiny efficient snowplow working to collect your precious pollen. The removable micro-screen is a thoughtful touch that acknowledges the reality that, yes, sometimes things need cleaning.

""The Little Details""

Speaking of cleaning, this is where the stainless steel construction really shines – literally and figuratively. Unlike aluminum grinders with their coatings that can flake off faster than my new year's resolutions, the Herb Ripper maintains its integrity over time. It has a certain self-cleaning behavior that means you're not spending your weekends with cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol trying to restore it to its former glory.

The magnets deserve their own paragraph. With 9.2 pounds of pulling force, they're strong enough to make you briefly wonder if you'll ever get the grinder open again. It's reassuring in a ""this thing could probably survive a drop from orbit"" kind of way.

""The Investment Perspective""

Yes, let's address the elephant in the room – the price tag. At $129 for the four-piece version, it's not cheap. But consider this: while you could buy several cheaper grinders for the same price, you'd probably spend more time replacing them than actually using them. This is a buy-it-for-life situation, assuming you don't lose it during a move (which, given its weight, seems unlikely).

The storage lid (sold separately) is a nice touch, though at this point you might as well go all in. It transforms the grinder into a sealed storage container that looks more like a high-end spice container than what it actually is. Perfect for those ""unexpected parent visits"" when you need to quickly reorganize your coffee table.

""The Verdict""

After several months of daily use, the Herb Ripper has earned its place as my go-to grinder. It's like the difference between cooking with a dollar store knife and a proper chef's knife – once you experience the upgrade, there's no going back. The consistency of the grind, the smooth operation, and the built-like-a-tank construction make it worth every penny.

""Confessions of a Grinder Trilogy Owner""

Let me confess something that probably cements my status as a certified gear enthusiast: The Herb Ripper isn't my only high-end grinder. In fact, it's part of what I embarrassingly call my ""Holy Trinity of Grinding"" – a trio of medical-grade stainless steel masterpieces that makes my bank account weep and my herb drawer look like an aerospace engineering lab.

Alongside the Herb Ripper sits my Old Mate Designs Aroma 3, a 304-grade stainless steel beauty that introduced me to the world of premium grinding. Its innovative threadless design and that satisfying skateboard bearing spin had me at hello. At 62.5mm, it's a substantial piece of machinery that feels more like precision equipment than a mere grinder. The super-sharp teeth and magnetic closure system make it a joy to use, even if it did make my other kitchen tools feel somewhat inadequate by comparison.

Completing the trinity is the Brilliant Cut Grinder (BCG) in stainless steel – a masterpiece that speaks to my inner perfectionist. With its interchangeable grinding plates for different consistencies and that signature threadless magnetic design, it's like the Swiss Army knife of grinders. At 55.9mm, it's more compact than its siblings, but don't let that fool you – this 305-gram wonder is a testament to precision engineering.

Do I need all three? Of course not. That's like asking if someone needs three different espresso machines (spoiler alert: I might have those too). But each has its unique characteristics that, in my slightly obsessive mind, justify their existence in my collection:

- The Herb Ripper: When I want that tank-like reliability and satisfying heft
- The Aroma 3: For those sessions where I appreciate the bearing-smooth action and generous capacity
- The BCG: When I need to dial in that perfect consistency with its modular plate system

My friends have stopped questioning my grinder choices. They've accepted that I'm the person who will launch into detailed comparisons of thread designs (or lack thereof) and tooth patterns if given the slightest opportunity. I've become that guy who brings different grinders to sessions like some sort of traveling salesman, eager to demonstrate the subtle differences in grind consistency that only I seem to care about.

Final Thoughts:

The Herb Ripper is a fantastic grinder that would satisfy most users' needs completely. But for those of us who've fallen down the rabbit hole of premium grinding equipment, it might just be the gateway to a larger collection. Is it overkill to own multiple high-end grinders? Probably. Will it stop enthusiasts like me from appreciating each one's unique characteristics? Absolutely not.

If you're considering the Herb Ripper, know that you're not just buying a grinder – you're potentially taking your first step into a world of precision-engineered herb processing that you never knew existed. And if you already own other premium grinders? Well, there's always room for one more in the collection. Just don't blame me when you find yourself comparing tooth geometries and magnetic closure systems at 3 AM on specialty forums.

P.S. - Yes, you can clean all three in an ultrasonic cleaner, because at this point, why not complete the image of someone who takes their grinding way too seriously?


""The German Temptation - Or: How to Subtly Hint for a GRIPO 55""

Just when I thought my grinder collection was complete, just when I had convinced myself that three premium grinders were enough, the universe decided to test my resolve by introducing me to the GRIPO 55. It's like walking past a Porsche dealership when you already own three BMWs – you know you don't need it, but oh boy, do you want it.

Let me paint you a picture of this masterpiece of German engineering: Medical-grade stainless steel (because apparently, regular stainless steel just isn't good enough), gold-plated magnets (yes, you read that right – GOLD-plated), and 24 diamond-cut teeth that probably took longer to design than some cars. At 55mm diameter and featuring a timeless, logo-free design that whispers ""I'm too sophisticated for branding,"" it's the kind of grinder that makes other grinders question their life choices.

The specs read like a luxury car brochure: 6cm height, 1.6g filling capacity, and a lifetime manufacturer warranty that suggests this thing might become a family heirloom. The sandblasted silk-matte surfaces and CNC-milled diamond relief pattern aren't just about looks – they're about creating what they call a ""tactile experience."" In other words, it's designed to feel as premium in your hand as it looks on your shelf. It's the kind of engineering that makes you wonder if the Germans have secretly been grinding herbs since the Renaissance.

At €198, it's not just a grinder – it's an investment in precision engineering that makes my other high-end grinders suddenly feel like they need to apologize for not being quite German enough. The fact that it comes in ""exclusive premium gift packaging"" is both a blessing and a curse – blessing because it would make an amazing present (hint hint to anyone reading this, especially during gift-giving seasons), curse because it makes it even more tempting to add to my already excessive collection.

The modular construction and personalized laser engraving options are just icing on the cake. It's like they sat down and asked, ""How can we make this even more premium?"" and then actually did it. The limited edition status just adds to the allure – because apparently, I needed another reason to justify wanting one.

""In Defense of Excess""

Do I need a fourth grinder? Absolutely not. My current holy trinity of the Herb Ripper, Aroma 3, and Brilliant Cut Grinder already covers every conceivable grinding scenario. But need and want are two very different things, aren't they? The GRIPO 55 isn't just another grinder – it's a piece of German engineering art that happens to be incredibly good at grinding herbs.


P.P.S. - If anyone is wondering what to get me for any upcoming occasion (birthday, Christmas, Thursday...), the GRIPO 55 comes with very nice gift packaging. Just saying. No pressure. But also, yes, pressure.

P.P.P.S. - Yes, I realize that the cost of my grinder collection could probably fund a small vacation. But can a vacation grind herbs with precision? I think not.",1,1734701003.0,weedgrinders,0,1.0,False
1hijo4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfree/comments/1hijo4m/cat_vent_about_boyfriends_cat/,Cat vent about boyfriend's cat,"I've always felt a little impartial about cats, now I know I don't like them.

At first I thought I could learn to like cats, as far as cats go he's a sweet boy. He's 13 years old so he's quite calm, affectionate, he doesn't scratch or bite, and he uses the toilet instead of a litter tray so he's somewhat hygienic? Doesn't flush after himself, but if he had opposable thumbs I think he would. 

I'm allergic to him, and despite kicking him off many times he'll often sleep on my pillow in the daytime leading me to wake up unable to breathe. He's fluffy and white, and his fur gets everywhere so even if he doesn't sleep on my pillow I'm constantly suffering from a minor allergic reaction.

I'm a light sleeper too, and sometimes he'll randomly jump on my pillow waking me up several times a night.

He scratches up the furniture, and the arm of the sofa is constantly getting dirty from his paws.

He sits on the kitchen counters, chopping board (gross), the coffee table, the piano, leaving fur EVERYWHERE. 

He vomits in horrible and hard to reach places, and then my boyfriend gets upset that I refuse to clean it up?

My clothes are constantly covered in cat hair, I've had to sell some of my clothes and buy new ones in materials that catch less fur. I can't wear my cotton overcoat anymore because it's constantly covered in hair.

He screams, for no reason. He'll start yowling after he's finished eating.

I’m sorry.,"Early clarification, I am not clinically diagnosed BUT I have a thyroid condition where it is part of the symptom.

Story-wise, for the sake of being related to the sub, recent events and thoughts I thought back then I wouldn’t consider are flooding my mind. Things such as me not wanting to die first being something I consider now or getting sick with a deadly disease is something I internally hope. Back then, I just didn’t want to be an extra (financial) burden to my family but now, well… it’s in my head. At least, it isn’t the worst thing so far like taking my own life, much too scared of that, the pain, the thought I could be wrong in my beliefs and religion could be right. Anyway, you can stop here if you’re not up to read my boring and entitled life in the next update.

Basically, I knew very well and see myself as spoiled. Maybe it’s how I view myself, really. I’m not that picky with food but I have a sensitive nose (hate coffee, mocha, papaya just for the random food choices), I would wear my clothes either until they can’t fit anymore or they’re way beyond saving from sewing patches, just to save money. I am from a developing/3rd world country. I grew up an achiever, not an overachiever, just enough to be in the Top 10. Sickly since birth plus helicopter parents, so no extra curricular activities to boost my grades. Just a plain ol’ study bug. An achiever until… Sophomore or Junior High (no middle school during my time so I was somewhere around 14-16). Minus the health issues, I really thought I had a bright future. Got accepted into a branch school of one of the top universities of my country, a top uni for priesthood specifically singled me out in my class. Parents didn’t want me trying other colleges when I already got accepted by the best. Cue 2 years in uni, I got sick, mom got sick, dad quit smoking suddenly for mom, suffered withdrawal symptoms and developed complications and died. Transferred to a local Catholic college nearby, survived school thanks to alternative/herbal meds. Took another break due to my sole helicopter parents wanting a break. COVID happened. Took my 2nd degree (teaching), got my license 2-3 years later. Took my Masters currently, now on break due to being overwhelmed with my thesis. I’m leaning close to 30 with barely any job experience. During COVID, I did freelance (audio) ESL teaching and I loved it. I come from the countryside so me earning around 4-6 dollars a day is enough really, but the freelance company that did it went under and it was just a shadow of its old self and you have to beg your students for donations. Still scared of switching to another platform. Outside the screen though, back to my health, I have normal lab results but I don’t feel normal. Family, while supportive, don’t understand my issue cuz the results are normal. Am I stuck in bed? Kinda. Sole joys of my life? Reading Korean manhwa, Japanese manga and their respective light novels, a walk with my dogs until they poop which is enough time to at least get a little sweat on either my forehead or back, mobile games with plot to read some more and if I have extra cash and travelled to the city alone and there’s a book bargain? Buy any book. Also, a bit of P_rn or JP hentai if my thoughts go waayyy hard when I’m alone. Basically, the recent changes? Other than my thesis and getting a break due to being clueless on what to do (my bachelor thesis was a joke. Only did the 3 chapters and my partner backed out due to ironically being depressed herself. Now, it’s me working alone), I guess it’s now time for me to job hunt after years of graduating. Like, actual job hunt in a school. I did it a few years back, just 3 schools when I got my license, 2 did not call back at all. My alumni in HS told me outright they had no vacancies despite posting a job request online. ESL teaching? Same as my college, I just realized I thought I was good in English (as a non-native), but I failed at whatever interview I did outside my freelance gig. My sole attempt of transcribing/transcription online? Done with the interview, passed the necessary documents, might’ve been a scam cuz the sole reason was they had no trainer for us (at least they replied but I found them asking for new hires a month later). Basically, for me it feels like the engine to look for a job died now. Maybe I’m too comfortable with my current status in life, knowing full well this won’t last since Mom is a senior citizen and my brother won’t certainly care for me (but I have neighbors, distant cousins who hilariously do get cared from by their well-off unmarried siblings. Just to share, a sibling of 6, 3 unemployed with 1 of them used to have a small shop just to have something to do but currently closed it to be the caretaker of their younger sibling whose on end stage kidney disease, 1 out of the 3 employed is the sole one with kids, 2 work abroad to pay off their niece and nephews and basically pay for the unemployed siblings social security pension)

Contrary to this long post, IF I do get in, maybe my mindset will change again. But right now, the thoughts alone are overwhelming and I probably offended some of you sounding more of an entitled and spoiled brat in a depression forum",1,1734700930.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my story and see if anyone here has gone through something similar. I’m a 22-year-old guy, and over the past few years, I’ve been grinding hard. About three years ago, I started a few companies and have been working 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM almost every day since. I’ve always thought I was taking good care of myself—working out, sleeping well, and eating clean.

# The Build-Up

Around 2 years ago, I started feeling like work wasn’t as fun anymore. My business partner began pushing me hard—calling me out every time I messed something up—and it really started to take a toll. Fast forward to August 2023, I packed my life into two bags and traveled around Europe for a month. During that time, I started sleeping less and drinking more, though I kept up with my workouts.

After that trip, I planned to go to Cape Town. At the airport, I had two glasses of wine and suddenly felt extremely dizzy. While waiting at the gate, I couldn’t breathe and had what I think was my first-ever panic attack. It was terrifying, but it passed after a couple of hours on the plane.

# Where Things Went Downhill

When I arrived, I felt okay for a day. But the next morning, I had coffee, and *boom*—derealization hit me like a truck. I felt completely disconnected from myself, and it hasn’t gone away since. I stayed in bed for three days, panicking, before flying home.

Since then, I’ve been dealing with these symptoms on and off:

* **Headaches**: Mostly in the neck and front of my head (come and go).
* **Derealization/Depersonalization**: Constant, 24/7.
* **Fatigue**: I feel drained all the time.
* **Tinnitus**: This started about two months ago.
* **Sleep**: I sleep one extra hour per night now but still feel tired.
* **No motivation for work**: I used to love working, but now I can’t find the drive.
* **Weak hands**: My grip feels weak at times, but it’s fine when I work out.
* **Blurry/busy vision**: It happens occasionally.
* **Health anxiety**: Constantly worrying about what’s wrong with me.

I have always been a guy who have found ""Cure"" in things.

If I'm tired, I workout more, sleep better and eat better food.

If I was stressed I went to the forest.

If I wanted someone to love me I found a girl for a few months.

I've always found a solution for everything, even tho they haven't been good always.

**My Current Lifestyle**

**Right now, I’m trying to maintain a balanced lifestyle to support my recovery. I work out 4-5 times a week and eat clean foods, including fruits, while also taking supplements like creatine, zinc, and magnesium. I sleep until my body naturally wakes up and work around 6-8 hours a day.**

**However, I don’t hang out with friends much, which I know isn’t great for mental health, but I do have a girlfriend who’s been supportive. Living in Sweden, it’s dark and cold this time of year, so I haven’t been spending much time outside, which might also play a role in how I’m feeling.**

# Extra Context

For the past 2-3 years, I’ve also had ongoing issues with one of my testicles. It’s been a hard time dealing with this, and I think it’s added to my stress. I’ve booked my 10th appointment to figure it out because I want answers.

I also booked an appointment to check if I really have asthma since I don’t want to use my asthma medication anymore unless I truly need it.

# What I’m Wondering

* Do I need to resolve these other issues (like my testicle problems or asthma concerns) before I can fully recover from what I’m going through now?
* Is it even possible to burn out at 22?
* Has anyone else experienced derealization or similar symptoms from stress?
* What helped you recover?
* Should I stop booking appointments and just go about my life?

I think I’m doing this because I want to figure out what’s wrong with me. Any insights, experiences, or tips on recovery would mean the world to me.

1hijixt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1hijixt/tapering_off/,Tapering off :/,"Hey bup buddies, first time poster here but been reading every single post since I started taking 75mg on 12/4, and upped to 150 on 12/8.

I called my doctor yesterday and I am going to taper off and try something else, and was looking at Strattera.

Overall, taking bupropion I have about 2-3 dizzy spells a day, even with drinking electrolytes/water (love Liquid IV!). Could barely eat, and when I did it felt like I was eating rocks. The insomnia I already have, so that just intensified but leveled out back to “normal”. Lastly, my aggression has skyrocketed (I am not an aggressive person) and I’m finding myself being mean and short with people, even my husband :( I love wine, and now I can’t drink it because I’m afraid of the hangover or, worse, a seizure.

However, I have noticed increased energy in the morning, and I only have to drink half my coffee before I feel too jittery. I noticed that I have better control over being sad, like I can actually stop myself from crying. My attention at work is not being taken up by my phone as much. I love this aspect of the medication and hope I can find something similar.

Just my two cents. I know I’m not alone here, and thank you all for posting and replying.",1,1734700451.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

[Weekly Market Recap (December 20) - US-China Critical Minerals Race Benefits Canada - NAI 500](https://nai500.com/blog/2024/12/weekly-market-recap-december-20-us-china-critical-minerals-race-benefits-canada/)

Despite the incoming Trump administration’s threat to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, China and the United States’ recent decoupling and export bans in critical mineral sectors have created a rare growth opportunity for Canadian producers.

Earlier this month, the Chinese government further tightened restrictions on exporting four semiconductor-related materials to the United States. Gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials are effectively banned from U.S. exports, while stricter end-user and end-use reviews are being applied to graphite exports. This move follows U.S. measures enforcing new semiconductor export controls targeting China.

Gallium, germanium, and antimony are all essential materials in semiconductor manufacturing. Antimony, often referred to as the “war metal,” is also commonly used in military-related applications such as the production of explosives and bullets. Recently, graphite has gained significant attention as a critical raw material for the anodes in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), driven by the expansion of the EV industry.

However, the U.S. faces a heavy reliance on China for the supply of these critical minerals. According to data from the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2022, the U.S. imported $48 million worth of germanium and gallium combined, with one-quarter of its germanium and over half of its gallium supply sourced from China. Additionally, 42% of the U.S.’s graphite imports came from China.

To address this supply chain challenge, Canada, as a friendly neighbor to the U.S., has naturally emerged as a potential alternative supplier.

In December 2023, Michael Rowley, the President and CEO of [Stillwater Critical Minerals Corp. (TSX.V: PGE, OTCQB: PGEZF)](https://nai500.com/zh-hans/%e8%82%a1%e7%a5%a8%e6%9f%a5%e8%af%a2/?qm_symbol=PGE%3ACA), [discussed the future of critical mineral supply in an interview with *Metals 100*](https://nai500.com/blog/2023/12/the-future-of-critical-mineral-supply-stillwater-critical-minerals-corp/). Michael also revealed that the company has received a strategic investment from Glencore, which will support the continued expansion of the Stillwater West project. This project features five Platreef-style nickel and copper sulfide deposits, containing a variety of critical minerals, including a total of 1.6 billion pounds of nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as 3.8 million ounces of palladium, platinum, rhodium, and gold.

The Canadian companies involved in the production of these key minerals include [Teck Resources（TSX: TECK.B）](https://nai500.com/zh-hans/%e8%82%a1%e7%a5%a8%e6%9f%a5%e8%af%a2/?qm_symbol=TECK.B%3ACA), ***Neo Performance*** Materials, and Northern Graphite. Other companies, such as Nouveau Monde Graphite, are also developing relevant projects and are poised to meet North American market demands in the future.

***Neo Performance Materials, headquartered in Toronto, is North America’s sole producer of gallium, which it recovers through recycling.*** Teck Resources is one of the world’s largest germanium producers and is currently exploring options to expand its production capacity. Meanwhile, Military Metals, a Canadian antimony development company, is rapidly acquiring antimony mine assets in North America and Europe to establish a supply chain independent of China. For graphite, Canada also provides potential solutions through Northern Graphite, which operates North America’s only active graphite mine.

# DEC. 18th 2024~ 'As much money out the door as they possibly can': Biden administration keeps grants coming

The Biden Administration continues to announce major funding deals for many of Canada's critical minerals companies

[U.S. government offering grants to Canadian critical mineral firms | Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/commodities/biden-administration-keeps-grants-coming)

[\\""MAYBE NIOCORP IS WAITING FOR A DEAL TOO....!\\""?????](https://preview.redd.it/h1gadktd508e1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccc187a6d89336b56c99feeda8e88108b65b89e7)

The United States government says it will provide a[ US$754-million loan](https://ir.novonixgroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novonix-offered-conditional-commitment-us754-million-loan-us) to construct a synthetic graphite plant in Tennessee to Novonix Ltd., whose chief executive Chris Burns is based in Halifax, where it maintains its research labs, though it is publicly listed in Australia.

The loan is just one example of how [U.S. President Joe Biden](https://financialpost.com/tag/joe-biden/)‘s administration’s focus on building out a North American critical minerals supply chain has often accrued to the benefit of Canadian-based companies, many of which have struggled to raise money on public markets in the face of moribund commodity prices.

# ***>>>In total, such companies have received hundreds of millions of dollars in support from the U.S. government and many industry insiders say there could be more deals announced before [Donald Trump](https://financialpost.com/tag/donald-trump/) takes over next month.

# “Up until January 20, 2025, I think you’re going to continue to see the types of agreements we saw with Novonix yesterday,” Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners LLC, a strategic metals advisory firm, said. “Biden and his Department of Energy are incentivized to get as much money out the door as they possibly can.”<<<<<****

Congress has already approved legislation that sets aside funds for critical minerals projects, he said, but unless it is awarded to specific companies, the incoming Trump administration could decide to shift policy and simply not dole out the money for such purposes.

Many other critical minerals companies besides Novonix, which has ambitions to be a major player in the battery sector, have received commitments of various forms from U.S. government agencies during the past few years, sometimes even for projects located in Canada.

**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible... 

 RESPONSE:

1hije69,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnchoredWorlds/comments/1hije69/yearend_update/,Year-End Update!,"It's been a little over a week since [*The Solace of Hop*e ](https://readerlinks.com/l/4246388)released, and I figured since it's also getting toward the end of the year, I'd give a brief update on how the year has been gone.

The year started with the release of *Steel Sharpens*, which was such a fun book to write. And since I released it on the 10-year anniversary of my first published book, *A Warrior's Path*, I gave ALL of my books away for free for a couple of days. I want to say five days, but I can't remember. Anyway, something like 30,000 books were downloaded, which is phenomenal. I just hope people start reading them at some point.

And after resting a bit after finishing *Steel Sharpens* (but not long enough), I began *The Solace of Hope*. I made that decision because since *Steel Sharpens* was so easy and fun and I figured since I was still in the groove, I might as well jump into book 3 of The Eternal Ephemera. That turned out to be a bit harder than I expected. A lot harder, lol.

But after a few false starts, I figured out the plot, the story started rolling, and it just kind of unspooled from there. I can't remember when it started to ease off so I wasn't pulling teeth, but somewhere along the way, I also went on vacation to Hilton Head.

The wifey and I went there for our 25th wedding anniversary, and that turned out to be a bittersweet moment. We got to Hilton Head, and that night, our son called, telling us that one of our cats had died.

Toby was his name, and a long time ago, he showed up on a neighbor's front door on Christmas Day at around 2 months old. He wasn't a particularly affectionate cat. Nor was he nice. From the outside, most people would think he was an asshole, and that was sometimes the name that we often called him.

But there was an energy to Toby. A defiance wrapped up in a cute fluffy cat. It's hard to describe, but he wrapped us around his paw by simply wearing us down. I can't believe the things he got away with. Any beverage left on the counter-water, coffee, tea, or soda-became his if we turned our back for just a moment. And we knew he'd do it and still forget! We would then get mad at him and later on, laugh about it. Eventually, we just broke down and lived with and loved his eccentricities. There are so many memories about that little boy.

Anyway, I eventually got *The Solace of Hope* finished, and I decided to take a well-deserved rest. For those who don't know, I also have a full-time job that can pretty stressful. Writing is my solace (see what I did there?). But about that rest, it largely didn't happen. More about that later.

So I said that a rest largely didn't happen, but I did take time off. In August, I flew across the pond and went to Scotland for WorldCon in Glasgow. I met a bunch of friends over there and had a really good time, but the highlight of the trip was easily the Highlands, especially the Isle of Skye. I could have spent a month or more in the Highlands. There is a majesty, mystery, and magic to those hills, and if I could go back today, I would. Even though I hate the cold, that's how much I loved that part of the trip. The Highlands is gorgeous.

Unfortunately, upon coming home, there was a health issue in a family member that I had to help with. Everything turned out largely fine, so when I got home and after a book signing at a bookstore in Asheville, NC, I decided to drive down to DragonCon. I hadn't intended on going, but I got a fantastic deal on a hotel that was one block off the main site, and it was only a four hour drive, so...

Anyway, I had a wonderful time, amongst the best I've had in years of going to DragonCon. The one embarrassing moment was when Zack Pike, author of the fantastic *Orconomics* (anyone reading this newsletter should definitely give it a try), came up to me at the bar in the Westin, and I had no idea who he was. I've scared Zack when driving him in the hot rod I used to own, had lunch and dinner with him on multiple occasions, and I had no idea who he was. Thank you prosopagnosia!

That turned out to be the norm for the rest of the conference, but people were gracious, and like I said, I still had a fantastic time.

Then it was home. Writing. Work. Rinse and repeat. I was hitting another groove.

And then Hurricane Helene hit. We got off relatively easy, all things considered. Power was out for 5 days-which meant most of the food in the fridge/freezer was ruined-there were dozens of trees down all over the place, the internet and phone was down in the office for two weeks, but we were pretty much back to normal shortly thereafter.

But the people in the mountains... entire towns gone. Homes washed away. Some of them are still homeless and out in the winter elements. I hope they get the help they need, and I also wish there was more I could do for them.

Later on in October, I met a bunch of authors in Charlotte for a weekend writer's retreat we sometimes have. Those meetings always recharge the batteries. Plus, I got to ride a one-wheeler (badly) and also learned that my competitive streak isn't dead. I lost a simple game and was pissed enough to make sure it didn't happen again.

October rolled into November, and I was still writing and working, rinse and repeat. Oh, yes. What was I writing? It isn't *Instrument of Omens*, book 5. Sorry, but if it's any consolation, that is the book I'll be working on starting in 2025. I can't wait to get back to Seminal. I'll probably write books 5 and 6, back-to-back once I dive back into that series.

Anyway, after I finished *The Solace of Hope*, I had this notion of writing some old-school fantasy with a simple world, a Dark Lord, Chosen One, Gandalf-figure, and even a fated love. I wanted to make it as tropey as possible and honestly thought that would be easy. Don't ask me why. It was just a burr under my butt, so I figured why not?

But just like *The Solace of Hope* tricked me, this book did as well. It does have those old-school elements, but there is so much more. A lot more. Ultimately, I think my brain is incapable of writing a story set in a secondary fantasy world that isn't deep, and that kind of worldbuilding ends up changing what was intended to be a simple plot.

Thankfully, I'm rounding third and heading for home with that one, and I might share it on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/DavisAshura), but the sequels for this one (and it will need sequels) are going to come after I finish *Instrument of Omens* and *The Eternal Ephemera.*

And finally, I have a release date for the audiobook for *The Solace of Hope*. As before, it will be narrated by the magnificent Travis Baldree. The release date is June 24th, and [here is the link](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Solace-of-Hope-Audiobook/B0DPLH3BGP).  
I'll probably remind y'all again as time goes on.

For now, I hope everyone has a wonderful and happy Holidays!

However, it's really difficult for me. I have a fairly good job, my family is quite nice, my body is, for the most part, healthy. I have good comforts like hot water, coffee, and plenty of food. Above all, I don't have to worry about my safety, wars, homelessness, or anything like that. Many things to be grateful for.

Still, I would trade all of this for non-existence in the blink of an eye. Everything I've lived through so far makes life a much more unpleasant than pleasant experience.

I know our existence is not justified by our happiness, but that knowledge doesn’t make life any more tolerable. Am I supposed to suffer and still be grateful for it? A hard pill to swallow.
It's like trying to be grateful to your kidnapper for giving you a comfortable little bed in their basement. I know it's not a perfect analogy and I feel bad for thinking like that, but I can't help. This is how I feel.

I know many people go through this, so I appreciate any practical advice or wisdom you can offer.

1hij7pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeGuru/comments/1hij7pe/niki_brah_scamming_thousands_of_victims_buys/,Niki Brah scamming thousands of victims (buys Ferrari),"NikiBrah is marketing himself to be a ""honorable"" and ""professional"" fitness coach when in reality he's nothing but a great marketer, lying and scamming his way into you paying him money for his ""coaching"". 

  
I used to be an avid follower of his instagram - believed he was the real deal, then i bought his program - which costs 500EUR A MONTH and the disappointment couldn't have been bigger. 

  
After talking to dozens of other clients we realized what was going on: we have all been lied to and manipulated into paying him money and all we got in return was basically a scam program with no real value. 

  
Let's break it down:

NikiBrah CLAIMS all sorts of things on his instagram and youtube channel but then completely fails to deliver on ANY of these things inside his paid program. I guess he's just too busy flexing with his Ferrari and Rolex lifestyle - I wonder how many unhappy clients he must have been scamming over the years to make this amount of money. 

  
Nikita claims his coaching is all 1:1 and he cares a lot about all his clients. Literally every one of his clients i've spoken to reported that they've been ignored, their questions never got answered or they just received one word answers. BUTTT they all needed to pay him multiple hundred euros for the ""1:1 support flatrate"".

Most of his trustpilot reviews are fake, you can see some of the real ones (search for 1 star reviews) where people actually tell the truth about his coaching. He continuously tries to delete the 1 star reviews because he's trying to hide how shitty his course actually is.



Exhibit 1: Veganism VS meat eating:

In his Instagram, Nikibrah claims that if you have been living as a vegan and want to start eating meat again you need to come into his coaching because it's ""a delicate process that can only be done with the supervision of a professional"" (aka ""give me money you stupid sh\*t""). Once you fall for his scam and actually sign up for his program the answer to ""can you help me transition from vegan to meat eating again?"" will literally be ""yeah just start eating meat brah"". This is literally the answer many of his clients have reported to me when I asked them about their experience with Nikita's program. 

  
Exhibit 2: The self-proclaimed ""God of hormones"". 

What Nikita Udovinchenko claims on his Instagram: ""you need to regularly do blood tests and have them reviewed by an expert to really increase your testosterone and get healthy hormone levels"" (aka, ""come into my course and give me your money""). Once you join his program he will tell you to get a comprehensive blood test, once you send him the test he will ignore it and just tell you ""everything is great, just do more exercise"". This is NOT the type of 1:1 support that is being promoted on his social media. 

Exhibit 3: ""Women need to get off the pill"" 

What Nikita claims on his Instagram: ""Women need to stop taking the pill because it's bad for their hormones. BUT they can't just stop taking it because it's an intricate and complex task that should only be done with an expert and if we wanna know how exactly that's done we need to come into his coaching"". Once the victim fell for it and finally signs up for his coaching his literal answer to ""how can I stop taking the pill? Can you guide me through it?"" will be ""just stop taking the pill"". That's it. For that we should sign up for his program?

  
Exhibit 4: ""If you want to increase your testosterone, come into my program and i'll professionally guide you through it"". Most guys i've spoken to literally have gotten the same answer ""just watch some of my youtube videos on testosterone"". So just to get this straight: Nikibrah wants us to pay him money every month so we come into his ""1:1 coaching course"" only to then be told we should just watch some of his youtube videos on the topic?

  
Exhibit 5: Caffeine cycling. 

Nikibrah often talks about caffeine needing to be ""cycled"" and again here: it's a balanced process that should be done with his supervision aka buy his damn program. Once you're in the program his ""balanced process under his supervision"" is literally ""just don't drink coffee, unless you have a week where you have a lot of work, then drink it"". Great, that's definitely worth 500 euros per month LOL.

Exhibit 6: Fake weekly ""checkups""

In his program you as his client are supposed to fill out weekly trackings for calories, macros etc so he can then give you customized feedback. Sounds all great but in reality he doesn't really check any of these numbers, he just sends you copy paste paragraphs and doesn't look at a single of your metrics. Most clients i've spoken to said he never looks at any numbers and he literally sends every one of his clients the same generic copy-paste paragraph that they're doing ""an excellent job"". 

  
I've spoken to other people who were promised Niki will help them get fitter and train specific muscle groups. One guy in particular needed help with getting a bigger chest, Niki just answered ""just train more chest bro"". 

  
So, I hope people find this post and understand his scheme clearly: Promote lies on instagram, sell them dreams, post a bunch of testimonials and then claim this is all only possible by coming into his ""1:1"" coaching program where he will teach you all the secrets. Only to then be completely ignored and told to just watch youtube videos. 

  
Additionally people he is close to have reported that Nikibrah has faked his entire instagram brand: he bought followers and is consistently buying fake likes and comments on his posts to give you the illusion of him being legit.

So, ladies and gentlemen, my warning: don't fall for this scam!   


Nikibrah has built himself a rich lifestyle on lies. He will gladly take your money for an overpriced bullshit course in which he ignores you and sends you copy paste ""feedback"". 

In my opinion it's just sad, because he's clearly a smart person. Unfortunately smart enough to scam thousands of people for their money.",2,1734699399.0,FakeGuru,0,1.0,False

I'm considering buying this grinder to replace my Eureka Mignon Specialita, which I find frustrating to use (high retention, incredible annoying to change grind size and cleaning is a hassle).  
I recently tasted coffee from a grinder at my work (Mahlkonig EK OMNIA) and I really enjoyed the clarity of the coffee (t'was a pour-over from a Moccamaster).   
So I'm basically looking for something with better clarity than what I currently have, for both espresso and pour-over, along with improved workflow and usability.

I have several questions, some of them regarding the shipping of the grinder from their main site [variabrewing.com](http://variabrewing.com) (since I can't order directly to my address, I have to use a third party shipping company, and I need that info to calculate shipping. I asked them directly but they haven't replied yet).

1. How big the was the package, and how much did it weigh with everything in it? Did it arrive in the resin case directly or the resin case was in a cardboard box?

2. How long until you received the grinder after purchase?

3. I read some people experienced issues with grind size and the grinder turning itself on and off randomly -- did anyone here experience those issues (or any other)? If you did, how did you solve it?

4. Regarding the stock burrs, how are you enjoying the coffee from it? (regarding espresso and pour-over, but any experience would be nice to hear).

5. If you had to choose between keeping the Varia V6 or replace it with something like a Mazzer Philos, would you replace it?

1hij3zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingErgonomic/comments/1hij3zc/sleep_your_way_to_a_painfree_neck_a_reallife/,Sleep Your Way to a Pain-Free Neck: A Real-Life Guide to Ergonomic Cervical Pillows,"## Unveiling the Best Pillows for Neck Health, Because Your Neck Deserves a Break!

Ever woken up with a stiff neck, cursing your pillow for betraying you? It might not be your pillow's fault; it could be a lack of an ergonomic cervical pillow. I've been there, trust me. After years of tossing and turning with the wrong pillows, I decided to dive deep into the world of ergonomic cervical pillow reviews. Let's explore together what worked for me and how you can find your perfect neck-saver.
  
  
## The Neck's Not-So-Simple Anatomy

Our necks are like the unsung heroes of our bodies, tirelessly holding up our heads while we go about our busy days and sometimes ridiculous nights. Seriously, have you ever thought about how complex the anatomy of your neck really is? It’s easy to overlook. I learned this the hard way, initially thinking I just needed a soft pillow to rest my weary head. Little did I know that standard pillows, with their grimy fluff and support that seems to vanish overnight, often lack the essential design needed for neck health.

One time, after a particularly late-night binge on some sitcoms, I woke up with a neck that felt like a rusty hinge. I could barely turn my head to check if I still had coffee left in my mug! I started diving into the real reason for my discomfort. The neck is packed with vertebrae, muscles, ligaments, and nerves, all working harmoniously to support our movements. Standard pillows often don’t match that harmony; they can either squish down too much or prop us up awkwardly, leading to all sorts of neck mayhem.

What’s baffling is that we spend so many hours sleeping, often neglecting whether our pillows are truly giving our neck the support it deserves. Your neck deserves more than a lumpy, unformed mess. Ergonomic cervical pillows, with their contours and shapes, cater to those intricate curves and angles, helping reduce pain and improve sleep posture. So, if you’re still using that old pillow from college (you know, the one that’s more of a mystery than a comfort), maybe it’s time for a neck-saving upgrade. Trust me, your neck will thank you!

## Ergonomics: The Magic Word

Ergonomics is like the magic charm that helps us use our bodies better, especially when dealing with daily tasks like sleeping. Picture this: you’re sinking into a comfy bed after a long day, but when you wake up, your neck feels like it just ran a marathon. Ouch! That's where understanding ergonomics swoops in to save the day. 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-cervical-pillow-reviews> 

Simply put, ergonomics is about designing things to fit our bodies, not the other way around. When I first learned about ergonomics, it was a total eye-opener for me. I began to realize that the pillow I was using was like that friend who always borrows money and never pays you back: unreliable. I replaced my fluffy, lumpy pillow with one that actually supported my neck's natural curves. It was like finding the treasure chest at the end of a pirate's journey!

Here’s how it changed everything for me:

* I discovered that a pillow shouldn’t just be a soft cloud; it should align my neck and spine.
* Thanks to better posture while sleeping, I found myself waking up more energized and with way less discomfort.
* I even felt less cranky—who knew a pillow could double as my grumpy-repellent?

Understanding ergonomics transformed my pillow game and, honestly, my life!

## The cervical Pillow Showdown

Choosing the right pillow can feel like a treasure hunt, and I’ve navigated through a whole jungle of different types of cervical pillows. Let me take you on my journey through the land of memory foam, buckwheat, and bamboo pillows. Trust me, there were times I felt like Indiana Jones, dodging neck pain!

Starting with memory foam, I was intrigued when I first tried it. It's like getting a hug from a cloud. Seriously! The way the foam contours to your neck feels pretty fantastic. However, it does trap heat like a pizza in a hot oven, and I found myself waking up all sweaty. Pro tip: if you’re a hot sleeper, make sure to look for those cooling gel versions—because who wants to wake up feeling like they just ran a marathon in their sleep?

Now, let’s chat about buckwheat pillows. I had my doubts, honestly. They’re filled with little buckwheat hulls that can be a bit noisy—not exactly what I wanted to hear at 3 AM. But once I got used to it, the adjustable firmness was a game-changer. You can squish it to your liking! Just a heads up, they’re less fluffy and more… rugged, I guess?

Finally, bamboo pillows caught my eye. Soft, breathable, and environmentally friendly, they seemed perfect. The only snag? They sometimes flatten out faster than my willpower at dessert time. If you opt for these, though, shuffle them around like a deck of cards for a comfy experience.

So, whether you want a warm embrace from memory foam or the firm support of buckwheat, there’s a cervical pillow out there just waiting to save your neck!

## Unboxing: My Top Cervical Pillow Picks

Finding the right cervical pillow can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, especially when every pillow boasts of being ""the best."" But let me tell you about a few ergonomic wonders I’ve tried that made my neck feel like it was having a spa day. Trust me; your neck deserves at least that much!

First up, there was this pillow that looked like it was designed by a team of engineers on a mission. At first glance, it was surprisingly firm, which made me hesitate. I mean, who wants a pillow that feels like a rock? But after a few nights, it worked its magic, cradling my neck just right. I could finally sleep on my side without feeling like I was auditioning for a role as a contortionist.

Then there’s the pillow that made me giggle when I unboxed it. Picture this: a pillow that had a neck roll and a groove for my head. It felt odd at first—kind of like trying on a new pair of shoes. I was skeptical, thinking ""Will I be in a neck-roller coaster all night?” But nope! It hugged my cervical spine, and I woke up feeling like a champ. Gone were the days of stiff mornings!

So, what’s the takeaway? Every pillow has its quirks, just like us! Finding your perfect match may take some time and a little trial and error. But trust me, when you find “the one,” you’ll feel like you’ve hit the pillow jackpot!

## Sleeping Positions Matter: Find Your Perfect Pose

Did you know that your sleeping position can make or break your neck health? It’s true! I was oblivious to this fact until I spent what felt like an eternity tossing and turning, trying to find a comfy spot that didn’t end with neck pain. Believe me, the struggle was real.

Finding the perfect sleeping position is like trying to find the end of a rainbow. At first, I thought it was all about the pillow—turns out, the arrangement of your body is just as essential. For instance, I’ve learned that sleeping on your back is usually considered the best because it helps keep your spine aligned. But, that didn’t suit my habits. I’ve always been a side-sleeper! 

As I dove into the world of neck health, I discovered that placing a pillow between my knees not only supported my lower back but also helped keep my neck aligned. Crazy, right? For those who love curling into a fetal position (guilty as charged!), try hugging a pillow to maintain a good neck position. Just remember, whatever you choose, try to keep your head in line with your spine.

Trial and error paved my journey. Experiment with different positions and see what feels right. Your neck will thank you!

## From Pain to Gain: My Journey to a Pain-Free Neck

Waking up with a stiff neck felt like my morning ritual, a fun little surprise that greeted me every day when I rolled out of bed. I mean, who doesn’t want to start their day feeling like they just lost a wrestling match with an invisible enemy? Seriously, it was like my pillow was in a secret alliance with my neck to ensure that pain was on the morning menu. I tried everything. Remember those squishy, fluffy pillows that looked like marshmallows on steroids? Yeah, those didn’t cut it. Instead, I woke up like the Hunchback of Notre-Dame.

My quest began with research, and boy, was I overwhelmed! There are way too many options out there. I felt like Goldilocks—this pillow is too hard, that one’s too flat, and don’t even get me started on the neck rolls that looked like oddly-shaped Tootsie Rolls. Finally, I discovered ergonomic cervical pillows. Oh, what an adventure that was! Some had contours that cradled my head like a royal crown, and others had memory foam that hugged my neck while I slept. 

Here’s what I learned: **Material matters!** Also, give yourself some time to adjust. Switching pillows is like trying on a new pair of shoes; sometimes, it takes a little bit for your neck to figure out its new cushion buddy. I’m not saying I found the holy grail, but my neck is definitely on a “pain-free” vacation now!

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it - my journey into the wonderful world of ergonomic cervical pillow reviews. Remember, finding the right pillow is a deeply personal journey, so don't be afraid to try out a few before finding your perfect match. Your neck will thank you, I promise. Now, go forth and sleep well, friends!",1,1734699024.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

1hij3jk,https://i.redd.it/ze60kpto208e1.jpeg,Digvijay: A case of strategy over personality.,"Here's my analysis of what might've possibly went wrong for Digvijay in BB. 

It all seemed to start when he refused to maintain his friendship with Kashish over trust issues, even after she apologized. Maybe it was because staying friends with her would upset his fanbase. Yet, the inconsistency showed when he forgave Avinash for a nasty joke but couldn't forgive Kashish for her reaction to it.

His confusion extended to his relationship with Rajat. While Rajat was nice to him, Digvijay seemed to draw the line when Rajat mentioned going back to his ""old ways."" But Digvijay later told KV that his fans hated Rajat, which made the trust issues over coffee seem pre-planned, not something too genuine.

He claimed to enter the show without any assumptions or bias against anyone m, but his actions didn't match. He had issues with Avinash Vivian and Eisha while sticking to the family group relentlessly, and yet he expressed trust issues with them as well.

Then there was his recent statement to Eisha that he trusted Chahat more than the family group, yet he was upset when the family group didn't save him from nomination, just hours later.  

The biggest eyes opener for me was Yaminis changed pov about him, who entered as a Digvijay fan, ended up disliking him and befriended Kashish. 
Even Bigg Boss seemed to catch on, frequently taunting Digvijay about his ""game.""

Digvijay might have been a good gamer, but this is Bigg Boss-where adaptability to new situations and authenticity/ showing personality mean more than anything else. He over-relied on planning and trying to cater solely to his social media fanbase, which backfired. In the end, he forgot to connect with the broader Bigg Boss audience, which seemed to be the nail on the coffin. 

My only hope & prayer is that his fans do better & don't repeat what they did to Kashish after the splits stint to the other girls this season. I hope all of y'all reading do better in that aspect as well because no contestant deserve to go through that kind of nasty.

“Heads up, I make the best soft boiled eggs.”  
  
Yes. You do. Ewan ang korni talaga na I keep reminiscing about the time we shared, bakit kasi hindi na lang ako agad maka-move on dito. That morning bago tayo kumain ng decent meal eh nag prepare ka na ng spicy noodles tapos nagulat ako na putek ang perfect nga ng pag gawa mo ng soft boiled eggs. You know how I liked my coffee, and sobrang na-appreciate ko yung pag keep up mo sa kaartehan ko on how I like things huhu. 

Ang daming bagay na I can’t look at or experience the same way before kasi associated na sayo. Marlboro red. You’re the first guy I kissed na nag s-smoke ng reds and damn ang korni nitong sasabihin ko pero tangina, I’ll always associate the taste of marlboro red sayo. I remember looking at your collection ng mga kaha and I was amazed din kasi I used to keep my boxes din haha pero yung sayo sobrang dami eh, you smoke one pack per day. Which I get kasi hello smoker din ako and nakaka-stress talaga ang buhay.

Grabe yung yearning ko sayo, it’s so out of character sa akin na madalas wala namang pake and madaling mag detach sa mga bagay-bagay. Minsan nararamdaman ko yung kamay mo na nakahawak sa mukha ko, o kaya naman hanap din ng kamay ko yung balat mo; yung paghawi ko sa buhok mo papunta sa tenga mo, kahit na yung simpleng pag sandal lang ng ulo ko sa balikat mo. Nitong kailan nga na lasing na lasing ako at nag crash muna ako sa bahay ng kaibigan ko para magpa-baba ng tama; I remember waking up na nilalamig ng sobra and I called for your name, kasi akala ko nandoon ako sa bahay mo na naka-aircon hahaha. Nung nasa diwa na ako and na-realize ko na “okay, wala ako sa bahay mo. Nandito ako sa Cubao sa bahay ng tropa get your shit together” sa totoo lang tumulala pa ako non bago umalis kasi puta pati ba naman sa lamig associated ka pa rin? 

Ewan, I sound so lame and cringe na kada umiinom ako eh ikaw pa rin yung lumalabas sa bibig ko and iniiyak ko. Pero this is the only way I can cope kasi I know na I’ll never get answers from you kung ano ba ang nangyari. Literal na nararamdaman kong pinipiga yung dibdib ko whenever I remember the time na we shared. Mas matagal pa kitang gine-grieve kesa sa time na magkasama tayo. Dumaan na ako sa phase na hinahanapan ko na ng mali yung sarili ko, kung mababaw ba ako na tao, kung panget ba ako, or kung nagpakita ako ng panget na ugali sayo ((which I am sure na wala naman kasi ang saya pa nga natin nung bago ako umuwi sa bahay mo eh)). I thought na we could talk like grown adults, you could’ve just said na ayaw mo na or hindi ka pa ready and I would have respected that. Pero wala, it ended lang talaga. Wala man lang nangyari na falling out or anything, it ended suddenly lang after having spent such a great time with each other. Ayon yung pinaka-masakit na part. Kasi hindi ko maintindihan. 

Grabe lang din yung strength sa pagpigil na i-message ka. Gustong-gusto ko malaman kung kamusta ka na, tanungin ka kung ano nangyari. Pero hindi ko gagawin, respeto ko na lang din sa sarili ko. Wake up call na rin siguro nung galit na galit yung tropa ko nung nandoon ako sa kanila tapos muntik na kitang tawagan, sabi niya “bakit nung kay \[redacted\], nilalaban mo yung boundaries mo? Yung disrespect na ginawa niya sayo, pinaglaban mo yung sarili mo kahit na gustong-gusto mo rin siya? Ano nakalimutan mo bigla yung boundaries mo just because of this dude?” Ewan eh, parang gusto ko talagang ilaban kung ano man yung meron tayo kahit na it means na ibababa ko yung sarili ko HAHAHA pero hindi ko talaga gagawin.

- “cute” area that has a sense of identity and local businesses, doesn’t feel like a soulless suburb just with strip centers/chain restaurants
- good healthy food options (good grocery stores, healthy restaurants)
- not super urban feeling, but walkable to some extent (like not downtown Arlington due to tall buildings and less sun, but still able to walk to a coffee shop for example)
- decent access to some nature (at least a park or trails nearby)

tims has been spreading to the us, mainly in the north and northeast from what ive heard, and i recently got to try it twice.

now, as a non-regular (the closest tims is 30+mins out of the way), i was blown away by pretty much everything

my first time i got a bacon turkey club and a donut (glazed crueler). i think about that sandwich all the time. it was so good. there was lots of mayonnaise, but it wasnt too bad. the donut was light and the glazing was crispy, but not hard. it felt *good* to eat a tim hortons donut. a dunkin donut feels like a slog to eat, and its so heavy on the tongue with how thick and gooped in sugar it is. not to mention the pricing, my memory isnt the best but i think i got the donut and the sandwich for less than $10, which is pretty much unheard of in my state

my second time was arguably even better. i got the breakfast combo, bacon egg and cheese english muffin, hashbrown, and a regular sized caramel iced coffee. i was blown away. the english muffin was good, and so was the hashbrown (which was like a smaller, crispier, less salty mcdonalds hashbrown), but what really got me was the coffee. usually iced coffees from starbucks or wawa are too watery and too sweet. this coffee? perfect texture, not super watered down, and it was smooth and earthy while not being overbearingly sweet like starbucks and wawa. it was perfect. i also had some regular glazed and chocolate timbits, i give them the same praises as the donut before. and once again, the pricing is incredible. 

im much more satisfied with the stuff i get at tims for the price. a similar order from mcdonalds would be more expensive (a single hashbrown is $3) and not taste as good. i would love to eat at tims more, but i dont wanna spoil a good thing by having too much of it.",4,1734698392.0,TimHortons,1,0.83,False

1hiixkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_curvyline_/comments/1hiixkh/got_fucked_in_train/,Got fucked in train ,"
It was midnight at New Delhi railway station, and I was already on edge. My friends and I were waiting for the train to Jaipur, and the general coach was our only option—ticketless and stuck with the crowd. That’s when I noticed him.  

He was tall, gym guy muscular with trimmed moustache and beard and few brown highlighted hair strands slicked back under a black cap, wearing skin-tight chapri pants and a black full-sleeve T-shirt that clung to his muscles. Gold rings sparkled on his fingers as he was carrying his briefcase his eyes had this creepy stare.  He didn’t blink. His eyes roamed over my body like he was undressing me in his head. I felt naked under his gaze. My white camisole, barely holding onto my curves, clung tighter under the heat, and my see-through skirt wasn’t helping. My nipples stiffened, poking through the fabric, and I hated how aware I was of his reaction.

When the train finally pulled in, chaos erupted. As we squeezed into the general coach, the man stuck close—way too close. His crotch pressed into my ass, and I froze. My body went into full alert mode, every nerve firing.  Was he rubbing his dick against my ass ?  Was this intentional?

Sweat trickled down my back as my mind raced. My legs felt weak, my hands clammy. I could feel the hard outline of him pressing against me as we shuffled forward, and my thoughts spiraled. Was he stalking me? Was he gonna cum right there?  

“Move!” Amisha hissed, snapping me out of it. She dragged me to a seat, but he followed like a shadow, sitting directly across from me. His legs spread wide, his eyes glued to me. He wasn’t even pretending to be subtle, his stare dark and nasty, taking in my see-through skirt and the curve of my thighs.  

I looked down, and my stomach dropped. His dick was straining against his pants, thick and hard. My thighs clenched involuntarily as heat pooled between my legs. Why the fuck was I reacting like this? I crossed my legs, trying to shake off the feeling, but his gaze pinned me in place.  

The air felt heavy, suffocating. My friends were oblivious, chatting away, but I couldn’t move. His stare burned into me, and my body betrayed me, reacting to the raw, dirty tension. I hated it. And yet, I couldn’t look away.

Trust in your preparation, stick to the mindset and principles you have learnt and you'll be fine.

  
Top Tips:

* Do it in a testing center if possible AR Udemy CAPM Course Landini Practice Test - Online version
* Use AI/Chat GPT to help you deepen your understanding of established gaps you find when testing
* Don't drink 3 coffees before the exam as you will need to take a massive dump as I did.
* Remember you only get one opportunity to review the 1st 75 questions (once you complete all 75 and before you take your break)
* Nail down the formulas early - they are super easy to remember with bit of practice
* AR has a pdf here [Formula Single Sheet.pdf - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tGw10ASYh9Ks-8q7YGED4QgyQ_ZQonT/view)

This Heartgold copy will be the death of me haha! 4th full odds hunt all which have been on this heart gold and all of which have gone between 10-25k resets! Starting to lose hope I’ve pulled out the 3DS to hunt entei/raikou on Alpha Sapphire just so I can remember what seeing a shiny looks like. Latios is one of my favourite shinies so I’m definitely not giving up but motivation is at an all time low. Been putting in 800-1500 resets a day

I had my first lucid dream this morning (20/12/2024) between 06:00AM and 7:15AM.

# Background

For context, I am a man. I am 35 years of age. I have never had a lucid dream in my life (not that I'm aware of anyway). I have gone through my life with a very weak relationship with my dreams. I never really took them seriously and never really remembered hardly any of them. I would remember remnants of my dreams here and there but mostly I'd just wake up and be aware I had a dream but the memory would be gone in 10 minutes and I would start my day. I've had quite a few nightmares which were easier to remember.

I have struggled with trauma, social anxiety, general anxiety, bullying, low confidence, and addictions pretty much since my childhood. I had a good upbringing but something was wrong with me due to confidence and a lack of ability to connect with people.

I've lived quite a directionless life. I am a good person with a good heart and never go out of my way to hurt anyone. I've led a life of feeling lost without knowing who I truly am.

It is since the Covid lockdown of 2020 that I really started to work to clean up my body, mind, and spirit. I did anything I could to try and help myself. I started meditating (its effectiveness started when I learned proper techniques regarding posture and breath), working out, eating healthy, and working on my mental health. I got more deeply into spirituality over the past few months.

# What I Think Contributed to My First Lucid Dream Experience

I got more deeply immersed in my spiritual side in the past 5 or so months. I have always believed that there is something more to our reality than meets the eye but never delved more deeply into contemplation and being aware of it.

These past 5 months have been a different journey in that I have devoted my time to getting to know myself more spiritually and discovering more about myself and the universe around me. I have delved into a number of spiritual books that have included the topics of lucid dreaming but also dream yoga for spiritual purposes as well as meditation and Kriya Yoga. I got much more serious with my meditation practice and aimed for a consistency of at least one half an hour session per day, usually aiming for an hour. I have also been working on releasing my trauma through Trauma Release Exercises (TRE). I am currently over 4 months into my TRE journey.

Naturally, from my spiritual pursuits, I got interested in lucid dreaming and dedicated time and consistency into trying to ingrain it into my subconscious. It took me 2 and a half months to have this first lucid dream with near daily practice of the following things:

* **Reality checks** \- throughout the day when I had a moment to spare and remembered, I'd do a number of reality checks and try to rewire my mind to question reality. I would count my fingers, try to breathe through pinched nostrils, try to put a finger through the palm of my hands, check the time etc...
* **Dream journal** \- any scrap of dream fragment I could remember I would jot down into my phone. Later in the day, I would record this into a Word document on my laptop. I would read through my dream journal periodically when I felt like it
* **Affirmations** \- reading daily (some misses here and there) affirmations related to being a lucid dreamer. The affirmations are in the present tense and are positive. I aimed to read these 5 or so affirmations as a group for 10 minutes each day
* **Wake-Back-To-Bed (WBTB)** \- I have practiced this technique a total of 22 times with all of them being unsuccessful. This morning's successful lucid dream wasn't from an intentional WBTB although I did wake up and go back to bed
* **Mantras** \- When I go to bed and am letting myself fall asleep, I'll repeat as many times as I can, these mantras: ""I am aware within my dreams"" and ""I will remember I'm dreaming""
* **Meditation** \- I have been meditating for 4 and a half years now but they have always been very short 10 minute sessions. Don't get me wrong. Quantity does not equal quality. I did increase the session times to 30 minutes to 60 minutes but I also aimed for quality by learning proper posture and breathing techniques
* **Breathwork and Pranayama** \- I've been practicing standard breathing exercises for about 2 months now but have recently incorporated pranayama types of breathwork into it also
* **Trauma Release Exercises (TRE)** \- it is my opinion that TRE has helped massively as my energy systems are slowly healing allowing me to access deeper and higher states of awareness and consciousness more easily

Note, for the past 10 days or so, my consistency with affirmations and WBTB was very bad. I did, however, keep up with daily reality checks when I remembered throughout the day.

# My First Lucid Dream Experience in Detail

On the morning of 20/12/2024 which is a Friday, I woke up at 4am with the intention of hitting the gym at 6am when the doors open, so I could get my workout in before starting my work day. I went through all the usual motions of the morning. I got up, went and made a cup of black coffee, did my breathing exercises, did 30 minutes of meditation, and then decided I did not feel up for the gym today (as is the case sometimes when one isn't feeling strong enough mentally). I went back to bed and relaxed. I lay on my left side and closed my eyes. I thought to repeat my lucid dreaming related mantras. I slowly drifted out of consciousness and into sleep.

My dream began fully non-lucid. I first saw myself staying in a couple's home as a guest. I was speaking with the woman before her partner was trying to put something onto the table in front of me. I helped bring the table closer to him.

I am then walking around my city trying to get home. It is dark at night. I am wandering around and am lost. I light up a cigarette and puff away as I try to find my way home. It feels realistic, the way I take a drag from this cigarette and the taste of it as well as the smoke coming out of my mouth. I looked into the pack of cigarettes and saw there were a few more left (I gave up smoking in real life over 4 years ago and wont go back to it. In the dream, before becoming lucid, I was kind of thinking why am I smoking? I told myself it is a one-off. I was aware that I am disciplining myself in all respects). I then decide to look for the nearest train station to get home. I can't find a train station and decide to ask a lady for directions. At first, I can't see this lady due to the dark. It is as if I am fully blind. I then am able to see her and she tells me the direction to go in. I go in that direction but it looks like the entrance to an underground car park. When I enter it, I am in a dimly-lit room. I see a couple having sex on a table. I hide out of sight behind another table because there is someone approaching. After that person has left, this is the exact point I become lucid in my dream.

I realize I am dreaming! My mind starts to speak! I say to myself ""This is a dream right now. This is not real"". At this unbelievable realization, I slowly rise from my hiding place on my feet and look at my environment in front of me pondering the reality of where I am at. I step forward and decide to try and change my environment. My attempts don't work. When I close my eyes and open them, the area I just came from is now a bedroom of some sort with a bed, a lamp, a bedside table, and a mirror. I decide to investigate and explore further. This room is very pleasantly lit with a warm and glowing yellow light. I go towards this room and when I enter before investigating further, I am filled with excited emotions. My conscious mind is aware that excitation could cause me to lose lucidity so I work on calming my heart and breath down. It works and I am more calm. I start my exploration and investigation of this room. I notice on the bedside table a mysterious looking book. I touch it, look through its pages, and look at its contents. None of its contents make any sense to me, and I now cannot remember what I saw in this book. I remember feeling a real sense of awe and amazement as I inspected and examined this book. The interactions with it felt so real. I could feel it physically. I could hear the sounds it made as I went through its pages. Simply amazing. After examining the book, I noticed there was a mirror to the left of me. My conscious mind instantly became curious as to what my reflection would look like to my dream mind. I peered into the mirror from its left corner and saw a figure. It looked somewhat like me but the reflection was foggy and unclear. Like a dirty mirror. At this point, my conscious mind is getting more excited again. I decide to try and manifest an attractive woman here into my room. My attempts are unsuccessful. Not too long after, I start becoming aware that my lucidity may be weakening. My vision is starting to blur and break up. I am aware the lucid dream is going to end. My conscious brain remembers my lucid dream studies and tries the ""spinning around"" technique. I spin around a number of times and feel dizzy in my dream mind. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and the dream has ended. I wake up back in my bed in real life.

I am very excited and start recoding all details into my phone at 7:15 upon waking from my first lucid dream.

I thought to share and document my first lucid dream here with all of you. Hope you enjoyed reading it.",5,1734696721.0,LucidDreaming,3,0.86,False

Folks, this has to stop.

Time management can be tricky for students because schedules are busy, procrastination is common, and the internet is just so darn distracting. That’s why we’ve put together our best tips for better managing your time and actually getting stuff done with as little stress as possible.

# Figure out what you’re doing right now

Before you start trying to overhaul your entire life, take a day or two to figure out what it is you’re doing *now*. Keep track of how you’re spending your time -- like how many times you reach for your phone in the middle of a study session, or what kinds of tasks make you start daydreaming 10 minutes in. Basically, you’re gonna act like a zoologist observing a lion out in the wild, except you’re somehow both the zoologist *and* the lion (woah).

What you learn from this will inform what you need to change (or maybe even what to keep, if you’re already doing things that work for you).

# Make a schedule, not just a to-do list

Knowing what you have to do is a good first step, but knowing *when* you’re going to do it is the real key. So bust out your calendar app and block off some time to get stuff done. Yes, you do have to write it down (either virtually or physically) because it’ll help you remember and stick to it. It’s not that we don’t trust you to keep mental tabs on things...it’s just best to not take any chances.

When you get assigned something, add it to your running to-do list. Then when you have a chance later, put dedicated time in your calendar to work on it (always assume you’ll need more time than you think). Your to-do list gives you an idea of all the things you need to get done and a place to jot them down quickly -- like when you’re in the middle of class or a club meeting. Your calendar is where the real planning happens, and it’ll take a little more thinking in terms of scheduling (more on that below).

# Break it up, and spread it out

The fastest way to get overwhelmed by a project is to try and do it all in one sitting. It doesn’t matter if you have all of Sunday free to get your research paper done -- if you’re opening a blank document in the morning and turning in a draft in the evening, you’ll be stressed all day. Instead, break it up into baby steps, and spread them out over time.

An 8-page research paper can be split up across a week (or more) by researching one day, outlining another, and then writing a page or two each day until the deadline. With enough time, you can spread your work into SUPER short sessions, like 20 minutes each day over the course of a month -- that’s 10 total hours of work that’ll feel no heavier than an episode of *Friends* each day.

# Seriously, make it itty-bitty, baby steps

What do you do when a step that’s already broken down still feels like a huge hurdle? Go *smaller*. Take our previous example -- starting to do research for your paper is a good first step, but it might not *feel* any less intimidating than writing the whole thing. So take steps within the step (step-ception, if you will).

To get research done you have to:

* Get out of bed (we’re assuming you’re marathoning those *Friends* episodes right about now).
* Get your computer.
* Think about the questions you want to answer.
* Open a document.
* Write your questions down.
* Open a browser.
* Search them.

And that’s before any actual research even gets done. Maybe you can’t imagine yourself \~researching\~, but getting out of bed or opening a document isn’t as much of a stretch. It’s all about how you’re *thinking* about the work that motivates you to do it (or not). Take a tiny step, and then another, and then another, and eventually you’ll be making some real progress.

# Schedule around your own needs and rhythm

Some folks work really well in the morning, some folks are more productive at night, and some folks are at their best under a full moon (...okay, that last one was werewolves, but the point remains). Whatever works for you is what you should schedule around.

That means that your most important work (big presentations, papers, and projects) should happen when you have the most energy. All the smaller stuff (like easy worksheets or short readings) can wait for those times when you’re not necessarily on your A-game.

The same applies to the length of your sessions. You know yourself best, so you can make the call whether to go for shorter sprints or longer stretches of work. There are plenty of methods to choose from, from the fast-paced Pomodoro method to the longer ultradian rhythm technique. Find what works for you!

# Schedule breaks and fixed stop times

Your calendar isn’t just for work -- it’s equally important to make time for fun. Remember those steps we talked about? Take little breaks as needed between steps and tasks. Grab lunch in the middle of your study session, or take a quick walk between researching and outlining your paper. These buffers will clear your mind and give you something to work towards when you’re, well, working.

Be sure to also block out clear end times for tasks. If you’re giving yourself Thursday night to work on your study guide, mark in your calendar that you’ll stop at 9 p.m., and then *actually stop at 9 p.m.*. Knowing when you’re going to stop keeps you from thinking you have all day and goofing around or putting stuff off until later.

Pro tip: whether you’re taking a break or stopping for the day, make a little note for yourself about what you did and what you need to do next so that you can easily pick it up the next time.

# Clear your distractions

Look, we both know that it’s really easy to get distracted from work -- especially when it’s work that you’re not too wild about doing. The biggest distractor is probably your phone (because slime videos, deep-fried memes, and your friends’ snapchats are just a few taps away), so here are some quick ways to keep your focus where it needs to be:

* Put your phone on airplane mode, or mute notifications.
* Make your phone password annoyingly long (like 20-30 characters).
* Temporarily delete the apps that distract you most.
* Or disconnect from wi-fi and block mobile data on those apps.
* Just put your phone in a different room entirely.

# Address why you’re procrastinating in the first place

Okay, time to get a little real with you. These techniques can help you manage your time better, but it’s also worth getting introspective about the reasons why you might be procrastinating or avoiding work in the first place.

For a lot of people, it boils down to a fear of failure or criticism. Writing an essay may feel hard because you’re worried that your words won’t turn out the way you want them to. Tackling a big presentation may be intimidating because you don’t want to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates. It’s not that you can’t do the work, you might just be paralyzed by the thought that it has to be perfect.

We can’t magically make those feelings go away, but we’re here to tell you that no one expects your work to be flawless, and fear shouldn’t stop you from trying. At the end of the day, you have to turn in *something*, so take it step-by-step, get some work in, and edit as you go -- once you’re actually doing it, it’ll feel so much easier.
