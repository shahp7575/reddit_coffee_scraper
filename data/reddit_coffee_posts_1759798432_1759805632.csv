i’m really introverted and get anxious in large crowds. i tried the bar scene and it’s not for me. 

i like gaming and reading. i have a few plants. i like animals. i have a bit of a coffee obsession. any activities or clubs around that stuff would be cool. 

i’m open to trying new things too. i just get in my head a lot and am trying to be less of a shut-in. i care more about the people i do an activity with than the activity itself, if that makes sense. i’m open to doing anything if it’s with the right crowd. 

any recommendations would be awesome. thanks :)",2,1759805181.0,UGA,0,1.0,False

I'm from Cebu, and I have only been on a Mindanao road trip once, so I don't really know what I don't know. A couple of questions:

* Is this a safe route or would you recommend the coastal route?
* What are the best times to travel?
* Do you have recommendations on where to stop over for food, coffee, maybe a place to stay overnight?
* Is this ideal to do this within the day, or should I split the travel time over two days?
* Any tips or useful information I should be aware of?

1o035lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1o035lq/retroactive_jealousy_triggered_from_bfs/,Retroactive jealousy triggered from bf’s frustration about sex,"Please read through and would appreciate calm and composed responses and not very attacky ones as I already feel slightly depressed. Last time I posted this here many women came hard at me shaming me for making bad choices. But I am trying to carefully navigate my next steps. Thank you and appreciate any meaningful advice!

When we first met my boyfriend had a lot of experience. He’s been with only 7 women in the past but he was hyperactive to the point of doing it almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day with some of these women. He started late at 25 and maybe tried to overdo it. Had long term relationships with 2 women out of these. Some were casual but most of his experience came from his long term girlfriends. On one hand its good that he was stable and monogamous. On the other hand he built all of his experience based on these one or two women and thought that was the universal case. Before meeting me he had just broken up from the two long term gfs and then was in college for post grad and managed to do some casual relationships. He has had sex atleast 500-600 times in the last 2.5 years. He’s had a shit childhood and was bullied and somewhat traumatized and I feel he used sex as a grown up as a coping mechanism for a lot of things and didn’t really stop and processed his emotions.

When we met we had known about each other for a few months and had a crush on each other. He had been single for a few months at this point.

When we first started dating, I told him I need time and was struggling with vaginismus. I hadn’t dated anyone in a while. I was looking to build emotional connection with someone before jumping into bed. While he was understanding and tried to be patient, he also got frustrated a bit quickly. He is a pretty good looking guy and many of the girls approached him. He never had to struggle or wait to get sex so I understand his frustration. I started trying to push myself to be able to do it easily. I wanted to do it too.

But instead of communicating his frustration calmly he stated it in a very weird manner where he made it obvious that he didn’t have to struggle this much with others. He has since apologized many times about this and completely changed. He realises his mistake.

Other than sex, he’s generally socially awkward introvert types so he states he didn’t know at the time how to properly communicate his feelings. I felt horrible and dehumanized for him to make it seem like I was not enough or taking time in bed while other women were able to do it easily. Also because I had been upfront since day 1 about wanting more time.

Its been a while now and he has changed completely and never says something like this now. He is completely obsessed with me, never shows frustration in this manner and has given me all the lead. We only do it when I approach him. Which has made me trust him more. For someone who was so obsessed with doing it regularly, he wanted to show me he was willing to change for me and become patient and we only did it 10 times in 6 months. This was not on purpose. I too have a high sex drive but we were going through a rough patch of arguments and I was feeling depressed and slightly pressured in the past because of his insensitive remarks so he was trying to show me his patience by giving me space. This significant change in his behaviour has me confused. I love the bf he is now and I wish he was like this always.

However I can’t help but feel jealous of how he put his first gf on a pedestal. I know guys never easily forget about their first love but he didn’t have to tell me subtly how great she was even though it was long ago. It wasn’t fair of him to bring his hyperactive experience standards and apply them on me when I had been honest about my expectations since day 1 of taking it slow. Again he has completely changed now and is a wonderful bf in present day and appreciates me. But I resent him so much for making me even slightly feel like I had to act like his ex to get his affection. It affected my self worth. I started feeling less because of something that many women struggle with - vaginismus especially growing up in a conservative country. In modern day especially with dating apps I haven’t been able to find any guy who would be patient enough to understand such things and take it slow. While he didn’t push me, he showed it to me once or twice it was frustrating compared to others. He could have just left. He also did wilder things with others which I don’t think I’ll be able to do anytime soon like having spontaneous sex with his ex in a coffee shop toilet, doing it 7 times in one night etc. All of thess created extreme standards in his mind and when he met me, he liked me but I made him wait and was different and he couldn’t handle it maturely. I would have totally understood if he communicated to me that he just feels frustrated. He literally said “he never had to wait so much” and that made me feel pressured. He apologized immediately. He even stated at that time she was the best he ever had.

He admits that our relationship is the most meaningful and best relationship we had and we only struggled with sex. But I had that he felt comfortable appreciating exes in bed in front of me. Even if long ago. I hate him insinuating that we need time to get there. 

We have argued about this many times and it never happens now and we otherwise have a great relationship and it does seem like a mistake he made in the start coming out of the hoe phase no matter how stupid I think it is.

He has been there for me in difficult times and supported me and we have grown a lot together in career and life.

But I cannot help with the rj feeling with that one ex who was his first and he described it like she was so great and fun. He never made such appreciative comments about us. And I think it was much more significant for me because I pushed myself and overcame vaginismus to be able to do it easily. But he couldn’t see those efforts.

Idk what to do at this point. We have already dated 1.3 years. Idk if I can move on soon. I feel conflicted. On one hand I love him and cannot imagine leaving. On the other hand the RJ gets really strong.

I never had RJ before. I was okay with guys having a past and literally did not care. Around the time I was in my 20s no decent guy around me was not inexperienced. And it was not even something I was looking for. I have spoken to guys before or gone out with who had slept around a bit. But I wasn’t bothered. My RJ only got triggered after he mentioned in the start when we were still in the talking stage about his great past experiences at the same time showing frustration towards me. This is the most triggering thing. He made me feel shit and lacking behind while appreciated others. He talks about it as an immature phase but it impacted me and my self worth. I feel like he was 28 at this point and should have known better instead of working on his mistakes only after it completely distressed me. Its been a year of that not happening anymore but the resentment is so strong against him for making me lose my self worth because while he stopped I continued to feel for a while that I have to act like his ex to retain his love as he could only understand love and affection from that perspective. He most definitely for the first 3-4 months had standards especially for sex based on his past experiences instead of approaching me for who I am as my own individual person. I’m confused how to proceed now because while I consider leaving, I also need to consider how he radically changed for me and its only my resentment now. Even though he did fuck big time earlier. I feel conflicted to forgive him for making bigger mistakes and letting him have control over my self worth. So on one hand I feel I should work on my resentment. On the other I feel he should have been grown enough to act better.",2,1759805021.0,TwoXIndia,0,1.0,False

met this guy at a bar in the summer. I’m F24, he’s M30.  we hung out a lot and had a talking phase for a month before he asked me out. i said yes of course, but sometimes i’m questioning if that was the right decision. my thoughts:
-the age gap doesn’t bother me, but for some reason I feel as if he’s trying to fast track this relationship to get to the next stage of life- marriage, buying a house, kids, etc- only bc his friends are either engaged/ already married/ signing to buy their first house soon. he was so happy to have me meet his dad about a week after we became official, and i’ve met all of his friends before we had a title as well. he even made a snarky remark about how i hadn’t introduced him yet to my parents/ family, and how “i don’t want to be dating you for 6 months and not meet your parents. then i’ll feel some type of way”. (now- i guess i get his point, but this also felt very vaguely threatening. idk). he gave me a key to his apartment in like week three of our talking phase, didn’t even stop to ask how i felt about it. 
-i feel that he often dances on that like between cute and creepy obsession. i am a curvy woman, so often other men will glance at me, and he makes jokes about beating them up just for even breathing in my direction. i always laugh awkwardly bc i can’t tell if he’s joking or being dead serious. 
- he also made many many many remarks about how im “the love of his life” and how ill “make such a good wife” and “im going to marry you”. now, for some people, these comments would make them glow with happiness. but to me, it feels like he’s planning an entire life for us without filling me in. how does he feel so sure and strongly about me being “the love of his life” only 1.5 months of dating? feels strange. it feels manipulative. 
-during intimate moments, he makes me promise him that i’m “his forever and ever” and make me swear up and down that i “better not be talking to nobody else” and how i “better not be sleeping with anybody else”. these comments make me so uncomfortable that my stomach churns and my palms burn hot and clammy. 
- he makes baby jokes all the time. saying things like “i’m so glad im choosing to have kids with you” or the other day, it was chilly so i was wearing black long sleeve T-shirt w blue jeans; he said “that looks like a good future mom outfit”. (for reference, im still in college working towards my degree with about a year left. i work part time and still live at home bc wtf is this economy rn. POINT BEING- i am in absolutely no position for a child right now. i have desires for them in the future, but not right now). i had to tell him the other day that i dont like those remarks, as they kinda weird me out. it’s like he has a br33ding k1nk or something. i feel so off knowing that he’d be so happy to knock me up but doesn’t even know me well enough yet to read my facial expression. 
for other context, he’s very sweet and takes care of me. he never lets me pay when the bill is dropped off at the table, orders, pays for and goes and gets my coffee to bring it to me each morning, buys me 2 dozens roses once or twice a week. he buys me the expensive makeup and jewelry that i’m always looking at, and is even trying to buy me the new apple watch for my bday next month as my gift. i had planned to buy it myself and was just asking him questions about how it works as he owns one. 
—> in the past, i have been in a toxic, abusive and controlling relationship. i have long since seemed therapy to work on myself, but, i feel like i can’t help but notice some commonalities between this relationship and my previous/ traumatizing one. i am a bit confused on if these are actually things in common (is him buying all this stuff a form of manipulation?) is real or am i just still so limited due to my prior relationship? 
idk. he’s respectful and very nice. but i feel off. something here feels off. maybe i’m not looking at the big picture? help me out here, what are your thoughts ? ",0,1759804965.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

For honestly awhile now, I feel like one day I woke up,, and I was not fully digested from the day before- but I chose to eat something anyways.
Ever since I have felt undigested/overlapping like.. if that makes sense or as if I should wait for my stomach to empty/get hungry to eat again.
If I ate anything the bloating would be crazy..
So I tried to,, except three days not eating/“fasting” and I still wasn’t cleared out or physically hungry- bloating is significantly decreased.
So I went a little over a week without eating and my stomach went down p much to normal/flat,, but I had no hunger.
If I even DRINK something like water or coffee with ANY creams- I will become bloated (especially creamed coffee or a “digestible” liquid)
This has been pure misery and I have also lost weight even before I stopped eating completely.
I don’t know what else to do except wait to get hungry but I guess I fucked it up or something.
If anyone understands what I’m talking abt/going thru and u have any advice to restore my gut/stomach back to normal, I would greatly appreciate it.
This has been pure misery and depression.

My parents got me retractive orthodontics when I was a kid. When I bring up jaw surgery around my mom, she assures me that it's totally normal and inevitable that I can't breathe through my nose, because my father also can't breathe through his nose, to such an extent that he wouldn't kiss her much because he couldn't breathe. Wtf? Is that supposed to make me feel better? Roll over and accept an entire life of basically breathing through a coffee straw? I know jaw issues are NOT hereditary because I've extensively researched orthotropics, but she argues for genetics anyway. No curiosity, no desire to learn and change.

She doesn't even seem to believe that it will actually improve airway capacity. It seems like it's going to take me actually getting this surgery for her to realize it's better for me. And I'll have to fund it on my own. :( In the end I'm an adult and it's my body, but it sucks when the people who are supposed to be looking out for you, the very people responsible for making your face as messed up as it is, don't care or in fact push you *not* to get the surgery. The only people who seem to really understand this are others who have explored orthotropics and jaw surgery. Sometimes showing before and after pictures helps people to be a little more sympathetic, but then it appears to them like a frivolous cosmetic procedure rather than something that will hugely improve quality of life.

1o02xbv,https://i.redd.it/s1io5kzppltf1.png,Our Anniversary Gift His Secretary's Coffee,"Happy Anniversary""—Dahlia Rose orders coffee through her husband Zavier’s account, only to discover it was delivered to his secretary, Blaire. A receipt, a dismissive lie, and years of hidden betrayals later, Dahlia pulls out a divorce agreement—signed, sealed, and waiting for Zavier’s signature. But when Blaire flaunts their affair at the company’s anniversary party, Zavier warns Dahlia: ""One wrong move, and you’ll walk away with nothing.

# Chapter 1 - The Final Signature

On their wedding anniversary, Dahlia Rose used her husband's food delivery account to order two iced lattes—and had him foot the bill.

An hour later, his secretary, Blaire Evans, posted:

""Mr. Wheeler is unbelievable—I’m on a diet! How am I supposed to finish two iced lattes?""

Dahlia’s eyes flicked to the receipt, but Zavier Wheeler casually snatched his phone back.

""The app glitched earlier, so Blaire’s address defaulted. Now she’s stuck with two lattes—what a pain.""

Face blank, Dahlia turned and unlocked the safe behind her, Zavier’s dismissive tone still hanging in the air.

""You should’ve checked before ordering.""

As he spoke, she pulled out a document, signed the last page, and handed it to him.

Zavier’s expression iced over at ""Divorce Agreement.""

""Over a wrong address?""

""Over a wrong address,"" Dahlia confirmed without looking up.

Instead of taking it, Zavier scoffed and sprawled across the office couch.

""Dahlia, this was just PR when we married. My parents handed it to you as a formality—not for you to weaponize.""

The document was barely a few pages, but Zavier couldn’t be bothered to read it. To him, it had always been corporate theater.

Clutching the papers, Dahlia stepped forward.

""I’ve signed. You do the same, and we’re done.""

""Seriously? Over this?""

Five years with Zavier had taught her that edge in his voice—patience thinning.

""Let’s not pretend. You married for money. Who knows what strings you pulled? Without my parents forcing this, I wouldn’t have bothered. That agreement protected the Wheeler name—not you. Don’t flatter yourself.""

She almost laughed.

He had no idea she’d demanded that agreement as a condition.

He swatted at the papers.

""You’ll forgive employees for tanking projects but not one slip-up of mine?""

""One slip-up?""

Dahlia dodged his hand, her sudden laugh freezing him. His gaze sharpened as she flipped to the agreement’s first page.

""Five signatures needed. I decided: every twenty times I forgave you, I’d sign once. Five years covered all five.""

The first—their wedding night, Zavier at a bar, ""catching up with friends.""

The second—their first family visit, humiliating her publicly: ""They can arrange the marriage, not force me to love you.""

The seventieth—the day she gave birth, while he toasted his secretary’s new home.

...

Zavier thumbed through, pausing at the dried tearstain by the second signature. A beat later, he tossed the papers aside.

""It’s just coffee. Want some? I’ll have it delivered now—ten times the fee, someone’ll take it.""

Dahlia pushed the agreement toward him, voice steady.

# Chapter 2 - A Cruel Anniversary Ultimatum

A knock came at the door as Zavier Wheeler straightened his collar and tossed the divorce papers into Dahlia Rose's hands, his eyes glinting with warning.

""This year’s annual meeting is key to securing my inheritance. Don’t embarrass me in front of the staff. One wrong move, and I’ll sign these papers—you’ll walk away with nothing.""

He paused, lips twisting into a mocking smirk.

""Face it, without me, you couldn’t even afford a cup of coffee. Keep your mouth shut, or even the Wheelers won’t be able to save you from the fallout.""

Before Dahlia could respond, the door swung open. The HR Director entered, wheeling in an elaborate five-tier cake.

Did he actually remember our anniversary?

Instinctively, Dahlia tucked the divorce papers behind her back, refusing to become office gossip.

Zavier tensed, irritation flashing across his face.

""Blaire’s off today. Why schedule a birthday party now?""

The employees froze, eyes darting between Dahlia’s pale face and Zavier’s scowl. Whispers erupted.

""Blaire still comes first, huh?""

""Does Mrs. Wheeler know about them?""

""Like I always said—cross Blaire, and you’re done.""

The HR Director cleared his throat.

""Sir, this isn’t the monthly birthday. It’s for the company’s fifth anniversary. Since today’s also your wedding anniversary, we thought we’d celebrate with Mrs. Wheeler while she’s here...""

Zavier’s brow furrowed, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. His voice wavered.

""Oh. Right.""

An intern piped up, grinning:

""Mr. Wheeler, those limited-edition figurines you asked about last month—were they for Mrs. Wheeler’s gift? That $200K set must be incredible!""

Another voice chimed in:

""Funny, Blaire posted one last week. Wouldn’t even let us near it. Maybe Mrs. Wheeler can show us?""

Zavier shifted uncomfortably. The intern’s manager yanked her back.

""That’s their private matter. Focus on celebrating the company—it’s their love story, after all!""

Blaire Evans’ voice drifted in from the doorway.

""What’s all this? Cake and coffee?""

She strolled in, ignoring the crowd, and nudged Zavier’s chest playfully.

""Oops. Mrs. Wheeler must’ve forgotten—I only drink half-sweet.""

With a sly glance at Dahlia, Blaire pressed a lipstick-stained coffee cup into Zavier’s hands.

""Since these were a mistake, you can have them back.""

She shifted deliberately, flaunting the designer figurine hanging from her purse.

""Almost ruined the birthday present Mr. Wheeler gave me!""

Gasps filled the room. All eyes locked on Dahlia.

Zavier started to dismiss them, but Dahlia’s voice cut through, ice-clear:

""Sign the papers.""

Blaire’s smirk vanished behind a mask of faux sympathy.

When he was a younger man he was abusive, very. I get told he did used to beat my dad and uncles, and especially my grandmother. Stories endless one time he smashd a mirror in her face. It shocked me.

But my grandad was this hero and role model for me as a kid i was nurtured by him out of all his grandchildren the most. 

Every time he’d come he would bring me cars and toys. I remember he’d have a tobacco pipe and when id lie on his shoulder he’d smoke and tell me to sit on the edge of the sofa until hes done, and he’d give me an empty medicine bottle to play with and pop open and close. That smell of the empty med tub i still remember. 

He had those sugar pills you put in tea and coffee ifykyk he’d let me press the button every time even if it was such a small thing.

Even though he had an abusive past, he never ever ever ever looked at me in anger or frustration or shouted at me i have no bad memories of him genuinely. He always smiled, he always taught me lessons.

When my dad wasnt there, HE taught me how to ride my first bike, he bought my first bike, he bought me my first car, he fed my love for things like engines and cars and sports and riding bikes. 

For his children it wouldnt have been like that.

It makes me think how even the most complicated and roughest of men change as they grow. 

He was the elder of the family everyone looked up to him, i know he was stern and rigid when he needed in terms of family matters but he never showed that side to me.

Him and my grandmother whos my life and heart were divorced and seperated for decades. They still saw eachother at family gatherings often. Family road trips and holidays and at family house visits theyd be in the same room, but never speak to eachother. I have a very very faint memory not sure if its even a real memory of them talking for a split second which is so weird. 

Even though my grandma is my whole life the one person i love most, i could never see my granddad as a bad person.

Some of my granddads final words and requests were: “ Ask her to forgive me “ to my father. 

I was young i mean i couldnt process it i guess i had never lost anyone before i didnt know how it felt so i was in shock.

Literally my uncle tried to cheer me up with supercars and all that stuff but i just couldnt register anything.

Its only now i realise eveything deeply, how everytime he came, taking me to get food with him from a takeaway wasnt him feeling hungry or wanting to treat me, it was NEVER ABOUT THE FOOD. He wanted me to remember who my grandfather was and enjoy the time together. 

I forever love and miss my grandad and im sorry for not appreciating everything he did for me while he was still here.

1o02vca,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/1o02vca/am_i_asking_too_much_or_do_i_have_the_right_to/,"Am I asking too much, or do I have the right to feel like he's only loving me when it's convenient?","I don't want to write this, but after several conversations that ALWAYS turn into arguments where he feels defensive or attacked, I don't know what to do...

I’m in a long-distance relationship, officially about 4 months, but we started talking the beginning of this year when I was happily single. For context, I (34F) was in a relationship for 5yrs prior where I didn't get my emotional needs met. I took time to go to therapy and work on my own happiness. I made it very clear to him that I didn't want to be in a relationship that made me feel any less peaceful or happy that I could make myself. I set my standards and communicated them clearly. He (38M) was very persistent that he wanted the same type of relationship and could be that. I even told him I'm okay waiting until I move next year, but again, he was very confident that it's what he wanted.

In the very beginning, he was thoughtful with little surprises that made me feel seen. Photo gifts, always wanting to take pictures, a sweet letter, always had undivided attention when we would FaceTime, he loved us having deep long conversations and reading...

But over the last few months, I noticed that dwindling significantly. It started small so I tried not to overthink especially cause he had a new job. But it was visible enough where conversations started to be surface level unless I tried to bring something up, but even then the effort wasn't really there to reciprocate.

 I’ve tried to share feelings of emotional disconnection and wanting us to grow together on an emotional and romantic level and I want to feel special like he would tell me he wants me to feel. Even when I preface things kindly, he often takes it as me saying he’s not doing enough. After one conversation turned into an argument, he sent me a heartfelt message about wanting to “love me better, not just with intention but with action,” which meant a lot to me because that’s exactly what I need. But when I would ask how or what that meant to him, he would say he doesn't know and needs time to process... but then never initiates bringing it back up. So I’m struggling with whether his actions match his words.

For example: there was a product drop I was so excited about as I waited for years. I sent him links, made it clear how much it meant, and thought he’d surprise me. He didn’t. A few weeks went by so I ended up buying them for myself and when I shared that i had bought some, my boyfriend’s reaction was supportive like ""Aw that's good. I'm glad!"" but very surface-level and not once said ""I was going to get you one""

Another example: when he visited recently, he offered to help me clean up and said he wanted to ease my stress because he knew how much I had going on. When he asked me what he could do, I gave him a couple of small, specific tasks... He then asked if I could text him a list. I obliged, but was a little dissapointed that it felt like i had to write things down like a chore. He had hours free while I was at work, but instead he napped, went to the gym, and got himself snacks. He picked me up later, smiled, and said, “Don’t be mad, I didn’t do what you asked, but it’s fine, we’ll do it together later.” I felt sad — not because of the undone tasks, but because he’d offered, knew how stressed I was, and then brushed it off. I started to cry in silence and asked him to give me a minute. I didn't blow up or yell or get mad. I calmly tried to explain my feelings and how it hurt that even when I make it convenient, it felt like he took advantage of me being understanding even though he made me feel so safe that he would want to help me.. He got defensive and it escalated into him blurting out that maybe we should just go our separate ways after the trip since he’s “not doing enough.” I went outside to take a breath and he apologized and said he didn't want to, and wanted to make me happy.

And here’s the part that really confuses me: one time he even asked me, “If I asked you to buy me X, would you do it?” I said yes, I would. He didn’t end up asking, but over several days he kept saying, “Dang, I keep forgetting to buy X” and “Ugh, I really need X.” What he didn’t know was that I had already shipped it the day he wondered if i would. When it arrived, I asked him, “When you kept hinting, were you hoping I’d just buy it without you asking?” He sheepishly said, “Yeah, I did. Thank you, babe.” So he clearly appreciates thoughtfulness when it comes from me.

For context, he does show care in practical ways — like ordering me food or coffee on DoorDash — but it’s always after asking me exactly what I want and having me send a link. It’s never a surprise or anticipation. Meanwhile, I tend to send him things he needs or surprise him without asking. I've sent him hand written cards, his favorite snacks, pratical home things that he's complained about having to get, I give him advice and truly listen on just about everything he talks about.

I've brought it up in several ways. And he keeps saying he will process and talk to me but then when I check a few weeks later, he says he forgets and gets defensive as if im being mean to ask where he's at or if he's thought about our conversation. Now its to a point where he says we argue all the time and I keep ""bringing things up from the past"" and I feel so confused because the only reason things keep coming up is because he won't communicate with me and seems to expect me to just forget? He sends me short loving texts, talks to me often..etc. 

I can’t tell if I’m expecting too much. Am I asking too much by wanting more thoughtfulness, follow-through, and initiative from him, or is this a reasonable need in a relationship? I'm at a point where I'm so confused because he's so sweet with saying he loves me, and is thinking of me and hopes I have a good day and wants to talk every day but I can't think of a time he was romantic without being prompted. Like sending me something just because that wasnt initiated by me specifically asking or when we argue...

But again, he sends me food and coffee so should I just be grateful for that?

I've never been in an LDR, so I guess i wonder what is reasonable to expect.",1,1759804195.0,LDR,0,1.0,False

Im thinking of going to the doc but it's expensive,"I've always been someone who's chronically sleepy. Like Im always yawning, tired, even with coffee. Sometimes I get like a couple hours of energy and then Im back to being tired again. 


I've gotten used to it, I've been like this since I was like 10. 


Im 19f (FTM trans)now. And over the past 4 months I just cannot stay asleep. I wake up randomly in the night. Not to use the bathroom, not anxious. I just cant stay asleep. 


In highschool I used to fall asleep alot of the time. To the point where I was basically made to stand in the class right after lunch because I would just..... knock out cold. 


I would drink like celcius and keep instant coffee in my locker to stay awake but it would only work for like 3 hours.


Anyways, that's like fine and I can cope with it, and if I get tired at work I just stand and drink coffee before my shift. 


Its getting kind of absurd. Im usually tired but this is like so much worse than my normal. 


Im considering going to a doctor but im worried im going to get brushed off. I have tried everything I can think of, though. Magnesium supplements, cutting out caffine, more caffine, multivitamins. All my bloodwork comes back fine, and I have mild anemia. 


I have Ehlers-danlos syndrome, sucrose deficiency, anxiety, and depression. I dont want to go to the doctor if its just like depression because I can talk to my therapist about it. 


I sleep abt 8 hours minimum every day (more like 10-12 right now, I feel like i cant function below that), I dont go on my phone much (I do sometimes, but I dont usually) when I try to go to sleep.


Im normal weight and height (5'6 and 155 lbs). I eat well and splurge on treats very little. I am a server so I am active at my job. I've always been a night owl, but I gave waking up at like 8am and going to bed at 12am a try for a few weeks with 0 improvement. Im on zoloft and testosterone (testosterone started in september). 


Im just lost. Im tired. I cant sleep. Its ridiculous. ",2,1759804180.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I'm a decade older than Sebastian. The first time I laid eyes on him, he was a scrawny street rat, fighting mutts for whatever scraps he could find.

His stare, raw and wild, was pure wolf.

So, I scooped him up. Molded him from the ground up.

Ten years. That’s all it took for Sebastian to morph from a gutter rat into the city’s golden boy, its most sought-after CEO.

For the longest time, I genuinely believed Sebastian was my masterpiece.

Until that fateful day. A bratty little girl, smug as you please, stopped my ride.

She casually placed a hand on her swollen belly, hit play on a recorder, and asked, “Sebastian, who do you like more—me or that old hag?”

Then, a voice I knew way too well, dripping with disdain: “Just some aging woman. All these years, what I’ve loathed most is her condescending attitude.”

A smile played on my lips. Looks like Sebastian had conveniently forgotten his days of begging like a stray.

The next day, a gift-wrapped box arrived on his doorstep. Inside? A bloody, lifeless fetus.

His eyes blazed, pure inferno. A gun found its way to my forehead. He snarled each word like a curse, “Lilith.”

I took a slow sip of my coffee, cool as ice. “Seems Mr. Lawrence has a memory lapse regarding my… methods.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, his voice a low growl. “You think I won’t pull the trigger?”

He wasn’t that pathetic waif anymore. Those years clawing their way to the top had chiseled him into something sharp and dangerous.

I just gave him a little shake of my head, a faint smile still on my face. “If I were you, I wouldn’t waste breath on threats.”

Sebastian froze. Then, a whisper of sound from the floor-to-ceiling window behind him.

He spun around, his expression shattering.

There she was, dangling from the 72nd floor, hands bound, her white gown billowing like a tattered flag. A sheer drop to oblivion yawned beneath her.

“I’d be cautious if I were you,” I purred, the gun still a chilling pressure against my temple. “If your hand happens to slip and I’m gone, your little darling downstairs gets… well, pulverized. One life gone… only one now, though.”

The girl’s sobs were pathetic. “Sebastian, save me!”

His eyes, bloodshot and wild, finally flicked the safety catch. “Lilith, how dare you!”

My security detail moved in like shadows.

The air crackled with unspoken violence, a storm about to break.

But with a dismissive flick of my wrist, I waved them back. “Stand down.”

Then, without even looking, I drew a hidden dagger and plunged it deep into Sebastian’s gut.

He gasped, a guttural sound of pain, but the gun pressed harder against my skin.

“Enjoying yourself?” I murmured, my voice soft, intimate.

Sebastian’s face was a mask of pure ice. “Are you satisfied? Now let her go.”

# Chapter 2 - The Ghost of Eve

Amaya's different from you. She's just some innocent babe who knows zilch.

Sebastian's goons showed up faster than a speeding bullet and snatched Amaya.

Honestly, I never really meant to hurt her anyway.

Watching Sebastian coo sweet nothings to the girl cradled in his arms, like she was some delicate, priceless artifact, I just felt… meh. So over it.

He used to hold me like that too—right after our enemies ripped away our baby, leaving me barren forever.

That was a fully-baked baby girl, we'd named her Eve.

Sebastian went all out for Eve, dropping serious coin on a gold statue in her memory.

He told me, ""Lilith, our child will surely find peace in the afterlife.""

He wanted a never-ending parade of worshippers, all praying for Eve, stacking up blessings for her.

I asked him once, ""Why all the drama?""

Sebastian, looking like a homeless lumberjack but with pure grit in his eyes, said:

""Because Eve is the only kid I'm ever gonna get in this lifetime.""

Now, I'm staring at the gift box on Sebastian's desk.

Sebastian, you reneged on your word. But no sweat—I'll jog your memory.

When the girl finally stopped her waterworks, she glared at me, eyes puffy and radiating pure hate:

""Sebastian, it's her! That witch killed our baby!""

But Sebastian's face went dark.

He ran a hand through her hair, his voice eerily chill, ""You've gone too far.""

Amaya's sobs choked in her throat.

She had no clue that ever since we lost Eve, no one around us dared breathe a word about anything related to kids.

That pain? It's a ghost that'll forever haunt Sebastian and me.

Nobody spilled the tea to Amaya. She just kept wailing, her cries enough to shatter anyone's soul.

Sebastian scooped up her limp body, bulldozed past me, and stomped out.

""Lilith, I'll remember this."" I just never saw Sebastian's payback coming in hot and fast.

Listening to my subordinate's update, I absently stroked the cat on my lap.

""Mr. Lawrence outbid us, double the price for the southern estate.""

""Mr. Lawrence has been low-key chatting up shareholders, trying to snag their shares.""

""Mr. Lawrence… had the cathedral built for little Eve demolished.""

My grip tightened, and the cat let out a yelp of pain, curling into a ball of fear in my arms.

""Say that again?""

I kept my face blank.

My assistant gritted his teeth, ""Mr. Lawrence demolished the cathedral. He said he's gonna build an amusement park for that home-wrecker! Construction kicked off this morning!""

Crash!

I chucked the coffee cup next to me. It exploded into shards.

My assistant immediately bowed his head, ""I'll handle it right now!""

I raised my hand, ""I'll go myself.""

By the time I rolled up, half the cathedral was already rubble.

Amaya was clutching a balloon, bouncing around, barking orders at the workers:

""Clear that spot properly! And over here—Sebastian, I want a carousel right here!""

Yesterday we had dinner at the inlaws and we got some good food and a nice meal with her family and happy birthday with Cake that I made and worms with dirt (pudding and gummies) she helped make the dessert  even when I tried to shoo her away. 

Anyway it's definitely hard as the entire time we also have to take care of our boys of course. Today was the birthday and I worked and then she had to work at night. Early before kids got up I went out to get her fancy coffee. I got one of the kids up and let her stay in bed. Started making her pancakes (the batter was spoiled so they came out flat at rubbery) then I had to start work, I'm remote.  During lunch break we opened gifts (I got her a etsy sweater and shirt) with a heartfelt card. She left after I got done to go to work and I took over with the kids for dinner/play/bedtime. 

She got home late from work and was upset because her birthday just felt very lame and not special. She wanted to be alone. Did I drop the ball or is this just how birthdays are when you have kids? We just don't have the money to do anything extravagant. Past birthdays I think I've tried to do more. So did I drop the ball and should I make this up to her or is this just a normal adjustment to parent life? ",1,1759803452.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Started on Meetup, recently moved to my own domain. This guy  attended once over a year ago, never came back, never gave feedback.

The moment he receives the first event notification from the new mailing list he replies TO THE MAILING LIST EMAIL (luck I saw it).

He critiques the group based on that one session from over a year ago (like too noisy, no structure, not intellectual enough), he some people were there for romance not philosophy (wtf?), he requests a private coffee meeting with me to discuss ""the purpose of the group and how it achieves that purpose"", and he also includes his full business signature as a Certified Practising Accountant with legal disclaimer, which seems like status signalling..

I replied firmly to him that the group is open format (it's all already on the website), and that I I don't meet privately with strangers to discuss how I run the group, but he's welcome to attend sessions like everyone else.

His response was to apologise for sending an ""obviously upsetting email"" (is this because I'm a woman?), then asks EVEN MORE questions, like is there a chairperson? How is discussion moderated? What are the rules? (sir, it's a book club at a cafe!) He then gives me an ultimatum that either we ""consult together"" on how I run things or he'll ""proceed to establish a forum for philosophical discussions"" himself, obviously to compete against mine. Then he requests a phone call with me AGAIN after I already declined.

I haven't responded to the second email.

I don't remember this person at all, maybe I was travelling when he attended. He's been on the mailing list for over a year doing nothing. But NOW that I've invested in a domain and legitimised the group more, suddenly he has opinions and demands. He's had literally years to start his own group if he wanted more structured philosophical discussion but he hasn't done anything. I'm the one who's started a group.

AITA for my reply? Is this guy overstepping?

# Coffee And Fat Burn

Coffee is more than just a morning drink. It can help the body burn fat. Many people use coffee to boost their energy. But it also plays a role in weight loss. Understanding how coffee affects fat burning can help you use it better.

Coffee contains natural compounds that speed up the body’s processes. This helps the body burn calories faster. The effects go beyond just feeling awake. Coffee can help the body use fat as fuel during exercise and rest.

# How Coffee Speeds Metabolism

Coffee boosts the body’s metabolism. Metabolism is how fast the body burns calories. Drinking coffee raises the metabolic rate temporarily. This means the body burns more calories even at rest.

The main component that affects metabolism is caffeine. It stimulates the nervous system. This causes the body to release more energy. As a result, the body burns fat faster and uses it for energy.

# Caffeine’s Role In Weight Loss

Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in coffee. It helps the body break down fat cells. These broken-down fats are released into the bloodstream. The body then uses them as fuel during activity.

Caffeine also reduces feelings of tiredness. This helps people stay active longer. More activity means more calories burned. This supports weight loss and improves fat burning over time.

1o02cpa,https://i.redd.it/3ikk1o4xkltf1.png,Collection-Undercover Intern: I Met My Husband’s Mistress,"It was my first day at the company as an intern.

A woman in a couture suit stormed in and slammed a wedding photo and a marriage certificate down on the reception counter.

""You're a new intern? No wonder you're so ill-mannered!"" she snapped.

""You're carrying all those documents—do you want to hide that ugly face of yours or are you trying not to look at me? Put them down! Stand with your hands at your sides!""

I followed intern protocol and dipped my head slightly, my voice steady. ""Hello, ma'am. How may I help you?""

That single ""ma'am"" lit her fuse. She stopped in front of me and snapped, ""What's going on? Does the HR department hire now without teaching people how to show respect?"" She jabbed at my badge. ""Look at my photo and certificate, then look at your badge—what makes you think you have the right to speak to me? Call me Mrs. Parker!""

The other interns paled. One girl tugged my sleeve and hurriedly bent low. ""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Parker. She's new—she doesn't know the rules yet. Please don't be angry.""

The woman snorted and rolled her eyes, then swept into Asher's private office. The intern who'd apologized whispered to me:

""She's Camilla. She's Mr. Parker's first love. Don't upset her—if she tattles to Mr. Parker, your internship will be over.""

I was surprised. Asher's marriage certificate should have been quietly locked in our apartment safe. Why would he let some woman named Camilla swagger around his company waving a fake certificate?

A thought flashed through my mind. I stayed silent—my mission here was to complete the internship and observe Asher's management. Besides, I could use the chance to see just how far this self-proclaimed Mrs. Parker could push people under Asher's indulgence.

At lunch Camilla pressed the intercom to the admin desk and snapped her order through. Her voice over the speaker was sharp: ""Bring me a hand-brewed Blue Mountain coffee, water at 85 degrees. Send it to my office immediately.""

I hurried to the pantry to prepare it. Hand-brewing takes time; I was five minutes late. For that five minutes she exploded.

When I finally arrived with the cup, she waved her hand and sneered. “Look at the time! Five minutes past the optimal tasting window — do you know what that does to the flavor? You’ve ruined my mood. You’ll pay for it!”

All eyes in the admin area fixed on me. Camilla's makeup and designer clothes were impeccable, but her vicious tone made everyone uneasy.

I kept my composure. ""Ms. Jones, I'm truly sorry, but hand-brewed coffee does require time.""

She snatched the cup from my hand, then—without hesitation—threw the scalding coffee across the back of my hand. ""How did you clumsy idiots get into Parker Enterprises? You must have bribed someone to land this internship.""

Chapter 2

My fingers tightened into fists until the nails bit into my palms; pain and anger flared. I was on the verge of snapping when Mariana lunged forward and planted herself between me and Camilla.

""I'm so sorry, Ms. Jones! She's new—let me apologize on her behalf. Please don't be angry; it isn't worth wrecking your health over such a small thing,"" Mariana said, bowing and slipping a hand into my sleeve to pull me back into the crowd in a low voice. ""Hold it together. Don't act up. Remember who she is—if you cross her, our whole department bonus could be gone. It's not worth it. Leave it to me.""

Camilla watched Mariana's groveling face and finally seemed satisfied; she languidly produced a wet wipe and cleaned her fingers. ""Hmph. That's more like it,"" she said loftily. ""Come on, I'll take you to inspect the company canteen.""

Inspect the canteen? What gave this outsider the right to inspect the company cafeteria?

""Ms. Jones, there are strict regulations about the company cafeteria. External people can't just walk in—"" I began.

Mariana yanked my sleeve. ""Don't you get it? She's Mr. Parker's favorite."" She leaned in, voice urgent. ""Offend Mr. Parker and you might be fired; offend her and you'll vanish. Mr. Parker dotes on her—there are rumors she's the real mistress of Parker Enterprises. Our jobs depend on her single word. You're an intern—don't take chances.""

The mistress of Parker Enterprises?

Funny… I’m his real wife, yet somehow I never got the memo.

Camilla saw me standing there and assumed I was cowed. She made a mocking sound. ""Oh, are you frozen at the sound of Mr. Parker's name?""

""Let me tell you something: a man like Mr. Parker is not for lowly interns to reach. One word from him and you won't be able to survive in this industry, understand?""

She swaggered into the staff canteen. ""What junk do you serve the employees?"" she sniffed, pinching a piece of sushi on her tray and tossing it away. Then she hauled a salad bowl from her Hermès bag and slammed it on the serving counter. ""You lot probably never ate anything good in your life. Fine—today I'm generous. Try a top-tier organic salad and taste how the upper classes lunch.""

She lifted the box to pour it into the communal food container.

""Ms. Jones! Absolutely not!"" the cafeteria manager, Mr. Cooper, snapped. ""Company food safety rules forbid outside food being mixed into staff meals. This is a health issue—please cooperate.""

""Rules? Safety?"" Camilla laughed as though the words were a joke. ""Do you really think my salad is less safe than your low-grade ingredients? This bowl could buy your lunches for a week.""

""Please step aside,"" Mr. Cooper said, standing firm. ""This is a policy issue. We can't risk anyone's health. Don't make this difficult.""

She made a video call instead. ""Asher, look! Your staff are refusing my help—can you believe it? I'm trying to improve their meals and they're yelling at me!""

Chapter 3

From the other end of the video came Asher's gentle voice. ""Milla, don't be upset. Hand the phone to the cafeteria manager.""

Camilla pressed the phone screen against Mr. Cooper's face with a triumphant smile.

Asher's voice turned immediately icy. ""All relevant staff, apologize to Camilla at once! Otherwise you will all be treated for gross negligence—this month's salary and bonuses will be deducted! I mean it.""

Mr. Cooper's lips trembled. The supervisors and several colleagues blanched, exchanging helpless looks.

Asher sounded even colder, clearly unhappy with the silence. ""What? Do I need to repeat myself twice?""

The video feed wavered, and Camilla swivelled the camera toward Asher's side so we could see where he was.

The background showed a private room in an upscale club. Asher sat at the head of the table, surrounded by several middle-aged men—clearly an important business dinner. When he saw Camilla putting on an act, he first shook his head in resignation, but there was no annoyance in his eyes—only indulgence.

""Ash…""

Ignoring that Asher was conducting business, Camilla began to cry into the camera. ""Look, they're all ganging up on me. I just wanted to be nice to everyone and they give me attitude. They ruined my good intentions! Ash, you must stand up for me!""

She dabbed at her face and forced out a few tears. The vulnerable, wronged expression clashed so violently with the earlier arrogance that it was like two different people.

Asher's expression fell; without asking why, his entire attention fixed on Camilla in the video.

""All right, all right—don't cry. Makeup ruined by tears isn't a good look. Is it worth making yourself miserable over? Hmm? With me here, nobody can bully you.""

He soothed her in a low voice, then finally looked over at our side of the call, his tone hard as ice.

""Do you not understand my orders?""

""I am ordering you now: do exactly as Milla says and apologize! If within three seconds I still don't see an attitude of contrition…""

He hadn't finished the sentence when I stepped straight up to the phone's camera, placing myself and the burn on the back of my hand clearly within the frame.

""Elena?""

There was a flicker of surprise in Asher's voice.

His surprise gave way quickly to impatience. He didn't even glance at the scald on my hand; instead he irritably pinched the bridge of his nose with an empty hand. ""Elena, what are you doing in the cafeteria? Aren't you supposed to be interning in HR?""

I looked at him calmly. ""Do you think so?""

Asher's eyes scanned the cafeteria manager and the staff behind me. His voice dropped: ""Stop making trouble and do as Camilla says—apologize now. Anything else we can talk about tonight when I get home.""

The words landed like a slap. Not only I, but the staff beside me were stunned.

Camilla straightened immediately, chest thrust forward, and poured fuel on the fire. ""Ash, so she's the new intern. She was so fierce a moment ago—she egged the manager on to defy me!""

Asher's face softened into concern and pity. He looked in my direction. ""Elena, apologize now. Don't make things hard for me.""

A smile flitted across my face. ""Asher, do you remember our bet? Do you remember exactly what you promised me?""

""Now it's time for you to keep your promise.""

Without waiting for any reaction, I cut the video.

I didn't hesitate. I reached into my pocket, took out my private phone, and dialed my brother Caleb.

""Caleb, there's someone forging documents and disrupting Parker Enterprises' normal operations.""

""Tell Asher to get his ass here right now.""

""And bring the draft of the divorce agreement we prepared.""

""In five minutes, I want to see him kneel before me, begging me to sign the agreement.""

1o02c8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1o02c8x/rj_triggered_from_bfs_frustration_about_sex/,RJ triggered from bf’s frustration about sex,"When we first met my boyfriend had a lot of experience. He’s been with only 7 women in the past but he was hyperactive to the point of doing it almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day with some of these women. He started late at 25 and maybe tried to overdo it. Had long term relationships with 2 women out of these. Some were casual but most of his experience came from his long term girlfriends. On one hand its good that he was stable and monogamous. On the other hand he built all of his experience based on these one or two women and thought that was the universal case. Before meeting me he had just broken up from the two long term gfs and then was in college for post grad and managed to do some casual relationships. He has had sex atleast 500-600 times in the last 2.5 years. He’s had a shit childhood and was bullied and somewhat traumatized and I feel he used sex as a grown up as a coping mechanism for a lot of things and didn’t really stop and processed his emotions.

When we met we had known about each other for a few months and had a crush on each other. He had been single for a few months at this point.

When we first started dating, I told him I need time and was struggling with vaginismus. I hadn’t dated anyone in a while. I was looking to build emotional connection with someone before jumping into bed. While he was understanding and tried to be patient, he also got frustrated a bit quickly. He is a pretty good looking guy and many of the girls approached him. He never had to struggle or wait to get sex so I understand his frustration. I started trying to push myself to be able to do it easily. I wanted to do it too.

But instead of communicating his frustration calmly he stated it in a very weird manner where he made it obvious that he didn’t have to struggle this much with others. He has since apologized many times about this and completely changed. He realises his mistake.

Other than sex, he’s generally socially awkward introvert types so he states he didn’t know at the time how to properly communicate his feelings. I felt horrible and dehumanized for him to make it seem like I was not enough or taking time in bed while other women were able to do it easily. Also because I had been upfront since day 1 about wanting more time.

Its been a while now and he has changed completely and never says something like this now. He is completely obsessed with me, never shows frustration in this manner and has given me all the lead. We only do it when I approach him. Which has made me trust him more.

However I can’t help but feel jealous of how he put his first gf on a pedestal. I know guys never easily forget about their first love but he didn’t have to tell me subtly how great she was even though it was long ago. It wasn’t fair of him to bring his hyperactive experience standards and apply them on me. Again he has completely changed now and is a wonderful bf in present day and appreciates me. But I resent him so much for making me even slightly feel like I had to act like his ex to get his affection. It affected my self worth. I started feeling less because of something that many women struggle with - vaginismus especially growing up in a conservative country. In modern day especially with dating apps I haven’t been able to find any guy who would be patient enough to understand such things and take it slow. While he didn’t push me, he showed it to me once or twice it was frustrating compared to others. He could have just left. He also did wilder things with others which I don’t think I’ll be able to do anytime soon like having spontaneous sex with his ex in a coffee shop toilet, doing it 7 times in one night etc. All of thess created extreme standards in his mind and when he met me, he liked me but I made him wait and was different and he couldn’t handle it maturely. I would have totally understood if he communicated to me that he just feels frustrated. He literally said “he never had to wait so much” and that made me feel pressured. He apologized immediately.

He admits that our relationship is the most meaningful and best relationship we had and we only struggled with sex. But I had that he felt comfortable appreciating exes in bed in front of me. Even if long ago. I hate him insinuating that we need time to get there. 

We have argued about this many times and it never happens now and we otherwise have a great relationship and it does seem like a mistake he made in the start coming out of the hoe phase no matter how stupid I think it is.

He has been there for me in difficult times and supported me and we have grown a lot together in career and life.

But I cannot help with the rj feeling with that one ex who was his first and he described it like she was so great and fun. He never made such appreciative comments about us. And I think it was much mire significant for me because I pushed myself and overcame vaginismus to be able to do it easily. But he couldn’t see those efforts.

Idk what to do at this point. We have already dated 1.3 years. Idk if I can move on soon. I feel conflicted. On one hand I love him and cannot imagine leaving. On the other hand the RJ gets really strong. I have ocd too.

I never had RJ before. I was okay with guys having a past and literally did not care. Around the time I was in my 20s no decent guy around me was not inexperienced. And it was not even something I was looking for. I have spoken to guys before or gone out with who had slept around a bit. But I wasn’t bothered. My RJ only got triggered after he briefly mentioned in the start when we were still in the talking stage about his great past experiences at the same time showing frustration towards me. Its been a year of that not happening anymore but the resentment is so strong against him for making me lose my self worth, I’m confused how to proceed.

Every time I close and open my eyes, hell is there.

This place is all too familiar, warm. Above is the ceiling of this hell, where complete darkness blends with scattered brown and rust-red patches, creating a strange, cosmic-like appearance. It's fundamentally dark. Here, I have no choice but to keep the lights on all day long. I sit on the cafe terrace and unfold the newspaper. It's called a morning paper, but there is no morning here- the name is meaningless. Today's paper has a factory explosion on the front page. Twenty employees inside the workshop were ‘crushed’ and were crushed as the entire building caved in. Shrapnel flew, embedding itself in nearby buildings, and the air became completely thick with the blood spilled by the injured workers. The smell of blood seemed to suffocate me. The next page celebrated the opening of a newly built hospital. But why would a hospital be needed here, where no one dies? I closed the paper. An old man walking his dog passed by. He seemed to have lived here quite a while, and since serious things only happen inside this newspaper, I think hell isn't so bad after all. There's even coffee here to ease the loneliness. I don't know where the beans are grown, though.

Usually, when you think of hell, you picture pits of fire, screams, shouts, and agony, but the reality isn't like that. Except for the gradual numbing of my sense of time, this place is tolerable enough to get used to. One assigned demon looks after me for a certain period. Even though I said I was fine, he insisted on taking care of me. That's the rule here. Every day, a newspaper is delivered to my door. I bring it to this cafe, read it, and wait. That's when the demon comes. He always pulls up a chair in front of me just as I'm halfway through my coffee. It never changes.

The demon said, “It feels like we've known each other for ages, but today is actually our last day.” I widened my eyes at the sudden news. ""What? Why? Is the contract over?“

The devil says, ”I suppose you could say that. I've been reassigned to someone else. By the way, haven't you gotten quite used to it here?“

I briefly recall my life up to now. ”Yes. More than I thought. No one's fallen into the lava or anything. Hmm."" I nodded slightly, looking a bit tired. The devil laughed at that. “It's a common prejudice. That's how we're usually portrayed. Do you remember when we first met? I completely forgot to record that.” “There are no clocks here, no calendars either. It just feels like a very long time ago.” “Ah, right. I forgot about that too. I'll just write down ‘a long time ago’ then.”

I thought, How could someone who's been here so long, even becoming a demon, have no concept of time? “Is it really okay to just write it like that?”

“Everyone else writes it that way too.” The demon answered casually and flipped through the papers. A little annoyed by that attitude, I just stood there with my arms crossed.

“Nothing changes, right?” The demon glanced up at me with a sudden friendly expression and smirked. He continued, “You won't find it fun. You'll have to keep living here from now on.” “It's kind of funny you say ‘live’.” I took a sip of coffee. “Oh, right. We're already dead.”

Before we left the cafe, I paid the bill to the staff. Walking along the stone-paved sidewalk, I took in the quiet downtown scenery. “Not that you need to be asked, but what's your last memory before dying? Do you remember why you died?” the demon asked me.

At those words, I suddenly tried to recall the memory, but it didn't come easily. I answered honestly. “Ah.” The demon nodded as if understanding. Then, I caught a fleeting afterimage and blurted out, “Moths. Moths.”

“Moths?” “Yes. Moths... um. I saw them burning.” The demon looked at me, ears pricked. ""Keep talking. I don't get to hear stories like that around here.“ It felt awkward, but I continued. ”Well, these moths, like white mold, were all stuck to the ceiling. I stomped my foot to make a vibration, and they all flew away in surprise. Some jumped into the fire under the stove. I watched that for a long time."" That was all I could remember.

“Is that all?” The demon seemed slightly disappointed. But he immediately sniffed with a seemingly humble expression. “We have moths here too.” “Well, if there are dogs, why wouldn't there be moths?” “All the other animals are here too. I don't quite understand why animals are in hell as well. It seems this place isn't just for humans. That would be better, though.” The demon laughed foolishly.

We walked in silence for a while. There was nothing else to say. After walking like that for about five minutes, I found the silence unbearable and blurted out something. “But you know...” The devil reacted with a start. “Yes?” “This place doesn't seem much different from where I used to live. Why is this hell?” There were dogs, moths, and even the devil wasn't evil. The devil just shrugged. “I don't know.”

“Sometimes it's better than reality. I don't really remember what reality was like, but that's the nature of this place.” The demon continued. ""At least nothing changes. You don't have to change jobs. You don't die, so there's no desperate need to make money. Still, you feel things like hunger, so you have to eat. That's the only reason to make money. If we weren't hungry, this civilization wouldn't have been built in hell.“ The patterns in the sky slowly shifted, like moving clouds. ”Up there.“ I looked up. ”Up there? What is there?"" The demon stared intently at the yellowish-brown ceiling. “It feels like someone up there is watching us. If not, why would this be Hell? When I go to the bathroom or pick my eye, I suddenly feel eyes on me. From above that ceiling.” I turned my head to look at the demon's face, checking if he was joking. “What kind of noise is that?” “Well... I can't say for sure either. For some reason, it feels like someone's watching me. Maybe it's the one who sent me here.” “The Judge, you mean?” I almost asked if a monotheistic deity existed. The demon shook his head. “Not that. I've never been judged. Though I've been here a long time.” “Oh? Then it doesn't really matter if they're watching or not, does it?” It sounded like such a trivial thing, so I answered casually. The demon just looked slightly embarrassed. “I suppose so.”

I paused and looked around for a bench. In the park, a woman and two children were playing ball together. Watching them, I muttered to myself. “Every day feels like a holiday here.” The devil agreed. “Still, you'd get bored if you didn't work.”

I looked up and shot the devil a glare. “By the way, aren't you here in hell because you died? How did you get a job?” Only then did the devil sit down a little way away from me. “After you've been here a while, you can get a job. You might even find a lover. Marriage doesn't mean anything here, but some people do get married. I'm pretty familiar with this place. If you set your mind to it, you could get a job too. You could guide newcomers like I do. I've never been married myself.” Then he paused. “Well, maybe I have.”

I didn't press further. The ceiling's pattern was shifting like clouds. “You said someone up there is watching us.” “I don't really know.” “Are you just going to keep saying you don't know? You've been here a long time.” The demon's attitude was starting to get on my nerves, and my tone grew sharp. “I haven't been here much longer than you.”

“Right, well then...” The children had fallen and were crying. The children's mother started scolding the slightly older one. The high-pitched voice reverberating irritatingly through the park made my head ache a little. “Unexpected things happen too.” I turned to the demon at those words. “Huh?” ""Nothing major, but I've seen people who should have died in reality still alive. Once, when I was going to a cafe to counsel someone else, I saw a factory explode on the way, crushing several people beneath it. The stench of blood made it hard to breathe on the way back.“ I felt a strange sense of déjà vu. ”Wait a minute. Wasn't that in the newspaper today?“ ”What?“ ”The factory explosion accident."" “Today?” “Today. It was in the paper.” The demon just stared at me, eyes wide. “Here, wait a moment, I definitely saw it in the paper.” But it seemed I'd forgotten the paper at the cafe. The demon let out a deep sigh. “Times like this make me afraid of God.”

The devil suddenly stood up and pulled me to my feet. “This is truly the last time.” I stared blankly at the devil adjusting his clothes. “Ah. Is it time to part ways?” “Yes. I have to manage someone else now. It's a serious matter.” I hadn't done much, but hearing that made me snort. “Ah, I'm sorry.” The devil looked at me with a wry smile.

“It's been so long since I took on this role—though it feels like it was just five minutes ago—my memory's getting hazy. Don't call it dementia.” I forced a small smile at the joke. “I hope you do well. Since you won't die, I suppose there's nothing to worry about.” We shook hands and parted ways.

​

Not knowing what to do next, I lay awake, unable to sleep. When I finally got up, I'd grab a newspaper and head to the cafe, repeating this routine. I started chatting with the waitress who refilled my coffee. She told me she'd just arrived after dying.

“You got a job pretty quickly, though.” I said, taking a sip of coffee. The woman abruptly sat down at the table in front of me, propping her chin on her hand. “Yeah. I remember dying by suicide, but I couldn't remember anything else, so I quit. Just a moment.” She picked up a cup, sat back down in front of me, poured herself some coffee from the pot, and drank it. “Aren't you in trouble? For goofing off?” “What does it matter? There aren't many people coming in anyway.” Just then, a customer entered. The woman briefly left her seat to take the order, then sat back down in front of me.

“Why don't you just work hard?” The woman just rolled her eyes.

“How did you die and end up here?” I was about to honestly say I couldn't remember, but suddenly felt embarrassed and made something up instead. “A traffic accident.” “Hmm.” The woman nodded.

For a while, I kept meeting up with that woman. Sometimes I'd go see a movie alone, other times I'd go to the park with her. When I tried to tell her something I'd seen in the newspaper, she wouldn't believe me. “No way.” So when I tried to show her proof, I'd always realize I'd left the newspaper at the cafe.

I grew increasingly numb. If you called it a routine, it was going to the cafe and reading the newspaper. After repeating that countless times, there were moments when I completely forgot this place was hell. When I knew it was hell, no matter how painful things got, I'd just accept it. But only similar things happened, and the only difference was whether the woman propped her chin on her left hand or her right hand at the counter. Whenever that thought suddenly surfaced, it sent a chill down my spine. Even when I'd get into pointless arguments with the woman, and she'd say, “I don't know. I don't want to think about it,” and storm off, leaving me furious, I never thought, ‘This is hell.’ When I heard the people sitting next to me in the cafe shouting, ‘This place is no different from being on your deathbed,’ ‘That's what's scary, that.’ I'd always sneer inwardly, ‘They haven't been here long.’ It gave me a strange sense of pride.

That day, as usual, I had a vague thought before heading out to the cafe. Lying on the mattress, staring at the light streaming in through the window.

There was a moth. What was clear was that watching it burn to death wasn't horrific. Nor did I enjoy it. It was simply something burning, nothing more. Fragments of its wings lingered faintly in my mind, like a dream, dragging themselves along. Then, it faded away inside me again for what felt like an almost infinite amount of time. Ironically, it was during those moments that I felt truly alive. The postal delivery man in his fifties who lived next door pounded hard on my door, startling me terribly. Reluctantly, I got up, opened the door, and faced him. The man asked me abruptly, expressionless. “When did you say you died?” I answered. “Just a little while ago.” The man frowned, his eyes darting as if to glance into my room on either side of me, then silently returned to his own house. This happened several times.

But that particular day, extreme fear surged at the delivery man's actions. I grabbed the man as he tried to enter his house and beat him mercilessly. Bleeding and nearly collapsing, he fled into his house and slammed the door shut. I pounded fiercely on that iron door, shouting, “None of your damn business, you idiot! None of your business!”

I went back inside, grabbed the newspaper, and headed to the cafe. For a moment, I thought I could have gone somewhere else today. But I called out to the woman, “I'm going to the park...” She blinked. “Okay.” I even knew the number of ants crawling on that park bench. I'd forgotten how many there were, though. I waited until the woman finished work. The newspaper read ‘Factory Explosion Accident’.

The next day, I went back to the cafe and unfolded the newspaper. The woman was resting her chin on her hand. She closed her eyes, then opened them again. Nothing had changed. I felt this wasn't hell. I imagined maybe this wasn't hell at all, just a single dream. Lying on the mattress, I opened my eyes and stayed like that for a while, then got up again, opened the door, grabbed the newspaper, and headed to the cafe. If you become numb to all this, eventually it becomes nothing. Every day—though I can't even say every day—I feel like someone who died and has done nothing since. I haven't actually done anything. Even if I try to recall what I've done, I can't remember anymore. Silence. Yes. Silence. It's like when you hear a sound constantly, you become so accustomed to it that you feel you hear nothing at all. That is silence. It perfectly matches my present state. In the dream of being awake, very rarely, through the cracks of confusion, memories from before surface like fiction. But I don't think I thought anything when I saw the moth. I saw nothing in the moth burning to death. It was just the moth dying. If I have a sin, that is it. The reason I came to hell—if the judge up there sentenced me to hell—would be for the sin of going to the cafe every day, reading the newspaper, and drinking coffee. If I close my eyes and open them again, nothing will have changed. Because I know nothing. That is why I am dead. Faithfully fulfilling this state brings me a comfort that wells up from a distant place. This is my comfortable hell, a place all too familiar. I pick up the newspaper again and head to the cafe.

Suddenly, I caught a sickening, nose-piercing stench. It was the smell of blood. It came from a deep red pool beneath the collapsed ruins of a building. It matched the color of the ceiling exactly. Fear overwhelmed me, and I reflexively looked up at the sky. No one was watching me.

People gathered around a person crushed beneath building debris. Someone suggested calling the police. The old man beside me retorted, “Where are the police here? Shouldn't someone here act like a police officer and take this person to the hospital?” As the old man tried to look at me, I averted my gaze. I headed straight for the cafe.

Anyone could have spoken to me. Or I could have spoken to someone. But none of that happened. Only during that brief period when the devil first manages those arriving in hell do people live as if they were ‘still alive’

After the management ended and they began to sink uncontrollably into the time of confusion—time itself now meaningless—there was no turning back. Now, I have no interest in others, or even myself. Because there's no need to care. And, above all, because forming relationships and living with someone no longer holds any meaning for me. Only then did I realize I hadn't even asked the woman her name.

“Name?”

The woman frowned as if answering was difficult. Her face wore a strangely terrified expression. “What would you do with it?”

“It's no big deal. Is it too great a thing to tell me?”

The woman began to guard against me. ""Then you tell me first. It's no big deal, just like you said.“

That's when my body started to stiffen. I couldn't remember my own name.

”Fine. Let's just forget about it.“

The woman poured me coffee as usual. ”It doesn't matter. What good is a name anyway?"" I could tell she was pretending it was nothing.

“Worried?” “About what?”

“You can't remember your name, you know.”

The woman wrinkled her nose. She always did that when annoyed. I drank my coffee, and outside, artificial lights shone as they did every day. It was beautiful.

“How exhausting it is to start something new,” the woman murmured. “I started going to church this time.”

“Church? You mean... Christianity?” I absentmindedly looked up at the sky. The terrace ceiling was dark red, glowing like wolf fur. The woman shrugged her shoulders and pouted her lips. “The postman who lives next door... his wife kept urging me to come to church.”

“Wait. A post office delivery guy lives next to your place?” The woman looked flustered. “Uh-huh. Is there a problem with that?”

I recalled that delivery guy I'd beaten up, leaving him bleeding profusely. I decided not to press further, thinking there might not even be just one delivery guy. “Well, I guess that's possible.”

“Anyway, I went to church with that woman. There was no pastor, but the chapel was packed. It wasn't that there were no people outside; it was that almost everyone just lived there. Some crazy guy dragged a cross over, lay down on it, and was begging two other people to nail him to it.”

I set down my coffee cup.

""No one tried to stop him. They wouldn't die anyway.“

”Are you going back?“

”Yes. I'm going back. That woman will be there soon.“

”Should I come too?“

”No.“ The woman shook her head. She looked tired. ”You shouldn't come.""

​

After returning, I couldn't sleep and ended up staring out the window all night. The woman must be at the chapel by now. The sky still looked like rusted iron melted into water and mixed with tar. My room was on the first floor, so I could see the park right outside. A man sat on a bench. As I stared intently at him through the window, he faintly resembled the demon who had been overseeing me. No, actually, that's how I was seeing him. Sitting upright in a suit on a dark, empty park bench, he seemed almost meditative. It was obvious his work had just ended. But what did it matter if his work was done? It would start again anyway, and that was practically right now. Yet that man seemed to be trying hard to enjoy that brief peace. If he was also a worshipper, was he offering a prayer now? But everything is over now. All judgment has concluded, and we've been transported to hell. Unless consciousness ceases, we're stuck here, forever colorless. Even if we pray now, the god above merely watches us, utterly indifferent. That man crushed at the construction site earlier probably didn't do anything particularly wrong either. He was just unlucky. That is precisely what it means to be in hell. We have returned to a world where nothing is decided. And because we are trapped in a fate where we cannot even die, that is hell. This is hell, and we must live here.

Then the construction worker and that man overlapped in my vision. Truly, he resembled the demon who had been overseeing me, but I couldn't help but recall that unlucky victim I had never seen before. Even if his head were crushed a billion times, he'd be fine. It would never end, and if he could offer prayers like that, it meant nothing. I wanted to cry. We were abandoned by that ceiling, so I wanted to beg him to stop, to please, just stop praying to Him for what? I begged him to stop. My whole body ached as if my skin were tearing.

Very slowly, imperceptible time stretches endlessly, and I climb, clinging to that single thread. Even if I hold onto it and climb ceaselessly, barely a second passes. Yet every human being wants to believe that linear time has an end. If not, what on earth is all this I'm conscious of right now? I lift the coffee cup, drink from it, and set it down again—performing this sequence of actions. And the flow of that sequence is precisely the flow of time. So time is flowing, after all. I pick up the newspaper, head to the cafe, talk to the woman, and return. That is the flow of time. So shouldn't there at least be a point where my time completely ends in all this? Couldn't one imagine waiting until time itself is utterly destroyed? Even if closing and reopening my eyes feels like an eternity has passed, perhaps only an instant has elapsed, or conversely, if the opposite is possible, wouldn't the time we spend in hell be something both very long and very short? I must disappear. Within this entire sequence of time, it is right that I be consumed and ultimately vanish. I must die again. If I do not die, I simply cannot endure that man sitting over there, probably closing his eyes every day to pray, then walking out again to work, only to have his head crushed under a concrete pile, repeating this cycle. And I cannot bear myself either. I cannot bear this very moment of awareness, knowing it is not truly a moment. It is not that death erases existence, nor that I alone do not die. It is the fact that time stands forever still, changing nothing, that robs everything of meaning. Nothing changes. That is death. That is the loss of my entire being.

Yet I rise again, grab the newspaper, and head to the cafe. That woman, that man, the child whose eyes meet mine, the dog, and the old man walking the dog—all move and make sounds without change, maintaining a strange silence. It doesn't seem terribly painful either, so I drink my coffee again. Perhaps it's all sophistry. It must be. The coffee smells good, after all.

The man outside the window stands up. He smiles at me. I open the window and shout once. “Hey!”

The man looked at me as if asking what was wrong.

“What are you doing right now?” The man awkwardly bowed his head slightly and tried to leave. This isn't right. “No, that's not it, come back!”

The man pointed to his mouth, then made an X sign with his fingers. He was mute. Then he closed his eyes and pressed his hands together. He said he was praying.

“Why are you doing that...” Even if I asked, he wouldn't be able to explain. I impulsively asked, “No, teach me how to do it.”

I climbed over the window frame barefoot and followed the man to the bench. He sat me down beside him, closed his eyes, and placed his hands on his legs as if to say, “Follow me.” I quietly mimicked his posture exactly.

How many minutes passed? Useless thoughts swept through my mind in a whirlwind before stillness descended. I resisted the urge to just get up several times, and then, in the complete darkness, a teal-colored ring-like afterimage began to drift around. Something like a blue bruise seemed to move and float, and something lumpy like mold flickered before my eyes.

It was white mold. White, powdery spores like mushroom spores seemed to cling to my hands. Wooden planks were joined end to end, and when I brushed my hand over them, such dust seemed to stick. A moth with shaggy fur landed on my hand. Shuddering, I shook it off, only to find countless moths stuck to the hearth before me. The moths were flapping their wings urgently, violently, swept into the flames. Sometimes one moth would be sucked in by another's wingbeat. Their fur caught fire and they vanished quickly, the moths turned to ash falling to the floor, becoming dust. I stuck my head directly into the hearth, and my hair began to burn. The intense heat felt like my head was melting. Growing darker and darker, I lay there as a skeleton, mixed with the burnt moth ashes. A strong gust of wind blew, and we vanished completely. At that moment, I didn't want to disappear. Because I was afraid.

When I opened my eyes, artificial lights were flickering, and the man was gone. I cried.

When I went back to the cafe, the woman wasn't there. This was the first time something like this had happened. All I had heard from her was about the chapel. When I asked another employee, they couldn't figure out who ‘that woman’ was. Only after I described her face did they say, unsurprisingly, she'd probably be at the chapel. That coworker was also quite startled, saying this had never happened before, and that she had just left, saying she wouldn't be coming back because she was going to church for worship.

I headed for the church. It stood atop a slightly elevated ridge, its spire rising like Golgotha's hill. With its open ceiling, it felt like the sole hope erected after the apocalypse. I stepped inside.

Before me, countless people bowed their heads in silent prayer. At the very front, just as the woman had said, a man lay coldly, nailed to a cross. His eyes were open. Blood trickled steadily from his hands and feet. It seemed as if the man was saying something, so I bent down to listen. In a voice that came out in broken, staccato whispers, he murmured.

“Hell... is inside me. And... I can't escape from myself.”

I quietly closed the man's eyes. Amidst the sound of people's breaths, someone stood up and let out an ‘Ah’. It was an old woman. It wasn't a human sound, but sounded like the wail of a beast.

“There's no salvation, none! We must keep being punished!”

Instantly, everyone looked up at the old woman. Beside her stood the other woman. She staggered toward me, utterly terrified, grabbed the hem of my shirt, and said, “Over there... at the bottom of that hill...” Immediately, several people went outside, and the murmuring grew louder. The old woman collapsed right there.

When I went outside, a child lay there, eyes wide open, staring at us, not even dead yet. The sight was so horrific it made you want to vomit. Someone had stabbed the child with a knife. The child was abandoned at the foot of the hill, bleeding, only emitting grotesque moans. Someone, who looked like the child's father, slowly walked down and embraced the child. Then he wept. I felt dizzy and returned to the chapel, sitting in an empty seat. The woman stood beside me and placed her hand on my shoulder. “I'm sorry. I told you not to come.” I replied in a hoarse voice. “No... I just... I missed you...” The woman said nothing. “Remember that story you told me before? About how it seemed like there was a god up there, on that ceiling?” “No. There's no such thing as God. You probably just misheard something the devil told you.” The woman shook her head.

“You told me.” I buried my face in my hands and stayed still. ""I don't know. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't. But at least I know it doesn't matter. God neither saved us nor cursed us.“ My voice was almost a sob. ”But what can we do? Look at that man... Look at the one nailed there. We have no choice but to pray..."" The woman said nothing. Only the sound of her deep inhaling and exhaling could be heard.

“I can't do this anymore. None of this matters. I'll keep going to be punished. I don't know what I did wrong.” The woman's voice was cold. She walked out of the church and vanished from sight. For some reason, I felt then that I had died a very long time ago.

I too left the church. But I didn't go down the hill. Gasping for breath, I stared at the cross, towering high enough to pierce the ceiling. And then I began to scream, so loudly it startled even myself.

""Now I understand everything. How you intended to drive us mad, to make us endure our own hell, because even when we were alive, hell wasn't somewhere else—it was us. But you've trapped us once more. Even if that woman leaves me, something remains—my own hell. The hell I can never escape is me. Look at him now. Are you satisfied? He should have died again, but he couldn't. He finally realized he could never escape himself! That's our punishment. It's because we were so indifferent. Because I felt nothing watching the moth burn, because even in hell someone would still butcher that child, because in time that never flows, we made even caring for each other meaningless. Because I'm as indifferent to them as you are to us!"" I tasted blood in my throat, felt it tearing. Hearing my voice, a few of the people watching the child from below the hill startled and slowly gathered toward me, but they only looked at me with resignation. A middle-aged man said to me, “Just… go home.”

​

I closed my eyes. The mattress was hard, the light still dim. The newspaper came every day, and the man outside the window was always sitting there, but even when I went to the cafe, the woman was nowhere to be seen. That's when I realized how desperately I wanted to see her.

I stopped going to the cafe and lay on this mattress for a very long time. My lungs inflated and deflated weakly, like a hollow shell, and the only truth was the sensation of empty air touching my fingertips. Once, it tingled like an electric shock; another time, there was no sensation at all. It felt increasingly numb, yet when I stroked the mattress fabric with my hand, I could distinctly feel the texture.

I've pondered several hypotheses, but to no avail. One is that God might exist; the other is that God truly does not. Even if God exists, all this is eternal and unchanging, so it holds no meaning. No matter how much I shouted at God, He wouldn't listen, and even if He watched me, He never directly did anything to me. And if that God truly punished me, I'd have no reason to suffer. Because, naturally, everything is meaningless. No matter how much I struggled to create meaning, even if I endlessly repeated this failure, eventually I'd stop and fall silent. Then, once I manage a resigned smile, strangely, everything becomes laughable. Then, all the suffering up to now turns into a single laugh in an instant.

The problem is that there is no God. If there is no God, then—I don't know why—every time I fall into this thought, it feels like I've never been alive. Only I have been here, from the beginning until now. Only that I lie here now and that I long for a woman feels real; everything else seems scattered and nonexistent. I take actions that will shape my future and forge my life, but here, there is neither chance nor fate. Time does not move; it merely exists. I gave up on this struggle long ago. Neither path comforts me.

I want to go to the chapel one last time. I want to sit on that varnished wooden chair and feel, just once more, that God might exist.

Yet, within this space of eternity, there is something I can do. I can climb over the window frame. And I can go sit beside that man, closing my eyes for a long time. This time, I imagine myself becoming a moth. In that brief, peaceful moment, I pray to God. To a God who might not exist.

When I open my eyes, the man is gone. And after a very long time, I go back to the cafe. The bell rings, and I walk back into my hell.",1,1759802097.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

It’s an epidemic. We all went along during Covid and chipped in a couple extra bucks to help the food service workers but this has gone too far.

Shake shack
Poyoteca

Mind you, I always tip 20% minimum for full service. I used to wait on tables so I appreciate good service. I just don’t understand why these places are still insisting on tips. The only answer is greed and a lack of courtesy for the customer. 

Are there counter service establishments that we can enjoy that does choose to tax their customers besides the obvious ones like Starbucks and Guisseppes? Let’s shine a light on these places.

If you don't know who he is, he was this kind of rebel figurehead in Nicaragua who had two national forces after him during a guerrilla campaign in country through the 1920s and 1930s. 

And every morning she would make these Gallo Pinto (it's a Nicaraguan rice and bean dish that's very famous within the region, usually eaten with eggs/huevos rancheros, tortillas, crema fresca or queso blanco/queso frito (fried cheese) and are very multiuse), along with a cup of coffee that was made straight from the coffee plantations her husband operated. Don't know if she ever cooked for him directly, but they were definitely in the same house during this time period and it was definitely a staple in the house.

The gallo pinto in question were her crown jewel, all from memory. It was around 1/3 veggie oil, a couple cups of small red beans, 2 cups of long grain rice, 1/2 an onion, oregano, salt to as much as you want, make it like any other rice and bean dish. But the kicker is what she used was 1 tbsp of worchestershire sauce, ketchup and mustard and added it to pan where the rice and beans were being cooked.

And voila, gallo pinto as a Central American guerilla leader would have eaten in the 1930s",26,1759801608.0,TastingHistory,4,1.0,False

I've so far pulled about 10 shots (changed some settings about half way) and I'm getting terrible results:

* Seems to flow fine but comes out very watery (not even gets watery later but even in the beginning the color is very light brown)
* Puck doesn't seem compacted at all
* Grind gets everywhere, the picture is after ONE espresso after being cleaned and vacuumed
* Using my favorite fresh beans and it tastes awful (I'm not an espresso guy but it seems to taste and smell overly bitter compared to what I've been able to get out of my Delonghi Eletta)
* Very sad thin crema
* Not sure if this normal but it's making weird hissing noises

1o01usb,https://easethegrind.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/why-choosing-the-right-comforter-matters-in-winter/,🧣 Why Choosing the Right Comforter Matters in Winter,"When the temperature drops, the real battle begins — not with the cold, but with the comforter. Pick the wrong one, and you’ll spend the night shivering like a popsicle or sweating like a burrito in a sauna. The right comforter? That’s your ticket to cozy, uninterrupted hibernation.
Here’s the lowdown on the top three types of winter comforters — and how not to regret your purchase at 2 a.m.
❄️ 1. Down Comforter – The Fluffy Cloud of Luxury
Why It’s Great:
Down comforters are stuffed with the soft inner feathers of ducks or geese — basically, nature’s version of a heated blanket. They’re warm, light, and make you feel like royalty… if royalty also drooled in their sleep.
Pros:
Feels like sleeping inside a marshmallow
Warm without the weight
Lasts for years if you don’t spill coffee on it
Cons:
May trigger allergies (and sneezes aren’t cute at 3 a.m.)
Pricey — your wallet might need a comforter too
Needs dry cleaning, because apparently luxury can’t handle a washing machine
What to Look For:
Fill Power: 600–800 for serious warmth
Shell: Tight cotton or sateen — soft, durable, and fancy
Baffle Box Construction: Keeps the fluff where it belongs (no cold corners allowed)
A good choice: 
https://amzn.to/3IUhgWP

🌿 2. Down Alternative Comforter – The Budget-Friendly Impostor
Why It’s Great:
Made from synthetic fibers, this comforter says, “I’m not real down, but I play one on TV.” It’s soft, cozy, and won’t make your sinuses revolt.
Pros:
Hypoallergenic and machine washable (because life happens)
Affordable enough to buy matching pillow shams
Comes in different warmth levels for picky sleepers
Cons:
Heavier than down — a bit more “weighted blanket,” a bit less “cloud”
Loses fluff faster than a cheap pillow fight
What to Look For:
GSM: 300–400 for winter warmth
Shell: Cotton or microfiber for breathability
Box Stitching: Keeps the fill from migrating south for the winter
A good choice:
https://amzn.to/4pZ6LSK

🐑 3. Wool Comforter – The Overachiever of Bedding
Why It’s Great:
Wool comforters are for people who want warmth without the sweat. Wool naturally regulates temperature, so you stay toasty but never overheated — like a perfectly baked cookie.
Pros:
Breathable and moisture-wicking (no swampy sheets)
Naturally resists dust mites and allergens
Built to last longer than most relationships
Cons:
Heavier than down
Pricier than synthetic options
Feels dense — not ideal if you like your bedding light and fluffy
What to Look For:
Filling: 100% natural or organic wool
Cover: Cotton or organic fabric for softness
Design: Quilted to keep the wool evenly spread (no lumpy surprises)
🛏️ How to Choose
Warmth: Match fill power or GSM to your home’s chill factor
Allergies: Down alternative or wool if feathers make you sneeze
Care: Down = dry cleaning; others = toss in the washer
Budget: Down is luxury, synthetic is practical, wool is “I care about the planet and my sleep”
A good choice:
https://amzn.to/438e6FQ

🔎 Final Thoughts
Down: For those who want to sleep like a pampered goose
Down Alternative: For the sneeze-free, budget-conscious dreamer
Wool: For the eco-friendly sleeper who runs hot

1o01qr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o01qr9/my_husband_gave_me_a_5_budget_for_his_birthday/,"My husband gave me a $5 budget for his birthday and I spent more, AITAH?","I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong or an asshole for doing this at all but I can also see from my husband’s side, so I just don’t know. I’m hoping someone can give me a non biased opinion. 

  Basically the title explains it but for some more detail- Me and my husband (f23 and m29) have been married for two years and we have a four months old baby. We decided it would be better financially for me to become a stay at home mom when baby girl came because the cost of daycare would quite literally be my income. I am a teacher. Because of this naturally we have somewhat of a tighter budget, but by no means are we struggling financially. I say this without any meaning anything, just to give context, I know times are really tough right now for a lot of people and I know I’m very lucky. 

  Anyway, my husband’s birthday was last week. I asked him what he wanted as a gift about a month ago and he told me anything, but under $5. My husband is a very hardworking man and he really doesn’t enjoy *things* that much so this wasn’t a weird thing for him to say. He added on we are budgeting anyway so a $5 present would be enough. 

  I really didn’t know he meant that. So, from our joint bank account for his birthday I purchased him a book he was reading reviews on, a coffee mug that said something about being a dad, and a pair of sunglasses because our dog chewed his up and he was pretty mad about it. All together it was around $90. When I was at the store getting the book and the mug I purchased a few items for the baby so it was like $150 total there. But $90 for his gifts, that’s important. 

  When I gave these gifts to my husband (he was happy about the sunglasses) but immediately started in on the “this couldn’t have been $5!!”. I was like yeah of course not but it’s your birthday. 

  Well needless to say he was pissed. He basically yelled at me while our baby was sleeping about going over budget and ignoring what he said. I was stricken and i apologized and said I’d return it if he wanted, I had the receipt. He then proceeded to snatch the receipt from my purse and read that the total was $150 and berate me even more. It took me ten mins just to get a word in edge wise and explain half that price was also for the baby. When he finally could listen enough to hear that he was just so annoyed and told me to return it all. The next day I tried to, but of course he wanted to keep the sunglasses. 

  I was just so pissed off and then to make matters worse he tried to apologize the next day by initiating intimacy and when I was like, in what world does it seem like I want that right now?? He quipped it would’ve been a better birthday gift and “free”. 

  I’m just so pissed off but does he have a point?? AITAH for going over his $5 budget??

1o01pxu,https://i.redd.it/tymi4mcoaltf1.png,Frederic Sidequest Rewards Tier List,"I've wanted to rank the Freds as far as rewards go for a while now and I think I've landed on a reasonably accurate ranking spread. To some degree this is also my opinion, so if you have a feeling that something should be higher or lower, I'd love to hear it.

  
S

Bright Fred rewards you with maxed out healing capabilities for visiting him, and a portable Medic-in-a-jar. His healing does over 200 HP and also cleanses all status effects for the entire party, which is a combination that no other single healing item can do. The Medic-in-a-jar does the same thing once per day and can be used mid-battle as an emergency heal. Very worthwhile option to have a permanent (once per day) healing source while exploring and you can stop by Frederic's apartment to use Bright Fred himself and save on healing items or cooking. Halfway replaceable by other healing items independently, but not in full (i.e. healing or status effect cleansing, but not both in most cases, and the few that do both only cleanse one or two particular status effects), and are single use consumables by contrast. 

Faceless Fred will duplicate any wearable of your choosing (he says he can't duplicate weapons, but ranged weapons come up as options and should be treated as a bug that could be patched in the future). This takes one day and will remove said item from your inventory until the next day. Requires beating >!the Face Taker!<, which can an annoying if you have no reliable source of Acid damage or used all the Turpentine while fighting the other Freds. Duplicating a Coat of Arms, Champion's Belt, Sapphire Ring, or Teeth Pendant can be great uses of this service, but there are many viable options for duplication depending on your party and build. Consider what equipment slots your party can use before committing to a duplicate item (i.e. don't duplicate jewelry for Ernest or bodywear for Roaches). No other way to duplicate items exists.



A

Frederic rewards you with the Paint Palette if spared. Off-hand slot item that gives a 5% chance to apply Poison, Blind, Panic, Rage, Confusion, Sleep and/or Charm on hit. Somewhat dependent on RNG, but can result in clutch status effect procs that can help you in a pinch. Less useful if your party is depending on two-handed firearms/melee weapons or dual wielding pistols and one handed weapons. The only item of its kind in-game. 



B

Godhead Fred gives you $400 if you call out the god scam and spare him. Money can be hard to rank independently, so it's more about why you want $400 than just having it. Mutt's special inventory is a very good use of it; Lockpicks and the Coffee Machine are excellent returns on investment, and items like the Champion's Belt and Training Belt can be good ways to round out a character build. The broad subjectiveness of the usage makes it reasonable to put in B, and individual uses of the money can go in A or even S tier depending on the circumstances.



Wriggly Fred provides a cooking buff and also gives the Fred Ring if you accept his otherwise random prompt when he moves into your apartment. Restorative effects of cooking with Wriggly Fred can potentially go up so much that cooking becomes equivalent to Elixirs. Fred Ring gives +4 Agility and 15% Evasion. Other jewelry and equipment can give Agility, but Evasion is very rare. Two body pieces (Strange Robe from Fake Harriet and Dark Robes from Jasper) give 10% evasion, and the Ring of Alertness gives 5% less Evasion. The only Fred to give two separate rewards at once (Faceless Fred duplicates an existing item, so it doesn't count). Worthwhile choice if you can afford to cook more and the Fred Ring can be relevant for some builds.



C



Toxic Fred rewards you with the fake Cowboy Hat if you spare him, which after advancing to the next day becomes the Eyeball Hat and is removable. The Eyeball hat has +4 Def and Ballistics Def, immunity to blindness and sleep, a 20% change to poison enemies with basic attacks and grants the Toxic Dance skill, which is AOE, scales with HP and deals Acid damage with a chance to poison enemies. There is headgear that can individually resist sleep (Gas Mask) or Blind (Welding Helmet) but not both. Has a minor niche defensively against every final boss, Furnace and Hellride. Toxic Dance is a gimmick unless you slot it on a high HP unit like Papineau. Potentially useful pickup in select situations, but the other options outclass it.



Tumor Fred rewards Tumor Lumps if spared. Combat throwable that deals Flesh damage with a chance for heavy to severe Bleed stacking. If you abstain from using it, it doubles in your inventory. On paper, possible for you to have 32 or more if you wait several days without using it. The ultimate example of delayed gratification amidst the Fred rewards, but is not necessarily the best option, even considering you can have many copies by the time you want to use it against a superboss or final boss. Subjectively a terrible option because Tumor Fred actively begs you to kill him.



Godhead Fred gives you the Strange Feather if you don't call out the god scam and spare him. +5 HP, STM and Luck. Debatably the worst reward. Replaceable by the Gold Bracelet, having 5 more max HP, equal STM and gives +2 to all other stats, or the Sapphire Ring, which gives 50 HP, 25 STM and cold resistance instead of a Luck boost. The Champion's Belt also replaces it in a different slot. Very mediocre stat increases and not worth picking up over other Fred options, or even the $400 available if you call out the god scam.



D



Shadow, Scared and Bites Fred give you nothing for sparing them. As of 1.7 they are the optimal Freds to kill if you want to just get the cursed painting for story progression and put off your final decision for later. Could change in 2.0.",12,1759800958.0,LookOutsideGame,4,1.0,False

I met someone I’m a 30’s F (not single) and this man is way younger than me. He’s in uni and he’s in his early 20’s. I met him on reddit back in March and at first, we were just chatting on dm’s and we transferred to another messaging app and we started building our friendship from there. 

Fast forward to maybe June or July, we decided to meet up and had dinner together after my work and his uni.  The moment I saw him, my jaw dropped cause he has the most beautiful set of eyes I’ve ever laid my eyes on. We became closer after that meetup. 

Fast forward again to yesterday, we met again to go to my gym cause he told me wanted to try doing my workout so I told him I’m gonna make arrangements to my coach for a free trial. 

After our workout was done, I asked if he wanted to grab coffee with me and he said yes, when we were already outside, he told me he has something inside his car that he wanted to give me for my birthday. It was the item that I have always been eyeing for myself but just couldn’t justify buying. I specifically told him not to get me anything cause he didn’t need to. 

When we were saying our goodbyes after our coffee, I felt warmth after our hug. I am so conflicted and I’m starting to hate myself because I’m starting to like him. It was more of him listening and taking notes and doing something I like doing. Not the material thing! I’m not like that at all. 

I’m not gonna lie, he is mature for his age and I’m completely conflicted about my feelings for him. It’s not even lust I’m feeling. It’s more of genuine care and I don’t know if he likes me or just friendly and generous to all his friends.

Which is exactly what I was hoping because that dynamic just is and is something I’ve learned to manage and isn’t a main focus in my life. I thought that largely spoke to her abilities any other reader would have dwelled on this but she moved on! I initially got this as a love reading but my cup had other plans. As many others I got this reading due to an end of a great relationship. I have always ignored the voice in my head that has said “this break up happened because love is not important for you right now. It is not the right time to be focused on love. You need to focus on your career and dreams.” And the cup reflected that. The part of the cup dedicated to any insight about love in readings was faint and had little to no coffee grinds to read but the area that was most potent and had the most coffee remains to read was about my future as an attorney and the journey to get there.

We all have our own rooms and just share the common spaces. One of the girls is in a ""situationship"" of sorts with a guy for about six months. He was around the previous semester, but really only attempted to befriend me, not any of her other friends. But he also did things like make me file his taxes, took over the bedroom we shared and had me sleep in the living room so he could stay over. 

Well this year, it escalated. He and his friends helped build some of our furniture when we moved in. I felt bad for having to ask and paid for pizza ($50 worth), sent home a card and some snacks, and said thank you more times than I can count. He even told me, ""This is what friends do, don't say thank you anymore"" 

Well when he was upset (because I was talking to my friend, his ""gf"") he started being rude and I said ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"" since I made breakfast for the house and enough for him, made sure there were snacks he could eat in the house, etc. and he got this awful smile on his face and said ""have you ever heard don't bite the hand that builds your furniture"" and just stared at me as I mumbled an apology. I looked to my roommate, my best friend, who knows I have a really hard time asking for help/bad experiences from asking in the past and she just stared, watching and didnt defend me.

I went to process the whole thing with my other roommates and they quickly told me that that was not okay of him, he was a guest in our home and he had no right to treat me that way. They didn't like the way he treated me ever, or the way he treated our friend in their relationship, or how rude he was to us as a whole in our house. So, this resulted in me and my roommates confronting him that night and having us ask him to leave for the night. 

Since he and I were friends previously, we did have a conversation hashing it out, but it ended up in him manipulating me and making me think everything that had gone wrong was all my fault. After this encounter and everything that had happened, my friends and I asked that he not spend time in the common areas and if he came over he had to go straight to her room. 

It has been about a month and things have only gotten worse. He has sent mean and verbally aggressive messages to me, treated us rudely when we ordered from the coffee shop he works at, stared me down when he passes me on campus and I swear he has such a terrible, bone-chilling look. Today, when he glared at me on campus, I felt truly unsafe. 

As for my best friend, she has completely isolated herself for everyone. I have repeatedly told her how uncomfortable he makes me and how awful and uneasy he makes me feel, and she said nothing and continues to bring him into our home. They also like to do the grass in the house even though obviously that is not okay AND all of us other roommates hate the smell. None of the rules we have set are being followed or respected, he makes me terribly anxious, and she has not apologized. 

Am I overracting for wanting to go to someone higher up to file a complaint/formal request for him to not be allowed back in our home?

We met online and hit it off right away, talking every single day, making things official within a month, and saying ""I love you"" at 3 months. Things were great, and despite a lot of my relationship anxiety issues coming up (which I've been handling successfully privately), I feel like I'm in the first truly adult, communicative relationship of my life. I'm a writer and an editor. I've been looking for a job ever since we met, and with the job market being as it is — especially in my field — I've had little luck. To make ends meet in the meantime, I do freelance (copy)writing, social media, marketing, etc., work. When we met, I was in a much better spot, having multiple clients and making enough money to comfortably afford paying off bills and having weekly dinners and hangouts (even if not a lot of them). But lately, all of that's changed. My freelance roster suddenly took a huge hit; I had to take a lot of money out of my savings, and now I'm only breaking even. I also can't seem to replace the lost clients as easily as I have in the past. Because of this, the number of things I can do for fun has drastically diminished. I can basically only do things like walk around the park with a coffee or go see a movie, and I definitely have to cook all of my meals at home. He lives in Midtown Manhattan, makes a lot more money, and eats out for most of his meals. I'm terrified because when I'm at his place (which is most of the time), I can't keep up, and that makes me feel like I'm suddenly not good enough for him. Our relationship, despite moving so quickly, is still so new. I want us to create memories together, and so does he, which requires doing things, and that requires money. He recently suggested going away for a quick weekend getaway, for example. I can't afford to pay for my half of it or take him out for a date night any time soon, and I feel so horrible because it's clear that my lack of success is affecting his quality of life and the quality of our relationship. After all, he'd have so much more fun with someone who could afford to pay her way through fun date nights and impromptu couples' trips together.

I know people say you shouldn't judge yourself based on your job (especially in this job market) and if the roles were reversed and I made six figures and he was broke, as long as he still tried his best (which I am), I'd happily treat him within my budget and all I'd care about is how he treats me and what kind of a person he is. But I can't seem to extend myself similar sensitivities, especially every time I remember how old I am. He's never made me feel any lesser because of it, but I can't help but think that I've turned out to be a disappointment.

I hope all is well and just wanted to share my story. I’ve been with my company for 2.5 years roughly at this point in time. At the 2 year mark, I was offered a vertical position/move that I instantly said yes to. 
To put it into perspective, I was a customer service agent, did so well and had amazing feedback, that a  process improvement role was created for me. 
I waited 6 long months after the initial conversation for it to actually go through.

In the meantime, I had a mental breakdown from all the stress of being in the department. My former boss and her boss would routinely engage in micromanagement, gaslighting, turning us against other departments in the company (us vs them is ingrained from the very beginning), giving us a heavy workload above what any one person could handle and with insufficient help to top it off. I’ve had at least one idea stolen that I’m publicly aware of but who knows what has happened behind the scenes (I’m an undiagnosed high functioning autistic woman with military avionic maintenance under my belt. So to say I think outside of the box is putting it lightly).  
I took a week off, came back crashed out within 4 days, and then had to take an FMLA leave for another week. I was getting upwards of 200 emails per day and almost all required a response or some type of action within 24-48 hours. It was very widely known that I had double the workload of my peers and yet I continued to absolutely crush it at work. And she did nothing about it. 
now she has to hire a temp person to help out my replacement due to the workload. I was doing the work of 4 people day in and day out. 


Now, one day I told boss A what my dream job was. She took my idea, made a job out of it, and then ELT -  **cough cough the CEO** - snatched me and put me in a different department. It’s like working for a different company now. Mind you, this lady will tell everyone she made my job (this is important to note for later). 

I went from having a team of 10 to only being the single and lone person on the “team” I’m on now. And my job was written to heavily assist my previous team. Because my team touches more departments at any other, and is basically where you see where all the crap lands, I, as a continuous improvement specialist is responsible for improving work processes specifically, sat in those meetings to still gauge it. Mind you, I was with them for 2.5 years and was only a few weeks removed. When I joined the meetings, I always had feedback about what I had learned and would tell team members of the issues that cropped up in the background that I had handled on their behalf and to not worry about it (time is a precious commodity that they do not have because boss A insists on underpaying and overworking everybody for nothing in return).  Because I know very personally what it’s like, I want to step in and help take off some of their burden because I like them all very much. 

Now, here is where shit gets weird. After the meeting, boss A comes up to me and gives me a paper which is basically a follow up of what happened in the meeting. Then, she turns around she starts telling people I made her uncomfortable. That caught me by surprise as she could’ve very easily have said “I know you miss us, but you can’t join anymore” versus telling people that I made her uncomfortable. So, I promised to not go to anymore and to avoid going up to her department. I removed myself from all her department emails and channels from Teams. 
Next, she tells a Chief ____ that she feels like I’m the police. That’s strike two. 

Last week, I went into my former direct bosses office (boss B who is under boss A) and gave her a little insight of what I was reviewing when I requested information (it wasn’t bad. In fact, the company exceeded the goal by 1%). I was met with so much hostility, negativity, and animosity. When she heard all of what she heard to hear she goes “is this just informational”. I said yes, she goes “well, I gotta go. I have things to do.” boss B immediately leaves her office and starts to whisper to boss A. 
On this same day, I was talking to a coworker about work related issues. She showed me what she was working on and I showed her what I was working on to help the team. Boss A comes by, didn’t even look at me (I’m very big at social queues and notice what people don’t do because I’ve had to study these things as an autistic person). The next morning, she goes to this coworker to ask her what we were talking about. That’s strike 3. 

Today, before I did anything, I made sure to read my
Job description to make sure I was within my jurisdiction. I was so, so I proceeded to clean up the system and get out old open files. I closed things open from 2023 and 2024 only. I emailed the proper departments, and let them know I had handled it. Boss A’s department wasn’t even on the list. 
One guy said he uses the system differently and I quickly reversed what I did, and immediately set up a meeting with him and his bosses to understand how they use the system and specifically stated in the email “I want to make sure I’m not doing more harm than good.”

Final straw - she emails me close to the end of the day and asks “Who told you to do this” as if I’m 5 years old. I said no one, is this an issue? She goes it’s creating confusion to which I replied I’m not sure why this is confusing as it’s in my job details - the one she likes to brag about that she wrote! 

I am so beyond these two miserable old hags. I’m here to tell all of you to DOCUMENT everything. I’ve even written down a nonchalant encounter in the break room grabbing coffee. Since she mad a comment that I made her uncomfortable, I’ve been avoiding her at all costs because now IM uncomfortable. She has done the same thing to another girl that was on the team. It’s like she gets upset that someone had the nerve to leave her poorly ran department and the petty antics.

Clinicians define cluster C PDs as being driven by fear and anxiety. Controlling behavior driven by malice, narcissism, entitlement, and other issues is not a symptom of OCPD. All domestic violence perpetrators are controlling, but the vast majority do not have mental health diagnoses. [Domestic Violence Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychologyTalk/comments/1mxy7v6/psychology_of_domestic_violence/)

If you're being physically or emotionally abused, please do not view any of these resources as ""explaining"" that abuse or that a disorder is ""making"" your partner behave a certain way. In this video, Lundy Bancroft, the author of the most popular book on domestic violence, states that about 88% perpetrators do not have mental health disorders: [Inside the Minds of Domestic Abusers & How to Support Women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywsTdzkiPF0).

**ADVICE**

I think it’s best to take some time to learn about OCPD, and consult with a therapist, before attempting an intervention for a loved one who may have OCPD.

This is excellent advice from another member: [Looking for advice on how to properly set boundaries and stand up for myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1doj2zv/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_properly_set/).

You need to get a therapist for yourself as soon as you can. Everything changed for me when I knew I had someone in my corner who understood and validated me.

Journal these incidents in detail before you act. I found this immensely helpful for me to look at things objectively and see that it was not all my fault. Also good to have a record of things to avoid gaslighting if that’s happening. Make sure your records are honest and include the bits where you messed up as well, you grow that way.

Make a deal with yourself that you will STOP apologising for things that are not your fault to keep the peace. This is hard, because it means you can’t make the conflict go away quickly, but things will NOT improve ever if you keep doing this.

Learn to be okay with your partner’s being disregulated. That is their issue not yours. Have a plan for what you can do to self-soothe or protect yourself. Can you leave the room/house, go for a walk with the dog, get a coffee etc. If it goes on for a long time you will need a longer strategy.

Have scripted responses in your pocket to respond to attacks and attempts to draw you in or elicit an apology. This is why journaling is good because you already have an objective understanding of why you don’t need to apologise. Eg ‘I am not going to be yelled at about X, if you keep yelling I will Y’. ‘I don’t see it that way, I’m happy to have a conversation about it when you are calmer.’ ‘I understand that you think (reflect what they said), but I don’t agree that that’s how it was.’

Books like Boundaries and Stop Walking on Eggshells are great.

Know that you can’t fix this person, be prepared to leave, you are not obligated in any way to put up with abuse. Don’t go to couples counselling IMO, unless they are in a place where they admit they are controlling and are doing their own work. YOU CAN LEAVE THEM. But you will need to address your own boundary issues regardless, otherwise you could end up back in the same position with another controller.

Advice from  [American Psychiatric Association:](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/personality-disorders)

Individuals with personality disorders are usually aware that their life is not going well. Approaching a friend about their painful feelings or the frustrations and disappointments in their life, and offering to listen, might be a way to help them consider treatment. If you have had a successful experience in therapy, share that with your friend, even if it wasn’t necessarily for “personality problems” (an off-putting term for many people). Most people with personality disorders enter treatment with another problem, such as depression, anxiety, substance use, a job loss, a romantic break-up, etc. The challenge is to get your friend “in the door,” so to speak, not to commit to long-term treatment at the beginning.

Research has shown that certain foods and nutrients can disrupt sleep architecture, increase nighttime awakenings, and even reduce deep sleep.

Here are some of the main culprits backed by clinical studies:

- **Caffeine and chocolate:** Caffeine has a half-life of about 5–6 hours, which means that even an afternoon cup of coffee can still affect your sleep that night. Dark chocolate also contains small amounts of caffeine and theobromine, both of which can increase alertness.  
- **Alcohol:** It can make you fall asleep faster, but studies show it disrupts REM sleep and increases wakefulness in the second half of the night.  
- **Spicy or acidic foods:** These can cause indigestion and acid reflux when lying down, which can interfere with both falling and staying asleep.  
- **High-fat or heavy meals:** Fat slows digestion, meaning your body is still working while it should be resting. Some research also links high saturated fat intake with lighter, more fragmented sleep.  
- **Sugar-heavy snacks:** Sudden blood sugar spikes and crashes can cause awakenings or restlessness during the night.

---

**What helps instead:**  
If you are hungry before bed, opt for lighter options like Greek yogurt, a banana, or a small bowl of oatmeal. These contain tryptophan and magnesium, which support melatonin production and muscle relaxation.

**Included amenities:** Fully furnished, in-unit washer & dryer, dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster, rice cooker, full-size oven, balcony, flatscreen TV, central heating and cooling, individual locking bedrooms, detachable showerhead, etc.

I have one outgoing and friendly roommate. The landlord also hosts gatherings every so often like cookouts, and the overall management group is kind and understanding.

**Rent: $875.00 a month, with ALL utilities included.** Yes, this means water, sewer, recycling, etc.

**Other notes:** There is a $200 sublease fee to transfer the lease (background checks , credit check, etc.) and for cleaning between my move out / your move in. This is negotiable, but the rent price is not. Leases are individual, so my roommates lease is not tied to yours and vice-versa. The lease is for the full year until July 31, 2026.

A few years ago I had a dream that I was in a strange city, surrounded by mountains. For some reason I just knew that it was in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
The city was completely destroyed by heavy rain. Trees were scattered, cars upside down, a lot of people wandering around.
An old lady came to me and pointed a place that she said it was her house. She was crying and repeating “ I lost everything”.
When a woke up, the dream was still very vivid in my mind and I felt very sad and depressed.
Later I went upstairs of my apartment to have some coffee and watch the news. When I turned the news channel I could not believe what I was seeing. They were showing the city of petropolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro , that were devastated by heavy rain that same night.

Last night, I fell asleep to the sound of his breathing.","It all started on one of those language exchange apps. I was trying to brush up on my French, he was trying to improve his English. He was in the UK, I was in the US, and we were just two random people who happened to swipe on each other. What started as awkward messages about grammar quickly turned into 3 AM video calls that I’d take huddled under my blankets, trying not to wake my roommate. His accent, the way his eyes would crinkle when he laughed… I was falling for a guy I had never even met.

After a year of digital dating, we decided to pull the trigger. I booked a flight to London, my stomach a chaotic mess of butterflies and pure panic. That first meeting at the airport felt like a scene from a movie. I remember scanning the crowd, my heart pounding, and then… there he was. The hug wasn't awkward at all; it felt like coming home. That week was a blur of seeing the sights, meeting his friends, and realizing this was undeniably real.

The three years that followed were brutal. It was a rollercoaster of tearful airport goodbyes, counting down the days until the next visit, and celebrating anniversaries over a screen. We spent a small fortune on flights. The time difference was a killer, and there were days the loneliness felt so heavy I wasn't sure we could make it. You have to build a whole life together on pure trust and communication.

Then came the final boss: the visa process. It was a soul-crushing mountain of paperwork, interviews, and waiting. For nearly a year, our future was in the hands of a government official. But we got the approval. I packed up my life, said goodbye to my family, and took that final one-way flight. Now, we're building our life together, one day at a time. It’s the little things, like cooking dinner together or him bringing me coffee in the morning, that make every second of the struggle worth it.

What she says she wants is a frother and espresso machine. What I've read we would also need is a grinder as well which can be as much as the machine?!

I've been reading all through here. Gaggia classic pro is good but pricey. Also on sale. But also requires heavy modifications to get to a consistent cup? There's always acronyms involved that I cannot follow.

Breville Bambino plus is good? But the frother has issues?

I cannot imagine more than 3 cups going through it within a short period.

Where can I start? I got about 3 days to research all options. (:",1,1759799925.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

It was chill, warm, and exactly the kind of low-pressure closeness I value. They’ve since travelled, and I’ve realized I’d really like to find that kind of connection again.

I'm moderately athletic, extroverted, and people say I’m calm, open, and easy to talk to. I love thoughtful conversation — especially the kind that lingers long after.

I’m looking for someone who enjoys physical affection in a respectful way, one that doesn't involve sex. Cuddling, watching something, sharing space — with room for deeper conversation and comfort. I’m open to more intimate cuddles or other forms of intimacy, but not looking for anything beyond that right now.

We’d meet in public first (coffee, a walk, something low-key) to feel things out. Ideally, you'd be someone who can host — if not, we’ll figure something out.

If you’re over 22, emotionally aware, and craving a little connection without pressure — say hi. Would love to hear from you.

1o016tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1o016tf/dont_invite_the_person_you_are_dating_to_your/,Don't invite the person you are dating to your church......yet.,"Hey everyone, 

I thought to share my perspective on inviting someone you are casually dating to church. For context about who I am, I am a single, 38/m.

I have a female friend who once was dating a guy she was seeing for maybe one month and a half. I don't think they were exclusive. They also did not have a label for their kind of relationship. They were romantically seeing each other., of course.

The man invited my friend to his church. She told me the whole thing was weird because she felt like he was showing her off to other girls to make them jealous. 

My friend certainly discerned vibes by what she felt. She did not feel he was interested in her well-being (making sure she is comfortable, safe, enjoying herself, etc.). This happened years ago so I don't remember many details after that, but I know she did not see him for very much longer afterwards.

I can see how inviting someone, who is of the same denomination as you, to church can be a good thing, However, I would challenge you to consider a few things. 

  
**Social safety and Comfortability**

Community is everything. We should all have that. However, communing with the right people at the right time is different and is better. Same goes with dating. 

It's my opinion that as a dating relationship progresses, intentions should evolve. Since it's more unlikely for people to fall in love with someone they already know, safety should mean everything in this ""match on an app then meet later"" age. 

It's okay to be casual and meet over coffee, even as believers. You don't have to get an approval from your pastor, bishop or some other kind of church leader to date someone. That's not biblical. Now, getting wisdom from your leaders is highly advisable though and very biblical. 

If you ask someone who has never been to your church to come to your church, chances are they don't know anyone there and they are still working on how much they trust you. I'm speaking to men here. We want to trust the lady we are out with too, but trust is HUGE for many women when they are out with a guy, especially if they have been traumatized in any way, shape or form. BTW, there's such a thing as religious trauma. Again......safety matters. 

So, think about how uncomfortable someone can be around tens or hundreds of people you know but they don't and now they have to have the pressure of not looking like a lunatic by entering your circles and trying not to embarrass themselves and you at the same time! 

  
**Does going to church together help you truly see the person as you are with?**

Say you are not sure if the other person you're dating has similar or the essential beliefs of a Christian.  Is inviting them to your church going to aptly gauge that for you? 

It could. Not every dating situation and two sets of people are the same. However, people are imperfect which means, seeing how they are in public can be vastly different than who they are in private. 

Unfortunately, I had a friend who divorced from her ex-husband who exemplified this. He was a devoted Christian at church but was unfaithful in an adulterous relationship. He even married the one he cheated on my friend with! This shocked everyone they both knew. The man was even on the worship team. 

As biblical as it may be to worship together since you two may be Christians, I highly advise to wait on that. Two Christian adults are capable in getting to know each other in public environments, like a cafe at a park, a library (silent reading dates! :)), sporting areas, etc. and discern how the other truly worships God through action. 

You can achieve this with intentional conversation and activity. Choose a fun activity you both like and ask basic (not intense) questions to draw the other person out (i.e. What do you like most about your major in college? What's your favorite Anime? What's your favorite book? Song? etc., then ask to follow up questions that relate to the original questions as you do the activity together. 

It can be easy for others to hide their true nature behind false piety, especially in mega churches. If the person you are dating has not gone through tough situations with others who go to the same church as them, those people can be a false or shallow reference of character on behalf of your date. They may not know how your date reacts to terrible situations. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

In my opinion, there is no rush in attending church together.  It can make one feel unsafe, bothered and unprepared since they are not with their support system and forced to trust you while at an unfamiliar place.

If you feel like you are rushing into going to church together, I suggest stepping back and focusing on building rapport with one another. Get creative! But also, establish boundaries and respect one another. You can ask the other person if they are open to hanging out in a group where a friend of theirs can hang with you two and a friend of yours-keep it small and casual. Lastly, be open to answering questions More than likely the other person is getting to know you from scratch. 

P.S. to the men here- If a woman says 'no' to going to church with you, assume she means no. Respect the answer, give her space and let the relationship naturally carry on. Remember, trust is everything and if she hasn't had time to build trust with you, going to church together is the last thing that should be done (IMO).

Again, feel free to comment if you have thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!",0,1759799494.0,ChristianDating,12,0.36,False
1o016ta,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o016ta,Heidi's Lane Podcast Recap. The one where we all lose brain cells.,"Heidi’s Lane Podcast Recap. Ep 72. “Do You Miss Dave? (Ryan Asked) When New Love Meets (and Heals) Old Grief”

OP NOTES: This transcript will make you question whether I, as the transcriber, am sober. If you question this, then I have done my job in relaying the chaos that is this episode. But really, Ryan and Heidi both need parental supervision and an appointment with a therapist. Heidi shares that this episode is to celebrate girl M’s 19th birthday. I’m sure that’s exactly what M wanted, her mother spending an hour and 11 mins with her man of the moment talking about her drug overdosed deceased man of the moment. Happy Birthday, M!

Heidi: We’re back. 

Ryan: Thanks for having me. I just got in from the airport. 

H: You can now see his face

R: Thanks for swinging by to get me. Thanks for the lift. 

H: This is the man, the myth, and the missing

R: You’re so smart.

H: On our last podcast we talked about the financial responsibilities of raising kids going to college, Star Wars, boy M’s side hustle, girl M passing her boards, and this man who I barely know knows so much about me and my family. 

R: It is weird. What’s that secret question you wrote down?

H:  The purpose of today’s podcast is to wish girl M a happy birthday. 

R: That’s so cute. 

H: The podcast I had scheduled for today was a great one on my eating disorder, and I was like NO, nooo

R: That’s not very birthday-ish.

H: No, no. It’s a few hours long and it will have to wait. My eating disorder has been a requested podcast topic. I’ll follow it up with a podcast from a therapist. You need to talk a little louder or turn up your sensitivity. 

R: You’re like, “Ryan, be more sensitive.”

H: Last episode you were louder than me.

R: Let’s adjust the volume. My nickname as a kid was “microphone.”

H: Mine was “Hurricane Heidi.”

R: Why are they both so fitting? I never stop talking really loudly all the time.

H: I’m everywhere all the time and I make messes

R: You are a little hurricane-y, but it’s so good. You are good hurricane energy.

H: I’m fun and loving I think, right?

R: You’re a love-i-cane. It’s like Lidocaine. Lidocaine is what’s affecting you right now. It’s getting better.

H: When I put my hat on, it was too tight. I had to loosen it. 

R: We should probably mention it now. Last time I was on I mentioned Star Trek

H: Last time you said I never watched Star Trek or Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.

R: Let’s be clear, the Trek and the Wars are very different. 

H: It’s all in space. 

R: I’m not a Trekkie. It’s very different than a Star Wars person.

H: I don’t believe you. Let’s drink our Red Bulls. These are car approved.

R: Yeah, car approved. 

H: They’re technically fuel. Like Black Rock which is an overpriced energy drink, but it tastes so good. 

R: Your forehead and Star Trek

H: Oh yeah. So I got this literally 48 hours ago. It’s called PRP. No, not PRP, it’s exosome therapy. I’ve got a whole, I’ve got pages. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pages, with 30 questions on each page

R: Probably 25

H: No, 30

R: Just estimate. Hurry and estimate.

H: 150 I think. 

R: No, per page.

H: 30

R: Okay, I’m seeing it

H: Do you want to count?

R: No, I think 30 is right. Maybe 34.

H: 30. I have all these questions. And today, in honor of M’s birthday, we’re going to answer them and keep it lighthearted. I want to wish M a very happy birthday. She’s 19 and in Thailand.

R: That’s so fun.

H: I’ll spare you the Thailand stuff today

R: They want more

H: Yeah, we’ll have more. 

R: We’ll tell some of her Thailand stories later.

H: We should tell them today in her honor. She is so funny.

R: She’s great.

H: Many of you often ask about my hair loss. This treatment is called exosome therapy. I get it done by Carly Klein and her NHLMA team. National Hair Loss, I don’t know. NHNHLA? National Hair Loss?

R: National Hair Loss Association. 

H: NHLMA

R: Should I be the president of NHLMA?

H: Ryan is bald. 

R: It’s been that way for a very long time.

H; Clearly I’m attracted to bald men. 

R: Like 90%

H: No, I’m 100% attracted to you. 

R: No, you’ve had a few “haired” men. 

H: Yeah, a couple. I’ve also had a couple with no hair.  NHLMA. I don’t know what the L is. I’m way off. She gets me my laser hats and my minoxidil, which is oral Rogaine. I go once a month for exosome therapy. Gosh damn, what is that? I looked it up on your CHATGPT. What are exosomes? 

R: You use my CHATGPT and it’s starting to think your questions are mine. 

H: I was researching because of my forehead. 

R: You asked CHATGPT some other questions (he giggles)

H: Exosomes are tiny vesicles, not to be confused with testicles, that all cells naturally release. They are microscopic packages that carry proteins, lipids, and genetic material in the body. They help with cell communication and influence healing and inflammation. They come from stem cells. They first went on my head with a microneedling machine. It’s many needles that go vrmmm vrmmm vrmmm. They inject lidocaine and do a nerve block on my scalp. Then they aerate it. Then they inject exosomes into my scalp. It helps grow your hair. Yesterday I woke up…

R: The day of, you Face Timed me and uncovered your face. It was like looking at 2 faces. One side of your eyebrow has a lot of motion. They look good individually. 

H: Independently?

R: Independently? Solo? What’s the word we’re looking for?

H: Independently?

R: No, it’s a different word. You know when you can feel a word? It’s like an itch in my brain. Like when you can see the word. Not independently. 

H: Irrespective. 

R: That’s like irregardless. It’s not a word. 

H: We should do a segment where we talk about words people say wrong. 

R: I have a list from one of my girls. One of my daughters has a full list of words that bother her. Like 50 of them. 

H: Like when people say “anyways.” It’s “anyway.” 

R: Anyways, okay, irregardless of this. One half of, what is the word? Independently.

H: It looks like a sh!tshow. 

R: Yeah, because your whole left side is expressive and your other side is trying to smile. It’s trying to smile with a straight jacket on. 

H: Remember on our first date? When I met you I told you I had just gotten botox. I have it right now and it looks great, but if they go heavy at all on the outside of my forehead, it drops my eyebrows. Do you remember that? It was like that for 2 months. 

R: I was just so excited to meet you.

H: For 2 months I had no expression. 

R: You have such an expressive face though. 

H: Can you tell the difference though? 

R: No, not really. You make a fake pouty face. No, not sexy pouty. Don’t try to be sexy pouty. It’s like fake hurt feelings. 

H: I do that a lot with you.

R: It’s cute. 

H: I don’t pout to get anything but…his hugs. 

R: Your eyebrows make little triangles in the middle. When you have botox, they either don’t work, or this time, your left eye triangle is really good, and the other one stays straight. 

H: What???

R: It looks great

H: Thank you. Back to my forehead. The divot is gone. I have edema on my forehead. 

R: Is any conversation we have going to be serious?

H: I don’t know.

R: Like what did we do right before we left the house?

H: I got a major…have you ever felt deflated? 

R: Nooooooooo, well, I have. I was so rude and unaware. 

H: It was so funny and so pure and so innocent. I’ve known you for a couple of months.

R: We’re passed a few months now. 

H: We’ll save the story of how we met for another episode. 

R: I’m going to tell so many versions of that story. I’ll probably say that I just met you forever ago.

H: Ryan is the nicest, funniest, sweetest human you’ve ever met. I’ve ever met. It’s so true. You’re so good. So good. I love you. We say we love each other. I do love him and I love all of you listening to this. I don’t want to leave anyone out. Ryan, let’s be honest here. I love our Transform shakes.

R: Are we being honest?

H: I’ll say the flavors I don’t love. I don’t love the Chocolate Strawberry that we used to have. Or the Chocolate Orange. I like the Key Lime mixed with things. I freaking love Strawberry Shortcake and Blueberry Cheesecake.

R: I like Cake Batter and Cinnamon Roll.

H: Pineapple Whip. 

R: Protein should not be fruity. 

H: You don’t like it thick, either. I’ve been forcing him to drink it, and “Isn’t it so good?” He’s so nice. I have a million shaker bottles. 

R: Literally. 

H: Ryan gets out a child’s cup and my frother and he froths his. This is his frothing motion. 

R: I don’t do that.

H: Then he gulps it. 

R: Protein shouldn’t be an experience in the morning. Coffee should, but not protein. 

H: What????? 

R: I like your hydration.

H: Everyone listening, let us know. How do you like it? Ryan likes plain whey protein. 

R: I was going to go to Costco to get some of their protein

H: I was like what???? 

R: I like it when you do my voice in a slightly mocking tone. 

H: And then I was like, “Okay sweetie.” I told you we have whey . So I ordered you some that day. We have 4 great flavors. 100 calories and 25 grams of protein. We have Chocolate, Vanilla, Creme Brulee, and Chocolate Dipped Cone. What did I do?

R: You immediately took action.

H: I ordered it right away. I also bought you Core Powers, and those are in the fridge now. I love you and I get it. We’ll make products that you like, too. Ryan, what did YOU order?

R: Nooooo, I just ordered some T-shirts and shorts, and I’m excited about them. I’m a sucker for a good ad. I love social media ads. I love buying from ads. I love marketing. They were supposed to arrive any day. 

H: It’s even more funny if you watch the Ring Doorbell footage, because it caught you at all angles. He’s been waiting for these shirts and shorts everyday. He checks multiple times a day. 

R: So I saw some motion on the Ring Doorbell. It was a huge box not from Amazon. This was it! I pick up the box, this is it! This is it!

H: He goes, “OH MY GOSH, THIS IS IT!” He rips the box open and sees it’s the whey protein powder and goes, “OH LAME!” and walks away. 

R: You were so deflated. 

H: Lame, and you threw the bubble wrap on the table. Lame.

R: I was like a spoiled, ungrateful kid on Christmas. Transform sends you stuff all the time.

H: Every few days. We have to make a Reel out of the Ring camera footage. 

R: It’s so disheartening. I was so sad.

H: You gave me a hug. I went limp.

R: You went boneless. That’s from a TV show called Psych. 

H: I couldn’t lift my head up because I have Fatellar tendons. No, that’s in your knee. I have pismo bands in my neck

R: There’s a Pismo Beach in California. I love Pismo. You were so deflated. 

H: I was laughing. 

R: That morning I had been giving you lots of compliments. I was like, “Oh, I miss you, I really like you, I miss you.” And you go, “Sounds good.” 

H: My mind was on something else.

R: I’m learning that about you. 

H: You told me on the phone, “I miss you, I can’t wait to see you tomorrow.” And I said, “Sounds good.” 

R: You get locked in.

H: A bomb could go off and I won’t notice. 

R: This is so true. A fire? I don’t have time for a fire. The fireman can work around me. I said that I liked you and you said that you liked you, too. 

H: There’s beauty in that. I subconsciously and automatically like myself. 

R: Transform protein is the best protein I’ve ever tried. I like the pure protein, not the meal replacement shakes. I like it straight up chocolate or vanilla. 

H: Dipped Cone is really good. We’re here to answer some questions. Happy birthday, girl M. 

R: Yeah

H: M is so cute. What questions should we go into? I did a Q and A. “How can I help you?” You told me you want to do a podcast where you ask me about Dave.

R: Yeah, 1 million percent. I didn't know anything about you when we met. I knew who you were, but nothing about you. 

H: You started following me last November and became aware of my life. You saw a Reel of mine and you hadn’t realized I wasn’t married to Chris any more. 

R: Yeah, Nov 2024. You did a reel about mixed families. I was 6 years behind your life.

H: You used to live in AZ. We ran in some of the same Crossfit circles. 

R: Exactly. 

H: We didn’t know each other. 

R: We had never met. We were at the same event in 2016 or 2017. 

H: FitCon. I did a panel that year and…

R: You danced. 

H: I did a book signing. 

R: I knew Drew 15 years ago from the Utah Crossfit world.  The gym I went to hosted the event. 

H: People want to know if I miss Dave. 

R: It’s all interesting to me. I didn’t know Dave, but I knew who Rachel was from her first book. 

H: I appreciate a million things about you. I have shared more with you about my life right away than with anyone else.

R: Right away, Heidi.

H: Physically, you are the most attractive person to me on the planet. And I am most attracted to you because of the safety that I feel from you. You make me feel safe. Emotionally and physically, in every way. And that trumps anything any man can give me. No amount of money or flowers or gifts can compare to how safe you make me feel. I was able to share with you parts of me from the very beginning. I knew the moment I met you you would be my best friend. You were my best friend, right away. There was no thought in it. I didn’t even know what you looked like, I had no concept of what you looked like. We won’t go into how we met, but I loved how I could tell you anything and there was no judgement. 

R: Yeah. No, not at all.

H: There’s not one single thing you don’t know about me, and that feels so good. Back to the Dave question, Do I miss Dave? It’s hard for a man to see the connection I had with Dave and how the connection lingers after he passed away. If Dave was alive, and my ex, there wouldn’t be all this grief. He was my best friend. I started dating so soon after Dave died, trying to numb myself from the pain and to feel protected. I went 180 opposite of who Dave was. I didn’t want who I was dating to feel hurt by Dave. Sometimes it would creep out. It’s hard for a man to hear feelings I still have for another man. You genuinely care about how I feel and how I miss him, and what he meant to me. You were so grateful for my experiences with him. Meeting you freed me. You allowed me to post about him. You helped me move through the grief. I was safe. I appreciate you. Do I miss Dave? I will always miss him. You’ve even said you think you and Dave would’ve been friends. 

R: Yeah, yeah. 

H: I will always miss him. My kids will always miss him. I have so much love for who he was in my life. I have so much love for him. I learned from Dave how to feel loved by a man. Just being in your orbit made me feel like I felt with Dave. I felt important for the first time with Dave. The more I’m loved by him, the more I appreciate him.  I missed how he made me feel. I felt unstoppable and alive and activated. I go from missing him to appreciating him. I have so much gratitude for him and for you. Dave would love you and he’d love we are in a relationship. Wherever he is, he’s saying, “Yeah, that’s how I want Heidi.” 

R: You’re you. Cheers to that. Let’s clink our Redbulls . Is this still recording? Yeah. Maybe you need a different title for this episode, I mean, this is really great. Dave was a dynamic person and that was so interesting to so many people. I’m not a therapist or a doctor. Grief is like a partner. It stays with us and can visit us daily in different ways. With reminiscing and sadness it never goes away. Remember when we were glass hunting, and I told you how lucky we’d all be if after we die, somebody spoke about all our best parts. All the good times. All the great parts. We all have ugly parts, and we’d be lucky to have someone keep our name alive. I want someone to do that for me. 

H: After so much time, you just become a thought to someone. 

R: When I looked at your Instagram from when you were with Dave, you looked bright and happy back then. You look like that now. 

H: Really? I looked like that around Dave and my kids. You’re the first person to activate it in me after Dave. The right partner activates the child in me. I have a lot of masculine in me.  

R: I’m not an expert, but therapists talk about when we get pulled into different forms of masculine or feminine energy, it can be unhealthy for us. We don’t want to be pulled too far in one direction. You sit around like a tomboy.

H: I have on a backwards hat and we’re dressed the same. 

R: You have “give me a noogie” energy. You’re like a playful kid. 

H: You activate my feminine softness.

R: Totally. 

H: If there’s a threat, I go back to being masculine.  With you my feminine is activated. 

R: You can see it in pictures. Those look like some good times. Dave and I would've been homies. 

H: He was really funny and fun. The way Dave died was unfair. It all happened the way it was supposed to. It was his choices and all. I want to be a voice for him. I feel bad for his kids, they see things posted online about their dad. I knew him better than anyone.  I got a different version of him than Rachel got, just like you’re getting a different version of me than Chris got. Dave was elevated, sweet, kind, funny, loving, tender, and hurt. He was vulnerable about his hurts and trying to improve his human state. If I could have kept his death from the world, I would have. It wasn’t an accurate picture of him. We wouldn’t be together today.

R: It would have been a fun friend group though. You’ve moved through grief well. I know everything.

H:  Some people from my past ask me if you really know everything. “Does he know that one story?” He knows everything. He even knows more.

R: Same

H: I love that you’re safe enough to tell me your stories. Most people will judge you. I don’t judge. 

R: We all judge. 

H: I don’t feel judged by you. We judge because we have to categorize. Some people shame. I don’t shame, that’s why Dave felt safe with me. 

R: Yeah, you don’t have that energy.

H: Where do you want to go from here? We’re at 52 mins. 

R: I think your audience wants to know if you miss Dave. Do you think about him? What’s it like for you? We should do that question one day. Or we can talk about skin care and peptides.

H: I should ask you how it makes you feel that I still love Dave? I care so much about how it impacts you. My previous relationship was very difficult. You’ve been very honest and very understanding. I know you want to podcast about Dave.

R; I’m highly interested in what makes you you. What got you to this point in your life? We’re not in our 20s. With botox you look in your 30s. What led you up to this point? Wait? What’s the question?

H: If I had an ex boyfriend who was still alive, it would feel different. 

R: Yeah, if he was still alive I’d tell you to go back to him and explore it. I haven’t lost a partner, but I assume it feels unfinished. I don’t feel threatened. If you persistently talked about Dave I’d tell you to go to therapy and that I can’t fulfil you. 

H:  I feel safe sharing. I don’t show you videos of Chris. I don’t celebrate that. I share things with you because you’re my best friend. When someone dies, you forget all the bad. You only remember the good and you put them on a pedestal. I did that with my dad. We’re designed that way. The pain of passing carries a ripple of their good. It fades over time, and with new relationships. As I’ve healed, I’ve focused less on Dave. I don’t have any unfinished business with Dave. I feel like it all happened for a reason. Our soul contract was up for a year prior to his death. I was on a different path than he was. My sadness was in how he died and for how he sounded on the night before he died. I have guilt. Could I have saved him? We knew it wasn’t going to work long term. 

R: We talk about this stuff all the time.

H: The other night I cried.

R: It was on Monday. You had a good cry. We don’t talk about this a lot. 

H I had a big cry. I had a lot of emotion. I had a “high” thought. I wasn’t high, I was very sober, but I thought I could feel all the hurt of all the people of the world. We’re all the same matter, we’re all the same energy. What if I am everyone? What if everyone is me?

R: I love this. We feel it all. We feel all the love and pain and hurt and sadness.

H: That’s what it is. What if we’re stepping inside of something that we already are? I watched the Taylor Swift and Travis reel. It made me cry. I feel like I am Travis and Taylor. I feel like I have a part of what they have.

R: Just not their money.

H: Yet. 

R: They have serious money. And let’s be honest, it’s her money. 

H When we were on TV, the network said they wanted 15% or 20% or 30% of all of our businesses. And we signed it! We owed them money every year until we renegotiated our way out of it in season 3 or 4.

R: Oh yeah. We also want to podcast about that.

H: Do you think when Taylor started dating Travis her team negotiated to take a portion of Travis’ earnings? 

R: She’s so savvy. Why not? 

H: I would think she would have. Travis was all, “Sign me up.” Remember the meme about how Travis used to look like he could be selling base at the 7/11 and now he looks like a guy who cries during intercourse? 

R: That’s what good love does to you.

H: He doesn’t care, he’s Travis Swift.

R: I can’t wait to see SWIFT on the back of his jersey.

H: You told me you’re going to change your last name to Lane.

R: I’ll be Ryan Lane. That’s a sick name. I like my last name.

H: I like your last name, too.  We’re not getting married. We’re just joking, mom

R: Let’s talk about a different episode. We are watching the Biggest Loser documentary. I had so many questions for you about it. We should have people submit questions to you about it. Sorry, I didn’t watch your show.

H: I like that. I didn’t watch my show either. 

R: You’ll show me clips of it and you’ll tell me you don’t even remember being there.

H: No, I don’t. I was asleep. I was in trauma. I didn’t know who I was. Any version of me before 2015 was unaware. I have to pee. Last time we recorded I also had to pee. Houston we have a problem. I opened both doors, and you held my hand so I wouldn’t fall out the door. I peed for 4 mins. Let’s ask chatgpt, because that has to be an unhealthy amount of time.

R: In the middle of you peeing you asked me if you were going to be okay. You thought there was something medically wrong with you and you needed to go to the hospital.

H: I really did. I thought my body was draining more than my bladder. Like a urethra to the rest of my body.

R: Like you were peeing brain fluid. Your urinary tract rerouted to brain liquid. Is there such a thing as brain liquid? 

H: Cerebral fluid. Don’t ask me. 

R: Cerebral?

H: Cerebellum

R: Fluid. There’s a sack of fluid around your brain. It’s protective. This is not medical advice. 

H: We should go back and do these other questions. No, we’ll save it. We’re going to do a Q and A. We’ll have to do a weekly podcast because there’s so many things. 

R: Is there anything else you want to talk about? 

H: I brought you on to ask me questions.

R: You asked your own questions

H: My masculine took over.

R: This is your show.

H: Let’s save the rest for next time.

R: Thanks for picking me up from the airport.

H: I can’t wait to tell everyone how we met.

R: I have some ideas about that.

H: That was crazy

R: You were like, “Is that an octopus?” I was like, “No, it’s literally coral, it’s not even alive.” and then you started laughing and you spilled your coffee.

H: Thanks to everyone listening today. We had fun

R: We always have fun

H: We’ll be back with more. ",7,1759799494.0,hollisUncensored,25,0.82,False

For 8 years ever since we were in High school, I have been in love with a girl. I have confessed my feelings for her 5 times since then and the last confession I made was after our High school era 5 years ago which is like around her debut. Back then I asked her ""What am I to you"" and she said that I was a friend, a good friend that she's happy to cross paths with.

We haven't made contact since then, until I attended a concert with my friend 2 years later and she happened to be there. A surge of memories and feelings overwhelmed me that I went to the bathroom to compose myself. After the concert my friends and her friends went to go get a coffee from a convenience store and talked and she asked me to go and celebrate her birthday at her house. Even though I want to stay away to never ignite those lost feelings, I still agreed to go as a friend.

Birthday comes, it was the usual, foods gifts talks. Until karaoke time, she picks a duet, Until I found you and she passed me the mic, being put on the spot, I instinctively grabbed it. I'm probably reaching but at the time it feels like she's fallen for me. But still I decided to stay away.

This past few weeks, she's been messaging me again sharing her struggles, ofc as a friend I listened. But I noticed it just wasn't struggles she's sharing, but also her personal life, where she's at currently, her midnight snack. rambling about her period cramps etc.

I am a person who values friendships the most and not willing to risk it again for the 6th time (I have to hit pity soon right? jk) I should just wait right if she has developed feelings for me after all these years it's better for her to be the one to confess?

Today a couple comes in, another barista takes their order and then another one ran out their food. A few minutes later the boyfriend comes in (they were seated outside) and was wondering when their pancakes would arrive. I checked their food ticket and was like, “i’m so sorry, it looks like we don’t have any pancakes for this order. i’ll have the kitchen start it and i’ll come out with our POS to charge you.”

i head outside and the girlfriend was pissed, she was like “this is YOUR FAULT, i KNOW i ordered pancakes!!!” i was like “im
so sorry, the ticket didn’t have it on there but let me head inside and print out a receipt. Also note that our manager/owner NEVER comps anything unless dire. if they wanted pancakes they would have to pay for them. 

So, I head inside, pull up the receipt and i do see the pancakes on there!! basically it was a glitch that the entire food ticket didn’t print out. As soon as I printed her receipt I was going to go out there, apologize again and explain the mixup. Also this was all over a time period of about 1-2 minutes. She beats me inside and I was like “hey! i just printed out your receipt. i’m so sorry - the printer didn’t print out the entire ticket but the pancakes are being made and will be ready in a few minutes. she’s pissed but goes to sit back down.

About a minute later the food is ready and i go to bring it to them, apologize yet AGAIN and she flips out on me!!! she was like “this is all your fault, i’m almost done with my food.” and i tried to lighten the mood and i was like “yeah, i know - technology amirite” and she’s like yelling now “YOUR TECHNOLOGY YOU MESSED THIS UP THIS IS YOUR FAULT.” it was like so wild lol. i started to walk away but i was like ya knowwww she can’t talk to me like that. So i turned back around and said, “you know, you really don’t have to be rude about this. a mistake happened, as soon as it was brought to my attention i fixed it. i’m sorry.” and she was like “yeah you guys need to have better technology i shouldn’t have had to come inside to fix this and get something i ordered. i’m the customer, im right, you need to be taking care of me” 

ahhhh she was such a bitch lol. i was like “i did everything i could. i didn’t take your order, i didn’t bring out your food, i had no idea that anything was missing. relax.” i ended up walking away as she was still yelling at me. it’s just the entitlement, man.

in retrospect i probably should have spoken to the barista that took their order to fix things but she was busy and i wanted to get them their food ASAP. no good deed guys lol.",35,1759799068.0,Serverlife,10,0.98,False

I am looking for models(free) for my upcoming Real Person ASMR platforms so FYI these sessions are recorded and free  
I have various routines and you can model as much as you'd like, more content for me is great! If you are not familiar with real person ASMR there are plenty of YouTube videos to check out! Unfortunately I don't have any content yet that I can share but it will be under [https://www.youtube.com/@CalmHandASMR](https://www.youtube.com/@CalmHandASMR) once I get established, that's where you come in :)  
I prefer to come to you and we can of course meet for coffee etc beforehand for both our safety. At this time I am accepting female models only, no exceptions. A little bit about myself...I have been in the medical field for 23 years. I still work in medical but I am branching out with ASMR! I became a fan of ASMR light touch/real person a few years ago and would love to offer these relaxing sessions and gain content so others can enjoy as well.  
I can go more into detail via email and answer any questions you may have but I have to add now, due to previous inquires, that this not a sexual kink, there is/will be nothing sexual involved, no men, no exceptions.  
I am available on weekends, but can do a weekday evening sessions depending on my work schedule. Sessions along, including set up time, are about 2- 2.5 hours at the very most.

What started as one awkward coffee catch-up turned into a regular thing. Now, every Wednesday, a few of us grab a table by the window at Harbour Brew and just talk — nothing serious, just work, weather, random stories. It’s funny how quickly you can fall into a rhythm with people when you stop overthinking it.

There’s Olivia, who works in admin down by the ferry offices, and Mark, who runs one of the hardware stores near the square. Both easy to talk to, both the kind of people who listen without needing to fill every silence. I’ve missed that. We don’t always agree on everything, but the conversation never feels forced. It’s nice. Grounding.

Even work’s felt easier since then. I think having people to talk to outside the office helps put things in perspective. I’m starting to feel like myself again — or at least a better version of that.

Oh, and for anyone wondering: that little bump on the back of my head’s still there, but it hasn’t changed at all. Probably just a small cyst. No pain, no problems, so I’m not too worried.

1o00ujs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1o00ujs/2nd_honeymoon_itinerary_for_november/,2nd Honeymoon Itinerary for November,"Hello, 

We're heading to Paris for our second honeymoon (to celebrate 20 years). This is my 4th time in Paris, and my husband's third. We love to eat, explore, sketch, and we just love art. I've been so busy at work, and I really need to build in some time to just relax. I'd love any thoughts on our itinerary, and if there is anything else I really need to book - we'd like to keep some space flexible. I've made note of what is booked, and anything called reso is a reservation. 

Nov.3 (Mon)

* Arrive at noon (from the West of North America)- taxi into the city (because I'm finally taking a big suitcase instead of a backpack) - check into our hotel in the north of the 9th arr. 
* Afternoon/Evening - no real plans. Get French yogurt, maybe some cheese. Drink coffee, get coffee beans.  Maybe go the Musee Montmartre. We have a few nearby dinner spots in mind. 
* Stay up until at least 8 pm, 9 pm would be a giant win.  

Nov.4 (Tues)

* Wake up in Paris. Be delighted. Eat French yogurt. Make some coffee in the room. Find a boulangerie that's open at 7 am, eat a croissant (or 3). (we are morning people. I will be up early to greet Paris).
*  (8/9am ish)Head towards the Marais (we have old Navigo Decouvrte cards we will load for the week). Maybe go into Notre Dame if we can get tickets or the line is ok. 
* Wander around the Marais ( we have a little route planned). Visit the Musée Carnavalet! 
* Lunch - maybe Le Mary Celeste? 
* Afternoon - wander, sketch, nap, drink coffee, eat pastry.
* Apero - Maybe Bar a Bulles.
* Dinner Reso - Le Coq & Fils for Mac & cheese night! (I discovered this spot in 2016 - but I see it everywhere now) 

Nov.5 (Wed)

* 9am SHARP. LOUVRE!!!!! We have the Amis du Louvre. I haven't booked a time slot - will that be ok?
* Late Morning/early Afternoon - Jardin des Tuileries 
* Lunch - find a Jambon Buerre
* Afternoon - maybe a nap? Or maybe the Arc de Triomphe ( we have the Passion Monuments Pass). I still haven't made it to the Arc. 
* Early Dinner - Ramen in Little Tokyo
* Evening - LOUVRE again!!!

Nov.6 (Thurs)

* 9am - Sainte Chapelle followed by Conciergerie (booked)
* 11:45 - Notre Dame towers (Booked)
* afternoon - rest, eat something
* 4pm - Musee d'Orsay and the John Singer Sargent Exhibit (woohoo!!) (Booked)
* 9 pm - Dinner Reso @ Saisons Restaurant (9th)

Nov.7 (Fri)

* Maybe nothing? Or maybe walking to the second level of the Eiffel Tower, the Musée de l'Armée, and the Rodin. Or maybe sneak to the Louvre for a few hours. 
* Dinner reso - 8 pm - Meha (18th)

Nov.8. (Sat).

* Day trip! We just don't know where. Maybe Provins? Maybe Auvers-sur-Oise? Maybe Fontainbleau? Maybe the Loire Valley on some wine tour bus? Or maybe we just stay in Paris. Who knows. 

Nov.9 (Sun)

* Montmartre Day - Climb the Sacre Coeur, generally wander about and maybe sketch? Be lazy. drink coffee. eat pastry. love Paris. 
* Afternoon - maybe find lunch in the 10th or 11th because I've never been there before?
* Evening - see some of the Christmas lights at the department stores
* 9 pm - Dinner at Canard et Champagne 

Mon.10 (Mon)

* Wide open ( but who are we kidding, I am going back to the Louvre)

Tuesday 

* Eat more pastry. Weep. Fly out at 2 pm.

1o00u3j,https://i.redd.it/5wx0cvog8ltf1.jpeg,"Hanako's OG matchups |""Float to show"" | Beetlejuice vs pennywise (... Vs IT) |","Alrighty another Spooky month matchup! Somehow I do think this one was Already Made..?, soooo if the guy who created this matchup Is seeing this, If you want you can take this as a revamp, anyway, To the  connections, fooolks!

Connections: Both characters are ancient, malevolent, supernatural entities with immense reality-warping powers. They use their abilities to create elaborate, bizarre, and terrifying scenarios to mess with their victims, They are both instantly recognizable figures from horror-comedy with distinct, almost theatrical, costumes:

Beetlejuice: The manic, green-haired ghost in his black-and-white striped suit.

Pennywise: The unsettling, classic-style clown

While they have different ultimate goals, both largely target the vulnerable ones/kids/teens 

Beetlejuice preys on the deceased and the young (like Lydia Deetz) with promises, manipulation, and chaos to achieve his goal of returning to the mortal world.

Pennywise famously preys on children by exploiting their fears and then consuming them
Both characters have a weakness tied to their identity or true nature, which when discovered and/or used correctly, can defeat or banish them.

Beetlejuice must be named three times to be summoned or to gain power in the mortal world, and he can be controlled or banished.

Pennywise (It) is a creature from the ""Macroverse,"" and its true form and immense power are beyond mortal comprehension (the Deadlights). Defeating it requires the ""Ritual of Chüd"" and a strong collective belief/courage that overpowers its essence
They Also, in contrast (?) represent two different sides of the supernatural

Beetlejuice is the Mischievous, Sleazy Spirit: He is a gross, fast-talking ""bio-exorcist"" and ghost who embodies chaotic, dark humor. He wants to live again and wreak havoc

Pennywise is the Cosmic, Malevolent Demon: It's an ancient, Lovecraftian entity that embodies pure, predatory evil and feeds on fear to sustain itself


Both characters are linked to a specific location for their full power
Beetlejuice is often stronger in the mortal world if summoned, especially around the house.
Pennywise is tied to Derry, Maine, where it hibernates and where its ""home"" and physical form exist in the sewers

Both characters rely heavily on a bizarre, theatrical performance to manifest their powers and terrorize others. They are essentially dark showmen

Beetlejuice's ""It's Showtime!"" is his infamous catchphrase, introducing a chaotic, musical-like act of grotesque humor and magic.

Pennywise, the ""Dancing Clown,"" uses a literal circus/clown aesthetic and over-the-top, monstrous pantomime to lure in and paralyze its prey with fear

Their power is intrinsically linked to the mental state of the people around them

Beetlejuice must be believed in to be summoned and to effectively manipulate the living. The original Maitlands struggled to scare anyone because they were merely unseen ghosts; Beetlejuice is hired to make the haunting real and believable

Pennywise thrives on fear; the more the victim is afraid and believes in the monster, the more powerful Pennywise becomes. Courage and a refusal to believe in its power are its key weaknesses

Both Also are creatures from a different dimension/plane of existence.

Beetlejuice is a ghost, an undead creature tied to a bureaucratic, bizarre Netherworld (or Afterlife) system

Pennywise is a creature from the Macroverse and is a cosmic, eldritch horror whose true form (the Deadlights) drives mortals insanely insane!

Both center their activities around breaking down the idea of a safe home or family unit.

Beetlejuice is hired to essentially ""bio-exorcise"" a house, terrorizing a family to force them out of their own home.

Pennywise makes its home beneath the idyllic surface of Derry, Maine, often preying on children who have been abandoned, abused, or ignored by their families and society (Wow.. pretty deep 🖐️😔🖐️)

[[Connections related to the different versions of both]]

Main: 

Beetlejuice: From the 1988 Film's grotesque, dark comedian to the Musical's charming, fourth-wall-breaking anti-hero

It:From the terrifying yet slightly campy 1990 Miniseries (Tim Curry) to the deeply menacing, modernized 2017/2019 Films (Bill Skarsgård)

Youth factor: 
The 1989 Animated Series depicted him as a more mischievous, less malicious figure who was friends with a teenage Lydia

In all versions, Pennywise's main victims are children (The Losers' Club), and he often takes forms related to childhood fears 

They both rely on a human-like, theatrical avatar ,but! possess a deeper, non-human, and horrifying final form that is unveiled when their facade breaks
  
Beetlejuice: When pushed, he abandons the striped suit and transforms into truly monstrous, grotesque forms, such as the giant striped Snake or the monstrous, scarred, large-headed demon.

Pennywise: When his illusions and clown form are shattered, he reverts to his semi-physical giant Spider form (or the Deadlights), revealing a massive, insectile, and truly cosmic horror


Both are highly powerful entities constrained by a ""contract"" or a rule set. They are not simply invincible; they are supernatural beings whose access to maximum power is gated by specific, breakable rules 

Beetlejuice: Though possessing reality-warping and seemingly immense power (often classified as ""God Tier"" or near-omnipotent when unleashed), he is bound by specific, almost arbitrary rules: he must be summoned by his name three times, and his power is often contained to a specific geographical area (the house/graveyard/Saturn afterlife desert)

Pennywise: He is a cosmic entity (The Macroverse) who is nevertheless tethered to the town of Derry, Maine, and appears on a strict 27-year cycle. His power is also directly bound to the belief and fear of his victims; when the Losers' Club loses their fear, his power diminishes 

Both characters are predators operating on the boundary between life and death. One wants to cross back to the living side for power and freedom (Beetlejuice), the other baits the living to cross over to the death side for consumption (Pennywise)

Beetlejuice: He is a self-described ""bio-exorcist"" who manipulates the living by offering them a pathway to the afterlife or freedom from the dead. His main goal is to re-enter the mortal world by marrying a living person (Lydia), showing a constant drive to escape his constrained death state.

Pennywise: He is an ancient cosmic being who takes the form of a physical entity to hunt. He manipulates the living (specifically children) by promising them safe passage into death (""You'll float too""). His main goal is to consume the life force and fear of mortals

Things of interaction potential ____________________________
Scenario: Pennywise tries to lure and feed on Lydia. Beetlejuice, though initially only interested in marrying her, develops a protective, if twisted, affection for her. The two monsters would clash over the living prey, with Beetlejuice fighting to save her (to marry her later) and Pennywise fighting to eat her. This common goal (access to the mortal world/mortal souls) would guarantee an explosive conflict

The Conflict: If Pennywise tries to scare Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice's nature as an undead rogue spirit (who's ""seen The Exorcist 167 times and it keeps getting funnier"") suggests he may be immune to conventional fear. Conversely, Beetlejuice could attempt to reduce Pennywise's terrifying manifestations into an absurd joke, which, as the Losers' Club proved, is a key method for defeating Pennywise

 Dialogues
______________________

IT: 	I know your secret, ghost. You're just a sad little man dressed in a striped suit! I am the Great Cosmic Hunger! I am what you fear when you close your eyes!""

Beetlejuice: (Brushing sand off his suit) ""Nice trick, slick, but two ain't three! And speaking of silly little charms—what are you afraid of? A pack of prepubescent nerds singing about asthma? You get defeated by a loser's confidence?
__________________________________

IT: :	""Behold the source of all terror! The truth of the Void! The Deadlights! Gaze upon eternity and despair as your mind unravels into nothingness!"" (True form-a-shet)

BJ:(Squinting, perhaps putting on mini sunglasses) ""Whoa, whoa, hold the phone, hon! Is that a galaxy? Is that where you've been hiding for a couple millennia? Looks kinda tacky... to be honest. Did you pick that up at a celestial Hot Topic? It needs more green!""	
______________________________________

IT: ""Then I will simply make you irrelevant! You will be forgotten! A flicker of bad animation that no one bothers to summon!""

BJ: 	""Oh no you don't! I've already got my name on the marquee for the next thirty years! You're just yesterday's news, sweetie! Get me a coffee!""

Fighting potential

Examples: 

(Beetlejuice transforms the stage into the after-life waiting room)

Pennywise's ancient mind is baffled by the concept of ""Case Workers"" and ""lines."" He tries to terrify an office worker, who simply looks up, coughs, and says, ""Please take a number, or you'll be penalized 500 years""

Beetlejuice takes on the form of the desk clerk and hands Pennywise a ticket: ""Now serving #666, your complaint about existential dread is important to us. Please wait 1,000 years""

____________________________________


With the environment unstable from Pennywise's rage, Beetlejuice throws them out into the Sandworm Desert. He grows huge, black-and-white spikes from his body, turning into his signature Snake Form

My name is Nick, I'm 28, and I call Texas my home. I try to keep my posts informative, so this may be a long one. Thanks for taking the time to read through it, I promise you won't be disappointed. 

What do I do for work? Well, I work in finance. Specifically on the banking side but still for a massive financial company. I've been in the field for about four and a half years now, but before this, I worked in water damage restoration for another four and a half years. Decided the damage to my body was way too much, went back to college for finance, switched to marketing, ended up staying in finance with a marketing degree. Oh well. 

What do I do for fun? I'd say my most practiced hobby is gaming. I wouldn't say I'm addicted to gaming and putting in 12 hours a day, but most days I'll turn on my PS5 or PC and load something up to kill some time. After that, I'm super into Formula 1. I watch every race I can and even have alarms set to wake me up if a race is going to be early in the morning. Less religiously, I watch football, baseball, and hockey when I'm feeling up for it. I also enjoy reading from time to time, mostly dystopian fiction or poetry. I am involved in the furry community since I have a very good friend who is an artist and I would say this is something slightly important to me. I've somehow gotten myself into Legos recently, I'm an avid coffee drinker, I like trying new restaurants, I drive around the city almost daily looking for a new adventure, I like camping and the outdoors. I'm always busy. Oh, and I also have a cat and she's literally a princess so make sure to pay her your respects and bow in her presence. 

What do I look like? Great question, you actually keep asking great questions. It's impressive how great they are. I'm white, brown hair, brown eyes, 6 feet tall (doctor measured), 6'2 when I put on my boots (not doctor measured). I have 3 tattoos and want more. I go to the gym regularly but I enjoy food too much to call myself ""fit"". 

What am I looking for? I'm not fully ace. I am severely (and sometimes cripplingly (it's a word, trust me)) demi. I struggle to really connect with someone on a deep level but when I do, I'm all in and very connected and that's when the feelings blossom. I want the close and physical and flirting and intimacy, not always centered around sex. I'm also very open to just friends. I need people to talk to and help me get through my days when I'm struggling with boredom. 

If you're interested then I hope to hear from you soon. If not, no worries at all. I hope you find what you're looking for. ",6,1759798475.0,asexualdating,2,1.0,False

A few years ago, I came out of a long relationship that lasted almost a decade. The years since have been about healing, rebuilding, and getting comfortable in my own company again. It’s been a good kind of quiet, the kind where you learn who you really are.

Now that things feel lighter and more settled, I thought I’d open up a little again. Not looking to rush into anything, but it would be nice to meet someone kind, grounded, and real, someone who understands that connection doesn’t need to be complicated to matter.

If you’re also in that space where you’ve done some healing and just want to share good conversation, coffee, and some laughs with no pressure, I’d love to talk. Sometimes the best things start with simple honesty.",1,1759798474.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False
