A 2025 Founder's Guide from Bahrain Bay to Seef District\
\
Alt text: Corporate professionals in a meeting, Bahrain company formation.), many new founders discover the hard way that robust penetration testing isn‚Äôt just a best practice‚Äîit‚Äôs a regulatory must in most sectors. I used to think an SSL certificate and firewalls were enough. I was wrong.\
Bahrain's 2025 Business Landscape\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain‚Äôs EDB attracted more foreign tech firms in Q1 2025 than any other Gulf state. The Sijilat platform has cut licensing time by 45%.\
- The Seef District is now home to more than 2,700 startups (2025, Bahrain EDB).\
- Bahrain Bay continues growing as a fintech and cybersecurity hub.\
- The Diplomatic Area remains the most efficient zone for commercial registration.\
Bahrain‚Äôs 99% foreign ownership policies and streamlined company formation process mean even non-residents can launch with minimal bureaucracy‚Äîif they follow the rules.\
Business Formation Essentials\
And‚Äîthis is where many slip. Bahrain is not the UAE or Saudi: here, the MOICT wants real proof of cybersecurity controls before you‚Äôre fully operational, especially since the 2025 regulatory update. I once watched a founder be denied a commercial registration for forgetting to include a signed penetration test certificate. She waited three weeks for a re-inspection. (Pro tip: Prep your business documents ahead, and email your auditor before your MOICT appointment).\

Why Penetration Testing Is Now Mandatory for Many Bahrain Businesses\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration..\
This goes even further. Certain free zones‚Äîespecially Bahrain Bay‚Äîrequire proof of annual pentesting for data centers and SaaS tenants. The Ministry now audits random tech startups (my team‚Äôs cloud service was audited in March).\
2025 Regulatory Change: The Details\
In 2025, the CBB introduced mandatory reporting of ‚Äúcritical findings‚Äù within 72 hours of a test. Implementation started March 1, 2025; all businesses with a digital presence must now comply.\
What Does Penetration Testing Actually Mean in Bahrain?\
Penetration testing here follows the same global basics: ethical hackers simulate attacks on your digital infrastructure to reveal vulnerabilities.\
- Internal pentest: Simulates an attack from inside the company‚Äîthink compromised employee access.\
- External pentest: Simulates outsider attacks, targeting public-facing systems or websites.\
But here‚Äôs the Bahrain twist: All reports must be signed by a MOICT-approved cybersecurity provider. And, documentation must include both an executive summary and a raw data log.\
\
‚ÄúThe most common mistake? Using an international vendor not approved locally. Had a client lose two months because of this. Avoid it at all costs.‚Äù\
\
Find a provider from the Tamkeen-approved cybersecurity list or use a recommended local firm.\
Step-by-Step: Penetration Testing for Bahrain Business Formation\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
- Cloud-based or storing customer data\
- Operating from a Free Zone (e.g., Bahrain Bay, Bahrain International Investment Park)**\
2. Budget and Plan in Advance\
Cost ranges for penetration tests in Bahrain (2025):\
- Startup SaaS, single web app: BHD 800 ‚Äì 1,200\
- SME with cloud/email: BHD 1,500 ‚Äì 2,000\
- Full enterprise (multiple endpoints, remote branches): BHD 2,500 ‚Äì 4,500\
See more on actual costs and formation fees here.\
\
Insider tip: Schedule your pentest before Ramadan or outside major holiday periods‚ÄîMOICT approval lines are shortest at 8:15 AM Monday to Wednesday.\
\
3. Prepare Documentation (The Shortcut Way)\
\
Ensure your CR application includes a named cybersecurity officer (even if outsourced).\
Have a network diagram and list of user accounts ready.\
Use the Sijilat portal‚Äôs digital upload tool for reports; reduces approval time by 40%.\
\
4. Select the Right Vendor\
Don‚Äôt risk MOICT rejection:\
- Pick only locally registered cybersecurity providers with prior MOICT approvals.\
- Check Tamkeen‚Äôs Cybersecurity Grant‚Äîit can cover up to 50% of pentesting costs.\
5. Submit and Follow Up\
Upload all documents to Sijilat.\
- Attend your MOICT session in the morning (avoid post-lunch queues in Diplomatic Area).\
- Bring both digital and hard copies‚Äîsometimes, the official ‚Äújust wants to see the paper.‚Äù\
\
Pro tip: Greet with ‚ÄúSabah Al-Khair‚Äù and offer to share Arabic coffee during the wait‚Äîit‚Äôs never wasted effort.\
\
Read the full stepwise process for Bahrain company formation.\
How Penetration Testing Intersects With Other Compliance Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.). However, Bahrain‚Äôs compliance climate is stricter for cyber-risk.\
All companies (even those in free zones) must:\
- Maintain audit-ready accounting records (see this guide).\
- Submit annual financial statements and a cybersecurity compliance certificate.\
- For fintechs and SaaS: register with the CBB and submit penetration tests with the annual report.\
\
Tangent: I once spent three days chasing a missing ‚Äúdata privacy attestation‚Äù form for a small e-commerce store. Turns out, you upload it with the pentest results‚Äîone lost document can stall your CR for weeks.\
\
Common Mistake & Prevention Strategy\
A huge error I see: Founders wait until the last minute to book a test, believing approval is instant. It‚Äôs not. Always:\
- Book a pentest slot 4-6 weeks ahead of your CR renewal.\
- Keep a template checklist of every compliance document.\
- Build relationships‚Äîsometimes, a friendly MOICT official will call you if something is missing.\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Penetration Testing in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.)\
- Annual compliance review: BHD 200‚Äì600\
- Sijilat/MOICT filing fees: BHD 25‚Äì100\
And, if you‚Äôre in a free zone like Bahrain Bay, budget an extra BHD 200+ for third-party test attestation.\
\
Time-saving tip: Use Tamkeen funding for up to half the cost, but submit your application on the first week of each quarter‚Äîfunds run out fast.\
\
Bahrain Business Environment: Local Know-How and Customs\
\
Alt text: Professional business support., and always accept offered Arabic coffee during partner meetings‚Äîdeclining can slow negotiations.\
I‚Äôve formed several successful partnerships thanks to early morning chats in the EDB‚Äôs Bahrain Bay offices. And don‚Äôt overlook the value of WhatsApp introductions: a casual message often opens bureaucratic doors more than official emails.\
Importantly, Bahrain‚Äôs system rewards relationships but punishes regulatory shortcuts. Get your paperwork right, and MOICT treats you well.\
Free Zones, Foreign Ownership, and Local Sponsorship\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.), even as a non-resident.\
- Free zones like Bahrain Bay, BIIP, and Bahrain Logistics Zone offer extra digital infrastructure, but enforce stricter annual cyber audits (more info on free zones).\
- Local sponsorship is rarely mandatory for most digital firms (learn more), but helps when you‚Äôre establishing initial contracts or need to speed up government processes.\
My Preferred Providers & Insider Picks\
After testing several, I consistently recommend SecureVault Bahrain for fast, Sijilat-compliant penetration tests. Their reports always pass first time with MOICT and include remediation tips.\
Also: Always keep Tamkeen‚Äôs current approved vendor list handy (Tamkeen website).\
- Common mistake: Picking a cheaper offshore tester‚Äîtheir results will not be accepted.\
Final Tips for Effortless Compliance\
\
Prepare all documents (network diagrams, user lists, business process map) in advance.\
Always use a locally approved penetration testing provider.\
Schedule government appointments in Diplomatic Area for mornings‚Äîavoid Wednesdays after 1 PM to skip the biggest queues.\
Use Tamkeen grants to cut costs, but apply as soon as new funds are available.\
Build real relationships‚Äîespecially with your Sijilat case worker.\
\
And never forget: one missing cyber compliance certificate can delay your Bahrain company launch for weeks.\
\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Penetration Testing and Company Formation\
1. Is penetration testing mandatory for all Bahrain businesses?\
\
Not all, but any company handling client data, payments, running SaaS, or regulated by the CBB must conduct annual penetration testing. Check your business type‚Äôs requirements at company formation structures.\
\
2. How much should I budget for penetration testing?\
\
BHD 800‚Äì4,500 depending on company complexity. Use this cost calculator and breakdown for exact numbers.\
\
3. Can I use a foreign penetration testing service?\
\
Only if they‚Äôre registered locally and MOICT-approved. Otherwise, your results will be rejected. Always verify current approval status with Tamkeen or ask MOICT directly.\
\
4. When is the best time to apply for Commercial Registration and compliance?\
\
Early morning, Sunday‚ÄìTuesday, avoiding Ramadan and national holidays. Prepare scanned and hard copies of all cyber documents before your MOICT session for fastest turnaround.\
\
5. What are the biggest mistakes to avoid during company formation?\
\
\
Submitting incomplete cyber documentation.\
Not budgeting for annual pentesting.\
Picking a vendor not on the approved local list.\
\
\
Set up your accounting and compliance systems from day one to avoid surprises during renewal.\

I now feel like something is missing when I run out of it. 

I have always been an energy drinks/coffee kinda gal. Sometimes zero sugar, sometimes not, don‚Äôt care. I bought so many 5hr energy shots they started giving it to me for free at the gas station. Those have 200mg of caffeine in them and I was never as obsessed as I am with my 30mg caffeine diet cokes. When I run out of those I get kinda cranky and an energy drink or a coffee just doesn‚Äôt cut it as a replacement, meaning it‚Äôs NOT the caffeine that I‚Äôm craving. 

It‚Äôs not just me. Everyone I know who likes Diet Coke is completely obsessed with it and it becomes part of their personality. MatPat from game theory would be a more famous example of this but so many people in my personal life are the same way. People with Diet Coke magnets and Christmas ornaments because they adore it so much and it becomes like their ‚Äúthing‚Äù or their ‚Äúbit.‚Äù

1nalq7k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nalq7k,My experience raising clearwing hawkmoths (≈åsukashiba) üêõüíï,"Hi! It‚Äôs my first time posting in this sub so let me know if I got anything wrong, but after seeing another post talking about these beautiful creatures I thought I‚Äôd share my own experience raising/hatching them.
****Long post ahead, sorry!!****

I‚Äôm located in Yokohama, Japan where summers are very long (from June to October) with temperatures around 30-37¬∞C and humidity of 70-90% every day. Summer is miserable for me personally haha but seems to be the perfect condition for these little guys so keep that in mind if you want to raise them indoors.

I found several names for them online (pellucid hawkmoth, hummingbird hawkmoth, coffee clearwing) but here we call them ≈åsukashiba („Ç™„Ç™„Çπ„Ç´„Ç∑„Éê) which translates to ‚Äúbig/great clearwing‚Äù so that‚Äôs what I tend to use when I talk about them in english. (my husband likes to call them flying fried shrimp because of their tail üç§ haha) 

The first time I ever encountered one was in a park in Tokyo last year, and I have been obsessed with them since then. After a bit of research I found that they like Gardenias and I tried planting some in my yard earlier this year. I didn‚Äôt expect to successfully attract so many of them, but I now have mama hawkmoths visiting every day and laying eggs in my gardenias. 

Most of them didn‚Äôt get to turn into moths though and would be picked up by wasps and birds, so I decided to try and raise a few myself indoors.
I couldn‚Äôt find any info in english for taking care of this particular species, so I decided to document everything myself while getting help from blog posts in Japanese.

‚ú®üêõ Life of a clearwing hawkmothüêõ‚ú®: 
It takes them about ten days to hatch from their egg, and they‚Äôll immediately eat the empty shell before moving onto leaves and eat more. From then they‚Äôll keep eating and eating (and pooping a lot lol) and will only stop when going through molts. 

When it‚Äôs time for them to molt, they‚Äôll try to find a safe space (usually behind/under a leaf) where they can stay still for 15-20 hours. They first shed their face (which looks like a really cool mask), then their skin. It takes them about two weeks to go from super tiny to very chonky caterpillar üêõ 

After their last molts they‚Äôll keep eating for another 2-3 days, then they‚Äôll turn completely brown (I suppose to camouflage better?) and will look for dirt. Once they get into the dirt they first loosely wrap silk around a small area to make a safe little space/chamber for themselves and then start making their cocoon inside that space.

After pupating for 15-20 days, they‚Äôll hatch from their cocoon (during the night, while it‚Äôs still dark outside) and quickly look for something to climb onto to inflate and dry their wings. It‚Äôs a really cool process to see but it takes them several hours. Then, once their wings are fully grown they still have dust on them and they‚Äôll start vibrating to get all the dust off. At this point it‚Äôs still early morning and the sun is starting to rise. The last step for them is to release some type of liquid (leftover from their pupal stage) and then they‚Äôre ready to fly away :) 


So far I‚Äôve raised four of them, and it always feels a little bittersweet saying goodbye to them, I get so attached to my little baby cats/moths ü•∫
But watching them fly away after witnessing everything they had to go through is also incredibly fulfilling <3 

Thank you for reading all that if you did haha, sorry if I got some of the lingo wrong I‚Äôm new to moths in general and english isn‚Äôt my native language.
Anyway I just hope I get to spread more knowledge and love for these precious little creatures, they mean so much to me üêõüíï",1,1757225490.0,moths,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúThat email was very harsh and I‚Äôm sorry. It came from a place of fear and shock.

First off, my anxiety levels have tanked. I‚Äôm in a high stress job - one that I routinely have trouble going to sleep with because my mind tends to race a mile a minute about all the stuff that could go wrong/is going wrong and fixate which has caused a lot of sleep issues over the years. Two weeks off and I‚Äôm falling asleep very easy at this point - mind not racing nearly as much and my dreams are super intense right now as well which has been interesting.

Second, my mood has improved. So much so that my wife has commented on the difference. I‚Äôm no longer getting my very, very routine 2-3PM mega crash which kills my energy, mood, etc and my energy instead has been just very stable throughout the whole day.

Third, I‚Äôve been more patient and reasonable in situations I def have previously blown up in (at least internally).

Anyways, I know it‚Äôs a lot. And it seems like most people, from reading here, don‚Äôt see these results so quickly (I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs more like 3 months+) .

1nalnbx,https://youtu.be/UslhbeLYL7c,Five Nights At Freddy's Haunted House Halloween Horror Nights 2025 Universal Studios Hollywood,"Guests will fight to survive as they venture through an all-new haunted house inspired by the 2023 hit film ‚ÄúFive Nights at Freddy‚Äôs,‚Äù Blumhouse‚Äôs highest-grossing movie to date and an adaptation of the horror videogame phenomenon.  
  
Guests will follow in the footsteps of Mike, who was recently fired and desperate for work so that he can keep custody of his little sister, after he agrees to accept a position as a night security guard in an abandoned themed entertainment center: Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizzeria. The terror will start as guests navigate the corridors and learn that nothing at Freddy‚Äôs is what it seems when they encounter the supernatural and become lured into the black heart of an unspeakable nightmare.  
  
The journey will bring guests face-to-face with full-scale replicas of the eerie characters from the film‚ÄîFreddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake‚Äîas they stalk visitors through iconic scenes, including the security room and the showroom where the chilling characters performed. The larger-than-life characters for the haunted houses were created in collaboration with Jim Henson‚Äôs Creature Shop, who also masterfully produced the animatronics and corresponding costumes for the fan-favorite film.  
  
Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs (FNaF) is a multimedia franchise created by Scott Cawthon, encompassing video games, novels, graphic novels, and films. The overarching narrative typically centers on a night security guard or similar character who must survive from midnight to 6 a.m. over five levels‚Äîknown as ‚Äúnights‚Äù‚Äîwhile avoiding attacks from homicidal animatronic characters possessed by the spirits of children murdered by a psychopathic serial killer. Each installment is set in a different location tied to the fictional pizza chain, Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza. Core gameplay emphasizes resource management and the strategic use of tools to evade capture by the animatronics.  
  
The concept originated after Cawthon‚Äôs earlier family-friendly title, Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., was criticized for unintentionally frightening character designs that resembled sinister animatronics. Taking this feedback, Cawthon deliberately crafted a horror game that leaned into the unsettling nature of animatronics. Released in August 2014, the first Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs quickly gained massive popularity, spawning numerous sequels. Cawthon developed most of the early games independently using the Clickteam Fusion engine, later collaborating with Steel Wool Studios on additional entries, including an open-world adventure and a virtual reality anthology. Other spin-offs have been produced in partnership with companies such as Illumix and Mega Cat Studios.  
  
Though critical response has been mixed‚Äîpraised for its storytelling, atmosphere, and lore but often criticized for repetitive gameplay‚Äîthe franchise has enjoyed overwhelming commercial success. It has generated a wide range of internationally distributed merchandise and built a passionate cult following that continues to create extensive fan media inspired by the series.

1nalk4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nalk4m/my_30sf_neighbour_50sm_and_his_wife_are_creeping/,My [30sF] neighbour [50sM] and his wife are creeping me out,"Let me start by saying I‚Äôve only recently started prioritising my own feelings and gut instincts, after a lifetime of people pleasing and difficulties with boundaries. I‚Äôm in therapy and in a good place. I have a great relationship with my husband, who thinks what I‚Äôm doing is right. I am posting for advice on how to continue prioritising what I want while not making things awkward when I run into my neighbours.

My husband and I have moved into an apartment complex in a country where people are generally friendly (it‚Äôs an Asian country). I don‚Äôt want to create deep and intense friendships with neighbours because I like my space, and my husband is super introverted, so I like to keep interactions with neighbours easy. I typically end up meeting neighbours while out for a stroll. My husband sometimes joins me but most times it‚Äôs just me. 

I met my neighbour A in May because he and his wife B have some really nice specialised equipment (no details in case he/they find this post). We chatted on and off - I felt they were much more keen on meeting me but I chalked it up to middle age loneliness. They also have no kids or family around. I also feel oddly guilty for potentially confusing them at this time because I spoke to them on and off and wonder if this led them on? For example, B was sick and I gave her some fruit, and I shared a piece of music I‚Äôd been working on. But I have also been very up front about being busy with work and life so our interactions haven‚Äôt been consistent. 

The more I thought about it, the more I realised our interactions have left me really creeped out or worried. Here is an illustrative list of things that have happened 

- A called me early one morning and said he and B were at a store and had found the very specific equipment I was looking for, and then when I showed up at the store admitted that he lied so I‚Äôd come out to meet them
- He‚Äôs said unflattering things about B in her absence a few times, and I made my discomfort visible. Twice he said she wasn‚Äôt earning enough, once he complained that she was resisting doing something and that her reasons were dumb, and he said she is irritable and has huge anger management issues.
- I‚Äôve recently stopped interacting with them as much and B asked me to message A and recommend a specific product to him, which was weird because she could tell him herself, and A separately ran into me and passive aggressively asked me if I‚Äôd forgotten about him. I feel like they‚Äôve spoken about this. 
-A asked me why I wouldn‚Äôt hang out with him and his wife instead of my own family like my mom, who I‚Äôve already spent so much time with (?!)
- A met me and another neighbour for coffee (not my idea), and then told me I looked beautiful sitting under a potted plant
-A occasionally fishes for compliments, essentially asking me to confirm that he is one of the few neighbours I meet
-Hes also shared my music with other neighbours (I don‚Äôt care, I just thought it was odd). And why would he talk about me in my absence?

What I find baffling is that his wife doesn‚Äôt seem to be very bothered by what she sees. 

I also catch him looking at me at wider gatherings for just a couple of seconds too long. All of this makes me feel like he has already crossed or wants to cross some boundaries. 

My plan is to scale back all interactions and say I‚Äôm busy. But I find his wife‚Äôs encouragement really weird and I want to find a way to keep the peace since I run into them all the time. I‚Äôm also getting angry that they feel so entitled to my time. Please help me

TLDR - my neighbour is really intense and clingy and I don‚Äôt know how to reduce interactions while keeping things breezy.

Another issue is that I'm struggling to handle the DM inquiries from all over the world asking to sell large quantities of authentic Japanese matcha. So why did matcha become popular? It's because people who previously didn't like coffee or tea finally found a caffeinated beverage that suited them, leading to a sudden surge in matcha fans.

1nalapu,https://i.redd.it/x92zz70zkonf1.jpeg,"[Date] - Salamat Reddit, Tita Edition","So eto na nga mga accla, 3 weeks ago I posted my eme about moving on. Sa totoo lang waley akong balak makipaglandian lately gusto ko lang ng kausap. Last week nay hanash naman ako gusto kong magtanan, alam mo lungkut-lungkutan ang eme ni Tita. The next day may nag-DM napansin nya pala. 

It started with a hi and maraming kwento after. Tapos somewhere along the way nag-agree kami na magkita. Oo, ganito kasi hwag nyo naman patagalin ng linggo or buwan ung talking stage kung meron naman chance. At least di sayang ang panahon, di ba? 

We both agreed sa isang hotel kami magkita and funny hindi ako nagbihis. Naiisip ko kung sakali na di nya ako bet, nakarunning outfit ako pwede ko ng itakbo ang sama ng loob ko. Gugulangan ko pa sa dulong couch ako umupo, pero jusko ako pala ung masusurprise. I was about to message when suddenly someome sat beside me. Ayun nauna kong napansin ung kicks nya, ung watch nya na parehas kami and lastly ung face nya. Napalunok ako ng laway while looking at her, then I smiled. I reminded myself, uuy kalmahan mo girl alam ko yan ung mga type mo. She wasnt wearing no makeup but she looked like someone who came from a kdrama, ang ganda nya! May mga bloopers in between so I noticed her anxiety, so instead na kumain naglakad kami. 

The walking broke the tension between me and her. Tapos nagtawanan kami ulit when I said "" girl hwag kang tulak ng tulak malapit na ako masagasaan"" but that moment i missed the opportunity to ask her if I can hold her hand. Bumalik kami sa hotel kumaim at nagkwentuhan ng marami pang mga bagay. But like any other story when midnight striked we bid our goodbyes. 

Until one morning habang nagbibihis ako may nagmessage ""andito na ako baba"" followed by a call. Ayun nakahazard sya susunduin nya ako. Totoo lang nataranta ako that moment, ayoko ng surprises pero nung ginawa nya kinilig ako. Iba pala no kapag type mo? And it hits differently when you are the one receiving the effort like hatid+coffee. 
And oo nga pala sobrang taranta lo di ko napansin na baliktad ung long sleeves ko, the only time I notice it kasi nga I was looking for the pocket na. 

All day nakasmile ako, kahit ang dami kong work. I cant help but to think how bless I am to have someone showering me that kind of attention. Mapapatanong ka na lang deserve ko ba to? 

The next day, eto na naman sya. 30 mins or more naghihintay sa akin so we can have dinner. As I looked at her I began asking myself ano kaya nakita nito? Gorgeous is an understatement to her beauty lalo na kapag nakasmile, smart, witty, funny, and very much settled in life. Ang sarap nyang kasama at ang dali nyang mahalin. 

Yesterday, wala sa plano but when she heard I was elbowed in the face and bumagsak sa field she went there to check and drop me home. Major kilig ang Tita nung natanaw ko from the field sya, sabay kantsaw ng teammates ko ""haba ng hair mo"". 

3 weeks ago moving on ang drama ko to some it takes time to heal. Pero I realized the day that I met her here, I stopped thinking about my ex and those what if and that helps. Moving on is painful pero mas madali if u can verbalized it. Mas masarap din to be with someone who will listen and make you feel special. 

Lesson, we find love in a hopeless place. Salamat Reddit for being letting me meet her. Hindi ko alam how our future holds but I am cashing in every minute of it. 

And to my person, Boss, thank you never failing to put a smile on my face everyday kasi ""nakaka-addict ka"". Pinapataba mo ko üòÜ

1nala7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nala7r/caffeine_induced_short_psychosisdelusional/,Caffeine induced short psychosis/delusional episodes?,"I (F21) have been completely fine mental health/physical health wise my whole life. I had coffee for the first time when I was 20 and have never really drank soda or any other caffeine beverages before. This year earlier in spring of this year I was very tired (working on finals for online college classes), I had coffee earlier in the day. Literally everything was going fine but then when I looked at my boyfriend sitting next to me I randomly was hit with this crazy wave of anxiety and suddenly felt like he was replaced with an imposter.

Logically I knew he was still my boyfriend and something was just wrong with me. I acted normal as best I could but felt intense anxiety about the situation. It eventually wore off and I didnt feel it again until a few weeks ago (months after the first episode) when we were face-timing and it happened again.

I was very tired but don't remember if I had any caffeine that day. It was the same as before when I had a crazy anxiety wave but just got up and got some ice so I could hold it/put it on my face. I dont know what to do so I just treat it like a panic attack but Ive never really gotten them so I dont know the best way to treat it. The imposter feeling does eventually go away once the anxiety fades away as well. It finally happened again today but with my roommate this time. Again i am very tired and had a double shot coffee earlier today. This time it wore off pretty quickly after I let my anxiety ride out.

Does anyone have any clue what this could possibly be from? I cant emphasize enough that I have, and have never had, any other symptoms of psychosis or delusions at all. Its just been these three times. I'm hesitant to suggest capgras just because I am fully aware that the issue is with me and my boyfriend in this case is still my boyfriend even when I have the imposter feeling. And capgras seems more like a dementia or schizophrenia type side effect. I read somewhere that caffeine could cause these types of things but its weird that its the exact same anxiety and imposter feeling everytime. It's just a scary feeling and I don't know where to go from here as I dont want to bring it up since I feel and act normal 99% of the time otherwise.",1,1757223908.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1nal8ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1nal8ot/mini_barndominiums_that_maximize_every_inch/,Mini Barndominiums That Maximize Every Inch,"Creative Design Ideas for Mini Barndominiums That Maximize Every Inch
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a mini barndominium offers a unique blend of rustic charm and modern convenience. With limited square footage, smart design choices can transform even the smallest spaces into functional and beautiful homes. Here are creative design ideas to maximize every inch of your mini barndominium.

### Open Floor Plans for Enhanced Flow

Opting for an open floor plan is a top strategy for making the most out of your space. By minimizing walls between areas such as the living room, kitchen, and dining area, you create an airy and expansive feeling. This design allows natural light to travel more freely, brightening every corner.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

Invest in furniture that serves multiple purposes. Consider a sofa bed that converts into a sleeping area for guests or a coffee table with storage underneath. Here are some ideas:

- **Murphy Beds:** Fold down into a wall, liberating floor space when not in use.
- **Extendable Dining Tables:** Perfect for cozy dinners or larger gatherings.
- **Shelves with Desks:** A desk that folds down can double as a workspace and additional shelf space when needed.

### Vertical Storage Solutions

Utilizing vertical space is crucial when square footage is limited. Consider these storage solutions:

- **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Use them in every room from the kitchen to the living area. They draw the eye upward and can hold decorative items or books.
- **Tall Cabinets:** A tall pantry or cabinet can store goods while taking up minimal floor space.
- **Hooks and Pegboards:** In the entryway or kitchen, they keep items off surfaces and within reach.

### Creative Use of Loft Spaces

If your barndominium has a higher ceiling, consider creating a loft area. Lofts can serve as additional sleeping quarters, play spaces, or an office. Just be sure to include a sturdy ladder or staircase for easy access. A loft can breathe new life into your mini barndominium while saving valuable floor space.

### Natural Light

Letting in plenty of natural light not only enhances the mood but also makes spaces feel larger. Here are some practical tips:

- **Skylights:** Install in the main living area or kitchen to brighten up the interior.
- **Large Windows:** Opt for oversized windows or sliding glass doors to connect the indoors with the outdoors.
- **Light-Colored Walls:** Light shades reflect more light and create the illusion of a more spacious area.

### Smart Kitchen Design

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, and it can also be a tricky area to design in a mini barndominium. Here are some innovative kitchen ideas:

- **Compact Appliances:** Choose smaller, energy-efficient appliances that fit your space while still being functional.
- **Kitchen Islands:** A small kitchen island with wheels can provide extra counter space and storage.
- **Open Shelving:** Instead of closed cabinets, open shelves can make your kitchen feel lighter and more spacious.

### Outdoor Integration

A mini barndominium can benefit immensely from outdoor living space. A well-designed porch or patio can serve as an extension of your indoor living area. Consider adding:

- **Outdoor Seating:** Comfortable furniture that invites relaxation.
- **Vertical Gardens:** Growing herbs or flowers on walls can enhance aesthetics and provide fresh ingredients.
- **Fire Pit Areas:** A cozy place for gathering in the evenings.

Maximizing your mini barndominium‚Äôs space doesn‚Äôt just rely on creative decisions; it‚Äôs about making each choice count. By incorporating these design strategies, you can create a delightful home that feels spacious, functional, and uniquely you.

Essential Space-Saving Solutions for Mini Barndominiums
-------------------------------------------------------

When living in a mini barndominium, smart space-saving solutions can greatly enhance your living experience, making every inch functional and enjoyable. With thoughtful design strategies, you can achieve a cozy yet spacious atmosphere, maximizing your space effectively. Let‚Äôs explore various innovative ideas and approaches to help you make the most of your mini barndominium.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

One of the best ways to save space is by investing in multi-functional furniture. These versatile pieces can serve more than one purpose, which is perfect for small spaces. Consider the following options:

- **Sofa Beds:** During the day, a stylish sofa provides seating, while at night, it transforms into a comfortable bed for guests.
- **Ottoman Storage:** Ottomans can be used for footrests or additional seating, and many offer hidden storage for blankets, games, or seasonal items.
- **Foldable Tables:** Folding dining or workspace tables can be expanded when needed, then collapsed to free up floor space.

### Wall-Mounted Solutions

Utilizing wall space is essential for creating an open and airy feel in a mini barndominium. Here are some wall-mounted solutions that can enhance storage without taking up precious floor space:

- **Floating Shelves:** These can hold books, d√©cor, or kitchenware while keeping the floor clear and maintaining a minimalist look.
- **Wall Hooks:** Adding hooks in entryways or kitchens can provide a place to hang coats, bags, or utensils, preventing clutter.
- **Wall-Mounted Desks:** A fold-down desk can provide ample workspace when needed and be tucked away when not in use.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Maximizing storage is key in a mini barndominium. Here are some creative storage ideas that make the most of your available space:

- **Under-Bed Storage:** Use containers or drawers under your bed to store out-of-season clothes, shoes, or extra linens.
- **Vertical Storage:** Tall shelves and cabinets can utilize vertical space, allowing for more storage capacity in a smaller footprint.
- **Stackable Bins:** For areas like closets or garages, stackable bins can help organize items without taking up more horizontal space.

### Open Floor Plans

Embracing an open floor plan can create a sense of spaciousness in your mini barndominium. When rooms flow seamlessly into each other, it prevents the feeling of confinement. Here are some tips to achieve this:

- **Remove Non-Load-Bearing Walls:** If feasible, removing walls can open up the living space, creating a larger area that encourages light flow.
- **Use Area Rugs:** Define spaces with different area rugs, which can help separate the living, dining, and kitchen areas without the barrier of walls.

### Creative Nooks

Making use of every nook and cranny can add both charm and utility to your mini barndominium. Here‚Äôs how to turn little spaces into functional areas:

- **Reading Nook:** A small corner with a comfy chair and shelf can transform an otherwise unused area into a personal retreat.
- **Workstation:** An unused alcove can serve as a mini-office with a small desk and essential office supplies.

With these essential space-saving solutions, your mini barndominium can feel both spacious and cozy. The key lies in your ability to think creatively and strategically about how you design and furnish your space. By adopting a mindset that embraces multifunctional and space-efficient designs, you can transform your barndominium into a harmonious living environment that caters to your lifestyle.

### Conclusion

When it comes to mini barndominiums, every square inch counts. Embracing creative design ideas can turn modest spaces into functional and stylish homes. Consider open floor plans that allow for seamless flow between areas, making the most of your limited space. Use multi-functional furniture, such as a dining table that doubles as a workspace or a sofa bed for guests, to ensure that no room feels cluttered or underused.

In addition to thoughtful design, incorporating essential space-saving solutions is key to maximizing your mini barndominium. Built-in storage solutions like under-bed drawers and wall-mounted shelves can help keep your living areas organized and tidy. Folding furniture is another great option if you need extra room for activities or guests‚Äîthink collapsible chairs and tables that can be stowed away when not in use.

Utilizing vertical space also plays a pivotal role in making small areas feel more open. Tall cabinets or stacked open shelves draw the eye upward, creating an illusion of height while providing ample storage. bright color palettes and strategic lighting can enhance the feeling of spaciousness, making even the coziest barndominium feel like a bright, welcoming home.

With these creative ideas and space-saving solutions, you can craft a mini barndominium that not only meets your needs but also reflects your style. By focusing on smart designs and efficient use of space, you‚Äôll create a home that feels much larger than its square footage suggests. Whether you're designing a new living space or optimizing your current layout, remember that maximizing every inch can lead to a remarkably satisfying living experience.",1,1757223746.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1nakyfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1nakyfc/reese_talks_about_the_meaning_of_her_tattoo_and/,Reese talks about the meaning of her tattoo and defies doctor's orders,"In tonight's stream, Reese Quibell discussed the meaning of her Outshine the Fox tattoo, worried her fans by defying her doctor's orders and talked about how devastated she'll be when her elderly dog dies.   
  
At least two chatters who give money and/or other gifts to Reese sent superchats tonight using the phrase awesome sauce. Those fans are playing along with the ""joke"" that Reese started last night saying that there are forbidden phrases and topics in her chat, but people can bring them up as long as superchats are involved. ""You have to pay to say,"" Reese says.   
  
It reminds me of when Reese asked people to remind her to charge her computer mouse and she preferred for those reminders to be in the form of superchats. That was a defining red flag that caused at least one longtime Relatable Reese supporter to leave her channel.   
  
Reese starts talking about an expensive health crisis that one of her Zoom caller's dogs has been going through and adds that her Zoom calls also follow the struggles and stories of some other fans who pay Reese $25 or $50 a month. The dog her Zoom caller loved had to be put down and Reese asks everyone to send prayers or caring thoughts to that fan.   
  
Chatters are telling Reese they love her Outshine the Fox tattoo. Reese asks where the nurses in her chat are. Her chatters start talking about how much they adore their pets and how hard it has been to lose some of the animals they love so much.   
  
Reese is holding her elderly dog and she says Gertie is a huge part of her life and she cherishes her but it's hard to see Gertie age. She repeats how Finn, the very sick stray cat that Reese brought home for about two months, was the Relatable Reese mascot and so many people in her chat sent food, treats, toys and money to her for Finn and her other pets.   
  
Reese shouts out one fan who sent her a check for $100 after Finn was put to sleep. Reese claims she told that fan she didn't need her money but the fan sent it anyway. That's a con artist's tactic that Tommy taught Reese. We heard it on the Long Con video.  
  
Reese claims that the love and time fans invest in her, H and her pets are as meaningful to her as superchats, gifts and cash. She says when Gertie dies, everybody in the Relatable Reese community will pull together to mourn the dog's passing and comfort Reese. ""I will be absolutely a wreck,"" she says, alleging that she's trying to mentally prepare for it.   
  
Reese said last year that when she gets Gertie's teeth cleaned, she will need her therapist and her chat on standby in case there are any complications or Gertie dies during the procedure. She says she got Gertie Oct. 1, 2016. She's probably going to try to turn that into another anniversary or celebration for her channel to send her presents and superchats.   
  
Reese talks about her 95-year-old husband's death and his last words. She's really trying to pull on people's heartstrings tonight. She mentions more than once how Gertie was thrown out of a car and badly injured before Reese adopted her.   
  
Reese asks again where her nurses are and says she's supposed to be taking Rybelsus every other day to get the correct new dosage but she has taken it two days in a row to get it back into her system. ""Whoa, I think that was a mistake,"" she says. She claims she puked her guts out this morning and she hadn't had anything to eat so she just spewed coffee. Then she felt fine so she and her mom went shopping in Wartrace and then went to lunch. She didn't feel right after eating lunch either, she says.   
  
Reese complains pretty often that she never gets to go out to eat, but she eats at restaurants quite often with fans or her mom or H. I'm 99 percent sure that when she goes to a restaurant with fans or her mom, she doesn't pay for her own meals.  
  
A nurse in the chat confirms for Reese that it was a mistake for her to take Rybelsus two days in a row if she's only supposed to take it every other day. Reese says it was a big mistake because she's still taking the highest dose that doctors prescribe. She's taking 14 milligrams but then says she has a 2-year-old bottle of 3-milligram Rybelsus samples that a doctor gave her. Reese briefly considers taking some combination of the 3-milligram pills and then says that would screw everything up and she'll just follow her doctor's orders to take the highest dose every other day.   
  
Reese said last night that Rybelsus made her sick when she first started taking it, so it's telling that Reese wanted to take more of it when she has been off that medication completely for a month. She had to know she could make herself sick and possibly even cause herself pancreatitis by taking that much all of a sudden. Reese is trying to worry her fans about her health again. R  
  
eese says she wonders if she should even stream on Fridays or Saturdays because so few people show up to those livestreams now. That sounds like sadfishing for superchats and like she wants people to say how much they love her weekend streams. She shouts out the name of someone she hasn't seen in her chat recently and says she's concerned about a couple of people she hasn't seen lately. That's a cue for people in Reese's chat to try to find those fans and ask them why they haven't been showing up to Reese's livestreams.   
  
""If you went back to fix the mistakes you've made, you would erase yourself,"" Reese says. That's the quote she wants to discuss tonight.   
  
More than a few chatters are concerned that Reese's doctor isn't giving her 7-milligram Rybelsus pills that she can take every day. A nurse superchats her about it and Reese admits ""I'm just a dumb bum"" who decided on purpose not to follow her doctor's orders.   
  
She has a bunch of 14-milligram pills left and they're expensive so she doesn't want to waste them. Her doctor told her to take one every other day and Reese had said last night that she needs fans to remind her to take it every other day so she gets the proper dosage. Some chatters are reminding her that getting a higher dose of Rybelsus in her system could cause a flare-up of pancreatitis. Reese likes to play dumb so people get worried and send her superchats, texts or Facebook messages to check on whether she's doing what she knows she should do to take care of herself.   
  
Reese is concerned about her dosage of Rybelsus because since she stopped taking it, she has been gaining weight and she's hungry, she says. She was planning to take the highest dosage three days in a row in hopes that she wouldn't be hungry anymore, she says, but then she puked this morning and jokes that she thought she was pregnant and then remembered that was impossible. Reese says her cooter is still confident that she will have sex again.   
  
The nurse sends a few more superchats. She's been giving more money to Reese lately and Reese didn't schedule her stream with questions about God and the Bible until she knew that this nurse could attend.   
  
A chatter asks if Reese's labs were OK while she was off Rybelsus. Reese says no and she didn't get them checked for that reason. ""My vision is blurry as hell and I'm sure my sugars are insane,"" she says, adding that she ate way too many Ritz crackers and Oreos because she was mad at her pancreas. Does Reese not check her blood sugar levels at home? I thought the doctor she saw before her Nashville meet-up prescribed her a new monitoring device.

Reese says that Christy, the woman whose daughter owns Southern Goods Mercantile and who was on a livestream with Reese recently that Reese deleted, asked her today if Reese would like to have a booth there with some of her clothes in it. ""I've got like six closets full of clothes ready to go,"" Reese says she told her. She says she has a lot of handbags and Golden Goose shoes. Reese asks if anyone knows why she bought so many pairs of Golden Goose tennis shoes. ""I'm so sick of them,"" she says. Then she says she loves them and they jazz up an outfit like no other.   
  
A male fan of Reese's joins the $25-a-month Relatable Reese membership level. Reese tells him that she knows he has some financial stuff going on and she didn't expect him to do that. Reese claims she always tries to tell people on her Zoom calls that if they need to cancel their memberships, that's fine because she knows how it feels not to have much money either.   
  
A chatter tells Reese her shows are addicting. ""How is this addicting? I wouldn't watch me,"" Reese says. I wonder if Reese realizes that she's insulting her audience by saying things like that.   
  
She talks again about Jude Francis jewelry and says her mom loves it, but it's very expensive. Reese says she'd love for a rich person to buy her some of it. Reese says she's mad at herself for gaining weight this month and for not eating healthier. She says she knows better but eating healthy is a struggle for her.   
  
She shows the photo of her Outshine the Fox tattoo again and says she likes the message the tattoo represents more than she likes the tattoo itself. The fox symbolizes Scientology and the flowers represent new growth and fresh things, she says. ""We stepped out of the dark into the light and there was a little bit of color in the darkness,"" she says.

A friend told Reese yesterday she has to remember that the fox is still there and it could still rip her face off if it needed to, she says. Scientologists have to be predatory and tough to survive, she says. ""Scientology will always be a part of my life and I sometimes slip back into it but I step over into the light,"" she says. ""... I love that message. It applies to all of us. Everybody has grown out of something.""   
  
The woman who bought Reese her expensive peace sign uses ""awesome sauce"" in the chat without paying for it. Reese pops up her comment and says since that fan bought the peace sign, she has already paid enough to be able to use that phrase outside of a superchat.   
  
Reese claims a bunch of tattoo artists came over while she was getting this tattoo finished and told her it was a cool piece and that they hadn't done a piece like that before. Reese says she would like to have more color in the fox but the apprentice who did her tattoo told her he would not like that. A chatter says Reese's tattoo will be a conversation piece for many years and Reese says she hopes that's true.  
  
She says that when she was talking to the Aftermath Foundation under the radar, she had to outshine Scientology. I don't know why Reese has started to insist that she was talking with the Aftermath Foundation when Aaron was the only person from the Aftermath Foundation she talked with and he convinced her to be a double agent for his channel.   
  
A new channel member tells Reese that she saw the skin care products on Reese's site but she's not sure which products will work for her black skin. Reese has skin care and other products for sale on her YouTube channel and she gets commissions when viewers buy those products from her page. She tells the woman she doesn't know why having black skin would make a difference for a skin care routine and maybe there's something that she doesn't know. Wow.

That new channel member asks Reese how many black people are in her chat and Reese says she doesn't know but adds that there are a lot of diverse people in her chat. She tells Reese that African-Americans have differences in their hair and their skin. ""That's OK. You would know,"" Reese says.   
  
Reese says she has been betrayed recently by a couple of people she felt close to and that always hurts. ""Nobody's going to throw a rock at a tree that's not bearing fruit,"" she says. ""That's the way I look at it now."" She claims she's never had anybody attack her who is doing better than her. ""It's always less than. They're not helping anyone,"" she says.   
  
Reese says as long as she can support herself and H through her YouTube channel, she'll do it forever even if she doesn't have topics or specific things to talk about. She likes just going live and seeing where the stream goes, she says. Reese claims she can't believe how many people watch her channel because she's all over the place and she knows that drives a lot of people nuts.   
  
Often on her monthly Zoom calls, people who pay to join those calls will be texting Reese and sharing inside jokes, she says. Reese lists off several names and says she loves to see those women throw back their heads and laugh when she sends them texts in return. She's trying to entice even more people to pay for those Zoom calls. She has said in the past that only a very few people have her phone number, but clearly that's not true anymore. She texts during streams with people from her channel too.   
  
She retells several old stories about shitting her pants. Tommy always made her feel more at ease about shitting herself than Jeff did, she says. ""I don't mean to bring up Tommy,"" she says, but tonight she also complained about why people try to hold criminals to things they did in the past instead of accepting changes they have made to their lives.",2,1757222756.0,OT42,0,1.0,False

It's not bad, just not as great as I imagined). I played with it once to mix it, maybe 2 minutes, and that's it. The others have been played with 2-5x, no more than 5 minutes each time (usually less). Always with clean hands on a clean surface. 

I would prefer to sell all at once as a bundle for $60 for all + buyer pays shipping, but if not, I can sell them individually. I have Venmo, Cash App, and Zelle. I have access to a PayPal but that's my least preferred method of payment. 

None of these are completely melted. They may need a little reactivating, but not a ton. Worth noting: I have 2 fluffy cats! I don't allow them near my slime, but if you have pets, you know how hair & dust can show up anywhere and everywhere.

*\*D-20 takes a sip of her coffee, then coughs it up\**



School Chair: You know, if you want to take me out to coffee, you should probably like coffee first



D-20: *\*Still coughing\** I just *\*Cough\** Wanted to try it again



School Chair: But you have repeatedly told me how much you hate coffee, especially black coffee



D-20: Hey, your taste buds change every seven years or so. Maybe that happened, and now I like the bitter taste of coffee *\*Takes another sip and chokes it back to swallow\**



*\*School Chair chuckles a little, then frowns\**



D-20: What‚Äôs wrong?



School Chair: It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ You haven't acted like this in a while, the girl I fell in love with



D-20: What are you talking about?



School Chair: Nothing, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Nevermind



*\*D-20 raises an eyebrow\**



*\*School Chair is about to say something, then realizes something\**



School Chair: Why‚Ä¶ Is your face purple?



D-20: Huh?



School Chair: Like, your mouth and eyes have like a tint of purple



D-20: Oh uh, yeah, I‚Ä¶ Uh‚Ä¶ Tried on makeup, *\*Tries to do a pose to show it off\** Do you like it?



*\*School Chair just looks at her in disbelief for a second\**



School Chair: I-



*\*She then stops and remembers what Glass Bottle said last week\**



School Chair: I‚Ä¶ Think it looks good on you



D-20: Wait, really?



School Chair: Uhhhhh...¬† Yeah?



D-20: I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt really expect that from you, you always harp on about how makeup is unneeded and only there to make girls spend thousands of dollars to look ‚Äúuglier‚Äù



School Chair: That‚Ä¶ Is true‚Ä¶ But you look so good that even Makeup can‚Äôt ruin your look



‚Ä¶



D-20: Well‚Ä¶ Thanks



School Chair: Yeah‚Ä¶ Uh‚Ä¶ No problem



‚Ä¶



*\*D-20 tries to take another sip, but School Chair lowers it\**



School Chair: You don‚Äôt have to do something you don‚Äôt like to impress me, you‚Äôre plenty impressive already



D-20: Hey, I‚Äôm the one who took you out, I should be the one flirting, chessaly



School Chair: Cheesaly? I thought nothing was cheesy?



D-20: Did I say that? Well, I guess I was wrong



*\*D-20 laughs, then stops when she sees School Chair didn‚Äôt join them\**



*\*They then awkwardly look around for a second\**



D-20: Hey, could I ask you a question



School Chair: I‚Äôm all ears



D-20: Well-



School Chair: Are you not gonna comment that the expression ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears‚Äù makes no sense because we don‚Äôt have ears in the first place?



D-20: Why would I do that? It‚Äôs an expression



School Chair: Well‚Ä¶ Alright then, ask away



D-20: Well- *\*Picks up the cup\**



*\*School Chair takes the cup from her and takes a sip\**



School Chair: I can‚Äôt let you suffer anymore



D-20: Just let me ask the question!



‚Ä¶



School Chair: ‚Ä¶Alright then *\*Sips coffee\**



D-20: Well, with the wedding coming up in a few days, I do have something that I feel like I want to bring up



School Chair: I‚Äôm listening



D-20: I already know what your response will be, but I still think we should discuss it more



*\*School Chair raises an eyebrow and takes a sip\**



D-20: I‚Ä¶ Want to have kids (She says the last part¬† fast, like blurring it out)



School Chair: *\*Does a spit take\** What?!



D-20: I know, I know, your answer is obviously not, but maybe we can discuss it and-



School Chair: No



D-20: But I think there is still an important discussion to be had, like what about-



School Chair: *\*Grips the cup harder\** No



D-20: Let‚Äôs at least discuss it first, I know‚Ä¶ *it* but maybe you could-



*\*School Chair grips the cup so hard it shatters\**



School Chair:¬† NO! WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS, PERIOD



*\*School Chair breaths heavily for a few seconds\**



D-20: I know what you did‚Ä¶ May make you adverse to kids‚Ä¶ But maybe-



School Chair: There is no maybe, even if I wanted kids, do you think they would let me adopt?!



D-20: I mean we wouldn‚Äôt have to adopt because-



School Chair: That‚Äôs not the point!



D-20: Well‚Ä¶ maybe you could redeem yourself, show how you have gro-



School Chair: Do you hear yourself? I did something horrible, something unredeemable-



D-20: Don‚Äôt say that, you deserve the world-



School Chair: *\*Gets close to D-20‚Äôs face and slams the table with a fist\** I don‚Äôt deserve anything! I don‚Äôt deserve redemption, I don‚Äôt deserve happiness I don‚Äôt-



D-20: Do you deserve me? *\*Tilts head\**



*\*School Chair pauses, and stares at D-20 for a solid 20 seconds\**



School Chair: *\*Mumbles\** Barley



‚Ä¶



School Chair: I‚Äôll be honest, the only reason why I told you about *it* was so that this conversation wouldn‚Äôt come up‚Ä¶ But you‚Äôre still talking about it‚Ä¶ Why?



D-20: Well‚Ä¶ I talked about it with someone else and she-



School Chair: YOU TALKED ABOUT *IT* TO SOMEONE?!



D-20: No no no! I mean the wanting a kid thing



School Chair: Oh‚Ä¶ Sorry then, continue



D-20:Well, she said that even if I do know the answer, we should have a discussion about it and come to a conscientious



School Chair: *\*Sigh\** Fine‚Ä¶ Why do you want a kid?



D-20: Well‚Ä¶¬† It just feels like I haven't really accomplished anything, I probably will only be remembered as a b-list graphic designer, but, raising a kid just feels fulfilling, like I‚Äôm a functioning adult now‚Ä¶ I know that at least parents would be happy for me



School Chair: What are you a republican?



D-20: I-



School chair: Nevermind, let's ignore the fact that I don‚Äôt want anything to do with kids, I think the more important thing is how are we gonna afford raising one? Don‚Äôt kids take like hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise or something like that?



D-20; First of all, that over all of the 18, possibly up to 25 years that we raise them so it‚Äôs not as bad as you say, also you have a full time job and I am getting good pay from commissions as well, so I think we should be able to



School Chair: Alright then, I guess we would most likely have enough money, but what about our freedom? Will we be as free as we are now? Will we still be able to do fun stuff together? Will we even still have date nights?



D-20: I mean we could ask a friend to baby sit



School Chair: I am not asking glass bottle to babysit the baby



D-20:¬† And the rest of my friends are in another dimension



School Chair: What?



D-20: Nevermind, about the point about being free,while it is valid, don‚Äôt you want to settle down one day? I mean what? We‚Äôre gonna be in our 30s in a few years, we can't just continue to‚Ä¶ Well pretend we are young



School Chair: Stop making me feel so old



D-20: We‚Äôre basically in the grave, I said a few years but it‚Äôs more like one or two



School Chair: *\*groans\** I don‚Äôt know how but you somehow made a more agonizing topic than if we should have kids or not



D-20: *\*Chuckles\** Fine fine i‚Äôll continue, I‚Äôm just saying, do you really want to be like this your whole life? Be this‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Radical?



School Chair: Radical? Where are you getting that from?



D-20: You called me a conservative for wanting kids



School Chair: I called you a conservative because you wanted to make your parents proud



D-20: I mean¬† to be fair, your parents are awful



School Chair: True, but if I want to take your statement seriously, I‚Äôll not stop being radical until I don‚Äôt have to be radical anymore



D-20: No one‚Äôs forcing you to be radical



School Chair: The world is!¬† There are still millions homeless, innocent people being bombed, and still in over 60 countries it is illegal to be gay!



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ I know that-



School Chair: So yeah, I‚Äôm not stopping being ‚Äúradical‚Äù *\*Does the quotation mark gesture on the word radical\**



D-20: I‚Äôm not saying‚Ä¶ Nevermind, we're getting too political



School Chair; What do you mean? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre doing a challenge right now, Nobody is recording us



D-20: I guess so



School¬† Chair: So, about the challenge, I would think that by now the challenge would start‚Ä¶ Did you get eliminated



D-20: No, still in \*Looks down sadly\*



School Chair: What? Isn‚Äôt it good¬† that you went further in the‚Ä¶ Camp was it?



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ But I had to basically worm my way into two alliances and side with the one who won last challenge



School Chair: Hey, that‚Äôs just strategy



D-20: But I don‚Äôt want to have a strategy, I want to have fun! ‚Ä¶ Right?



School Chair: Here is how I see it, you, by having fun, are able to get far into the competition, i‚Äôm sure others are using strategy to get further into the competition as well, but that doesn't matter because you are using strategy so that you can continue and have more fun



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶



School Chair: You know, it‚Äôs really nice of them to give you a break in the challenges, I‚Äôm so sick of every time I‚Äôm free, you‚Äôre doing some challenge



D-20: I mean, it is supposed to be fast paced



School Chair: Alright then



‚Ä¶



D-20: I‚Äôm gonna go to the bathroom now



School Chair: Yeah, you go do that



*\*D-20 stands up and walks toward the building\**



School Chair: But wait‚Ä¶ how would makeup make the inside of your mouth purple?



*\*D-20 walks into the building, but instead of going to the bathroom, goes out the side exit\**



D-20: Why hasn‚Äôt the challenge started yet?



Glass Bottle: Yeah why?



*\*D-20 looks at Glass Bottle and blinks\**



Glass Bottle: Also, unless if you are planning on peeing out here, I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt the bathroom



D-20: How did you hear that conversation from here?



Glass Bottle: I have good hearing



D-20: And a better question, why are you here?



Glass Bottle: You told me to go out more, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing



D-20: Huh, I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised



Glass Bottle: I could say the same to you, lying so brazenly to your partner, very much like a straight couple



D-20: Why does everyone hate straight people?



Glass Bottle : I‚Äôm making joke Dicey, I know humor is hard



D-20: First of all it‚Äôs D-20, second of all what do you mean?



Glass Bottle: This *\*Gestures to D-20‚Äôs face\** is not make up



D-20: Well then smart guy, what is it then?



Glass Bottle: \*Thinks for a second, then points\* A side effect of your powers



D-20: My what?!



Glass Bottle: Powers, it‚Äôs the same glow you have when you generated that dough



D-20: You have no proof that it wasn‚Äôt in there beforehand



Glass Bottle: All I do is watch YouTube and check the fridge, I would have known if there was dough in there



D-20: I don‚Äôt have any powers-



Glass Bottle: Then explain how the inside of your mouth is purple



D-20: I‚Ä¶ The inside?



Glass Bottle: Yeah



*\*D-20 pulls out her phone, goes to the camera app, and presses the button to let her see herself\**



D-20: I‚Ä¶ Wait what? My mouth is purple



Glass Bottle: You see?



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt feel any worse so I guess it‚Äôs fine



Glass Bottle: Ah yes, because your opinion is better than every doctor in the world



D-20: Look, all you saw was a purple glow and I pulled dough out of there, you can‚Äôt show that was me



Glass Bottle: *\*Glass bottle raises an eyebrow\** No I saw you use your powers again that day, when you¬† pulled out that crystal



D-20: The‚Ä¶ Crystal? *\*Turns around and mumbles\** The only time I pulled it out that day was right before-



*\*D-20 slowly turns back to Glass Bottle\**



D-20: You‚Ä¶ saw that?



Glass Bottle: If by that you mean cutting yourself repeatedly and the healing it just to continue it again for hours then yea-



D-20: *\*Rushes toward Glass Bottle and shakes him\** Don‚Äôt say it out loud!



*\*Glass bottle and D-20 look at each other for a few seconds, not sure of what to say\**



D-20: Did‚Ä¶ Did you tell-



Glass Bottle: No I didn‚Äôt tell anyone



D-20: *\*She looks Glass Bottle up and down, and sighs\** I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre telling the truth or not, but‚Ä¶ I trust you



Glass Bottle: I‚Äôll take that as a compliment



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ You were supposed to take that as a compliment



Glass Bottle: Like I said, I did not tell anyone, and don‚Äôt plan to, but you should tell-



D-20: I am not telling her!



Glass Bottle: Okey then, I guess that‚Äôs settled then



D-20: Really? I was prepared to argue why I shouldn‚Äôt



Glass Bottle: Well it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna convince you



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôre right



‚Ä¶



Glass Bottle: So, when did this start?



D-20: Me‚Ä¶ Cutting myself?



Glass Bottle: Yeah



D-20: You‚Äôre not my therapist



Glass Bottle: Oh so you already discussed it with someone



D-20: *\*Looks away for a second\** ‚Ä¶ No



Glass Bottle: Alright then‚Ä¶ So?



D-20: *\*Smacks lips\** ‚Ä¶ Fine, It started back in college, back before I realized who I was



Glass Bottle: You know who you are? I feel like everyone else is still figure that out



D-20: You- You know what I mean, my gender, me going from guy to girl



Glass Bottle: Demi-girl



D-20: Do you or do you not want me to continue?



*\*Glass bottle throws a thumbs up\**



D-20: Well, at the time, I had another girlfriend. But she always expected so much of me which‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt deliver‚Ä¶ *\*Grips her arm\** I don‚Äôt want to get into details, but whenever I wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Or couldn‚Äôt do what she said, she would hurt me‚Ä¶ Sometimes physically‚Ä¶ But most times in a less visible way‚Ä¶ Spreading rumors about how I was a bad person, saying I was a pervert, saying I was dangerous, at one point she said I would take pictures of the rest of the girls and‚Ä¶ You know



Glass Bottle: Rip them up?



D-20: ,,, Sure,,, Let‚Äôs go with that



Glass Bottle: And‚Ä¶ Was any of that true?



D-20: *\*Looks at her and opens her mouth in offence\** No!



Glass Bottle: So‚Ä¶ how is that related to cutting yourself?



D-20: Let me finish, she continued to push me away from my friends, pretty much every friend I had back then, I never talked to again and I just didn‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I seriously thought about killing myself‚Ä¶ Multiple times‚Ä¶ But the time that I tried it, I missed and only cut up my arm a little, and‚Ä¶ It felt good, so I continued to do it, and she didn‚Äôt notice, and then, about a year later, I met School Chair who was instantly able to tell not only were the rumors true, but also could tell I was cutting myself. So she forced me to break up with my girlfriend, and protected me from anything bad that would come my way. She helped me to stop cutting myself‚Ä¶ For a while at least. She supported me through everything, including when I came out as trans two years later, she even tried to help me meet new people but the rumors were still in full circulation so I‚Äôm still struggling to make friends, but I think I‚Äôm getting better at it



Glass Bottle: So she‚Äôs been protecting you for awhile, and do you still like that?



D-20: Uh‚Ä¶ I do want to be more independent now, I‚Äôm 29! I can‚Äôt rely on someone my entire life!



Glass Bottle: Well, I‚Äôve been relying on you for a wee,k and that‚Äôs been going fine



D-20: You‚Äôre in your early 20s. You can still rely on others



Glass Bottle: Shouldn‚Äôt you always be relying on your partner at all times?



D-20: I just think she does it too much, plus she doesn't rely on me for anything



*\*Glass Bottle thinks for a second, then waves it away\**



Glass Bottle: Is School Chair not able to tell that you cut yourself now or something?



D-20: I guess not



Glass Bottle: Another side effect of the crystal?



D-20: I guess



Glass Bottle: Would these side effects include being more confident?



D-20: I‚Ä¶ Think so? Not caring about anything people say is being more confident, right?



Glass Bottle: Yeah, I think so, I don‚Äôt care, and I‚Äôm confident



D-20: Cool



‚Ä¶



D-20: I asked School Chair about the kids thing



‚Ä¶



D-20: And‚Ä¶ She mentioned *it*



Glass Bottle: Get a dog



D-20: Hm?



Glass Bottle: It is related to kids, right?



D-20: Yeah?



Glass Bottle: Get a dog, it seems like people react more when you get a dog than when you get a kid



D-20: And the reason?



Glass Bottle: Well, I was watching Young Sheldon and in season 6 when‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gonna say the name so that you don‚Äôt get spoiled



D-20: I‚Äôm not watching Youung Sheldon



Glass Bottle: Your loss, but anyways, when Georgy got someone pregnant, it became a whole deal, every episode in season 6 at least had a subplot about it, and was definitely the main focus of it



D-20: And how did that end?



Glass Bottle: I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt finished it yet, but my point is that in Lilo and Stitch, after like 5 minutes of bickering, they accept the dog, and while there is some turmoil, they accept it after like 2 days in universe



D-20: So‚Ä¶ Start with a dog? Is that what you‚Äôre saying?



Glass Bottle: Yeah



D-20: Man, I wish I could ask Mark, but I can‚Äôt, at least not now



Glass Bottle: What is a Mark?



D-20: Hm?



Glass Bottle: I‚Äôm Glass Bottle because I‚Äôm a Glass Bottle, but what is a Mark?



D-20: A name?



Glass Bottle: You‚Äôre not making sense



D-20: Never mind, alright then, so how so I ask it?



Glass Bottle: How about we have a dog?



D-20: How about we have a dog?



School Chair: Why?



*\*D-20 sits back down at the table\**



D-20: It just feels like the next logical step before getting kids



School Chair: You‚Äôre still on this?



D-20: Yeah I‚Äôm still on this!



School Chair: Well, I‚Äôm not too big on dogs either. There was a service dog there, and in my teenage mind, I also-



D-20: Okay then, I get that



School Chair: Could we change the topic?



D-20: Sure, you can start the next one



School Chair: Why did you take so long to use the bathroom



D-20: I mean we take a long time in there, right?



*\*School Chair raises an eyebrow\**



D-20: Okay, I get how that doesn't apply to me, but still



School Chair: You‚Äôve been taking a while for a lot of things recently, like when you took two hours to drink water



D-20: What are you talking about?



School Chair: Remember last week? When‚Ä¶ You made that homemade pizza? We went to bed, I told you I was proud of you, you went down to get some water, and came back after two hours



D-20: I thought you were asleep



School Chair: No, it was one of those nights where you don‚Äôt fall asleep the entire night. Does that happen to you?



D-20: No?



School Chair: Huh‚Ä¶ Alright then



D-20: Well‚Ä¶ I had to boil the water



School Chair: Why? I thought you were just going down to drink water?



D-20: I‚Ä¶ Wanted to boil out the impurities



School Chair: Isn‚Äôt that the filter‚Äôs job?



D-20: Better safe than sorry



School Chair: Alright then, but I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt take two hours



D-20: It‚Äôs nothing



School Chair: Look, if something is happening, I want to know. You can tell me, I‚Äôm here for you



D-20: Really, it‚Äôs nothing



School Chair: No matter what it is, I‚Äôll be better if you tell me rather than keeping it a secret



D-20: I really have nothing



School Chair: You know, a lot of weird things have been happening recently, like that purple glow when you were getting the dough or those extra knives in the sink¬†



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ that is really weird



*\*School Chair thinks for a second\**



School Chair: Also, when I woke up, I saw that you didn‚Äôt have a bandage on your finger



D-20: Oh, I took it off *\*Pauses for a second\** when I was getting water, it was no longer bleeding



School Chair: I saw the cut; it couldn‚Äôt have healed in that amount of time



D-20: Well-



School Chair: Trust me‚Ä¶ I would know



D-20: Look, I‚Äôm not hiding anything, and you know that



School Chair: We‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ On that topic now



D-20: Oh, uh, right‚Ä¶



‚Ä¶



School Chair: You know, just because I can‚Äôt read your face doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt read into the words you are saying



D-20: What are you saying? That I am keeping something from you?



School Chair: I mean, you have before



D-20: Hey, that was a surprise, that‚Äôs different



School Chair: I mean, every secret can be surprising



D-20: I‚Ä¶ yeah



School Chair: I love you, but I don‚Äôt like it when you hide things from me



D-20: I‚Ä¶ Am not hiding anything from you *\*Starting to glow purple\**



School Chair: D-20, please, I beg you, you‚Äôre acting differently, things are glowing and- wait wait‚Ä¶ Why are you-



D-20: *\*Stands up\** Everything is fine!



School Chair: No, but like seriously, you‚Äôre glowing right now



D-20: I‚ÄôM NOT HIDING ANYTHING! *\*Stomps the ground\**



*\*The world starts to shake\**



School Chair: What the hell is that?!



D-20: Uh‚Ä¶ Probably nothing



School Chair: I hope you‚Äôre-



*\*School Chair notices the shadow slowly growing bigger\**

School Chair: What is-



*\*School Chair looks up to see the meteor falling from the sky\**



School Chair: WHAT THE FUCK?!



D-20: Oh yeah, that‚Äôs the challenge



School Chair: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT?! *\*Points to the meteor\**



D-20: Yeah, pretty much



*\*People all around are starting to scream, trying to run and drive away\**



School Chair: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO STOP THAT?!



D-20: I was given this *\*throws energy shard toward School Chair\**



School Chair: *\*Catches it\** What the hell is this?



D-20: An energy shard of some kind, I got it for still having a token at the final



School Chair: And what do I do with it?!



D-20: Hopefully, it‚Äôll fix it



School Chair: Hopefully?!



Glass Bottle: Oh, hey, a meteor



School Chair: Glass Bottle? Why are you here



Glass Bottle: Is it really that unbelievable that I went outside because I want to?



School Chair: Yeah



Glass Bottle: I guess that‚Äôs fair



D-20: Why don‚Äôt you test it out?



School Chair: What?



D-20: The shard



School Chair: How would I? Just think to fire an energy beam and-



*\*A flash of lightning comes out of the Shard and hits Glass Bottle, shattering him and all the windows of the nearby buildings\**



School Chair: Did I‚Ä¶ Just‚Ä¶ Kill him?



Glass Bottle: *\*From behind School Chair\** No



School Chair: *\*Goes on one leg and swerves around\** How?!



Glass Bottle: Just a trick of the eyes, like D-20 glowing



School Chair: I mean, I guess you‚Äôre right. How else are you here?



Glass Bottle: Yeah *\*Walks up to D-20 and whispers\** Saved your ass there



D-20: We don‚Äôt even have asses



School Chair: What even is- Nevermind



Glass Bottle: You guys say that a lot



School Chair: We don‚Äôt have time! \*Gestures to the meteor\* The fucking asteroid



‚Ä¶



School Chair: This is the time when you tell me it‚Äôs actually a meteor



‚Ä¶



Glass Bottle: Did you or did you not know it was a meteor?



School Chair: Shut up



D-20: I guess just try to lightning zap it



School Chair: That‚Äôs a fucking meteor! Do you think lightning will do anything?



Glass Bottle: Hey, if a billion lions can defeat the sun, a billion lightning strikes can destroy a meteor



School Chair: That‚Äôs probably the same size as the fucking meteor that killed the dinosaurs



\*School Chair turns to D-20\*



School Chair: That‚Äôs correct, right?



D-20: About yeah



School Chair: I mean, more the meteor killing the dinosaurs, that‚Äôs correct, right?



D-20: The most agreed-upon way that dinosaurs died among scientists



Glass Bottle: I don‚Äôt know why people are trying to run. We're all going to die, right? Unless a miracle happens



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶



*\*Glass bottle turns to D-20 and raises an eyebrow\**



School Chair: Why are you guys so calm about this?!



D-20: I‚Äôm confident that we‚Äôll make it through this! Just throw some lightning at it!



School Chair: I‚Äôll try



*\*School Chair takes a deep breath and looks right at the meteor\**



*\*She then puts both of her hands out towards the meteor and fires out billions of thunderbolts at the meteor, looking like a light pillar that lit up the already bright day\**



Glass Bottle: Whoa, that‚Äôs a lot of lighting



School Chair: Yeah! It‚Äôs a world-ending meteor! Do you think I wouldn‚Äôt go all out!



Glass Bottle: Well, you should probably do some more



School Chair: Huh? *\*Looks back\**



*\*The meteor, intact, is still set to fall onto Earth\**



D-20: Yeah, to destroy a meteor like that, you would need way more lighting



School Chair: Welp, let‚Äôs do some-



*\*She pauses\**



Glass Bottle: Let‚Äôs see that lighting, Ms‚Ä¶ Lighting

D-20: Hm?



School Chair: Where does it get any of the energy? I mean, all of that lightning alone could have probably run all of the electricity in the world for years. Where did all of that come from?

*\*Glass Bottle makes sure that School Chair is out of earshot before turning to D-20\**



D-20: Who made that meteor disappear?



Glass Bottle: Did you not make it disappear?



D-20: No, all I heard was a snap and that blue light



Glass Bottle: Really, you didn‚Äôt do anything?



D-20: No



Glass Bottle: Were you really prepared to have the whole world end because you didn‚Äôt want to have School Chair know you have powers?



D-20: *\*Looks down for a second\** yeah‚Ä¶ I guess so



Glass Bottle: Welp, whatever that was, let‚Äôs hope that miracle persists to your wedding



D-20: Oh, right! It‚Äôs next week!



Glass Bottle: I‚Äôd say let‚Äôs hope that the miracle makes sure nothing bad happens, but something most certainly will



D-20: Are you-



Glass Bottle: No, no, no, I‚Äôm saying knowing you guys something bad is gonna happen, plus, you can fix it with that purple power thing right?



*\*D-20 pauses, glows purple for a second, and fixes the table and cup\**



D-20: Yeah‚Ä¶ I guess so, but don‚Äôt you wonder who snapped and produced that blue light?



Glass Bottle: No, not really



D-20: That‚Äôs probably how the meteor disappeared!



Glass Bottle: How I see it is, the world is not destroyed, I get to live longer to watch more YouTube, and eat more pizza, win-win!



D-20: Who is the other one winning in this situation?



Glass Bottle: Earth obviously



*\*D-20 chuckles\**



Glass Bottle: Everything will be just fine

1nakqal,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nakqal/i_want_you/,I WANT YOU,"My close friend Austin passed away a few weeks ago. I found him at my place, or rather, at our place. Austin and I were college friends. We were actually living in a dorm, but after Austin and I became close, we decided to move into a separate apartment. We rented this apartment. It wasn't very big, but it was enough for the two of us.

We easily managed most things by sharing the work. Ironing, cooking, grocery shopping... That day, it was my turn to go to the market. I went out for shopping around 7 pm. Not long after, about an hour and a half later, when I returned home, I saw a scene that will be etched in my memory for the rest of my life.

Austin was in the living room. The living room was in shambles, everything was broken and scattered.  The full-length mirror was shattered. Austin was lying in the broken glass. His eyes were open, his hands and arms covered in cuts, blood flowing from his throat forming a small pool on the side, and strangest of all, there was a bloody mask next to him. It was a baby's face, with protruding cheeks and forehead, exaggerated eyelashes, and a grin covering half of the face. I actually noticed the mask after the police and ambulance arrived at the scene. Because the whole time I was focused on trying to bring my friend back to life. Austin was already dead when I arrived. That's why he was taken out of the house in a body bag. God... I collapsed onto the couch. Two hours earlier, we were joking around with each other. Now he was in a black bag and I was... a man left in a void.

It was definitely murder, so the house was now a crime scene. I was homeless. Luckily, my grandparents had a summer house in the same city as my university, and I moved there temporarily.

When my parents heard about what happened, they were very worried about me. I wanted to continue going to school, but my mom insisted that I see a psychologist and even made an appointment for me. I didn't say much during the first few sessions because I didn't think it would help. So what changed my mind? The visions that started two weeks ago.

My grandfather's house is detached and huge. Also, I haven't uncovered most of the items, so it can be scary at night. One night, I went downstairs from the upper floor to the kitchen to get some water. When I turned my head to the left on the stairs, I saw him. He was about my height, a rather overweight man wearing a bloody butcher's apron. His chin was visible under the mask. And yes, it was that mask. The mask next to Austin. I climbed a few steps up the stairs and hid. I thought about calling the police. Then, when I turned my head to look again... he was gone. Still, I called the police to come check my house, but they found no one. And I'm sure they thought I was crazy as they left. The thing is... at that moment, I felt that way too.

When I told the psychologist about it, he said I was having delusions. The human brain can see hallucinations after such ‚Äòtraumatic‚Äô events. But it kept going. Sometimes it would walk past me while I was having breakfast in the kitchen. I would freeze in shock. Then I would get up to check, and he wasn't there. At first, it was so terrifying it kept me awake all night, but over time I convinced myself it was just my imagination. At least, I tried to. But it kept getting worse. There were moments when the killer, whom I had only seen wandering around, would stop and stare at me, sometimes following me. And then the voices started. While I was in the shower, I heard a knock on my door. A few taps. Then it stopped. And believe me, no matter how much the soap stung my eyes, I didn't even blink during the entire shower. It's all in your head, Caleb, calm down. These aren't real. I kept trying to calm myself down like that.

One night, I woke up with a sudden jolt. I was drenched in sweat. Because I was... tied to the bed. It wasn't just an illusion. Even though I pulled on the ropes, my arms and legs wouldn't move. I only noticed the man in the baby mask when he moved. He took a step toward me. Even if I screamed, my neighbor probably wouldn't hear me because the house was detached. With every second he slowly approached me, I struggled and trembled more. He positioned himself right at my head and, unbelievably... he touched me. When his hand grabbed my chin, I froze. He was holding me tightly. He was turning my head from side to side. Then he lifted my head and leaned over me. This isn't a nightmare, I said to myself. This isn't a nightmare. I could smell the dry blood on the mask. He leaned close to my ear as if to whisper, and then... I don't remember what happened next.

When I woke up, it was morning. My hands were free, and the man in the baby mask was gone. Still, I woke up feeling like I'd been beaten up that morning. I didn't see anything else all day. In the evening, I decided to leave the house for a walk. As I walked along the sidewalk in front of the house, I saw our neighbor Julia a few blocks away. I remembered her from a few summers ago. I had met her when we visited my grandfather, and we hung out together. She greeted me. I greeted her back. She asked why I had come here. I told her what had happened to my friend, without going into detail. While I was talking, she suggested we keep walking. I agreed, and we started touring the neighborhood together. I must admit, I hadn't had a normal conversation with anyone in a long time, and while talking to Julia, I realized how much I missed it. We walked together until it got dark. Then she went to her house and I went to mine. Before leaving, I said we should do this again. She agreed. Talking to her was even better than seeing a psychologist. So much so that the hallucinations began to subside to the point where I no longer needed medication.

Julia and I would meet outside and go for coffee. We talked about our hobbies. For example, she was studying at the conservatory. She told me about her dreams of becoming a musician. I played the guitar too, but obviously I wasn't as skilled as her. As I did things with her, I stopped going to my psychologist appointments. I was getting better. And also... I don't know. Julia filled not only the visions but also the void left by Austin. She had literally become my savior.

Once, she invited me to her family's house for dinner. Her family were sweet people, just like her. The warm family atmosphere... it was like a dream. It was something I had been looking for for a very long time. Since my university was in a different city from my family, I could only see them during the holidays. Julia and her family had filled that void for me. So I decided to invite her over. One night, she came to my house to watch a movie. With the lights off and a bowl of popcorn in our hands, we started a 3.5-hour action movie. Halfway through the movie, I paused it so Julia could go to the bathroom. When she came back a few minutes later, she had something in her hand.

‚ÄúWhere did you find that?‚Äù

I had actually forgotten it even existed. It was my grandfather's old guitar. Julia smiled at me. Then she took the guitar and sat down.

‚ÄúWould you like to listen to a few songs?‚Äù

She might have been one of the most talented musicians I've ever seen in my life. Her normal speaking voice was beautiful, but when she sang, it took on a divine beauty. She became one with the song. I thought she would be a very successful artist in the future.

As I listened to her, spellbound, the sound of my phone broke the harmony of the moment. It was an unknown number. When I answered, a woman addressed me by my last name. She told me to come to the police station immediately.

‚ÄúWhat's it about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe've found a new lead concerning your friend Austin's murder.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. Julia could tell from the look on my face that something was wrong. I told her I'd be there in a few minutes and hung up.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

He leaned his guitar against the couch. I told him I had to go to the station and explained why.

‚ÄìIf you want to go home, I can drop you off.

‚ÄìNo problem, if it won't take long, I'll wait for you here. Besides, the movie's only halfway through.

The offer sounded tempting. I told him I'd be home in an hour at most and went outside.

How could I have known...

When I got to the police station, a police officer greeted me. We went to one of the interrogation rooms. It annoyed me that no one was explaining what was going on. Finally, when we sat down at a table, one of the police officers spoke.

‚ÄìCaleb, we didn't want to call you back here, but there's been a major development.

‚ÄìWhat is it?

He handed me a note hesitantly.

‚ÄìDo you recognize this handwriting?

The note looked like it had been torn from a notebook. And it definitely hadn't been written with a normal pen.

‚ÄìThis... What's that on it?

‚ÄìBlood. A note written in Austin's blood. It was just found at home.

I looked at the note again.

‚ÄìCaleb, will you answer the question?

‚ÄìNo, I don't recognize it.

‚ÄìWell, did Austin have any enemies who would do this?

‚ÄìYou already asked me that.

‚ÄìI know, but maybe after this new detail, someone will come to mind.‚Äù

No one. No one came to mind. Austin had always been a somewhat introverted and polite kid. I was sure no one would kill him so brutally. When the police realized they wouldn't get anything out of me, they let me go.

I want you.

The words written on the little note. All night long, it was as if someone was screaming this inside my head.

I want you.

The police thought the note was written for Austin. But what if it wasn't?

I was a mess. I literally couldn't think. I was walking around in a daze, my head completely empty. I was like a zombie. All I wanted to do was go home and sleep. So I was going to tell Julia I was too tired and we could continue the movie another night. I called her. But she didn't answer her phone. I had called when I left the police station, and she hadn't answered then either. I figured she had already gone home since I was late, and I didn't think much of it.

When I was about 100 meters from home, my neighbor's voice made me turn my head that way. Mrs. Susan was walking her dog. When she called my name, the empty street echoed. She asked how I was doing. I gave short answers so as not to prolong the conversation and kept walking. But she stopped me again.

‚ÄúCaleb, I want to warn you about something.‚Äù Or rather, I want you to warn someone about something.""

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour friend.‚Äù

I thought she was talking about Julia, but I was confused.

‚ÄúWhat? Which friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one walking around with that mask, for God's sake. Please tell him not to walk around with that damn thing. It's scaring my dog, Dexter.‚Äù

I couldn't respond.

I just froze there. Mrs. Susan said goodbye and left. I realized I was shivering even though it was warm. Hallucinations... Were they real? Only one name came to mind. Julia. She wasn't answering her phone. She... She was alone in the house with the killer. I ran home. I opened the door so hard I almost broke it. I shouted Julia's name throughout the house. I was afraid to find her dead in the house, but worse, she was gone. Julia had vanished into thin air. The house was just as I had left it. The only difference was that guitar, which she had leaned against the chair, had fallen to the floor. There was a note next to the guitar. This time it was a note written in pen.

I want you.

I called the police. The police searched the entire house and neighborhood. There were no signs of a struggle, no signs of forced entry, and no blood. So no one could figure out exactly what had happened.

Since I was involved in both a missing person case and a murder case, they took me into custody. But it was certain and proven that I was in a different place from the scene of the crime in both cases. So they let me go. Still, Julia's family blames me. I blame myself too. For leaving her alone at home.

I left the summer house and checked into a hotel. My mom and dad insist I come stay with them, but I won't go. Because I'm scared. More for them than for myself. This killer isn't a delusion; he's hurting people around me. I'm afraid he'll do something to my family too.

I checked into a boarding house. I hadn't been there a day. I fell asleep without even taking off my clothes, exhausted. I woke up to the sound of the door at night. Someone was trying to force my door open at the cheap boarding house where I was staying. I jumped out of bed in a panic, but there was nowhere to hide in the one-room place. As I ran to the bathroom and locked the door, I heard the sound of the main door lock being broken. I could hear his footsteps. He was walking around the room. I even heard him throw a few things.

My phone was left outside. There was nothing here I could use to defend myself. I was writhing helplessly inside the room. Then the footsteps stopped. There was no sound for a long time. It was as if time had stopped. Until a piece of paper slid under the bathroom door. I was startled by the sound of friction. I stared in horror at the randomly torn piece of paper. It had a single sentence written on it in capital letters.

     A thermos is something lots of people use it keep soup warm for lunch or coffee hot in the morning or water cold when you outside. All thermoses supposed to do the same thing but they dont always work the same some keep food hot or cold for a long time and some dont. This project look at three brands Thermos Hydro Flask and Stanley to see which one works the best. Thermos work by slowing down how heat moves. Heat usually moves three ways conduction touch convection air or liquid  heat waves. Thermoses stop this by having two walls with empty space called a vacuum in between. Heat dont travel good through vacuum. The lid matters too if the lid not tight heat comes out fast. Each brand is a little different. Thermos is the old brand been around over 100 years. People use it for lunch or coffee or normal food. Hydro Flask  is newer and more popular with young people it looks cool and is good for hot or cold drinks. Stanley is big and tough people take it camping or to work because it last a long time and dont break easy. The goal of this project is to test which thermos keep food hot or cold longer. The test is simple heat up food or drink to the same start temperature put it in each thermos and check the temperature every hour. Do the same thing with cold water or ice to see which one keep stuff cold. The hypothesis is Stanley keep hot the longest because it strong and made for all day use. Hydro Flask maybe better for cold drinks because thats what people use it for. Thermos still works good but maybe not as long as the other two.  This project connect to STEM because it use science to explain how heat move. technology for how the thermoses made. engineering in how they built strong. and math to write down numbers and compare. At the end results will show which thermos is best for keeping food and drinks the way you want

We‚Äôve been friends for 23 years now, and he‚Äôs the only friend I‚Äôve kept in contact with. Otherwise, I generally distance myself from anyone getting too close after a few months. But, I‚Äôve put in as much effort as I can to maintain this friendship.

He moved out of state about ten years ago.

Unfortunately, I am a bit flakey. I will respond to any text at any hour, and when he comes back into town, I‚Äôll go meet him for lunch or a dinner about half the time. Recently, I got promoted at work, and I feel pressured to not take long lunches or leave for an early/extended dinner and happy hour or whatever else we‚Äôve planned.

I keep getting the feeling like I have hurt his feelings or disappointed him and his wife and he‚Äôs ready to move on.

However, he‚Äôs spearheading a charity gala in my city soon. I really want to go. I asked him to give me the weekend to talk to my partner and figure it out.

I discussed it with my partner, and it‚Äôs just not going to work.

We‚Äôd have to buy suits/dresses, and pay a lot of money per entry (for charity), and we just can‚Äôt afford it. We have a vacation/holiday coming up, and even if we canceled it and put all of the funds together, we couldn‚Äôt afford the minimum donation.

We‚Äôre both too proud to ask if he could make an exception for us, and even if he could, who knows how much we‚Äôd waste on fancy clothes we‚Äôd never wear again to ‚Äúfit in.‚Äù

I am afraid I will lose my friend if I say ‚Äúno‚Äù outright. We‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù relationship, like, we‚Äôd meet up at breweries with mid-priced meals, or fancy cafes for overpriced coffee, or an escape room or something like that. But, in this case, we‚Äôre worried about being humiliated by not appearing rich enough.

Do you all think if I say ‚Äúno,‚Äù but donate as much money as I can afford to the charities he‚Äôs representing will be a good way to salvage the friendship?

Pendapat pribadi berdasarkan berbagai kuliner yang udah aing coba:

1. Bubur Di bawah Pohon Rindang: Barusan banget ngelewat sana. Gila ngantrinya panjang banget ¬±70 orang. Dulu pernah nyobain, buburnya encer dan rasanya biasa aja, toppingnya dikit kecuali pesen extra, porsi standar. Tapi SAMA SEKALI GAK WORTH IT sama harga dan panjang antriannya. Apalagi kalau weekend duh

2. Warung nasi Bu Imas: Suka penuh sampe sumpek, padahal rasanya biasa aja dan kek tourist trapnya ""makanan sunda"" gasih? dari rasa kalah sama Ampera yang cabangnya udah lebih banyak. Padahal harga masih 11/12. Parkir suka gajelas karena gapunya lahan parkir sendiri alias ngandalin pinggir jalan. Tempatnya panas pula

3. Drunk Baker (Cihapit): Ini juga sama, antrian panjang dan harga agak pricy, tapi rasanya mid. Yang produk bersusunya, susunya kek dancow bubuk

4. Mie Naripan: Enak, tapi gak worth it dengan harganya. Masih mending Mie Avon

5. Ayam SPG: Kalau ini sebenernya biasa aja dan harganya masih terjangkau. Tapi jaman aing waktu sma, banyak beli ini ya karena murahnya, plus nasi dan serundeng ambil bebas. Sekarang dari harga sih gatau, tapi temen-temen kuliah terutama asal luar bandung, pada ngincer ini soalnya katanya viral karena enak banget. Padahal enak tapi ya dalam artian sesuai dengan harga aja. Ganyampe enak poll

6. Bacang jando di Asia Afrika: Lupa namanya apa sih. Pernah dateng kesana, antrian panjang. Tapi rasa bacang ama jandonya kagak nyatu dah


Kalo rumus aing sih, apapun kuliner yang antriannya udah ‚â•10, galayak coba. Masih banyak kuliner ""nonviral"" lainnya yang sama atau bahkan lebih enak. Hell, dari sekian banyak nasgor ama yamien yang udah aing coba aja, masih lebih enak yang deket komplek aing yang sama sekali gaada di internet

still, gak semua makanan viral itu bad. Beberapa kayak Sate Bu Ngantuk, Nasi Padang malah dicubo, buat aing dua itu paling enak di kategori makanannya masing-masing.

Sebenernya juga kalau menurut aing, semua coffee shop di bandung, secara rasa sama aja wkwk. Sebuah nikmat dari tuhan ke aing, karena gw gapicky nyari tempat ngopi. Di point coffee pun jadi.

I have been taking non-stimulant ADHD medication for a couple of months, but it did not help, so I switched to Atomoxetine and Concerta around December‚ÄìJanuary.
I did not notice any improvement in my concentration with Concerta, so I increased my dosage from 18mg ‚Üí 27mg ‚Üí 36mg ‚Üí 54mg. However, I still did not see any changes, so my doctor lowered it back to 18mg. After that, I raised it back to 36mg.
After consciously monitoring my concentration levels, I found that Concerta only lasted 4‚Äì5 hours for me, with 7 hours being the maximum (this only happened once).
I live in East Asia, where most ADHD medications are banned, so I don‚Äôt really have any other options. I asked to take Concerta twice a day so I could extend its effects. Yesterday was my first time taking two pills.
I took a 27mg pill at 8:00 am, but I soon started feeling strange. I could tell that my cognitive abilities were not normal, so at 12:30 pm I took an 18mg pill. This did not improve my cognition, and I immediately started feeling brain fog. I could not concentrate at all and could not remember things I had just heard seconds earlier. I also drank coffee that day (coffee had never caused side effects for me with Concerta before), so I thought maybe the coffee was causing this.
Today, I took the same pills at about the same times, but without coffee. However, my cognitive abilities are still declining, the brain fog is continuing, I can‚Äôt remember simple words, and now I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe easily (it feels like a heavy blanket or pressure on my lungs, though not severe).
I tried calling a government drug side effect reporting organization, but they are closed today because it is Sunday where I live.

We have a great relationship, love each other very much, etc. Last year we were going through a very rough patch, my partner was dealing with a gambling problem and I had expressed my concerns to him multiple times. I explained to him that I felt disconnected, that I wasn‚Äôt getting enough affection from him, not getting enough quality time because of how much he was out gambling, I was worried about the money, and he basically told me I needed to get more hobbies and be more independent. This was the closest we had ever been to breaking up and I was in a terrible mental state. I struggle with Anxiety, OCD, and ADHD which is a hell of a combination while I was going through this rough patch. I started considering the worst case scenario which would be if my partner and I broke up. Then I was terrified about being lonely and having no one to talk to, as I didn‚Äôt have many close friends at this time either. I was thinking about different ways I could talk to people and I thought of dating apps. I thought of tinder and I was thinking well I don‚Äôt want to go on there because it‚Äôs known for hookups. So I wanted to see what other options there were for just talking to people to maybe spark up a genuine conversation and I went on the App Store and started browsing, I came across an app called coffee meets bagel and thought it sounded wholesome and i downloaded the app because the title was intriguing and I was curious. Once I opened the app it prompted me to start building a profile and then I was like wtf am I doing and I deleted the app. So I never made a profile, never saw anyone else‚Äôs profiles, etc. I never had the intention to start talking to another guy romantically, I was more so almost in ‚Äúpreparation anxiety mode‚Äù thinking about what I would do it my partner and I broke up.

Since this all happened, my partner and I have both done a lot of work on ourselves. He has gotten his gambling under control completely, and I have become a lot less co-dependent. I would say our relationship is at the best point it has ever been at. However now I‚Äôm having terrible guilt thinking about how during that rough patch I considered going on a dating app. That was the closest I ever came to cheating. Loyalty and honesty are our highest values in our relationship and I feel like I‚Äôve broken that. I‚Äôve been beating myself up every day over this because I never thought I would ever cheat or consider cheating no matter what. If I tell my partner I feel like he would be hurt and confused because he probably thinks that‚Äôs something I would never do.

1nak4oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nak4oo/noaa_dissolved_my_research_department_and_the/,NOAA Dissolved My Research Department and the World Is About to End,"I lost my job last month. Well, I, along with fifty other researchers, scientists, and technicians. I won‚Äôt go into the bureaucratic bullshit surrounding the dissolving of the federal office I used to work for, but it might help to know that it was a sub-branch of NOAA.

Even before we were disbanded, you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to find any record of our office other than an unaccounted-for one hundred or so million in NOAA‚Äôs annual budget report. We fell under the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and weren‚Äôt given a designation, but we liked to call ourselves ‚ÄúBlip Watchers‚Äù since that‚Äôs mainly what we did ‚Äì watched monitors for blips.

Based on what I‚Äôve told you so far, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you for thinking it was a good thing to cut this blatant, parasitic, fund sucking waste of money, but once I‚Äôve explained what those ‚Äúblips‚Äù are, you may be calling your representative's office.

‚ÄúBlip‚Äù is a very benign term we used when referring to detections of electromagnetic anomalies across a network of magnetometer arrays around the globe. The technical term for these anomalies is ‚ÄúExtra-Dimensional Incursions‚Äù. These Incursions are‚Ä¶ well, we‚Äôre not exactly sure what they are, but they can be dangerous. When a blip manifests, it releases an amount of energy proportional to its size where it emerges. A Category 1 blip, for example, would produce enough energy to cause a light to flicker, a Category 2 would cause that same light to burst, a Category 3 is roughly the amount of energy produced by firing a 9 millimeter pistol, and it just gets worse from there.

For the past six years, I was one of the few techs who were responsible for follow-up investigations after a blip manifested and caused damage in a populated area. It usually consisted of phone calls, sending emails for surveillance footage, gathering police reports, and posing as an insurance adjuster ‚Äì anything to get every bit of data we could for these incursions.

I know that when I first heard all of this, I didn't think it was such a big deal, but since then, I‚Äôve seen a few things that changed my mind. I‚Äôve seen a Cat. 4 emerge inside the engine bay of a parked Buick LeSabre in a small town in Vermont, sending its hood and other metal bits flying in all directions, killing a cow in a nearby field, a Cat. 3 pop up in the left nostril of a city official during a town hall meeting in Quebec, blowing his nose clean off of his face, a Cat. 5 completely annihilate a fish farm in Bulgaria raining chunks of catfish into the neighboring Oblast‚Ä¶ You get the picture.

The worst I've ever seen was a borderline Cat. 6 just after I started that leveled a high rise. Fortunately, this was in the center of a ghost city in Northern China so there were very few casualties. The CCP claimed it was an intentional demolition but the CCTV footage we‚Ä¶ acquired‚Ä¶ and our magnetometers, told a different story.

If you're anything like I was after seeing that, you're probably suspiciously eying that flickering lamp on your desk and wondering what is the biggest event ever recorded. Confirmed? The 2020 Beirut explosion was a Cat. 8.

Unconfirmed, on the other hand, is a bit scarier. If you've ever heard of the ‚ÄúTunguska Event‚Äù, you can skip this history lesson, but for those of you who are typing ‚Äúbless you‚Äù in the comments, here you go:

On June 30th, 1908, in rural Siberia, an explosion estimated to be between 3 and 50 megatons created a shockwave that flattened over 800 square miles of Forrest, and broke windows hundreds of miles away. No crater, just carnage. For reference, both nukes we dropped on Japan added up to only 36 kilotons. 

The best explanation that we‚Äôve had for the explosion was a 200 foot wide asteroid that blew up at airliner cruising altitude, but no confirmed fragments have been found.

Obviously, the array or any other EM recording equipment was around then, but comparing the records and evidence to known incursions along with residual EM readings from Siberia, we're fairly confident in claiming it as the largest Incursion ever recorded.


‚ÄòYeah, this is all pretty wild, but you guys were just essentially book keepers‚Äô... I hear you, but we actually did stuff with the data we collected to try and predict events. Before our office was dissolved, we were able to predict an Incursion 30 seconds before it happened‚Ä¶ As I'm typing it out, I can see how insignificant that seems, but coming from no warning at all to half of a minute is monumental given what we have to work with. Our goal was to create an early warning system, but that's all out the window now.

I know I said earlier that we don't exactly know what is causing the Incursions, but we, well the egghead physicists I worked with, have a theory ‚Äì a theory that, I hope to God, is absolutely wrong.

The blips are like fish (just go with me here). One of our techs was a marine biology major who took the first job with NOAA she could get and wound up with us. She made the comment one day after a series of minor blips that the smaller ones reminded her of fish jumping out of the water and larger ones like whales breaching. We laughed until one of our physicists nearly choked on his coffee before opening Excel spreadsheets faster than the computer could handle it. After a short while, he had converted all of the blip data we had to a .csv file and plugged the data into our mapping software. We all gathered around his screen as he pulled up the world map and scrubbed through the timeline.

It looked like schools of fish jumping from the water all across the globe. There would be hundreds of Cat. 1 through 4‚Äôs before a 5 or a 6 would pop up, then the pattern would repeat over years of data, all over the world.  We ran the timeline before the larger Incursions and we found a pattern; The more small incursions that occur means a larger one will follow.

Someone asked why fish breach like that. Her answer was simply ‚Äú... To get away from the bigger fish‚Äù.

So, extra dimensional fish jump into our plane of existence to get away from being eaten by an even larger extra dimensional fish, and they all wreck shit when they do. So what?

Guys, I'm not going to sugar coat this because you deserve to know the truth. Our office is gone. No one is working on bettering our early warning system, no one is working on how to prevent Incursions. Maybe some other government has people on it, I don't know, but if they do, they never made themselves known.

Yeah, we can deal with a few explosions here and there, but that's not the problem. Before we shut the doors on our office, we saw the largest number and most concentrated areas of blips than have ever been recorded.

There's an Incursion coming, and I don't think the world will be the same when it breaches.",2,1757219881.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Set the barrel on a wooden pallet and used the new garden hose (labeled drinking water safe, from Home Depot) to fill it. Poured in the chlorine dioxide, ratcheted the plug shut, and voila! 55 gallons of drinking water just waiting.

I had been considering water bricks for more portable storage, but they're expensive and heavy, and I don't need to stack water in a closet. Joe Vogel, in his Field Guide to Clean Drinking Water, points out that commercially-sealed water stays clean indefinitely, and also that plastic bottles last a long time if not exposed to sunlight. Cases of bottled water it is, set on shelves off the concrete. (I have read that it's bad to store water directly on concrete. Don't know why, but putting all the water up on pallets and shelves to be safe.)

Then there's water collection and purification. I have a rain barrel set up, but of course it's plastic and out in the sun. I think of getting a couple of steel trash cans to use after the plastic barrel cracks.

Have a small Sawyer filter for the go bag. The solar oven will pasteurize water, and might even distill. Need to practice that and study Vogel for details on distillation. Have lots of paper coffee filters to strain out dirt and some Aqua tabs for purification. Need more tabs and maybe powdered bleach.

Going to try out using a coffee filter with a canning jar and ring. If it works it could also be used with cloth. The jars could be shared with neighbors.

Even before we were disbanded, you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to find any record of our office other than an unaccounted-for one hundred or so million in NOAA‚Äôs annual budget report.

When a blip manifests, it releases an amount of energy proportional to its size where it emerges. A Category 1 blip, for example, would produce enough energy to cause a light to flicker, a Category 2 would cause that same light to burst, a Category 3 is roughly the amount of energy produced by firing a 9 millimeter pistol, and it just gets worse from there.

For the past six years, I was one of the few techs who were responsible for follow-up investigations after a blip manifested and caused damage in a populated area. It usually consisted of phone calls, sending emails for surveillance footage, gathering police reports, and posing as an insurance adjuster ‚Äì anything to get every bit of data we could for these incursions.

I know that when I first heard all of this, I didn't think it was such a big deal, but since then, I‚Äôve seen a few things that changed my mind. I‚Äôve seen a Cat. 4 emerge inside the engine bay of a parked Buick LeSabre in a small town in Vermont, sending its hood and other metal bits flying in all directions, killing a cow in a nearby field, a Cat. 3 pop up in the left nostril of a city official during a town hall meeting in Quebec, blowing his nose clean off of his face, a Cat. 5 completely annihilate a fish farm in Bulgaria raining chunks of catfish into the neighboring Oblast‚Ä¶ You get the picture.

If you're anything like I was after seeing that, you're probably suspiciously eying that flickering lamp on your desk and wondering what is the biggest event ever recorded. Confirmed? The 2020 Beirut explosion was a Cat. 8.

Unconfirmed, on the other hand, is a bit scarier. If you've ever heard of the ‚ÄúTunguska Event‚Äù, you can skip this history lesson, but for those of you who are typing ‚Äúbless you‚Äù in the comments, here you go:

On June 30th, 1908, in rural Siberia, an explosion estimated to be between 3 and 50 megatons created a shockwave that flattened over 800 square miles of Forrest, and broke windows hundreds of miles away. No crater, just carnage. For reference, both nukes we dropped on Japan added up to only 36 kilotons. 

The best explanation that we‚Äôve had for the explosion was a 200 foot wide asteroid that blew up at airliner cruising altitude, but no confirmed fragments have been found.

Obviously, the array or any other EM recording equipment was around then, but comparing the records and evidence to known incursions along with residual EM readings from Siberia, we're fairly confident in claiming it as the largest Incursion ever recorded.


‚ÄòYeah, this is all pretty wild, but you guys were just essentially book keepers‚Äô... I hear you, but we actually did stuff with the data we collected to try and predict events. Before our office was dissolved, we were able to predict an Incursion 30 seconds before it happened‚Ä¶ As I'm typing it out, I can see how insignificant that seems, but coming from no warning at all to half of a minute is monumental given what we have to work with. Our goal was to create an early warning system, but that's all out the window now.

I know I said earlier that we don't exactly know what is causing the Incursions, but we, well the egghead physicists I worked with, have a theory ‚Äì a theory that, I hope to God, is absolutely wrong.

The blips are like fish (just go with me here). One of our techs was a marine biology major who took the first job with NOAA she could get and wound up with us. She made the comment one day after a series of minor blips that the smaller ones reminded her of fish jumping out of the water and larger ones like whales breaching. We laughed until one of our physicists nearly choked on his coffee before opening Excel spreadsheets faster than the computer could handle it. After a short while, he had converted all of the blip data we had to a .csv file and plugged the data into our mapping software. We all gathered around his screen as he pulled up the world map and scrubbed through the timeline.

It looked like schools of fish jumping from the water all across the globe. There would be hundreds of Cat. 1 through 4‚Äôs before a 5 or a 6 would pop up, then the pattern would repeat over years of data, all over the world.  We ran the timeline before the larger Incursions and we found a pattern; The more small incursions that occur means a larger one will follow.

Someone asked why fish breach like that. Her answer was simply ‚Äú... To get away from the bigger fish‚Äù.

So, extra dimensional fish jump into our plane of existence to get away from being eaten by an even larger extra dimensional fish, and they all wreck shit when they do. So what?

Guys, I'm not going to sugar coat this because you deserve to know the truth. Our office is gone. No one is working on bettering our early warning system, no one is working on how to prevent Incursions. Maybe some other government has people on it, I don't know, but if they do, they never made themselves known.

Yeah, we can deal with a few explosions here and there, but that's not the problem. Before we shut the doors on our office, we saw the largest number and most concentrated areas of blips than have ever been recorded.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Equipment

Brewing coffee at a campsite can be a delightful experience. The smell of fresh coffee mingling with nature‚Äôs scent is invigorating. But, choosing the right equipment is crucial for this experience. It ensures you get the perfect cup without hassle. With limited space and resources, portable and efficient equipment is key.

# Portable Coffee Makers

Portable coffee makers are perfect for camping. They are compact and easy to carry. Many designs are available to suit different needs. Some are lightweight, fitting in your backpack easily. Look for ones with easy cleaning features. Consider the brewing time too. Fast brewing models save time, letting you enjoy more of the outdoors.

# Manual Brewing Methods

Manual brewing methods offer simplicity and control. They don‚Äôt need electricity or batteries. A French press or a pour-over setup works well. These methods enhance the flavor of the coffee. They are easy to use, even for beginners. Manual methods also connect you with the brewing process. Enjoy the ritual of making coffee at your campsite.

# Selecting The Perfect Coffee Beans

When you‚Äôre camping, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can transform your experience, turning a simple morning into a memorable one. But, to achieve that perfect cup, you must start with selecting the right coffee beans. This choice can make or break your campfire coffee adventure. With countless options available, how do you pick the best beans for your outdoor brew?

# Types Of Coffee Beans

Understanding the types of coffee beans is crucial. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild flavor. They are perfect if you enjoy a subtle taste. On the other hand, Robusta beans offer a stronger, bolder flavor with higher caffeine content. If you need a wake-up jolt, Robusta might be your go-to.

Have you ever considered trying a blend? Combining Arabica and Robusta can offer a balanced taste profile. Think about your taste preferences and how they align with your camping vibe.

# Storage Tips For Freshness

Preserving the freshness of your coffee beans is essential. Keep your beans in an airtight container to prevent exposure to air and moisture. This helps maintain their aroma and flavor.

Store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight and heat sources, as they can degrade your beans‚Äô quality. You want your coffee to be as fresh on your last camping day as it was on your first.

Have you ever experienced stale coffee on a camping trip? It‚Äôs not pleasant. Proper storage ensures every sip is as delightful as the first.

Choosing the right coffee beans and storing them well can elevate your camping coffee experience. What‚Äôs your favorite type of coffee bean for a morning in the wild? Let‚Äôs make that campsite coffee unforgettable.

# Water Quality And Temperature

Choosing the right water quality and temperature is key to making great coffee at a campsite. Use fresh, filtered water and heat it to just below boiling. This ensures a flavorful and smooth cup, perfect for enjoying the great outdoors.

I have been taking non-stimulant ADHD medication for a couple of months, but it did not help, so I switched to Atomoxetine and Concerta around December‚ÄìJanuary.

I did not notice any improvement in my concentration with Concerta, so I increased my dosage from 18mg ‚Üí 27mg ‚Üí 36mg ‚Üí 54mg. However, I still did not see any changes, so my doctor lowered it back to 18mg. After that, I raised it back to 36mg.

After consciously monitoring my concentration levels, I found that Concerta only lasted 4‚Äì5 hours for me, with 7 hours being the maximum (this only happened once).

I live in East Asia, where most ADHD medications are banned, so I don‚Äôt really have any other options. I asked to take Concerta twice a day so I could extend its effects. Yesterday was my first time taking two pills.

I took a 27mg pill at 8:00 am, but I soon started feeling strange. I could tell that my cognitive abilities were not normal, so at 12:30 pm I took an 18mg pill. This did not improve my cognition, and I immediately started feeling brain fog. I could not concentrate at all and could not remember things I had just heard seconds earlier. I also drank coffee that day (coffee had never caused side effects for me with Concerta before), so I thought maybe the coffee was causing this.

Today, I took the same pills at about the same times, but without coffee. However, my cognitive abilities are still declining, the brain fog is continuing, I can‚Äôt remember simple words, and now I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe easily (it feels like a heavy blanket or pressure on my lungs, though not severe).

I tried calling a government drug side effect reporting organization, but they are closed today because it is Sunday where I live.

I‚Äôm a bit shy at first but super bubbly once I‚Äôm comfy and I‚Äôm all about deep convos and sharing playlists. Looking for a guy around 20 28 who‚Äôs kind nerdy and up for adventures like hitting arcades or binge watching a new series together. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into RPGs or can debate the best Pokemon gen! I‚Äôm open to local or long distance as long as we vibe and keep it real.

I‚Äôve recently started exploring the Bhagavad Gita, and it‚Äôs been such a refreshing journey for me helping me reflect on life, purpose, and love for God in a way that feels very grounding. I‚Äôm not Hindu (but i m an indian :) and I‚Äôm not looking at ‚Äúconversion‚Äù or anything like that‚Äîthis is more about spirituality, wisdom, and connecting with people who feel the same pull towards deeper meaning in life.

I‚Äôm craving genuine connections with like-minded souls here in Calgary who‚Äôd love to:
‚Ä¢Read and reflect on the Gita together (in a casual, open-minded way)
. Share thoughts on spirituality, purpose, and self-growth
‚Ä¢Build friendships rooted in positivity, kindness, and love for God (in whatever way you connect with Him)
‚Ä¢Maybe even gather for small satsangs (spiritual hangouts), coffee chats, or walks while discussing these ideas

For me, it‚Äôs about enjoying each other‚Äôs company, lifting each other up, and walking this journey together. No religious labels‚Äîjust love, wisdom, and friendship.

If this resonates with you, drop a comment or DM me! Let‚Äôs see if we can create a little spiritual circle right here in Calgary ‚ú®

1najqxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/1najqxx/as_a_man_as_you_get_older_your_value_improves_my/,"As a man, As you get Older Your Value Improves. My Personal Experience:","Edit: First to preface, what I mean by ""value"" is in the worldly terms. Regarding the real value of the Deen and Akhirah, that is only determined by Allah SWT. This post is referring only to the worldly lense.


As one of the fundamental aspects discussed on the sub time and time, a lot of you may have recognized my style of writing, I'm one of the oldest contributors on the sub, many of my older accounts are banned now. I will share my own experiences now.

But one of the fundamental things we have always discussed is, women are born with value, whereas for men we have to accumulate value.

A 18 year old guy, who's just finished high school, (we're talking from a worldy lense) no woman (very few) would give any chance to this man. Whereas the same 18 year old young woman, she will have lines of proposals, and yet she has no life experience in the worldly lense her ""value"" is alot. Why? Youth and beauty. The same guy in this age category while the hormones may be raging, nobody will give their daughter to him, and very few women or any will give a chance.

As men, as we get older and acquire resources the value and the recognition I have seen is astonishing. I've been writing here for a long time, from all kinds of posts. I have much more haters on here, then people who have gotten value, but anyway.


Alot has changed for me in the last 5 years, Alhamdulillah started traveling, have been to 36 countries, never knew about tours, I used to make lots of tips working in a night **** before COVID and obviously changed the ways as that's all haram money. 

Had to find a way, to, (was always a good public speaker Alhamdulillah) to make into a halal way. Never cared much about school, while I'm pursuing an MBA on the side, someone recommended and said you'd be a great tour guide. So I started working as a tour guide 4 years ago, and summers have been working across mid the west, North East US and parts of Canada doing those big bus tours, and then this year started my own small business. 


Alhamdulillah almost netted 200ish net in the last 5 months alone, as obviously it's a seasonal business, not bad at all for someone who's about to turn 25. Alhamdulillah.

Life now is, for the next 2 years scale this baby up, work like crazy (16-18 hour days) in the summer, only time I've been getting is work, pray, focus on my hifz revision and sleep. That's it. I down at least 6 black coffees a day to get me through the day.

But it's all worth it. Hard work never goes to waste, and Allah swt surely blesses as the barakah is in business.

My post is not meant to be ""oh look at me blah blah"". Nah. All praise be to Allah for everything, He can give, and take it in a second. The reason I'm making this post is so that, I find alot of other brothers may not know and feel hopeless, but believe me, as you get older it truly does get better. But it never comes easy. I worked my ass off, and especially as the only one running the show, (online bookings) and doing all the tours on my own, it truly gets exhausting but when you see the money coming in, it's all worth it. As it's coming to the end of the season now, I've almost lost my voice, but after giving almost 400 tours (multiple tours a day) and garnering over 300 5 star reviews, it's all definitely worth it.

And the way the seasonal business it works out for Ramadan, as I now have the freedom to lead taraweeh wherever I want from my old connections. IA next year I'll be leading in Guyana. It gives one freedom for religious obligations.

Brothers, doesn't matter if you have nothing, or something, keep giving charity. If you're struggling, either looking for a job, or don't know what to do with your life, give Sadaqah. Never miss your prayers. WAllahi you will see the impact of this on your life. There are many many fundamental benefits of charity and I made a post on this long time back, 

https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/s/rkfbuF6iOb

Whatever amount you give, as long as it's sincerely for the sake of Allah, you will see how easy your life gets. Not just in the barakah of life, but rizq which includes money as well. And just see how fast it gets multiplied in ways you can't imagine.

I started this business, as a big risk, and Alhamdulillah the feedback has been incredible for being a one man no show.

Your value as a man will improve alot, as long as you put your energy in the right things. It's crazy. Lol. Bought myself a Audi S5 Cabriolet a very eye catching decently fast car, and I dress in a very old school style, long coats, dress pants etc, and definitely I can see the ""attention."" Obviously being in the ""people business"" I can talk and communicate with literally anyone, so it's just interesting. Made so many connections from all the world, at this point I have like 3k contacts on my what's app, in which I have forgotten many of the people as so many people have came and gone. The good thing is, because In the winters I travel, by next May I'll be done adventuring 52 countries iA. And alot of these people I meet from different countries, they tell me all the best spots in their countries and give all the ""inside information."" So when I visit there, it's a win/win.

Alot of the OGs of this sub may know, we always discussed these things in the past. Alot of other posts were made by other contributors regarding the SMV (sexual market place value) and yes, definitely as we get older it gets alot better. The same women my age now, if they didn't make the right choices, well... You see? In the end, I'm a firm believer of Allah giving us the choice, and certainly if we make wrong decisions whether sinning in Dunya/akhirah wise, or anything Dunya wise, we reap what we sew. That's it. But obviously Dua and what have you, can do miracles.

Their (alot of our kweens) hey day is very limited. Very. For men, we build our value from 18 to 30s and depending how you do, you have your pick..

Alhamdulillah, I'm about to hit 25, because of my beard I look older, and it's a good thing.

So yes, it's definitely possible. As some random who's been known as the ""brokie, insel, loser"" ü§£ü§£ü§£ (names I've been called after receiving at least 50 hate DMS from my 5 year of Reddit posts by them strong, free hijabi kweens) if I can do it, you can too!


Definitely doesn't come easy. You have to work for it, but even in this ""recession economy"" you can make it. Your rizq was pre destined and written, but you gotta work for it, and find it. Obviously the halal way.

May Allah make it easy for all of us, and give us the best of the best, in the deen, Dunya, and Akhirah, and remember me in your Duas as well!",19,1757218597.0,TraditionalMuslims,2,0.94,False
