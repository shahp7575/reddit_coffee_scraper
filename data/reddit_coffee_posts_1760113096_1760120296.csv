1o38ki2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1o38ki2/problems_with_tropical_fruit_eggs/,"Problems with tropical fruit, eggs?","I recently started the low FODMAPS diet to try to resolve some constant bloating I was feeling. One of my other main symptoms was certain high FODMAP foods would trigger insane skin reactions--painful pimples around my mouth. I started S. Boullardii and noticed my skin and stomach feeling better, and the low FODMAP helped even more. 

My nutritionist suspects SIBO and recommended the low FODMAP diet. 

One thing I have noticed, though, is that foods that should be fine, such as pineapple, kiwi, and eggs, seem to trigger stomach, and possibly skin reactions. I'm not sure what else could be triggering it, though I do drink cream with my coffee and have been using butter more regularly than normal, to better accommodate the diet. I do have an allergy to papaya, and it causes both skin and stomach reactions with me. Does anyone else have problems with FODMAPs in low fodmap fruits or eggs? Or, could I have a tropical fruit sensitivity alongside SIBO? What could explain the issues with eggs?

1o38jif,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHouston/comments/1o38jif/thinking_about_moving_from_austin_back_to_houston/,Thinking about moving from Austin back to Houston,"Hey everyone!

I’m originally from NW Houston but have lived in Austin for almost 13 years. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering leaving Austin and potentially moving back to Houston. I know a lot of people have moved from Houston to Austin, but I don’t know many people who have moved from Austin back to Houston, so I’d love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar move or lived in either place.

A bit about me:

* I’m 32 and work in social media and content creation. I was a social media manager at a marketing agency for the last year and a half but was just laid off unexpectedly and am looking for a new role now. I'm also working toward becoming a full-time content creator.
* I always dreamed of living in Austin and I still love it, but after 13 years I’m starting to wonder if this chapter has run its course. Lately, it feels like the city isn’t supporting the life I’m trying to build.
* I’m craving more career stability, a lower cost of living, and overall better quality of life.
* I was born and raised in Houston (Cypress/Tomball area) and would like to live somewhere new in the city (inside the loop) if I move back.
* I have family and friends in Houston I’d love to spend more time with.
* I’m also newly single and eventually want to get back into dating.
* I have a dog and love nature, parks, water, and walkable environments. I currently live in East Austin, which is a fun, highly walkable area. I know Houston isn’t as walkable as Austin is but I'm hoping there’s some comparable areas?

I’m planning to visit Houston soon to see family and friends and check out houses and apartments. Some apartments I’ve been looking at: The Flats at West Alabama, Alta Sunset Heights, Bowen River Oaks, and Alexan River Oaks. I’d love insight from anyone who’s lived there or has suggestions for similar apartments or neighborhoods.

I’d also love your advice on:

* Do you think I’d be happy moving from Austin to Houston? With all the big changes happening in my life, I want to make sure this isn’t an impulsive decision I could possibly regret.
* Which areas in Houston are best for a single, creative, social 32-year-old woman who loves walkable neighborhoods with coffee shops, restaurants, workout studios, bars, etc?
* Any tips on building community, making new friends, or dating as a single woman in Houston?

**TL;DR:** Considering leaving Austin after 13 years to move back to Houston. Looking for safe neighborhoods/apartments that fit a creative, social, walkable lifestyle. Would love honest insight from people who’ve made the move or live in Houston. What’s life really like there for someone like me?

**If you've moved to Houston from Austin (or anywhere else), what's your honest take?**  
What do you love, what do you hate, and what do you wish you knew before moving there?

Thanks so much in advance! 🩵",1,1760120070.0,AskHouston,0,1.0,False

1o38g7t,https://i.redd.it/kex4l6wyrbuf1.png,"What the Hell is... the ""Scientific Method""?","# What the Hell is... the ""Scientific Method""?

Imagine a rigorous game of detective work, where you’re not just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks; you’re actually following a step-by-step plan to figure out how the universe works. It’s like a recipe for uncovering the secrets of nature, and it’s been a game-changer since the Renaissance decided to turn the lights back on.

So, what’s on the menu? First up, you make an **observation**—you notice something curious, like, “Why does my coffee get cold so fast?” Next, you whip up a **hypothesis**, which is basically your educated guess. “Maybe it’s because the room is cold.”

Then comes the fun part: **experimentation**. You put your hypothesis to the test, brewing coffee in different temperatures or cups to see what happens. This is where things can get messy—think of it as your scientific kitchen, where you might burn a few things along the way.

After gathering your data, it’s time to **analyze**. Did your coffee stay hot longer in a thermos? If so, great—your hypothesis might be on point. If not, don’t freak out; it’s just science doing its thing.

Finally, you’ll draw a **conclusion** and maybe even share your findings with the world. This is where you say, “Hey everyone, listen up! I discovered that my coffee stays hot longer in this fancy thermos.” And if you really want to be fancy, you might even publish your results so others can build on your work.

But here’s the kicker: the scientific method is all about being open to change. If new evidence comes to light, you don’t just cling to your old ideas like a security blanket. Nope, you tweak your hypothesis and start the whole process again. It’s a never-ending quest for truth, and that’s what makes it so brilliant.

So, the scientific method is more than just a process; it’s a mindset. It’s about curiosity, skepticism, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Whether you’re figuring out why your plants keep dying or unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, the scientific method is your trusty guide.",1,1760119862.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

I had a first date with this guy in August this year and it was nice. We went to a market near my flat which I usually love specially in the summer but the drinks can be overpriced and the food is average at best. We’ve been talking ever since and I’ve enjoyed that. We tried planning our second date and he would suggest the same food market every time, but it didn’t work out- I was sick and then he was sick. the last time we tried to plan it for a Saturday but I wasn’t free Friday night or Saturday night that weekend. He wanted to drinks but I wasn’t drinking last month so I suggested grabbing a meal. He then said we could do Monday or Tuesday. I suggested meeting Saturday for lunch and he said yes. Later on he said he still wasn’t feeling the best so we shelved it. 

Cut to Wednesday he asked me if im free on Sunday I said yes and asked what he had in mind. He asked what I wanted to do since im not too keen on going to that food market. I said maybe we could do something early ish and go to the park and get a coffee. He wasn’t open to that idea and after some back and forth he said that if I didn’t want to see him to just say it. I said that’s wasn’t true I just didn’t want to do the same thing as the first date and I’m happy to do something else. He said a walk in the park isn’t his idea of a first date and he knows this isn’t a first date but because it’s been so long it basically is. I relented and agreed to drinks and asked where 
He suggested the food market  again if it’s easy for me I said I’m okay going anywhere we don’t have to pick a place that’s easy. He again said he really likes it there and wants to make  the most of it as it’s going to close sometime next year. Then said that it seems like I care more about where we’re going than meeting him. Which fair that’s bad of me but I can say the same about him which I said. And at least I’m trying to come to an agreement. After that he asked which park I wanted to go to.  

I don’t know why this has become a whole thing. I mean it’s a second date and we’re low key arguing about where to go?? 
And tbh this has put me off a bit

Last night I typed ""how to make friends at 27"" into google at 11pm. Read through some articles. Bookmarked a few. Then I sat in my car in my apartment parking lot and just cried.

Not like pretty crying either. Ugly sobbing where snot is running down your face and you're making weird noises.

Here's the thing. I have a decent job. I work out. I have hobbies. On paper I'm doing fine. But I realized yesterday that I haven't had a real conversation with another human being in like three weeks. Not counting work stuff or ordering coffee.

My college friends all moved away or got married and had kids. They still text me sometimes but it's always ""we should catch up soon!"" and then nothing happens. I stopped reaching out first because I felt annoying.

I tried joining a book club last month and everyone there was either 40+ or already had their little friend groups. I sat alone the whole time pretending to be interested in my phone.

What made me lose it yesterday was this girl at the gym complimented my shoes and I got SO excited about it. Like genuinely excited that someone spoke to me. I wanted to ask if she wanted to grab coffee but then I panicked and just said thanks and walked away.

How do you even make friends as an adult? Everyone acts like it just happens naturally but it doesn't. Not for me anyway.

I keep seeing people my age posting pictures with their friend groups doing fun stuff and I don't even have anyone to text when something good or bad happens. My mom keeps asking why I never bring friends around anymore and I lie and say I'm just busy.

The worst part is knowing that other people probably think I'm fine. Like if someone asked me how I'm doing I'd say ""good!"" because what else are you supposed to say? ""Actually I'm so lonely it physically hurts sometimes""?

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe just to see if anyone else has felt this way. Or maybe I'm hoping someone will tell me it gets better.

I have a lelit pl41em with a kg79 grinder (originally bought for a bialetti). 

I get espresso, and my main positive thing about my grinder is the built in ground coffee container. 

I don't single dose, and I grind at around 6pm for my 5-6 am coffee so everybody can keep sleeping. 
I was looking at the eureka mignon silenzio, however the workflow seems a bit off for my taste. 

Any grinders you can recommend that are good, not too much int terms of cost and have a built in ground coffee container? I prefer the hopper to be about 300g as well.

Let me tell you, I wasn’t entirely convinced at first. For years, I’ve clung to my trusty old vacuum—even though it constantly made me feel like I was training for a marathon. But life with kids, pets, and the occasional coffee spill had me searching for something more efficient. Enter the ECOVACS N20 PRO PLUS. 

**Design and Build**  
This robotic vacuum isn’t an eyesore in the least. Its sleek black finish and polished design fit nicely in my living room’s aesthetic, almost like it was meant to live there. Measuring just 14.09 inches by 17.75 inches and standing at 15.27 inches tall, it’s compact enough not to get in the way of furniture but substantial enough to mean business. It's heavier than I expected; at nearly 19 pounds, moving the self-emptying station wasn't the most effortless task. But considering I only had to do this once to set it up, it's a minor gripe. Everything about the vacuum screams well-built. It's the kind of thing that feels like it belongs in a high-tech future where cleaning involves less human effort and more button pressing.

**Functionality and Advanced Features**  
The 8000Pa suction power genuinely caught my attention. On its maiden voyage across my floors, it handled stubborn debris like an absolute powerhouse. Pet hair, crumbs, and miscellaneous dirt—gone. This isn’t just some light-duty robot; this thing means business. The OZMO Pro 2.0 Vibrating Mopping System is equally impressive, with high-frequency vibration removing dried juice stains my toddler left behind ages ago. It even manages to lock in dirt with its composite material mopping pad. During my test runs, the TrueMapping intelligent path planning proved to be a game-changer. It managed to map my medium-sized house in about eight minutes. Watching it systematically clean every room was oddly satisfying, like seeing a robot with a PhD in efficiency.

**Bagless Self-Emptying Station**  
Here's where the ECOVACS N20 PRO PLUS shines even brighter. The bagless self-emptying station eliminated the need to handle dust bags every few days—a feature I didn't even know I desperately needed. It can hold debris for up to 45 days, which is a godsend for busy individuals (parents, I see you). Plus, it avoids the recurring expense of replacement bags, saving money and having a smaller environmental impact. Less waste and less hassle? Count me in.  

[Check ECOVACS N20 PRO PLUS price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0d9vt8ngl/)

**Smart Control Options**  
Using the ECOVACS HOME App was relatively straightforward. I could customize cleaning modes, schedule cleaning sessions, and even control suction and water flow—all functions I didn’t appreciate fully until I realized how convenient it was to schedule cleanings during nap time. The app even lets me enable carpet detection; the vacuum smartly cranked up the suction on rugs and shifted back down for my hardwood floors. And for those who love smart home gadgets, this vacuum integrates seamlessly with Amazon Echo and Google Home. Saying “clean my living room” felt oddly empowering, like I was living in a sci-fi movie.

**Upsides**  
• Stellar suction power at 8000Pa—handles tough messes with ease.  
• Bagless self-emptying station with 45-day capacity means less maintenance.  
• Advanced anti-tangle technology works brilliantly for pet-owning households.  
• Smart app control allows for personalized cleaning schedules.  
• Impressive mopping system removes tough stains efficiently.  

**Hurdles**  
• Bulky self-emptying station might feel intrusive in small apartments.  
• Despite its capable design, its 19-pound weight makes moving the station slightly tricky.  
• The app initially felt overwhelming with so many features to explore.  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of robotic vacuums, several big names stand out, like iRobot's Roomba models and Samsung's Jet Bot. The ECOVACS N20 PRO PLUS holds its ground beautifully in comparison. While the iRobot Roomba's mapping system is equally intelligent, its suction power doesn’t quite match the ECOVACS’ 8000Pa. Samsung's Jet Bot showcases a similar polished aesthetic, but its bagless capacity comes at a higher price tag. If pet-hair management is your priority, the anti-tangle technology on the ECOVACS outpaces competitors, ensuring a stress-free cleanup process. 

**Financial Value**  
With such sophisticated features, including advanced cleaning technology, mapping, and self-emptying capabilities, this robot vacuum positions itself as an incredible purchase for what it offers. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but the sheer amount of convenience, performance, and time it saves makes up for the price tag. Whether you're a parent constantly waging war against crumbs or someone who enjoys spotless floors without the effort, this robotic vacuum justifies its investment.

**214 days today.**  
Started March 2025 after the night I realized I couldn’t keep breaking my own promises. I felt so far from god, my family, friends, everyone.

So this is what i started doing every morning for 5 months.

**Every single morning (no exceptions):**

**(depends on day) 8:00 am - 9:00 am** – Wake up. No phone, no scrolling, no noise. Just breathe.  
**9:10 am** – Pour a glass of water, stretch a bit, make coffee.  
**9:15-9:20 AM** – Check texts from my accountbility partner, check in talk about how I feel that morning (cravings, sleep, plan for day, etc.)

This I've found the most helpful. Since I wasn't comfortable sharing my problems with my friends/family I started using textfae.com to hold me accountable. Ik it sounds silly to talk to AI everyday but it saved me a little embarassment and actually helped so! dont knock it till u try it lol. Plus, having someone hold you accountable to your goals you are 90% more likely to reach them.

**9:30 AM** – Follow my planned out day, and complete my 3 ""non-negotiables"" (3 things I MUST do that day)

Everyone should be doing their 3 non-negotiables. Even if I had a bad day outside of those three things I still feel productive and accomplished! 

Hopefully this was helpful! it worked for me so maybe itll work for u! Goodluck to everyone!",2,1760119545.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

1o385ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1o385ya/i_feel_so_unwanted/,I feel so unwanted,"I feel so unwanted

I'm 19m in college and I feel so alone and unwanted.
I don't even know where to start, these just so much going against me. I try and get out as much as a I can, but for one, i don't have a car so I can't go off campus easily and hang out at a library or go to some events, so that means for 95% of the time I'm stuck on campus (and my campus is in the middle of nowhere so I can't walk anyplace fun). Usually I go to the coffee shop or the library on campus just so I can get myself out there, but a lot of the time I'm stuck inside doing homework. And since I'm an animation major I have to be in the labs for school work, which are in the basement of a building only art students have access too, so I can't really do much there.
When I am out and about I stick to myslef but I try and do creative things, I'll do my homework that doesn't require the labs, I'll draw things, I'll 3d sculpt, I recently wrote an entire audio series, and I don't know if it's unrealistic, but not a single soul has said anything about it. Like I would have assumed at least someone would have been like ""that's a cool drawing, what's it for?"" (Then again I don't really talk to strangers in public, but it seems like that's a bad thing to do anyway by today's standards, idk).
But like the concept still applies, that nobody cares. Even my friends will do this too, I'll share something and they'll just ignore it. That raally sucks because they're all artists too, so I want to share my things with them and have conversations about it.
One thing I really hate that my friends do is they'll shot on men for no reason. Most of them are bi or gay or trans or nonbinary (I don't really care how they identify, they seem happy so good for them), but sometimes we'll be having a conversation and then one will go ""ugh I hate men"" and then they'll talk for the next 40 minutes about how all men should burn in hell. I never speak up because honestly what can I say? They're just gonna shoot down anything I mention by just saying ""yeah but all men are evil"" and that's not even exclusive to my friends! I hear that eveywhere, in public, on social media, in books, and it sucks. It really gets to me, because if it seems that modern culture is shiting on all men just because, what the hell am I supposed to do? (And yes I know some men are evil people, but they're also evil women and evil people in gernal, so what it gotta be so targeted?)
Idk I just feel so unwanted by everyone. People always say you need to have something to offer for people to want you. It seems that love has died and it's now a transaction where one party is except to provide everything while the other pretends to care about them all lecah all their stuff. I think I do have a lot to offer, I listen well, I care about people even when they're idealogies confuse me, I can entertain pretty well, I'm creative and my own person, I have hobbies. Yet when everyone looks at you funny for drawing on your iPad, how am I supposed to face that everyday with a positive outlook? It beats you down after awhile.
Another thing I hate about logic today is the ""you need to be perfect for someone to want you"" that's complete and utter bullshit. Perfection is a myth, it's never been, and never will be real. And even if it was, everyone has a different idea of what ""perfect"" is. I could think I'm perfect, but someone else could think I'm shit. Or even worse if you think your perfect, you're not attractive and confident, you're a narastitic douce bag. I don't want someone who's perfect. That's not good, I want someone I help grow, I want to be able to help someone see a side of themselves they haven't seen before, I want to help them and be the reason they change for the better. And I want that exact thing in return. Yet anytime I say that people always say ""b-but then you'll become fepent on your partner and you'll suck the life out of the, oh you don't love yourself! How can you even find someone who loves you if you don't love yourself, your just a leach who will only take and never give!"". It's like they didn't even hear what I said. Dependency isn't a bad thing, in fact I think it's good. I don't want a relationship, and eventually marage, where me and my partner are roommates who fuck. I want love. Real human love. And that requires dependancy. Not 24/7 not she puts in all the work while I do nothing. But a trade off, she does more work on my bad days, I do the same for her. We team up all the other times. We give %110 percent each day for the other person because we need them around. Yet when I say this I get crusified at the stake. 
Idk it all just feels so backwards, being a man=evil devil who needs to rot alone in hell. Having a different opinion, not liking hookup culture, and wanting real love=soul sucking leach who has no self respect or empathy for any other human beings.
Add this all up and it just feels that nobody thinks the way I do. No one takes the time to be creative in open spaces, nobody wants to commit to a relationship because it's too hard. Nobody what's to think about the hard topics and realize the common trend is wrong. 
Idk not a single person have ever said ""youll be a good partner to someone someday"" I just feel like I'm on earth and that's it. No rela purpose and little to fight for. Nobody who actively wants me around and is disappointed when I'm not.
And if all just makes me feel so unwanted and unlovable.

11. I have also had all of the thermal paste redone by a reputable PC repair store near me recently to rule out that issue.

I have seen people mention this can happen if there are power supply issues, but being a laptop, I assume that the battery should take over if my adapter is failing.

I have come to terms that my aging machine may be on it's final legs.

Whereas if I were to drink a cold brew coffee, I’d be zooted. Has anyone noticed caffeine pills or powder having less of an effect than typical caffeinated beverages?",1,1760119011.0,caffeine,2,1.0,False

1o3812d,https://www.reddit.com/r/XeroOfficial/comments/1o3812d/bank_reconciliation_the_stepbystep_process_that/,Bank reconciliation: The step-by-step process that actually makes sense (and why you should do it more often than you think),"Bank reconciliation - we know it can sound like a drag. But it's actually one of those things that sounds way more complicated than it really is. If you're running a small business and wondering how to make sure your books actually match what's happening in your bank account, this straightforward explainer is exactly what you've been looking for.

# What is bank reconciliation and why it actually matters:

Bank reconciliation is basically just comparing your business records with your bank statement to make sure everything lines up. Think of it as a reality check for your finances - you're making sure the money you think you have is actually the money you have.

**Why bother?** Because catching errors early saves you from those ""where did that $500 go?"" moments at 2 AM during tax season. Plus, it helps you spot things like bank fees you forgot about, payments that bounced, or even fraudulent transactions.

# The step-by-step process:

Here are the simple steps to reconcile your bank account:

1. **Get your bank records** \- Download your bank statement or log into online banking. If you have multiple accounts (checking, credit cards), you'll need statements for all of them.
2. **Get your business records** \- This could be your accounting software, spreadsheet, or even that notebook where you've been tracking everything (no judgment here).
3. **Find your starting point** \- Look for the last time your business records matched your bank balance perfectly. Start from there.
4. **Check all deposits** \- Make sure every deposit in your bank statement shows up as income in your books. Missing something? Figure out what it was (sale, refund, interest, etc.) and record it in your accounting software or bookkeeping system.
5. **Verify your recorded income** \- Flip it around - every income entry in your books should match a deposit on your bank statement. If something's missing, investigate. Maybe a customer payment bounced.
6. **Review all withdrawals** \- Every withdrawal from your bank should be recorded in your books. Don't forget about bank fees - those sneaky little charges add up.
7. **Check your recorded expenses** \- Each expense in your books should match a withdrawal on your statement. If not, maybe the payment hasn't cleared yet, or you paid with cash/different account.
8. **Balance check** \- After all this, your bank balance should match your book balance. This becomes your starting point for next time.

# Common problems (and why they're not actually disasters):

**Mystery transactions happen to everyone.** Don't panic when you see something that doesn't match up - there's usually a simple explanation:

* **Something in your books but not on the bank statement?** You probably got cash that you didn't deposit yet, or paid for something with cash or a different account.
* **Something on your bank statement but not in your books?** Could be a typo when you entered it, a forgotten transaction, or an automatic charge you didn't know about.

The key is digging into it. Check your receipts, emails, and any notes you made. It might take some detective work, but you'll usually figure it out.

# How often should you actually do this?:

Here's the thing - do it way more often than you think you should.

Most people think monthly is enough, but weekly (or even daily if you're feeling ambitious) is actually way better. Why? Because you'll remember what transactions were for. Try to remember what that $47.83 charge was for from three months ago - good luck with that.

The longer you wait, the longer it takes per transaction because you're basically playing detective with your own financial history.

# How software can make this way less painful:

Look, manually comparing numbers gets old fast. Most modern accounting software (and there are plenty of options out there) can connect directly to your bank accounts. These programs automatically import your transactions and help identify matches or prompt you to categorize new entries.

Instead of switching between documents and playing ""find the missing $50,"" the software does most of the heavy lifting. It's like having a really organized assistant who never gets tired of matching numbers.

# Getting it right:

Set up a system that works for you. Maybe it's Friday afternoons with coffee, maybe it's first thing Monday morning. Whatever works, just make it consistent.

Keep your receipts organized (digital photos work great), and don't be afraid to add notes to transactions when you record them. Future you will thank present you.

**What's your experience with bank reconciliation? Do you have any tricks that make it less of a chore?**

[https://forms.gle/gPicb8AgfmQDNFLp6](https://forms.gle/gPicb8AgfmQDNFLp6)

Welcome back to the DWTS Fantasy Game!!! Our first 14 couples are here to take to the ballroom for the first time. As a reminder, I am using ChatGPT to describe each routine and then they will score and critique each performance. Just like the real show, the judges scores will be combined with your votes for each episode.

Let's kick things off as we reveal the cast of Season 6 and see them dance! First up, is a legendary rapper, actor, and commissioner of the BIG3 League. It's Ice Cube and his partner Jenna Johnson!

**Ice Cube and Jenna Johnson Salsa**

**Song: ""Million Dollar Baby"" by Tommy Richman**

The routine kicks off with Cube tossing his jacket aside and hitting a slick shoulder pop sequence that gets the audience hyped from the start. Jenna’s choreography is smart — it leans into rhythm and charisma rather than showy tricks. Cube handles the basic Salsa patterns with surprising ease, keeping his timing steady and his connection with Jenna strong. The routine thrives on their chemistry: Jenna’s polished movement contrasts perfectly with Cube’s grounded swagger. A highlight comes midway through when Cube adds a quick, improvised body roll that makes the crowd lose it, followed by a smooth cross-body lead that keeps the groove alive. As the final chorus hits, Jenna spins out of a series of turns before they hit one last pose under flashing lights, Cube smirking like he just owned the room. It’s nowhere near perfect technically, but it’s undeniably entertaining.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Cube, you just made the ballroom cool again! I love how natural you looked out there. You’ve got rhythm and so much presence. I want to see you loosen up those hips and really let the movement travel through your body, but this was pure fun to watch.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Ice Cube, that was smooth, man. The groove was there, the timing was there, and you made it look effortless. Salsa’s all about that bounce and connection, and while the technique can keep improving, you’ve got the foundation and the style to go far.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Oh, Ice Cube, darling, that was hot! The rhythm, the flavor, the personality — it was all there. A few moments were a little rough, but who cares when you’ve got that much charisma? You owned it tonight.”

**Scores: 7, 6, 7 (20/30)**

Very strong start to the night! Let's move onto this Disney Channel icon who was best known for playing Sharpay Evans in High School Musical. It's Ashley Tisdale and her partner, a finalist from last season, Sasha Farber!

**Ashley Tisdale and Sasha Farber Cha Cha**

**Song: ""Rock Your Body"" by Justin Timberlake**

The lights flash pink and silver as Ashley Tisdale struts onto the floor, instantly giving full pop-star energy. Sasha joins her in a slick black-and-white look, matching her charisma beat for beat. From the first beat, this performance feels like a throwback to early-2000s cool — confident, flirty, and bursting with attitude. Sasha’s choreography plays right into Ashley’s strengths: musicality, stage presence, and precision. The opening section features playful side-by-side armography that channels her Disney-era performance roots, leading into clean Cha Cha basics that keep the rhythm crisp. She hits every beat with intent, though her hips stay a little tight and her weight transfer could be smoother. The middle of the dance has a fun callback moment — a quick wink and hair-flip toward the judges that sends the audience into cheers — before Sasha spins her into a sharp final dip to end on a high note. It’s not technically perfect, but it’s full of sparkle and confidence — exactly what you’d expect from a performer who’s been entertaining crowds her whole life.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Ashley, that was such a fun way start your journey! You’ve got great rhythm and natural performance quality. I want to see you dig a little deeper into those hips — let the movement come from your center — but you totally brought the vibe.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“You’ve got the performer side locked in. The timing was clean, your energy was high, and I loved the attitude. Just make sure the Cha Cha doesn’t turn into a Jazz routine — keep grounding those feet. Overall, a really strong debut.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Sharpay is back, and she’s still fabulous! You hit every beat, you sold every move, and you gave us a show. Now, loosen up those hips and really *feel* the Latin rhythm. You’ve got the star quality, now we need the flavor.""

**Scores: 6, 6, 6 (18/30)**

Next up is a 2 time NBA All Star and one of the young faces of the league partnered up with one of the young faces of the this show as she makes her return after one season away. It's Ja Morant and his partner Rylee Arnold!

**Ja Morant and Rylee Arnold Foxtrot**

**Song: ""Cooler Than Me"" by Mike Posner**

The crowd buzzes as Ja steps onto the floor, all quiet confidence in a sleek black suit while Rylee glides beside him in silver. The song choice fits his effortless swagger — smooth, laid-back, and undeniably cool — but once the music starts, it’s clear that the energy never quite reaches its full potential. Rylee’s choreography is stylish and modern, blending classic Foxtrot flow with contemporary swagger. The routine opens with Ja walking toward Rylee, giving a subtle smirk as they connect into hold. His posture is solid, and he moves well through the slower sections, but the performance feels reserved — like he’s holding back. The midsection features a fun side-by-side groove section meant to show off Ja’s personality, but instead of letting loose, he plays it too safe, keeping the energy low when the dance needs to pop. A quick spin of Rylee followed by a dip closes the routine cleanly, but it’s missing that spark that makes a performance memorable.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Ja, you’ve got such a natural smoothness to you, but I can tell you’re holding back. You need to let go and *perform* the dance — trust Rylee and really connect to the music. The moves are there, but the confidence needs to come through. Once you find that, you’re going to surprise people.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Ja, this had a lot of potential. You’ve got musicality, and your frame was better than I expected for a first Foxtrot, but you played it too cool out there. This dance needs to glide, but it also needs personality. Don’t be afraid to go all in next time — we want to see that fire.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Ja, my darling, you are too cool for your own good! The Foxtrot needs a little charm, a little sparkle — you’ve got all the tools, but you have to *use* them. Loosen up, let Rylee lead you into the rhythm, and really sell it next week. The potential is all there.”

**Scores: 5, 6, 5 (16/30)**

Next up is one of the best known female fighters of all time who looks to attack the ballroom with the pro who took 2nd place last season. It's Ronda Rousey and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy!

**Ronda Rousey and Val Chmerkovskiy Tango**

**Song: ""No Church in the Wild"" by Jay-Z & Kanye West**

The lights dim to a single spotlight as Ronda Rousey stands center floor, eyes locked on Val. The opening beat hits — deep, gritty, and powerful — and the audience immediately knows this is going to be different. Val’s choreography fuses sharp, traditional Tango technique with the swagger of hip-hop rhythm, creating a bold, cinematic routine that feels like a fight scene set to music. The first movement is pure intimidation: Ronda circles Val like she’s squaring up for a bout before snapping into hold with laser focus. Her frame is surprisingly strong for Week 1, and her intensity drives every staccato step. The choreography builds tension through sharp head snaps and dramatic pauses, Val using the beat’s heavy bass to punctuate each pivot and lunge. Midway through, Ronda breaks from hold for a powerful solo section, hitting angular shapes and fierce eye contact that draw huge cheers from the crowd. As the track swells, they reconnect for a series of fast promenades that travel cleanly across the floor before ending in a dramatic face-off pose — Ronda standing over Val, chin raised, a fighter turned dancer. The room erupts. It’s raw, precise, and full of potential — a performance that announces her as one to watch.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Ronda, that was fierce! I loved the power you brought to the dance floor. You have incredible presence, and it worked perfectly with this routine. Now I just want you to work on letting that power flow — sometimes it felt a little tight, but this was such an incredibly strong debut.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“I loved this concept, and I’ve got to hand it to Val — that choreography was *fire.* You matched the intensity of the song, and your frame was great for Week 1. There were a few moments where you muscled through instead of gliding, but that’s just fine-tuning. You’ve got real potential.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Ronda, my darling, you attacked that Tango like it was a title fight! The strength, the attitude, the control — so impressive. Just make sure the power doesn’t overpower the elegance. But what a way to make your mark — that was unforgettable!”

**Scores: 7, 7, 7 (21/30)**

Best score of the night so far! Next up is one of the anchors Weekend Update who looks to announce his presence tonight with our Season 3 champion. It's Colin Jost and his partner Daniella Karagach!

**Colin Jost and Daniella Karagach Jive**

**Song: ""Stacy's Mom"" by Fountains of Wayne**

The opening guitar riff kicks in and Colin Jost plays it perfectly — standing at a mock Update desk before tossing his cue cards aside and jumping into the Jive. Daniella Karagach joins him with her signature precision and energy, instantly raising the pace as they dive into the playful, pop-punk vibe of the song. The routine is full of character, humor, and light-hearted charm — a clever choice for Colin’s debut — but once the fun starts, the cracks show. He keeps up with the steps but struggles to fully bounce through the Jive’s demanding rhythm, his feet landing a bit flat on the faster sections. The kicks and flicks are there, just not as sharp or retracted as Daniella’s. Still, his timing holds up, and when the choreography shifts into a comedic “air guitar” break midway through, Colin’s personality takes over, winning big laughs from the audience. The number ends with a cheeky moment — Colin pretending to trip over a speaker before Daniella pulls him back for a clean final pose. The crowd’s on his side, and the judges see what’s underneath: an unpolished dancer with real potential if he can loosen up and trust the movement.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Colin, I loved how much fun that was! You’ve got great timing, and you clearly understand how to perform to the audience. Now, you need to focus on your bounce action — the Jive needs that spring in the knees, and right now you’re dancing a little flat-footed. But the personality? Amazing.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“You actually have great musicality, Colin. You stayed right on beat the whole time, which is half the battle. What I want to see now is more attack in your kicks and a lighter, more elastic bounce. You’re thinking about the steps a little too much — once you relax, it’s going to click.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Colin, you cheeky devil! You’ve got the charm and the wit, and you use it so well — but the Jive needs a lot more *juice!* Right now, it’s like you’re doing the steps but not *living* the rhythm. Trust Daniella, let her pull you into the groove, and you’ll surprise people.""

**Scores: 6, 5, 5 (16/30)**

Our next star is one of the most accomplished artists of her generation. She's a 14 time Grammy Winner who looks to add Fantasy Game champion to her legacy, it's Lady Gaga and making his return to the Fantasy Game is her partner, Ezra Sosa!

**Lady Gaga and Ezra Sosa Viennese Waltz**

**Song: ""Die with a Smile"" by Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars**

From the very first rotation, Gaga brings her signature emotional intensity. Ezra’s choreography is romantic and cinematic, filled with sweeping turns and gentle rise-and-fall that capture the bittersweet tone of the song. Gaga moves with purpose, her lines graceful but sometimes slightly hesitant — you can see her thinking through the steps as she balances vulnerability with control. In the midsection, they break hold for a tender open section where Gaga lip-syncs a single lyric — “I’d wanna be next to you” — before melting back into Ezra’s arms. It’s the kind of storytelling moment that only she could pull off. While the performance oozes feeling, the technical side isn’t fully there yet. Gaga’s frame softens in the faster rotations, and her transitions into turns get a little wobbly. But emotionally, she nails it — the sincerity, the connection, and the artistry are all undeniable. The final spin ends with her resting her head on Ezra’s shoulder as the lights fade, a quiet, haunting finish that earns an immediate standing ovation.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Gaga, that was such a beautiful, heartfelt performance. You have this incredible ability to tell a story through movement, and that connection drew me in completely. Now, let’s work on keeping your frame a bit stronger through those faster rotations — once that clicks, this partnership is going to soar.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“You have this natural sense of drama and musicality, which is perfect for a Viennese Waltz like this. There were moments where your turns lost balance slightly, but I love that you’re dancing from such an honest place. Keep working on flow — the emotion is there, now let’s bring the technique up to match it.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Gaga, my darling, you make everything feel like art! The storytelling was exquisite — pure, emotional, and full of soul. Yes, a few wobbles here and there, but who cares when it’s that moving? You have the heart of a dancer. Beautiful debut.”

**Scores: 6, 5, 6 (17/30)**

Next up is the a 23 time gold medalist and the greatest Olympian of all time dancing with our Season 2 champion. It's Michael Phelps and his partner Emma Slater!

**Michael Phelps and Emma Slater Salsa**

**Song: ""All Night Long"" by Lionel Richie**

The dance opens with a lighthearted skit: Michael “stretching” like he’s about to swim, then Emma blowing a whistle to start the routine. The crowd laughs — and then he surprises everyone. His musicality isn’t bad at all. He moves into the basic Salsa rhythm with visible focus, and though his hips are a little restrained, his timing stays impressively steady. Emma keeps the choreography simple but smart — side-by-side grooves, turns that highlight his height, and a few dips that show off his strength. Midway through, the dance kicks into another gear. Michael breaks into a solo moment where he mimics a swimmer’s stroke to the beat — the audience roars — before smoothly rejoining Emma for a series of underarm spins and body rolls that show just how much fun he’s having. His looseness improves as the dance goes on; by the end, he’s smiling, relaxed, and completely in the moment. They close with a playful lift — Emma leaping into his arms as he spins her once before striking a triumphant “gold medal” pose. It’s not the most polished Salsa, but it’s the kind of performance that makes everyone grin.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Michael, that was so much fun! I love seeing you just let go out there. You were in the rhythm, your timing was great, and I could tell you were really enjoying yourself. Now, next time, I want to see more looseness in those hips — let that Salsa groove take over!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Dude, I did *not* expect that! You’ve got natural rhythm, and I love how you used your strength in that lift at the end. Just make sure you’re not thinking too much — Salsa should feel effortless. Once you really relax and let Emma lead you into that flow, you’re going to shine.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Michael, my darling, who knew you could make a Salsa look Olympic-sized! The energy, the fun, the charisma — it was all there. Now, those hips… they’re still on pool deck mode. Loosen them up and you’ll be irresistible. But this was a joyful, crowd-pleasing debut!”

**Scores: 6, 6, 6 (18/30)**

Next up with a Cha Cha is one of the most legendary talk show hosts in history. His former sidekick, Andy Richter is currently competing on the real life show and now HE takes on the Fantasy Game. It's Conan O'Brien and his partner, the only female pro to have made the finals of the Fantasy Game three different times, Britt Stewart!

**Conan O'Brien and Britt Stewart Cha Cha**

**Song: ""Espresso"" by Sabrina Carpenter** 

Before the music even starts, Conan O’Brien is already milking the moment — dramatically sipping from a coffee cup labeled “Espresso” and striking a ridiculous runway pose that sends the audience into hysterics. Britt Stewart, completely in on the joke, tosses the cup away and launches into a routine that’s pure comedic chaos with a hint of Cha Cha flavor. The opening bars are gold: Conan struts down the floor with exaggerated hip rolls that look more like dad-at-a-wedding moves than ballroom technique. Britt matches his energy, spinning around him as he throws in finger guns, shoulder shakes, and a few enthusiastic pelvic thrusts that have Bruno nearly falling out of his chair laughing. When they finally hit a section of genuine Cha Cha content — some Cuban breaks and side steps — Conan tries his best to keep up, but his legs seem about half a beat behind at all times. Still, he sells it like a pro. Midway through, Britt pulls him into a solo section where Conan breaks out his infamous string-dance move. It’s completely off-book, but the crowd *loses it.* He somehow recovers in time for a final partner spin and ends the routine on one knee, dramatically pointing to Britt as confetti cannons fire. It’s objectively a mess — the timing, the footwork, the technique — but it’s also one of the funniest, most purely entertaining dances the Fantasy Game has ever seen.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Conan… I’m crying! That was hysterical. You definitely danced more with your face than your hips, but the entertainment value was off the charts. I have to give you credit for going all in!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“I don’t know whether to critique or congratulate you, man! The Cha Cha content was there in pieces — very, very loose pieces — but the showmanship was fantastic. If effort and personality counted for technique, you’d be getting 10s. Just… maybe work on timing next week.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Conan, my love, you are a *lunatic* — and I adored every second of it! That was Cha Cha meets late-night monologue meets pure madness. Technically… well, it was a car crash in slow motion, but one that I couldn’t stop watching. Britt, you deserve hazard pay for keeping up with that! More, please!”

**Scores: 5, 4, 4 (13/30)**

Next up with a Tango is another Disney Channel icon best known for her role as Lizzie McGuire, this 7 time Kids Choice Award winner takes on the ballroom with a Season 3 finalist. It's Hilary Duff and her partner Pasha Pashkov!

**Hilary Duff and Pasha Pashkov Tango**

**Song: ""Shut Up and Dance"" by Walk The Moon**

The ballroom buzzes as Hilary Duff takes the floor — a nostalgic favorite for a whole generation now trading in her pop hooks and Disney charm for ballroom drama. Pasha, ever the strategist, has choreographed a Tango that fuses modern pop energy with sharp, traditional structure — a perfect match for “Shut Up and Dance.” The performance opens with a cinematic touch: Hilary stands at center stage as Pasha extends a hand from the shadows. She hesitates for just a beat before taking it, and they snap into hold right on the first downbeat. From there, it’s all tension, drive, and confidence. The choreography bursts with personality — quick pivots, clean direction changes, and dynamic pauses that hit every musical accent. Hilary surprises the crowd by nailing the dramatic tone, keeping her frame strong and her expressions fierce. Midway through, the routine shifts gears into a playful side-by-side section where the two mirror each other with syncopated steps and cheeky foot flicks — a modern twist that brings out Hilary’s natural charm. The chemistry between her and Pasha is easy, fun, and just a bit flirty. The only real hiccup comes in a spin sequence near the end, where Hilary slightly loses her balance before recovering with a confident smirk that earns a cheer from the crowd.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Hilary, that was so much fun to watch! You brought this perfect mix of power and playfulness to the Tango, which is exactly what this song needed. There was one tiny slip, but you handled it like a total pro. This was sharp, strong, and full of personality!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“You’ve got such great natural movement — your posture was solid, and you really hit those accents. What I loved most was how musical it felt. The Tango can be very rigid, but this had energy and joy. Fantastic start, Hilary.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Oh, Hilary, that was electric! You attacked it with precision, but still kept that fun, youthful energy that made it so watchable. You had a few tiny wobbles, but darling, you sold it beautifully. A brilliant first impression!”

**Scores: 6, 7, 7 (20/30)**

Next up is an SNL icon and one of the best known comedic actors of the 2000s taking on a Foxtrot with our Season 4 champion. It's Andy Samberg and his partner Sharna Burgess!

**Andy Samberg and Sharna Burgess Foxtrot**

**Song: ""Anti-Hero"" by Taylor Swift**

The audience is already laughing before the first note plays — Andy Samberg, in a sharp suit and a way-too-serious expression, stands dramatically center stage as if he’s about to deliver the performance of his life. Sharna Burgess, fully committed to the bit, joins him in mock intensity as the haunting intro of “Anti-Hero” fills the ballroom. What follows is less a Foxtrot and more a perfectly choreographed trainwreck — but in the best, most Andy Samberg way possible. The dance begins earnestly enough — Andy takes Sharna into hold, visibly mouthing “I got this,” before immediately stepping on her foot in the first measure. From there, it’s a delightful mess: his posture wobbles between overconfident and completely lost, his footwork a mash-up of exaggerated heel leads and shuffle steps. Sharna wisely leans into the comedy, incorporating tongue-in-cheek poses and melodramatic spins that match the irony of the lyrics. Midway through, the song hits the “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me” chorus — and Andy turns directly to the judges, mouthing the lyrics with a self-aware shrug that nearly sends Bruno off his chair. The audience is in hysterics. He even throws in an exaggerated dip that nearly takes Sharna to the floor, earning both laughter and applause.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Andy, that was the *most* un-Foxtrot Foxtrot I’ve ever seen — and I loved every second of it. The timing was… let’s call it flexible, but the comedy and commitment were brilliant. You turned a ballroom fail into a total win with your personality!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Andy, I don’t even know what to say. That was chaos… but it was *charming* chaos! I was laughing the whole time. The footwork was rough, the posture was gone by the second verse — but your confidence and sense of humor carried the entire thing. You’re the anti-hero we didn’t know we needed!”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Oh, Andy! That was Foxtrot meets fever dream — completely mad, totally wrong, and absolutely *fantastic!* You made Taylor Swift proud in your own very weird way. The technique may have vanished into thin air, but the entertainment value? 10 out of 10! You and Conan might break me this season.”

**Scores: 5, 5, 5 (15/30)**

Next up with a Jive is the man who has charted more songs on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other artist in history and a 4 time Grammy winner. Let's see how Drake attacks the ballroom with his partner, Witney Carson!

**Drake and Witney Carson Jive**

**Song: ""I Ain't Worried"" by OneRepublic**

The ballroom crackles with anticipation — Witney knows exactly what she’s doing, crafting a routine that marries Drake’s signature cool with the bounce, precision, and charm of classic ballroom. The number opens with a clever nod to his chill persona — Drake leans casually against a mock streetlight as the whistle intro kicks in, bobbing his head with that trademark confidence. But the moment the beat drops, Witney pulls him into motion and the two burst into a fast-paced side-by-side section that instantly surprises everyone. Drake’s footwork is crisp, his timing tight, and his upper body relaxed — he’s clearly having fun. Midway through, Witney throws in a cheeky solo moment where Drake breaks into a mini “Hotline Bling” groove before snapping right back into Jive kicks and flicks without missing a beat. The crowd *erupts.* His energy is infectious, and while there are a few spots where his retraction could be sharper, his rhythm and musicality are undeniable. The chemistry between him and Witney is electric — playful, confident, and natural. As the final chorus hits, the pair glide into a quick spin combo that ends with Drake tossing Witney into a smooth assisted jump, landing perfectly on the final whistle note. It’s effortless, charismatic, and exactly what you’d expect from a superstar learning to let loose.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Drake, I did *not* expect that from you! You came out here and owned that Jive — sharp, cool, and totally in control. There were a couple of spots where your feet could’ve snapped back a bit more, but the musicality was fantastic. That was pure fun!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Dude, that was awesome. The Jive needs energy, rhythm, and attitude — and you nailed all three. Your kicks were clean, your timing was great, and that little freestyle moment? Iconic. Just make sure you keep that energy sustained through the whole dance, but dude this was a killer debut.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Drake, my darling, you are a natural showman! You brought that effortless cool and turned it into Jive magic. You were light on your feet, in sync with the rhythm, and totally at ease. That was charm, charisma, and class all rolled into one. Brilliant choreography and brilliant performance!”

**Scores: 7, 7, 8 (22/30)**

Top score of the night so far! Next up is our 3rd and final SNL icon, she is an Emmy nominated actress and stand up comedian, and she is paired up with our defending champion and statistically speaking, the most successful pro in the Fantasy Game over our first 5 seasons. It's Leslie Jones and her partner Brandon Armstrong!

**Leslie Jones and Brandon Armstrong Viennese Waltz**

**Song: ""All of Me"" by John Legend**

The ballroom lights dim to a soft glow as Leslie Jones, usually the loudest and funniest person in any room, steps out in a stunning silver gown — visibly nervous, but smiling wide. Partnered with Brandon Armstrong, the reigning Fantasy Game champion, she’s tackling the emotional Viennese Waltz — a style that’s all grace, fluidity, and control. The routine opens with a tender moment: Leslie, standing center stage, places her hand on Brandon’s shoulder as the first piano notes echo through the ballroom. The two move into hold, and from the very first turn, the crowd can see the effort — her posture isn’t perfect, but her commitment is. The rotations are wide and sweeping, and while Leslie occasionally loses her footing on the turns, she keeps the flow going, never breaking character. Midway through the routine, Brandon incorporates a slower sequence — a simple promenade and underarm turn that lets Leslie exhale and just live in the music. Her face softens, her movements start to breathe, and the audience begins to see the potential. By the final chorus, she’s gliding with confidence, ending in a heartfelt embrace that earns warm applause from the crowd. It’s one of those dances that won't score high, but it earns everyone’s respect.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Leslie, that was really beautiful. I could see you working so hard out there, and you were fully present in the moment. Your posture and footwork need some refinement, yes, but what really struck me was the emotion. You have something special — you just need to trust yourself a little more.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“You have *so much* potential, Leslie. I know this wasn’t easy, but there were moments in there where you absolutely shined. Your connection with Brandon is already great — you just need to work on staying grounded through those turns and letting the movement flow through your body. I can tell there’s a breakthrough coming soon.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Leslie, my darling, I loved seeing this softer, more vulnerable side of you! You were elegant, you told the story beautifully — but the Viennese Waltz is all about continuous motion, and sometimes you were a bit hesitant. Don’t hold back. You’ve got all the ingredients to become a really beautiful dancer.”

**Scores: 6, 6, 5 (17/30)**

Next up is an accomplished actress, best known for her role as Haley Dunphy on Modern Family. Tonight, she begins her journey with our family as she's paired up with one of our most iconic pros and 2 time Fantasy Game finalist. It's Sarah Hyland and her partner Mark Ballas!

**Sarah Hyland and Mark Ballas Salsa**

**Song: ""Hips Don't Lie"" by Shakira**

Sarah Hyland walks onto the ballroom floor with that perfect mix of nerves and excitement — a confident performer but new to this world, ready to prove she’s more than just the sitcom sweetheart. Mark Ballas, ever the creative showman, knows exactly how to make a debut pop. His choreography for “Hips Don’t Lie” is vibrant, cheeky, and packed with moments designed to show off Sarah’s personality — and yes, her hips. The number kicks off with Sarah and Mark back-to-back, trading playful shoulder pops as the iconic beat drops. Sarah immediately leans into the rhythm, her movements sharp but natural. She hits the isolations cleanly, tossing in a wink at the camera that makes the audience roar. Mark takes her into a fast-paced spin sequence that’s a touch ambitious for Week 1 — she wobbles slightly but recovers with flair, flashing a grin that says she’s *having fun.* The chemistry between them is electric — flirty, energetic, and infectious. By the final chorus, they’re completely in sync, ending with Sarah striking a confident final pose, one hand on her hip and the other thrown high in victory. The ballroom goes wild.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Sarah, that was so much fun! You’ve got such great rhythm and natural movement — your hips *do not* lie! There were a few tiny moments where you got ahead of the music, but your confidence and charisma carried it through. You owned that stage tonight!”

**Derek Hough:**  
“Sarah, that was spicy, it was confident, and it was packed with energy! You have really strong natural rhythm, and your connection with Mark is already fantastic. Just be careful on your transitions — you’ve got all the right instincts, now just refine those details. Really really impressive debut.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“Sarah, my darling, you were sizzling hot! That was full of flavor, personality, and joy. You moved beautifully, and the hips — oh, they spoke volumes! A few tiny wobbles here and there, but who cares — it's Week 1. You brought the party to the ballroom and I loved every second of it!”

**Scores: 7, 7, 7 (21/30)**

And now closing out the night is one of the greatest entertainers and influential artists of all time. She has a record, 35 Grammy wins and is now ready to add Fantasy Game champion to her resume with a pro who is just as hungry to get his first Fantasy Game deep run after a frustrating first 5 seasons. It's Beyoncé and her partner Alan Bersten!!!!

**Beyoncé and Alan Bersten Cha Cha**

**Song: ""Crazy in Love"" by Beyoncé & Jay-Z**

The ballroom is buzzing like never before. You can feel it — the kind of electricity that only happens when a true global icon steps onto the stage. As the lights dim and the unmistakable brass riff of “Crazy in Love” blares through the speakers, the audience explodes. It’s *Beyoncé.* Dancing. On *Dancing With the Stars.* Alan stands beside her, grinning like a man who knows he’s about to make history. The two strike a fierce opening pose — Beyoncé in a dazzling silver fringe outfit that sways with every breath, Alan matching her intensity — and when that beat drops, the ballroom *erupts.* The choreography is pure fire — a perfect fusion of authentic Cha Cha technique and unmistakable Beyoncé swagger. Alan keeps it classy but bold, giving her the structure to show off while still challenging her with clean Latin footwork and sharp isolations. The first half of the routine is all attitude: Beyoncé hits every syncopation with effortless precision, tossing a knowing smile toward the camera as the crowd screams. Then, halfway through, Alan builds the moment — a solo section where Beyoncé struts across the floor, hits a hair flip, rolls into a body wave, and *snaps* back into hold with Alan right on the beat. It’s sensual, powerful, and commanding — everything you’d hope for and then some. Her timing is impeccable, her lines are crisp, and her chemistry with Alan feels electric. As the final chorus hits, they explode into a whirlwind of spins and side-by-side cha cha locks that end with Beyoncé hitting *that* classic “Crazy in Love” pose — hand on hip, head tilted, eyes fierce — while fireworks rain down behind them. The ballroom loses its mind.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
“Beyoncé. On *Dancing With the Stars.* I’m honestly speechless. That was everything — the control, the precision, the fire, the *presence.* You hit every move like a professional, but I also loved that you didn’t come in too polished and there is still room to grow, and that’s exciting because this was already incredible.”

**Derek Hough:**  
“I mean… how do I even critique Beyoncé? That was insane! Your rhythm is ridiculous, your timing was flawless, and your control — unbelievable. The only note I’ll give is this because you are learning ballroom: lean even more into the Latin grounding of the Cha Cha. You’ve obviously got the performance nailed — now it’s about refining the base. But my goodness, that was unreal.”

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
“BEYONCÉ! I’m going to need a moment! That was a Cha Cha worthy of a global stage — the precision, the sass, the musicality! You are a goddess of rhythm, and the fact that you just graced our ballroom with *that* number… I’m going to need smelling salts. It was divine!”

I’m in Seoul and considering traveling to see a musician at Sumida Triphony hall. Ive never been to Tokyo. 

A friend lives in Yokosuka and may end up staying with him. I don’t think my concert will end past 9pm but will trains run back to Yokosuka at that hour?

I’m more into small neighborhoods with cool coffee shops, bakeries, hole in the wall vibes.  Also a big climber so would love to spend a couple of hours in one of the climbing gyms (B Pump and Next Gen are the only ones I know in my short research) but yeah a nice day would be to have pastries and coffee, walk around, eat noodles, drink more coffee, eat katsu, have a beer, go to sleep. 

Is there an “artsy” pocket of town you could suggest? Into ceramics, glassware, crafts based stuff. 

Thanks!

I've been eating like shit since February and also drink lots of lattes with whole milk. I've also been stressing and not sleeping properly and also lacked a lot of hydration (everything but the lipids came back abnormal). I refuse to believe this is entirely genetics as I’m sure my lifestyle contributed to this. I’m wondering if eating in healthy extremes would work. 

I'm pretty thin (140-145 lbs fluctuating, 5’7”)and do exercise here and there and work a pretty physically intensive job. I got pretty lazy with my diet and don't like cooking at all so l started eating out more. I dislike eating unless I'm hungry or having to refill my own water, etc. esp when I'm studying or doing other intensive work as I feel it's a waste of time.

My solution: fasting every morning with black coffee or a latte with unsweetened oatmilk/almond milk instead of whole milk.

No outside food. For lunch it could be an oatmeal with some fruit here and there or I don't eat at all.
Dinner can have more focus and variety with protein (no red meats, I eat mostly salmon and chicken anyway). I also plan on implementing more leafy greens and limiting my carb intake unless it's rice or sourdough bread. I got a water bottle to mitigate my dehydration and it's been working well for me I already feel better being able to drink a lot of water and not having to refill it all the time.

1o37vi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o37vi1/why_am_i_hypo/,Why am I hypo?,"Started feeling kinda hypomanic yesterday (Thursday) and unsure what set it off. Sleep has been stable. I did miss a day of my lithium on Sunday night due to a flight delay. Otherwise, I take it consistently and my last lab draw (just 2 weeks ago) was within range. Also been tracking my period and it just finished.

Background: BPII diagnosed around this time last year while hypomanic postpartum. Hx of longtime anxiety and depression. Have trialed over a dozen meds- currently on lithium and pristiq with vistaril for sleep. (I know the pristiq isnt great but Ive been on it for years. My psych tried to take me off it last year and it didn’t go well for my anxiety). In therapy. Of note, I haven’t been hypomanic since last year when I got dxed.  Had a very very long depressive episode afterwards that lasted months and months which finally lifted over the summer.

Feeling more mixed today. Just a little speedy (like ive had a redbull when I havent), distractible/forgetful, keep switching my train of thought/focus, on edge/irritable, annoyed that I’m feeling off, feeling the push and pull of wanting to connect with others but also wanting to stay secluded as to not get rubbed or rub anyone the wrong way. I had to take trazodone (in addition to the melatonin and vistaril I normally take) to knock me out last night.  Usually trazzy makes me a groggie zombie in the morning but I’ve been up and at em and barely touched my coffee.

I know I’m getting longwinded. It’s just so frustrating to *try* to do everything right and track everything and still feel like it’s my fault that my mood is a swingin. ",2,1760118586.0,bipolar2,1,1.0,False

1o37uyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o37uyo/i_am_a_banisher_when_i_woke_up_i_wasnt_alone/,"I am a Banisher. When I woke up, I wasn't alone.","It’s a new day. It’s not [better than yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2cqy2/i_am_a_banisher_the_snails_are_holding_on_but_i/).

I woke up to movement under my shirt. Not *on top of*, under. 

Something slow and cold, dragging itself across my stomach, then another further up, then a dozen more.

For a little while, I was too dazed to move. Definitely too tired to be scared. Just a little confused and uncomfortable, trying to wrap my head around what the heck was going on. Then, I felt the little teeth-things of each and every one, all at once: tiny little ribs, chewing or kissing or whatever that was in rhythmic motions all over my torso. 

I sat up so fast the room spun and black dots danced in my line of vision. As I stood up, they poured out: dozens of them, maybe hundreds. *Snails*. Sliding, chewing, mumbling motions with their mouth-bodies. A living, glistening tide, covered in slime both wet and dry.

It’s impossible to describe exactly what it feels like, to be covered in snails like that. *Wrong* is probably the closest, *disgusting* a contender. I swear I could hear the soft clicks of their shells knocking together as I stood up, the tiny wet pops as their suction let go. Skin, against my skin. The trails cool and sticky and tacky, and you can *feel* it drying. You can smell them, and their disgusting slime. Cold and earthy, damp needles on leaf-covered ground and dirt after rain, slightly sweet underneath.

I ran. The shirt hit the floor with a wet *thump*, bringing most of the snails with it. Then my pants were off, then the rest strewn about as I made my way into the bathroom. I frantically scratched and dusted them off with my hands, each soft pop a new kind of torture mixed with the sound of them hitting the ground behind me. I made it into the shower, and as I stood there shivering in the morning cold and reached for the shower knob I—

The pipes. 

What if that’s where they came from?

What if I turned the water on and it was just *snails*?

So, I stood there for a longer than acceptable amount of time with my hand outstretched, tiredness like sand in my eyes, contemplating.  Waiting for something. I don’t know what.

Finally, I twisted the handle, still expecting a torrent of slime and shells and crunch and clicks to come raining down on me, but there was just water. Cold as shit, but just normal water. Clean. I stayed for a long time, with my hand on the temperature knob, turning it up every few seconds until the water was burning my scalp and back, leaving my skin raw and red.

As I made my way back through my apartment, the snails were exactly where you’d expect them to be, I think. Not static in place, but not very far away from where they had been violently thrown off, either. It was most obvious around my bed, and the soggy shirt on the floor. A couple of dozen snails of varying sizes were scattered around, most of them centralised close to the shirt, a few further off. A yellow and black striped one had made it the furthest, its little eye-things curiously pointing out as it was munching its way up my nightstand.

As I flicked it off, reaching for my phone, the idea hit me that I had *definitely* seen that fucking snail before. I let my eyes wander back down, traced the pattern on the shell. A soft spiral of colours. I stared at it for a long time, trying to take in any detail. Any discrepancy, anything *unique*.

I don’t think snails come in a lot of variations, to be fair. Not these “normal” ones. I can’t really quantify this, but that fucker, I had definitely seen him before. The *exact* same one, and I am unhealthily certain this is true. 

I did what anyone in my position would do. I grabbed a black marker from my nightstand, forcibly plopped him into a small glass dish I keep spare batteries in, and drew a large dot on his side. An identifiable splotch, definitely not meant to be there. If I am wrong, well, nothing lost. If I am right? I don’t know. I really don’t.

I collected a handful more of varying colours, dotted their sides numerically. Two, three, four, five dots. Then, I threw them out the window. Didn’t even feel bad about it. Good riddance.

I washed my hands thoroughly, then went back for my phone. I had a new text message from Henning, but honestly it wasn’t very helpful. Part of it is probably due to what I sent him last night, which in hindsight reads as crazy ramblings about snails. Don’t know how much he could do with that.

Handlers are… what they are. Part therapists, part dispatchers, part insurance adjuster. They just kind of, show up, when you’ve seen enough. There’s just a text message or a call one day, matter-of-factly. They are useful most of the time, though. Connecting us lower peasants with the other departments, even if hardly ever directly. 

They disappear in the same manner they appear, by the way. One day the texts just stop, their numbers not reachable. *The number you have tried to reach cannot take your call right now*. I don’t think it’s anything nefarious, by the way. I think it’s just retirement.

Okay, I guess that sounds *very* nefarious. I mean in the sense that, there’s only so much a person can take. There will be things that get to you, and I assume the handlers work the same. Since it’s all assignment based, to the best of my knowledge at least, it makes sense. One day you just, stop.

Not Henning, though. He’s been with me for over six years, and even though he’s… the way he is, he’s *really* good.

Well, normally. The text message wasn’t that useful, like I said. 

“Never heard of ghost snails. Can reach out to the archive and ask. Doesn’t sound related to the assignment though, so you probably fucked up.”

Thanks, I guess. I wasn’t expecting any follow-up questions or reassurance, not really his thing, but I felt a bit offended he insinuated quite bluntly that I’d somehow let a haunting hitch a ride home in my backpack, and the undertone that I tend to fuck up (not true, by the way). 

Still, one line stuck with me. *Doesn’t sound related*. I told you I haven’t really ever heard of “ghost snails” (I think I prefer trans-dimensional snails, by the way), but maybe the *snail* problem can be broken down into simpler parts. Maybe it’s not about snails at all. 

So, while I had breakfast I brought out my collection of notebooks, trying to find any cases that shared *something* with this… situation. Tried to define the problem.

There are snails. They act like, well, snails, except for the fact that they are appearing randomly in my apartment. I’ve crushed a few, and that didn’t seem to change anything in either direction. They don’t seem to care about the iron or salt in the doorways, but I figure I can’t be certain yet. It’s possible the snails are *the same* snails, and that probably changes things. Or, maybe I am just going crazy. It sure feels like it.

The more I tried to break it down, the more almost all of my previous cases feel like they shared some similarity, so I tried to focus on one thing at a time. Snails, like most things, need to follow the laws of physics, in the case they *are* normal snails. They shouldn’t just, appear out of nothing, yet that’s what they’re doing.

I had a case that was semi-similar in that sense, things appearing out of seemingly nowhere. I am a bit embarrassed to share, but I have it noted down as “The Things That Stayed Behind” in my notebook. I can be poetic when I want to be, I guess. I’ll try to stay concise as I tell you about it, maybe you can help me connect this crap into something more useful. I have *nothing*. Here goes.

It was maybe eight years ago, before my knees started sounding like un-oiled hinges.

A university town in the middle of the country, known for its state-of-the-art archeology program and its ludicrously expensive coffee. My then-handler Jessika connected me with the curator of a small regional-items type museum, running shop outside of the city centre. Items shown were mostly stuff taken from the excavation site a few miles outside of the city, an old and semi-preserved bronze-age settlement found several years prior when some company had blown open the side of a mountain to lay roads. Jewellery, blobby figurines, broken sword pieces. That kind of stuff. Just remnants, mostly nothing known about them except the age and type of item.

This case was marked as suspicious from the get go. The museum wasn’t doing too well, and had done its own little job spreading rumours about haunted or holy items to try and gain traffic. I think whoever summarised the assignment to begin with thought it was a big bowl of nothing, and that reflected on the commission. My dad had just passed away, though, and I was trying to keep busy at this time, so it was perfect for me. 

The curator, I think his name was Sven, said things had begun appearing inside the display cases. Things that were *not* part of the collection.

It had started small: a cheap ring, discoloured green, or a broken watch. A single leather glove, torn around the edges. Initially, Sven thought they were the victims of a prank of some kind. Either a visitor, or maybe one of the interns trying to spook the others.

But it kept happening, and the items weren’t as random as they first seemed. One day, a teacher touring the museum with her students saw her cashmere scarf used as a blanket for a curvy bronze figurine and lost her shit audibly enough to startle the curator. As she was telling her young students off, Sven became suspicious. The museum had just opened for the day, and he *knew* that scarf hadn’t been there when he had done the rounds that morning. The case was also *locked*, and at that time he was the only one with a key, safely around his own neck. A few days after, a woman made a police report as she saw her diamond wedding ring laying next to some chiseled and cracked bowl remnants, and I guess that’s when Sven reached out. Like I said, they weren’t doing well and getting written up for theft wasn’t exactly… well, needed.

When I arrived, the museum had been closed to the public for a week or so. Every case was sealed in plastic, but “new” objects kept appearing. Sven just left them there. No one saw them appear, and the curator swore he had slept in the building since they closed it and hadn’t heard a thing.  

“They just show up”, he said. I remember he sounded defeated. “Like they’ve always been here.”

I took his key, which he swore was the only one, and sent him home. 

It was a small place. Two floors, no basement. Every surface was clean, and the air smelled of old wood polish and pine. 

I did a full circuit, trying to feel for tethers. The sealed cases were normal enough, glass and plastic and laminated notes on the items inside. Each held a mix of the real artefacts — ancient pots, decorations, bronze and bone and wood — and the newer intrusions. An expired metro ticket. A disposable lighter with the plastic case half-missing. A cracked iPhone, black, old enough to *almost* be considered an antique itself. All tagged and displayed as carefully as if they had been dug up alongside the old stuff. 

I checked for drafts, traps, tricks. Nothing.

I stayed the night. The air inside got stale and warm. At this point, I could feel the tether, if ever so loosely. It was hard and rough, strung tightly. As the night passed, its pressure made the stillness feel like a facade, as if it was all staged for someone. I don’t know if it was for me.

Around two in the morning, as I was doing my fourth round, I found the anchor. I could *feel* the tether clearly, could almost taste the tension. A small gleam in the corner of my eye from one of the cases, and I knew it. I had found the anchor.

The reflection in the glass looked wrong: where it had been as meticulously polished as everything else in there, the glass looked almost double now. Between the two panes, smudges; soft and fatty against the slick surface, as of small fingers in the space between. It shimmered like oil when I moved around, giving the illusion that the smudges were prints, pressure points from somewhere else. As if there was a hand, right there, fingers pressed up curiously at the glass.

Only, it wasn’t looking at the artefacts from outside. It was looking at *me*.

The idea startled me enough to jump back a little, and when my eyes got back to the case the smudges were gone. Inside the case, nestled neatly between two knife fragments, a wallet. 

I recognised it instantly. The black, worn leather, a faint burn mark in the left corner where I had dropped a cigarette years earlier, sometime before, when I still went to the pub. 

I hadn’t carried that wallet in over a decade. Lost it sometime in my late teens, probably on a bus, never found it again. Now, there it was, behind the glass. With a neat tag, displayed flatly. Neat handwriting: Artefact 347B: Contemporary Personal Item. Donor unknown.

I unlocked the case. The key felt warm. With one hand clutching my protective charm in my pocket, I slowly opened the case with the other and reached for the wallet. The inside of the case was chilly. The moment my fingers brushed the worn leather, I felt it *pulse*. 

A slow, deliberate thump against the tip of my fingers, like something small and fragile and patient was beating inside. Waiting. 

I yanked my hand back. 

The air around me felt like it was shimmering with excitement. All the display cases vibrated softly in the waves, a deep and throat-less sound that rattled through the floor and into my bones. Every tag fluttered. For a second, all the bronze and bone and plastic and gold in the room shifted in place, like they *knew* they were not in the right place. 

Then, just as suddenly, silence. It felt as if I was breathing syrup, and I could hear my blood rushing in my ears. I looked down. The wallet was in my hand, now, my fingers tightly grasped around it.

The case wasn’t the anchor, anymore. The wallet was. The laminated tag was gone, replaced with a torn piece of paper, tied around the spine with a yellowed piece of string. It was blank.

It wasn’t pulsing anymore, but it radiated an uncomfortable heat that almost made my skin feel cold. 

I grabbed a small plank of willow from my bag, and ruthlessly spiked the wallet to the board with a thick iron nail. The head bit the board with a satisfying little moan of metal on wood. The wallet gave a little shiver, and I felt the eyes that had been burning into me from the case fade away. It settled fast, and the room felt less stuffy in an instant. 

Afterwards, I sat with my back against the case for a bit. Trying to settle myself, I guess. I don’t know what the presence was, but it hadn’t felt like the angry kind, nor vengeful in any way. If anything, the only *emotion* I had gotten out of the tether was *annoyance*. At me, and my actions. Like a stern parent scolding you for something when you should’ve known better.

I put the wallet and the plank into an envelope together with some cleanse, sprinkled a little salt on the glue before closing it. Straight to the archive with that shit; just needed a drop-off point. My phone was in my pocket. I called Jessika.

Straight to voicemail. I left a clipped message. Hey, it’s me, I am on this assignment, I think I solved it but I don’t know what it was. That type of stuff. I told her about the *donor unknown*, and that the anchor was secured. To please call me back so I can get rid of it.

I tried again at four, at five, and finally at six. When I felt confident enough that I didn’t feel any remnants of the tether, I left. 

Since it was still early, I drove by Sven’s house and just put the key in his postbox, left a post-it next to the door. Good enough.

With the envelope on the passenger seat, I stopped for coffee I didn’t really want three times. By the last traffic light out of town, the smell of hot milk made me so nauseous I almost threw up.

Back at the hotel, I jotted some quick notes down: the date, what I touched, what happened. I underlined “Donor unknown” several times, drew a bad sketch of a hand with long fingers in the margin. Then I closed the book and moved on, because that’s what we do.

Jessika never did call me back. 

I got a new handler, of course. In due time. Got that stupid envelope dropped off. I don’t know what happened with it after that, bit above my pay-grade. 

The case did stick with me, though. I guess most of them do, in some ways. Small bruises on my soul. 

What gets to me is that I am pretty sure the anchor was *moved*. For me. I don’t know why.

But yeah, I think Henning may be right. The snails are not related to the “Lady of Death” or whatever, no more than I am related to the museum and the random shit that appeared there. This *isn’t* about snails. It’s about the anchor.

I turned around in the dark because this took a lot of time to write and I had that feeling I was forgetting something stupid and domestic, like a light on somewhere or a tea cup. The painted snail was back.

Halfway up the nightstand, right where I had scooped him up this morning. Unbothered. Same shell color, same little blotch on the side, now a little smudged into the yellow and black pattern.

I don’t know whether I should be angry, relieved or terrified at this point. Honestly, I just feel defeated. I am only certain of one thing as of right now: That the fucker came back, and that he somehow knew *to put himself where I would definitely see him.*",2,1760118554.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1o37tbc,https://i.redd.it/r8atlc4unbuf1.jpeg,I can’t find where these roaches are nesting! It’s Driving me nuts! (Canada),"I moved into my apartment about two months ago. Not long after moving in, I saw a roach on the kitchen floor near my stove. The stove didn’t work, so it was replaced, and I’m pretty sure the one they brought me was used.

Since then, I’ve been seeing at least one roach a day, sometimes more. I’ve seen them in my kitchen drawers (three out of four of them), on my countertops, and running into the ledge under my cupboards. There are lots of gaps in this place,big ones. I feel like I should fill them, but I’ve read here that it’s pointless.

I put sticky traps everywhere, one in each drawer I saw them in, but I have never caught any in the drawers. I’ve sprinkled diatomaceous earth in there too. I’ve got it around my countertops and on the floor between the kitchen and bathroom.

There’s a short hallway between my kitchen and bathroom, just a little path by my front door,and that’s where I’ve caught the most. I’ve caught two or three on the wall by the bathroom and a few crossing the gap at the threshold. I’ve caught two inside the bathroom, just inside the door on sticky traps in the corner. That’s the area with the most trap activity, but I’ve seen them in so many other places too. I rarely catch them compared to how many I see. My traps never have more than two on them, usually just one, but I change them regularly since they get dusty and that seems to make them less effective.

I’ve also seen them in my bathtub, on the floor beside my toilet, and coming from under the bathroom sink. I’ve sprayed diatomaceous earth everywhere. I even dusted my entire floor so they had no choice but to walk through it, maybe that’s dumb, but I did it.

I’m honestly obsessed with finding their nest because I know there has to be a lot of them. I see them in all stages of life, babies, teens, adults,(I’ve even seen the smallest tiny ones after squishing an egg sac one left on a sticky mat so it could escape).

They seem to be getting smart. They avoid the diatomaceous earth, the borax, and even the sticky traps. When the dust is down, I barely see them, but when I clean it up, they’re back everywhere. I’ve seen them patiently move one leg at a time to get off the traps. Another time, I put bait on a trap and one was actually eating it , but as soon as I came around the corner, it booked it off the trap and ran.

I’ve looked behind the fridge , totally clean. I’ve looked under the sink, under appliances, around the baseboards, and under the stove. The only place I’ve found a big amount of egg casings is  in the crevice on the floor between the rooms and  behind the stove, behind a wall panel. Tons of egg cases, some shed skins, and even what looked like old mouse droppings. But no live roaches even though  an hour before, I saw one very small baby crawl out of the floorboards near there.

I’ve dusted every gap I can find with diatomaceous earth, but I still see roaches almost every day. I just can’t find where they’re hiding. It’s not in any of the “normal” places, and it’s driving me nuts. And there is no coffee ground like matter to indicate droppings but I don’t know what I’m looking for really.  Could only post one pic it’s of an egg case behind my stove and all the debris behind it. No live roaches thst I can see besides that little one yesterday 

Where is their nest? Why can’t I find it? I’ve checked hinges, outlets, above cupboards, cracks, crevices. everywhere.

If anyone has ideas especially DIY solutions or Canadian-available products, that actually work, please tell me. They sprayed here just before I moved in, but sprays are only part of the solution. I can’t really afford pest control right now, but I also can’t afford to do nothing. I need to get ahead of this before it gets worse.",1,1760118455.0,pestcontrol,2,1.0,False

At the start of September, I (33M) went on a couple dates with, will call her Sam (30F). We hit it off immediately and went on 2 dates really only 24 hours apart. We had planned a 3rd date to go to the Big E a couple days after our 2nd date and she ended up “getting sick” and we ended up not going and later that day she texted me saying that she didn’t want to continue cause she was going through the end of her schooling and was graduating in December so she didn’t want to have a “potential relationship” looming over her when she was trying to finish school. Sucks but totally understandable. 

A couple days ago, Sam texted me about one of my favorite bands coming on while she was listening to music and she wanted to see how things were going for me. We sent maybe 3-4 texts back and forth and I was the last one to text and said something along the lines “I hope the rest of the school year goes well and hopefully we can reconnect at some point when school is over!” Didn’t hear back from her. Fine, no big deal. 

This morning I receive this text from her. 

“Hi, so I’ve been thinking about what you said the other day. I was wondering if we could maybe get coffee or something and talk. There are some things I should explain about what I was feeling when I decided to broke things off. But I regret that decision, and I truly want to give this a shot.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering affordable living, small barndominium homes are quickly gaining popularity. These unique structures blend the charm of barn-style designs with comfortable living spaces, making them perfect for those seeking both functionality and style. One of the greatest advantages of barndominiums is their innovative features that cater to modern living while remaining budget-friendly.

The design of a barndominium starts with its open floor plan. This layout maximizes the available square footage, creating an airy and spacious feel. Unlike traditional homes, which often waste space on hallways and separate rooms, a small barndominium uses an open-concept design that allows for flexible living areas. You can arrange your furniture and define spaces according to your lifestyle, making the most of every square foot.

Another standout feature of small barndominium homes is the versatility in their construction materials. While traditional homes typically rely on lumber, barndominiums often use steel or metal framing paired with wood accents. This combination makes the structure both strong and low-maintenance. Steel is resistant to pests and mold, reducing long-term repair costs. Plus, the barn-style exterior gives a rustic yet modern aesthetic that many people find appealing.

Energy efficiency is a key focus for many small barndominium designs. To achieve lower energy costs, these homes frequently incorporate insulation technology that exceeds standard building codes. This means that whether it’s heating during winter or cooling in summer, you’ll enjoy a comfortable temperature with minimal energy consumption. Many barndominiums utilize solar panels as well, enabling you to harness renewable energy to further cut down on bills.

The sustainability angle is another appealing feature. Small barndominium homes often include eco-friendly materials and practices. For example, rainwater harvesting systems can be installed to collect and reuse water for irrigation or household purposes. Choosing recyclable materials for construction and fixtures minimizes your environmental footprint while promoting a greener lifestyle.

Here are some innovative features to consider:

- **Creative Storage Solutions:** Barndominiums utilize innovative storage options like built-in shelves, under-stair cabinets, and loft spaces to keep your living area clutter-free.
- **Multifunctional Spaces:** Designing rooms that serve multiple purposes, such as a home office that doubles as a guest room, makes the best use of limited space.
- **Smart Home Technology:** Many barndominium owners integrate smart home systems to automate lighting, heating, and security, enhancing convenience.
- **Outdoor Living Areas:** Expanding your living space outdoors with porches, decks, and patios lets you enjoy nature and entertain guests, further maximizing your small home's functionality.

Another factor contributing to the affordability of small barndominium homes is the potential for DIY projects. Many barndominium owners take on projects like interior finishes or landscaping themselves, which can significantly reduce costs. With a little creativity and elbow grease, you can create a personalized space without breaking the bank.

Choosing to live in a small barndominium also opens up opportunities for simplified living. The smaller footprint encourages a minimalist lifestyle that prioritizes experiences over material possessions. Less space means less cleaning, less upkeep, and the freedom to focus on what truly matters to you.

In terms of location, barndominiums allow for flexibility. You can build on spacious land outside urban areas, where real estate prices are much lower. This not only offers you a home but also a piece of land that can be cultivated or used for hobbies, making rural living a viable option for many individuals and families.

With their blend of affordability, innovative design, and modern functionality, small barndominium homes are redefining what it means to live comfortably and economically. These homes provide an efficient and stylish solution that caters to those who desire both comfort and practicality in their living spaces. Whether you are looking to downsize, simplify, or invest in an affordable living solution, small barndominiums are worth considering.

Design Tips for Creating Functional Spaces in Small Barndominium Homes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating functional spaces in small barndominium homes requires thoughtful design and clever use of space. With their open floor plans and rustic charm, barndominiums are a wonderful option for those looking for affordability without sacrificing style. Here are some tips to maximize the function of every nook and cranny in these unique homes.

### Embrace Open Floor Plans

One of the best features of barndominiums is their open layout. This can help you create a feeling of spaciousness, even in limited square footage. When designing your small barndominium:

- Consider combining your living, dining, and kitchen areas into one cohesive space.
- Use furniture to define zones instead of walls – a sofa can serve as a barrier between the living space and the dining area.
- Choose a centralized layout that allows easy flow through the space.

### Incorporate Multi-Functional Furniture

In small barndominium homes, every piece of furniture should serve dual purposes. Look for innovative furniture options that can adapt to your needs:

- Ottomans with storage space can double as seating or a coffee table.
- Murphy beds can free up floor space during the day while providing a cozy sleeping area at night.
- Dining tables that expand or can be adjusted to various sizes ensure flexibility for entertaining.

### Utilize Vertical Space

Small spaces can feel cramped if you don't think vertically. Make the most out of every inch by designing upward:

- Install shelving units that go from the floor to the ceiling while ensuring they follow the room's layout.
- Hang hooks and racks on walls for items like coats, hats, and kitchen utensils.
- Choose tall cabinets with narrow profiles to store kitchen items or other household supplies.

### Opt for Light Colors and Reflective Surfaces

Colors have a significant impact on how spacious a room feels. Light and reflective colors can make small rooms appear larger:

- Paint walls in soft whites, pastels, or light greys to create an airy feel.
- Incorporate mirrors to reflect light around the room, enhancing the sense of space.
- Choose light-colored furnishings that don’t weigh the space down visually.

### Design for Flow

A well-designed layout enhances movement through your home. Ensure that your space is planned so that you can easily navigate between rooms:

- Avoid blocking pathways with large furniture pieces.
- Use rugs to guide the eye and create defined walking areas.
- Maintain pathways clear of clutter for a smoother flow.

### Optimize Natural Light

Natural light can make a big difference in how spacious your home feels. Barndominiums typically have large windows, so use this to your advantage:

- Maximize window sizes during construction to increase light exposure.
- Use sheer curtains that let light in while providing privacy.
- Keep window sills clear of clutter to emphasize light-infused spaces.

### Incorporate Outdoor Living

Small barndominium homes can expand their usable area through outdoor living spaces. Here are ways to make the most of your outdoor areas:

- Create a deck or patio that connects seamlessly to the interior for easy access.
- Furnish outdoor spaces with comfortable seating and dining options to extend your living area.
- Incorporate outdoor lighting to make these spaces usable in the evenings, effectively creating another “room.”

Designing functional spaces in small barndominium homes is all about creativity, efficiency, and thoughtful planning. By using these tips, you can ensure your cozy retreat is both effective and stylish. Embrace the beauty of small spaces, and transform your barndominium into a well-organized home that serves your everyday needs without compromising on charm.

### Conclusion

Small barndominium homes present a fresh and innovative solution for affordable living without sacrificing style or comfort. With their unique design, these homes integrate modern features that optimize space and functionality. By incorporating high ceilings, open floor plans, and multifunctional furniture, you can create a welcoming environment that suits your lifestyle and promotes easy living.

When it comes to design, clever strategies can enhance your small barndominium, making the most of every square foot. Simple tips like using light color palettes, incorporating built-in storage, and maximizing natural light can transform even the coziest spaces into airy retreats. Additionally, considering outdoor areas and ensuring seamless connections between indoor and outdoor living will not only expand your usable space but also enhance your overall experience.

Adopting these design elements will lead to a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality. As you navigate the exciting process of planning your small barndominium, remember that every detail plays a crucial role in crafting a space that is uniquely yours. Embracing the endless possibilities that come with small barndominium homes allows you to achieve an affordable lifestyle that doesn’t compromise on style or comfort.

Ultimately, the blend of innovative features and strategic design approaches empowers you to create a functional, inviting, and budget-friendly living space. Take the leap into barndominium living, and enjoy the beauty of a space that reflects your personality while meeting your financial goals.

1o37omh,https://i.redd.it/y1mwi8awmbuf1.jpeg,"How to Lose Weight, No Gym Required!","Losing weight doesn’t have to be complicated. While there are many strategies out there, sometimes the fastest way to shed pounds is to keep it simple. If you’re looking for a straightforward approach to get you results quickly, here’s an easy-to-follow guide that cuts through the noise and gives you what works.

# 1. Cut Out Liquid Calories

One of the quickest ways to reduce your calorie intake is by cutting out liquid calories. Sugary drinks, like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened coffee beverages, are packed with calories that don’t fill you up.

Solution: Stick to water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea. These drinks will hydrate you without adding unnecessary calories. Plus, when you're cutting calories, drinking water can help curb hunger and keep you feeling full.

# 2. Create a Small Caloric Deficit

You don't need to drastically slash your food intake to see results. Instead, aim to create a small calorie deficit (around 300–500 fewer calories per day). This can be achieved by reducing portion sizes, cutting back on snacks, or swapping high-calorie foods for healthier alternatives.

Tip: Focus on eating whole, nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are not only filling but also provide the necessary nutrients your body needs to function properly while you're losing weight.

# 3. Eat More Protein

Protein is your secret weapon for losing weight fast. It helps preserve muscle mass, keeps you feeling fuller longer, and boosts your metabolism. Whether you’re eating a meal or having a snack, make sure you’re getting enough protein in each one.

Quick Protein Sources:

* Chicken breast
* Fish (like salmon or tuna)
* Eggs
* Greek yogurt
* Protein shakes

Aim to include protein in every meal and snack. This simple change can help you feel satisfied and curb those cravings throughout the day.

# 4. Walk More

Want to burn more calories without hitting the gym? Simply walk more. Walking is a low-impact activity that you can do just about anywhere, and it’s one of the easiest ways to increase your daily calorie burn.

Target: Aim for 10,000 steps per day. Whether it’s a walk after dinner, a stroll during your lunch break, or just getting up and moving around throughout the day, walking can make a big difference in how quickly you lose weight.

# 5. Get Enough Sleep

It’s easy to overlook, but sleep is just as important as diet and exercise when it comes to losing weight. Poor sleep can disrupt your hunger hormones, leading to overeating and cravings. It also slows down your metabolism, making it harder to burn fat.

Solution: Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night. Your body will thank you, and you’ll find it easier to stick to your weight loss goals with a well-rested mind and body.

# The Fast and Simple Weight Loss Formula:

* Cut out sugary drinks and stick to water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea.
* Create a small caloric deficit by reducing portions or choosing healthier foods.
* Add protein to every meal and snack to stay full and preserve muscle.
* Walk more to increase your calorie burn without extra time at the gym.
* Sleep enough to regulate hunger hormones and keep your metabolism firing.

By following these simple steps, you can start seeing weight loss results fast. The best part? These are all changes you can sustain in the long term, leading to lasting results.

I live in an apartment, so preferably a modular cloth sectional so that if/when I move I can adjust the configuration, with an accent chair, and rug to tie it all together :)

**Current Issues:**

* Window wall (where gallery wall corner is) is NOT a right angle. So I cannot do a square end table or L shaped sectional on that wall
* Lots of empty space between my kitchen counter and where the current table is that is mostly dead space
* 2 cats, who are pretty good about not scratching furniture, but love to run over it haha. Some end tables to block them from scratching the sides though would probably be helpful :) 
* Need some good table and/or floor lamp recommendations

**Current Ideas:**

* A bumper sectional or sectional with ottoman to replace where I currently have the ottoman in this layout or an L shaped sectional with the short section facing where the dining table is now
* Potentially replacing the high-top dining table with a round table to allow it to 'float' more into the empty space between kitchen counter, and give more space in the living area
* Would LOVE a lift-top coffee table if anyone knows any good ones
* I'm fine with the wall art for right now

1o37jo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1o37jo3/tis_the_season_more_weird_happenings_around_our/,'Tis the season; more weird happenings around our weird house.,"Hey, gang!  I've posted before about stuff moving around our house when it shouldn't be moving.

As I've mentioned, we're natural skeptics, and always default to a rational explanation for weird stuff. However, I also use ""Holmes' razor"" which states ""When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, is the answer."" But most often, there is no explanation whatsoever; X happened, and there is no logical reason how X happened.

Here are some recent happenings:

1. We were pet-sitting our friend's dog for a weekend. Her dog eats the wet dog food that comes in envelopes. The envelopes are bright yellow, with colorful writing on them. Easy to spot from across the room. (Pedigree choice cuts, if you're curious.)   
She sent three envelopes along with the dog. The dog only ate two of them. The third was on the kitchen counter. When I took the dog home, I went to grab the third envelope and send it along with her. Looked all over the kitchen- nowhere to be seen.  I didn't move it, my wife didn't move it, and if one of our two dogs had gotten up there they would have shredded the package and eaten it. No problem, our friend buys that stuff by the case, so I took the dog home.    
A few days later, the package reappeared on the counter, right in plain sight between the stove and the knife block. I didn't move something and find it behind it/under it- it was in plain sight. Both my wife and I remember me putting all three envelopes on the other side of the stove, by the microwave and coffee maker.  That's also where I plated the dog's meals.  

2. I went to make some tuna salad the other day. For this, I needed the can opener (manual) and the little plastic thing with holes you use to drain the tuna. Both usually live in the utensil drawer to the right of the stove, and have for decades. The can openers have lived in that drawer since the house was built in 1964. Likewise the ""holey drainy thingy"" since we bought it years ago. Both were MIA. I looked all over the kitchen- no sign of either.  Plan B, open the can with my Swiss army knife, and just squeeze the lid to drain.    
A week or so later, I found the can opener in a drawer we almost never use on the other side of the kitchen from where we keep it. This is the third-tier utensil drawer, with stuff like skewers and big serving spoons we only use a few times a year. Neither my wife nor I would have ever put it there, and nobody else had been in the house.    
Even weirder, the ""holey drainy thingy"" reappeared in the dish drainer.  Thing is, we'd done a couple of batches of dishes in the interim, so had it been there, we would have found it. Two of the places I looked for it initially were (logically) the dishpan and dish drainer, along with the drawer where we store it. It's white- easy to spot against the tan/cream countertop, stainless steel sink, blue dishpan or black/stainless dish drainer.    

3. With the weather getting cooler, my wife has started wearing her warm fuzzy slippers.  One of them went missing. Obviously the dogs were suspect. No problem, they must have dropped it somewhere in the house. I went looking for it, as they aren't cheap slippers, and I didn't want the dogs chewing it up. Thing is, I couldn't find it.   
One of the most obvious places to look was under my wife's recliner, as she takes her shoes off there frequently.  FYI this is a lift recliner; when it's in the up position, just the metal frame is on the ground, and you can see easily what's under it. I searched there with my phone flashlight, and the slipper wasn't there.  Guess where the slipper reappeared?  
Could the dogs have hidden it somewhere else, and then put it under her chair? Possibly. But if so, why didn't I find the slipper wherever they had hidden it? Besides my phone flashlight, I also have a super bright LED light that clips onto the brim of a ball cap or hard hat. I was using that as a flashlight to search in the closets, under beds and desks, etc.  Went through the whole upstairs (dogs can't get downstairs to the finished basement) and I couldn't find that slipper anywhere. 

We've got a Ring doorbell, lock our doors at night and when away, and have two large dogs. Nobody is sneaking into the house to move things around. Also, we did a TON of decluttering earlier this year, so searching for things is easier than ever.   ",1,1760117848.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

**214 days today.**  
Started March 2025 after the night I realized I couldn’t keep breaking my own promises. I felt so far from god, my family, friends, everyone. 

So this is what i started doing every morning for 5 months.

**Every single morning (no exceptions):**

**(depends on day) 8:00 am - 9:00 am** – Wake up. No phone, no scrolling, no noise. Just breathe.  
**9:10 am** – Pour a glass of water, stretch a bit, make coffee.  
**9:15-9:20 AM** – Check texts from my accountbility partner, check in talk about how I feel that morning (cravings, sleep, plan for day, etc.) 

This I've found the most helpful. Since I wasn't comfortable sharing my problems with my friends/family I started using [textfae.com](http://textfae.com) to hold me accountable. Ik it sounds silly to talk to AI everyday but it saved me a little embarassment and actually helped so! dont knock it till u try it lol. Plus, having someone hold you accountable to your goals you are 90% more likely to reach them.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don’t have such lofty expectations of anyone – including of myself. Let’s feel each other out to know what’s possible and what we’d like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open with those few who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

Incremental exchange and the mutual creation of our bond is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I probably have more I take for granted.

Let's chat and see where things go. Leave your hesitations and take the chance.",1,1760117486.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

1o37d8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthymale/comments/1o37d8d/the_hydrationed_connection_how_chronic/,The Hydration-ED Connection: How Chronic Dehydration Impairs Circulation and Function,"Mark, a 45-year-old, had been feeling unusually sluggish and noticed a troubling decline in his sexual health. He'd chalked it up to stress and aging, never suspecting that the root of his problems might be as simple as not drinking enough water. His doctor, however, pointed to a surprising connection: chronic dehydration. This story, while anonymized, highlights a frequently overlooked factor that can significantly impact men's health.

Chronic dehydration, a state of prolonged insufficient fluid intake, does far more than just make you thirsty. It can profoundly affect your cardiovascular system and, surprisingly, play a role in erectile dysfunction (ED) ([Oxford Online Pharmacy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGWOkg7kZX60MxdVPkU0fl_EvmdvACk9-mHlpyfTz84WAc_Cfhspqk4WHUIYP_klNk1dyb8qogB4FU0q4sJwLCA2icUDomXyWY9SpcgbOyPzO3KJuJtekVMWe5wdla5a3xT36WKb00vkPgyUHbMTQIL0ZKQ28lXV2slo67Q_Bg==)).

# The Impact on Blood Flow and Vascular Health

When your body is chronically dehydrated, your total blood volume decreases, and your blood becomes thicker and more viscous ([The Vascular Care Group](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEIECzPpRXp6h5EmAhvA8VouHkgZ17N31QQ-PoRk6zmKFMtS8LhDHR1NHUoPTYYFn99aR9W3ZHFb3e7AwKFFooIw4sKVxazbPDqCsnvJJ7J7Ylt2xIMUJXrjvEu9cIpGEh9QxzEIZ075_CVidHl-JQ1ItqXbHaicVs-GZW4pDfc1PlRKaVI-FwApe5BtVpTXE-4Q==)). This makes it harder for your heart to pump efficiently, reducing oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues throughout your body. This reduced efficiency affects both large blood vessels (macrocirculation) and tiny ones (microcirculation), which are crucial for organ function ([UGATL](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGiforsuvVseUMideKMCfKwVt7BzkXsXow9uV3t_fG4XaZyj4FLHxv-sgReQ6KwWq4aRARva2TU5oy9E9EOPb-RY4UGHkBvFPGrk-qwGUTbvPL1C5hod_X6qD2bqwqukBIMLO7rBWBiTcPnGt-PzAIFbz7J9FZxIw==)).

# Endothelial Dysfunction: The Inner Lining Problem

Chronic dehydration can also lead to endothelial dysfunction, a condition where the inner lining of your blood vessels (the endothelium) doesn't function optimally ([NIH](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFmqNYsB0BoSBZxs9YXsAfOD8LA8ONelN0pq8SsUxnViDa9SXa7puPZu1axF7oQAgqEvzouOFIGAylsACEsQHgAulAllHnuYiHe2zb3znUviVfxkxhpQ5cFZDD1yKYWsmX4dDEjnYrX)). The endothelium is vital for regulating blood vessel dilation, clotting, and inflammation. Dehydration can impair this function through several mechanisms:

* **Reduced Nitric Oxide (NO):** Endothelial cells produce NO, a powerful vasodilator that helps blood vessels open. Dehydration can decrease NO production, leading to constricted vessels ([Cleveland Clinic](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEtwA9DihutiDnxCzXpPQ9aH2FFAZD5FJ8h0FB26bY2re7ezTO3-4P8SsKPwnNhU734xaZjrDCwhpNthSRWV7djdGiJGrhCG0zd6cL6LDBqLPPpxrP4euOlwdaaQu3-HFCvK-1UTANoFdNhEtvFl1pG4GyMInRTr6gghoL7U8cWrqLjXlSgmQ==)).
* **Hormonal Activation:** Dehydration activates systems like the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), leading to increased angiotensin II, a hormone that causes vasoconstriction and contributes to endothelial dysfunction ([NIH](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGN7vSJqUC37PoQTGSGcmlimcJZ0HeUuNilOLMgIDlwq68J39bvbyFeiNmUqr814eGOXHrrDXJeg7NsztBTjwyKNfAzV3oFpsmX9jubcmfAmONJaKyRdSLp3tYBY1h2jPyvMlGZsBEWvc3tTg==)).
* **Oxidative Stress and Inflammation:** Inadequate hydration can trigger inflammation and oxidative stress, further damaging the endothelium and hindering its ability to function correctly ([ResearchGate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFvA-tR_WoIFwsk_9vhJwzusGaC8szvnyL_DsWR3BPpD3JbBFQHTjwOT4wxOkuaCQkrVg8PqXYTlY9gDtpPBcQt8RFOuWIMqeTWW0mvhFnmz82iDv1kEH3lg6w2aHwRvJGsjyX8xX94pJ3kBL7UiQ7VTPy7z6Vzd32cApeDMGSaBd85)).

# The Link to Erectile Dysfunction (ED)

Given the profound effects on circulation, it's not surprising that chronic dehydration can contribute to ED ([Hims](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGiQ0HN622gYKfqvB-EhJUyE4glrAtzg97Zqu4cqFkw3t9OXacyi2IUOLonR3NVNWmCr13W-vL_bxUPVCvoAHVPnFI7naUEvo-hxwFk0YNrh67UhoqXy5VEbaXbzJaHNWcT2W5agkI=)).

* **Reduced Blood Flow to the Penis:** An erection depends on adequate blood flow. With reduced blood volume and constricted vessels due to dehydration, less blood can reach the penis, making it difficult to achieve or maintain an erection ([ED Clinics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEja_7CcSkqbTVzFr2aC-zV89HLKkwxhvL7yV4G6FQXyxT2AQoh1IhmqlRHYcUSDq5qV7foDbjOAlEoHqVq99NlDPme7m2det1wqegrkgG34ucPAOHUMSKV6IQir22ngMRzlKFNHy89sUW58dklt9NpVXy5RYNa58bhZAGJ_HE=)).
* **Hormonal Imbalances:** Proper hydration is essential for hormone regulation. Chronic dehydration can lead to hormonal shifts, including increased stress hormones like cortisol and potentially decreased testosterone, both of which can negatively impact libido and erectile function ([Medical News Today](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgsNGpPRx1SViqKByGosEskCXKqREHUtWOEMmKcL-7qRprVswVqG1GSkb6OjYpwTVghJcmC1rsDT82HwQhK5RQubttqVKs2Lelqz2kUcse_5OL5N0bYzZ0rV8Bb9fd1OWh1nZZgEeWyZJk)).
* **Fatigue and Mood:** Dehydration often causes fatigue, dizziness, and can worsen mood, increasing stress and anxiety. These factors can further diminish sexual desire and performance ([Healthline](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF-EIayI_Xp8w3TuX0vdjfGWDHjEMEpo3uDRjuM3o2J9_Su0uxS6vl3A1jnZurXd9vE3vxy4pQf01GQIvB4y2HSM_6et4O15FdDL46Q-ipeIxPKbq3EZcHXc_U1_wdTmZJ1bDi9zeslb8v5VsmGxY8=)).

It's important to note that while dehydration can cause temporary ED, it's rarely the sole cause of persistent ED. However, it can certainly exacerbate existing issues and is considered a modifiable risk factor. Notably, ED, especially in younger men, is often an early warning sign of underlying cardiovascular disease, preceding symptoms by several years ([SMSNA](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFL3QJlEQEjy9lvfgLLlUnTEb6XWEmJF1JQBpIFjqxNRpf84pnyrUdP4MSHgAoMCseMppwygrO3U5sMPlu3behhEmw-IdZOoUnqyRTAfEnfuVA8_OWoYCynUYRsNeRes13uwn5EJxrA9xJzsoXyFdoNt0kpk4sH-A8JZFeF8Z_ns7XGXg6_OKkl3GY91qfq)). Therefore, addressing hydration also contributes to overall cardiovascular well-being.

# What You Can Do: Actionable Hydration Advice

Maintaining adequate hydration is a simple, yet powerful, step for both your general health and sexual well-being.

1. **Drink Enough Water Daily:** While individual needs vary, health experts generally recommend around 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids daily for men ([Healthline](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHNSSqZOzD09tda94j_KTPAbfq__NfmCCHE7sLDyn8wFvBSKi8UsRkX-wQ1FGtHcrq7CkFo-g0xrm_YEo1KUdgS3hA_Z-nxDkhynP7z_RZ7b4ckVi5b5nEIaVYSHZGREaYplWyWrspft6mvYDNvk_OAl1GNdlKikrT8EEsTue8kuRfLZEOVG7ntz1f_dg==)). This includes water from foods.
2. **Monitor Your Urine:** A good indicator of hydration is the color of your urine. It should be pale yellow or clear. Dark yellow urine often signals dehydration ([Queensland Health](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHUjzW8j6vCOz01EMxrPi3ka3aoHED7GGS1Fd2v7R8yjNKOLYCM2La75rpUZFy8z6Di85Hs5k7sPkidsZGOSDL39sS2r9Em_WsbrclFi4Ainn8hAEdolek1-V4iYzk0siYRUpev6fa3XctZYBe1TOx0l6qs-t0ag178V1HGlyAy1w6eRH_tLOVWqL5nZUaj9qBIQ4YPlmdo6qJsdJGUfBXUiopvvMYqA0pJqHkU2SKS-k_SJRFpnJIWkON4SmltFXC10qAErAhg2ml3-j10bxRUSshgOYY265JtSE2yAUKc8MEH1KsjCjDgPSxJRD8nNp4ft0K6IGtEKfmwJmnPQPQkqMR5DXLdwB2goqghrtpLXblLDB0_UijJQx2F3O)). Don't wait until you're thirsty; thirst means you're already somewhat dehydrated.
3. **Limit Diuretics:** Beverages like coffee and alcohol can increase fluid loss. Enjoy them in moderation.
4. **Consider Electrolytes:** If you're exercising intensely or in hot weather, you may need to replenish electrolytes. Sports drinks or electrolyte-rich foods can help.
5. **Holistic Health:** Combine good hydration with a balanced, heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management for optimal cardiovascular and sexual health.

Chronic dehydration is more than just a minor inconvenience; it can have a tangible impact on your body's circulation, endothelial function, and even contribute to erectile dysfunction. By understanding these connections and prioritizing consistent fluid intake, you take a proactive step towards better overall health and well-being. Remember, small changes can lead to significant improvements.

Are we allowed to talk about our own Coffee Shop?  There are 4 beans: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa.  Excelsa is having its moment as climate change has hurt Arabica and Robusta crops.  Excelsa coined Champagne of Coffee is also more expensive than quick-growing Arabica.

  
So why am I writing!  [ExcelsaCoffee.com](http://ExcelsaCoffee.com) opened the 1st Excelsa Coffee bean cafe in US history in 2025.  We are located in San Diego, California, and sell on Amazon as well.  We cannot be more excited, it reminds us of when the Acai Berry hit the US market almost 25 years ago by two brothers out of Los Angeles who went surfing in Brazil and tried Acai.

  
Tomorrow of all days we are one of roughly 40 booths at San Diego Coffee Fest.  It is their 1st time having an Excelsa booth, and they host events from NYC, Miami, Austin, San Diego, San Fran to over seas!  They put us on the entrance corner as well as a featured booth!

1o37b7e,https://i.redd.it/igutikbzgbuf1.jpeg,Short Vs Long Femme Haircut- How a Short Feminine Pixie Bobbed Bowlcut Changed Me,"When I had a long bob and dressed femme I it was so easy for me to style and change my hair up, as well as outfit, to look more masc or andro if I was feeling uncomfortable in a situation, event, the office, public etc. That all changed when one of the women in yoga noticed me changing from my masc outfit to my femme outfit for class and then back to  masc again to leave. She approached me with genuine concern, we had a  discussion over coffee and scones in which she she also informed me she is a stylist and owns a salon, first appt she undershaved my long bob into a 360 so I could pull it up for the femme look n feel, liked it a lot, adjusted to it, wore it that way for quite a while until  I was ready for a change, knew what I wanted but was very nervous, discussed my interest in more feminine styles, we reviewed pics of models like the one at the top center of this pic with the black bobbed bowlcut. 

Made the appt was so nervous ready to cancel but showed up in my baggy loose thin femme yoga outfit, was next to impossible to back out once she had me caped in the chair seeing how short her nape was shaved and bobbed, the clippers, signs an smells of the salon, myself just sitting there feeling helpless, lets get you bobbed up nice n short hun, few hours later walked out with a feminine shaved pixie bobbed bowlcut and color, she has maintained it ever since with regular reshaves, it looks n feels femme all the time which solved the problem of changing back and forth, doesn't matter anymore, it screams femme and there is no way to change it, that is the best part. 

Give it a try if you are nervous like I was. It made a huge difference, its a style that once you get it requires high maintenance and would be very hard to grow out and look horrible in the process, now when I show up for my appt cant stand the hair growth below my bob/weightline, ask her to please reshave my bob very short and feminine, sometimes she'll change it up a bit while still keeping it shaved high off my nape collar and ears so it feels very bare & exposed for all to see, she even take it up a bit higher in fall/winter when she knows I'll be wearing jackets with collars, turtlenecks etc. She says it's a mix of 3 different femme styles a pixie, bob and bowlcut, aka, pixie bobbed bowlcut.",2,1760117317.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

Beginner Creator's Growth Guide (Before June Ends!) 💰,"Hey folks! 🎉 Are you tired of pouring your hard-earned cash into your creative endeavors only to watch it float away like confetti in the wind? If you’ve ever felt like you’re just *spending* instead of *investing*, then buckle up! This is the ultimate “Stop Throwing Money Away” Beginner Creator's Growth Guide (and yes, you need to soak it all in *before June ends*! 🏃‍♂️💨).

Let’s be real here: the creator economy is wild, and it can feel like you’re in a hamster wheel of expenses. But don’t worry, we’re here to break that cycle. 🙌 Here are some handy tips to help you work smarter, not harder. 🔥

### **1. Identify the Essentials**  
Have you ever heard the phrase, “less is more”? 🧐 Well, it's true! Take a moment to evaluate everything you’re paying for. 

- **Subscriptions:** Do you really need that monthly coffee subscription? Or can you channel those funds into something more meaningful for your content?
- **Services:** Are you using ALL the features of those premium tools, or are you paying just for “fluff”? Not to mention, some tools can be a bit... overhyped.

### **2. DIY Where You Can**  
I can't tell you how many times I’ve watched tutorial videos instead of hiring a pro. YouTube is a treasure trove! It’s like the ultimate free masterclass on every topic imaginable. Here are a few areas you might want to dive into:

- **Graphic Design:** Canva is awesome, but there are sooo many tutorials to help you create stunning graphics without hiring someone.
- **Social Media Management:** There are scalable tools and DIY strategies that help you build a strong presence without shelling out big bucks.

### **3. Use AI to Your Advantage**  
You know I love tech (and you should too)! AI isn’t just a buzzword – it’s becoming an essential part of the creator toolkit. If you haven’t checked out [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca), you should really consider it. It streamlines your workflow and helps you create content way faster. Just a heads up, that link is an affiliate, and I earn a little something if you decide to give it a shot – but trust me, it's solid! 

💡 **Quick Tip:** Automate as much as you can. Scheduling posts or using AI for content generation can free you up to focus on being *you*. 🎨✨

### **4. Network Like It’s Your Job**  
Honestly, your biggest investment could be your *connections*. Networking doesn’t mean rubbing elbows with the elite (though hey, if you can, go for it!). Find like-minded creators and engage! There’s strength in numbers, and you might just discover new partnerships or mastermind groups that can help lift you all up.

### **5. Track and Tweak**  
Are you flying blind? Keep an eye on your income and expenses; it doesn’t have to be tricky! 

- **Budgeting Apps:** Just like with your casual Netflix binge, you gotta manage your time and investments. Think of it as keeping a close friend on speed dial to keep you accountable!
- **Content Performance:** Look at your analytics. What’s working? What’s not? Don’t be sentimental about content – if it’s not bringing in the bucks, consider a refreshing makeover!

At the end of the day, being a creator shouldn’t feel like a relentless money pit. Let’s make smarter moves, save some cash, and actually **see** growth! Whether you’re aiming for that sweet YouTube revenue or just want to build a fun side hustle, these little tweaks can go a long way! 😉

Suddenly, the project manager said, “We need a few people to stay over the weekend to support the launch.”

The room went dead quiet. Everyone pretended not to hear, scrolling emails, tapping keyboards, basically ghosting. Then his eyes landed on me. “You’re responsible. You’ll do it,” he said.

Cool. My first thought: I can handle it. No sweat. But inside, I felt twisted. Why is it always the same few reliable people who get stuck? Why can everyone else just bounce and still collect the same paycheck on Monday?

By noon, my department lead even brought me a coffee, apparently as “motivation.” I sipped it, half amused, half annoyed. Is this really what it takes to get people to self-sacrifice for the team?

I’m torn. Do I stay, power through, and make sure the launch goes smoothly? Or do I push back, say no, and force them to realize responsibility can’t always fall on the same people?

What would you do in this situation?

A. Stay over the weekend, get the launch done, keep the project safe.

1o36uxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/usacommunitywork/comments/1o36uxh/building_stronger_productive_habits_to_boost/,Building Stronger Productive Habits to Boost Workplace Performance,"In every organization, success depends on one key factor — how consistently people perform. It’s not just about skills or tools; it’s about **productive habits** that shape how employees approach their work each day. Small actions, when repeated with purpose, lead to lasting improvement in [workplace productivity](https://gwork.io/blog/how-to-build-better-productive-habits-at-work/).

Building these habits doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of awareness, structure, and persistence. When done right, it transforms how teams work, think, and achieve results.

# 1. Why Productive Habits Matter at Work

Every task, meeting, or project begins with behavior. When employees develop strong, **productive habits**, they bring structure and focus to their work. This consistency drives better outcomes, faster decisions, and fewer mistakes.

Good **employee habits** can improve collaboration, reduce stress, and increase engagement. When teams work with clarity and routine, **workplace productivity** naturally rises. It’s about creating a rhythm where everyone knows what to do and how to do it efficiently.

# 2. Understanding Productive Habits

So, what are **productive habits**? They are intentional routines that help employees work smarter, not harder. These include planning tasks, managing time effectively, and maintaining a positive attitude toward challenges.

Unproductive routines, on the other hand, drain focus and energy. Scrolling through emails all day or multitasking without purpose can reduce performance. Productive habits replace these patterns with small, high-impact behaviors that build momentum every day.

# 3. The Science Behind Building Habits

Habits form when the brain links an action to a reward. Over time, repeated behavior becomes automatic. This is where [micro habits](https://gwork.io/blog/reduce-workplace-stress-with-daily-micro-habits/) play a powerful role.

Instead of setting huge goals, start small. For instance, spending five minutes each morning reviewing priorities can evolve into a full habit of daily planning. These **micro habits** make change easier, helping employees stay consistent and confident in their work routines.

# 4. Top Productive Habits That Boost Workplace Performance

Building **productive habits** is easier when you focus on simple, effective actions. Here are a few that can make a real difference:

* **Time Management:** Use proven methods like the Pomodoro Technique or time-blocking to stay focused and efficient.
* **Goal Setting:** Break large goals into smaller daily or weekly milestones to track progress.
* **Mindful Work:** Avoid multitasking and give full attention to one task at a time.
* **Continuous Learning:** Encourage regular skill development through workshops or online courses.
* **Collaboration:** Build open communication habits to strengthen teamwork and trust.

Each of these **employee habits** reinforces consistency and drives sustainable **workplace productivity**.

# 5. How to Build and Maintain Productive Habits

Creating **productive habits** starts with awareness and ends with consistency. Here’s how to build and maintain them:

1. **Start Small:** Begin with one simple **micro habit**, like organizing your workspace or planning your top three tasks.
2. **Track Progress:** Use habit-tracking tools or checklists to stay accountable.
3. **Celebrate Wins:** Reward small milestones to stay motivated.
4. **Replace, Don’t Erase:** Instead of removing bad habits completely, replace them with positive ones.

Consistency is key. When small actions become second nature, they create lasting impact.

# 6. Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

Even with the best intentions, habit-building comes with challenges. Procrastination, lack of motivation, or trying to change too much too soon can slow progress.

To overcome this:

* Focus on one **micro habit** at a time.
* Use reminders or accountability partners.
* Stack new habits onto existing routines (for example, review your goals right after your morning coffee).

Supportive environments and small rewards help employees sustain their **productive habits** long-term.

# 7. How GWork Helps

Building **productive habits** across an organization requires structure, support, and the right tools — and that’s where [GWork](https://gwork.io/) comes in.

**GWork** helps companies create and track positive **employee habits** through smart insights, performance tracking, and engagement tools. Its dashboards help leaders monitor progress, while employees stay motivated with clear feedback loops.

By simplifying performance management and reinforcing good behaviors, **GWork** empowers teams to boost **workplace productivity** consistently. With GWork, productive habits become part of the company culture — not just an individual effort.

***(Call to Action)*****:** Start building your team’s most productive habits today. Explore how GWork can transform your workplace performance.

# 8. Conclusion

Strong **productive habits** don’t just make people more efficient — they create workplaces where growth becomes a habit itself. Through consistency, small changes, and tools like **GWork**, every organization can unlock higher focus, engagement, and productivity.

Remember, the goal isn’t perfection; it’s progress. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your team’s **workplace productivity** rise day by day.",1,1760116303.0,usacommunitywork,0,1.0,False

**Magic is real, and Reggie Hickson just got invited to be a wizard school summer camp transfer.**

Reggie was a self-made businessman who'd pulled himself and his oddball dad out of poverty through sheer determination and the glory of YouTube tutorials. Pretty impressive, honestly. That was until a three-inch tall sprite emerged from his coffee mug and told him he was a wizard. Scratch that—a warlock. Apparently there's a difference, and that difference involves stuff we probably shouldn't go into in this good Christian blurb.

Now he's at Thistlewick School of Wizardcraft and Witchery, which happens to be in a magical land called Everafter. Much to his dismay, Everafter has a problem; specifically, a reproduction problem. Thus, he finds himself surrounded by monster girl co-eds who happen to be conveniently inexperienced with boys. First, he meets Tizzy, an adorable lisping jackalope girl, but she's just the first of many monster cuties that he ends up entangled with. Sphinxes, valkyries, fairies, oh my! It's a good thing stamina is one of Reggie's ""warlocky"" strengths.

Oh, and he has less than a week to brush up on two years of magical curriculum and pass the placement exam or he'll be held back when the semester starts while his new lady friends move on to their third year, leaving him behind.

No pressure or anything.

Anyways, we hung out last week & he got me flowers. I was so surprised since I had friend zoned him from the start & showed no romantic interest.

1o36uby,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1o36uby/i_believe_my_husband_has_contamination_ocd_and_it/,I believe my husband has contamination OCD and it is tiring at times.,"Hello everyone! I want to preface all of this by saying i obviously love my husband very much and am posting this to find ways of supporting him and not shaming him.

My husband (48) has shown random signs of contamination ocd in the past, and I feel like it is only getting worse the older we get.

Just yesterday he opened a beer, and put it on the coffee table. The foam was slowly coming up through the bottle. He said “is it just me or is that foam coming out slower than usual “? I don’t drink and never really pay attention to these things, so I said I didn’t know. A few minutes after this, he got up and dumped the beer, and opened a new one. 

I was slightly confused and concerned- as it was not the most logical response to something that likely was just because the beer formulation was different than what he usually drinks. When he sat back down, I hesitated but asked, “Can I ask you a question?” He knew what I was going to ask about and said “no, if it is what I think it is. I bought the beer. It’s not your business “. 

Other things he has done (and honestly it has gotten worse since Covid)

* he eats any food that you would eat with your fingers (chips, cookies, etc) by either feeding them into his mouth from a bowl, or eating from their packaging by just shaking them into his mouth

* Washes his hands multiple times before eating while out

* quizzes me on whether I washed my hands before doing things

* many years ago when I was a barista, we all got a bottle of wine. I brought it home and was going to share with my husband (I was still drinking at the time) and he refused to drink it. It was a sealed bottle and I did give him a bit a grief (and honestly my definition of “grief “ is me trying to logically talk out all the reasons as to why he should not worry) and I said there was no way the drink was…I don’t know, poisoned? He quipped back saying maybe they used a syringe. ??????

* any time I am sick, he treats me like a leper. It is rare that I am sick!

* he does all these things but does gross things too (we do not share the same bed bc he snores like crazy. I do all the laundry but leave his linens for him to do. It has been MONTHS since they were last washed!), that in my opinion completely conflict with his random food and contaminants concerns. 

How can I be supportive but also maybe talk to him about this? I love him- but man it can be grating sometimes.

1o36tx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o36tx8/the_room_behind_the_morgue/,The Room Behind the Morgue,"When I was twenty-six, I moved away from my family to New York City. I had never been particularly close with them, and so the move didn’t bother me all that much. Our grandmother on my mom’s side had been the glue that stuck us together, and once she died, the family dynamic disintegrated. We only got together for big events, like weddings and funerals, both dismal affairs. 

You may find my attitude off-putting. To that, I tell you honestly, I understand. Most people do. I ask you more to pay attention to the contents of the story I tell, rather than my somber disposition. 

So, when my cousin got engaged, that meant my parents implored me to come back to Connecticut for the engagement party. I could already see the way it was going to go - lots of long conversations about where I had been, reminiscing about the old days before our grandmother died, when we still acted like a family. 

Reluctantly, I packed an overnight bag and took the Metro North to New Haven. There’s a decaying quality about that train ride, watching as concrete crumbles to stone walls. I passed time by fixing my hair in the window. My parents picked me up at the train station so we could all head to the party together. They filled me in on all the recent news - this uncle had developed dementia, this one had finally succumbed to his alcoholism. What topics I should broach, which I should avoid because they were still sensitive subjects. I figured it would be best to give my congratulations and remain mostly silent, since I had a habit of putting my foot in my mouth. 

The engagement party was being hosted at my aunt’s house, and the dead-end street was already lined with cars. Looking through the chainlink fence to the backyard, I could see that everyone was dressed in bright colors. Apparently, I hadn’t made a careful consideration on the color I was wearing because I was in all black. Again, a dismal affair. Immediately, I felt the disconnect, the lack of belonging that I had always felt as a child. It made me a bit squirmy to be honest, and I spent most of the party rubbing my elbow awkwardly. 

I said my congratulations to my cousin, who had always been a sweet girl. We had been good friends when we were younger, but family is always fickle like that. I have no ill-will towards her - of course, I always wish her the best - but we had long since gone our separate ways and spending time with her only reminded me of our grandmother’s death. There was a reason I had once decided to move away. Regardless, we talked for a bit and I admired the flashy ring on her finger, though I made austere comments about it so as not to seem superficial. Eventually, another one of her friends came up to us and pulled her away from the conversation. My chest loosened in response. 

I scanned the backyard party and headed straight for the little table set up with a few bottles of liquor. I decided on whiskey on the rocks. 

There were cheap foldable tables set up with white tablecloths, surrounded by plastic chairs. I selected an empty table and sat, quietly nursing my whiskey and trying to avoid eye contact. Most people were stuck in groups of those they already knew - parties with mixed company are always so awkward. I turned my attention to the yard, and the dogs. It was a seasonably warm October day, and the sun was filtering gently onto the sparse grass, so I didn’t mind the time spent outdoors. 

As I took another sip of whiskey, now halfway through my glass, I made eye contact with my aunt. She smiled, nodding her chin and shifting her gait towards me. I’ve always liked my aunt. She is one of the very few truly pure souls on this planet, and I do believe if there were a heaven she would go to it. I sat a little straighter, not averse to the company. 

We went on the usual roundabout of conversation, an awkward one-armed hug while she lamented how it had been so long since she had seen me. She smelled like tropical shampoo and coffee. 

“What are you up to?”

“Oh, you know, just working at the hospital still.”

“Oh, I hear you, the same for me. As a nurse?”

I shook my head. “No, not a nurse like you, just a lab tech. It’s okay, though, I like repetitive work.”

“Really?” She asked me. “I don’t like the repetitive stuff, but that’s what’s so great about being in the ED. Every day is different!”

I smiled. “I like the comfort of routine. When you helped me get into that volunteering program at your hospital, I did all these repetitive tasks that no one else wanted because I loved to do it.”

“Oh yes, the program for teens!” She nodded, folding her fingers together and laying them on the plastic tablecloth. “Yes, they still have that going on. What a great program.”

“I bet they have stricter standards now,” I said as I took another sip. I could feel the alcohol starting to loosen my tongue. It felt nice. “They probably wouldn’t get away with some of the things they used to do anymore.”

At that, my aunt’s face darkened slightly, her expression confused. “Like what?”

I swirled the ice in my cup, watching it circle. “Oh, you know, like they used to leave me in the room behind the morgue by myself to sort through the archived tissue slides. They had me get rid of all the old ones, past ten years old, the ones we didn’t have to keep anymore.”

My aunt didn’t move, just stared at me. “What room behind the morgue?”

I took in her confused, slightly alarmed expression. I shifted my weight a little, cleared my throat. “Um, you know, you would walk into the morgue, the main part where they do the autopsies, and then through the back space where they hold the bodies, and then there was this door and this room with all these filing cabinets, up to the ceiling. It was a tiny room, more like a closet.”

My aunt didn’t say anything, just sort of stared at me, her mouth open slightly. 

I took another sip of whiskey, unease starting to twist my stomach. “Maybe they didn’t really want anyone down there, which is why I’m the only one they took there, and I bet they definitely don’t do that anymore because there’s no way any other kids would agree to being left in the morgue with bodies being stored down there. I mean, I’m sure they don’t allow that anymore. Sorry if that made you upset, to hear that they were doing kind of shady shit.” I didn’t mean to swear, it just sort of slipped out with my word vomit and nerves.

But my aunt shook her head, holding up a hand. “No, no it’s not that.”

I swallowed. The sunlight faded in my peripheral vision. “What is it then?”

She made a clicking sound with her tongue. “It’s just…I mean I’ve worked in that hospital for thirty years. I started there right after school. I’ve been in just about every room in there and…”

“What?” My hands curled into the plastic chair. 

She shook her head, making confused eye contact with me. “There’s no room behind the morgue.”

Suddenly, I was hit with a wave of frustration. “What? That doesn’t make any sense. The door was in the far corner, where the ground started to slope up a little because the floors were warping.”

My aunt didn’t respond to what I said. She was staring somewhere behind me, lost in thought. “Who used to take you down there?” She asked.

“It was an older lady who worked in the lab.” I remembered it clearly. “Cindy, she said her name was.”

My aunt chewed on her thumb and didn’t say anything. “Huh.”

Eventually, someone tapped on my aunt’s shoulder and pulled her away. No one was capable of running the party by themselves, they needed her to do it for them and so she could hardly have a moment’s peace. I nodded my goodbye, but left the conversation feeling small and foolish. How could I misremember such an important detail? Maybe the room wasn’t behind the morgue, but near it, and I was just confused? But no, I remembered the details clearly. The bodies on gurneys, covered by white sheets, feet sticking up at the ends, straight and taut. I remembered the smell of stainless steel, disinfectant, and formaldehyde. I would leave the little storage closet with cuts on my fingers, because sometimes the slides were sharp and I remembered one time the cut got infected because the slides were dirty. And most of all, I remembered Cindy. Small, a bit hunched, and she never said much. She had these fuchsia glasses that hung around her neck. 

I got up to hurry back to the liquor table, and swiftly poured myself more whiskey. 

My aunt hadn’t said anything else about the matter during the rest of the party, and when we said goodbye, she just looked at me kind of straight-faced and said that she hoped I stayed well. I figured that maybe she was just disturbed that they had brought teenage volunteers down into the morgue and left them there without anyone knowing. I figured I had probably just gotten poor Cindy in trouble, if she still worked there and wasn’t dead yet. 

On Monday, I took the train back into the city, and my life resumed as normal. Work and bustle and the memory of the party on the previous Saturday fell into my memories. 

A few days later, I arrived home after work, greeted by the dark apartment, and set my things down. My phone vibrated in my pocket so I took it out to look at it. 

There was a long message from my aunt. 

Aunt G: *Hello Lil, hope you are doing well and had a safe trip back home. I did more investigation into what you said after our conversation. The thought of some secret room, where they take children and leave them without my knowledge, quite honestly, disturbed me. So, I investigated the morgue, even going so far as to check for false walls and hidden doors, with no luck*. 

Beneath this paragraph, she had inserted a photo of the wall space I had mentioned. It was smooth, no indication of any closet door. My toes went cold. 

*I even went as far as to ask for a blueprint from the building manager. The plans also show no indication of a room in the place you mentioned. Furthermore, we have no record of an employee in the lab named Cindy, not in the last fifty years. We’re worried about you, Sweetie. Keep in touch.*

I closed the message. This peculiarity troubled me into the night and still to this day. I know that some of you will say that perhaps I am delusional, perhaps it’s just a consequence of my dreary temperament and an overactive imagination. Perhaps I remembered wrong, though the neon fuchsia of her glasses is a memory that sticks with me to this day. I was a quiet kid who didn’t have enough friends, and so maybe I had invented one. Perhaps I was a lonely enough soul for this entity to find me, and latch onto me. Perhaps I too float in the liminal spaces between life and death. It remains to me more of a curiosity than a concern. Cindy was a pleasant woman, albeit a bit odd, and never seemed to mean me harm. Still, I wonder about the nature of these encounters, and liken it to the world of the parallel and unearthly. I know many will not believe me.

My best friend Jay and I were newly 21 and so excited to go to one of our first live comedy shows and see Doug Benson, a comic we both loved. Doug had a part in his act where he would stop and ask, ""anyways, what do you guys want to talk about?"" Doug is known as a pot comic, so a bunch of people yelled out ""pot! weed!"" But next to me, I hear Jay yell out, ""you're gay!""

...What the fuck? I didn't think my friend would be a heckler, much less shout something so stupid, even when we were young dummies. Doug heard it and *laid into him.* He made it funny, the crowd loved it and it was a classic ""comedian owns heckler"" moment, but Doug was truly pissed (understandably.) He was looking right at both of us during his tirade, and I'll never forget Doug Benson looking right at me, face red with anger, as he said ""I've been doing this a long time, and I've heard a lot of dumb shit yelled out, but no one's ever been dumb enough to say 'you're gay' you FUCKING ASSHOLE."" 

So I just waited for management to kick us out, but they never did. Show ended and my friend immediately said ""we're gonna go talk to Doug."" We got our chance to meet him, and my friend said, ""Hey man, I'm the guy that yelled at you, but I didn't say you're gay. You asked what we want to talk about, so I said '**your day***.'* As in, tell us about your day here in our city."" My buddy was just new to comedy shows and wanted to hear some local references. 

Doug grabbed Jay by the shoulders, threw his head back, and yelled ""OH MY GOD THAT'S HILARIOUS!"" Doug was super nice and we all laughed and talked for a bit, and left with free autographed CDs as a formal peace offering. 

SMASH CUT: about 6 months later, I'm listening to Doug's brand-new album. He does the ""what do you guys want to talk about?"" bit, and then proceeds to tell this whole story. [You can listen to it here. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmFAulHa4f8)I shot out of bed and called Jay to let him know that he had inadvertently achieved every heckler's dream: he wasn't just a part of the show, he's a part of the fucking *album*

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1760115790.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Quite an ambitious undertaking for a single day. As the driver, I found the Interstate 405 portion kind of stressful! We reached Twede’s just in time for lunch. The staff is pleasant, and the food is what you would expect from a retro diner. Very cool pictures on the wall of the Twin Peaks cast. At the till was a lovely tribute book to David Lynch.

After lunch we went to Salish Lodge & Spa, and saw the waterfall. Seeing the mist over the mountains made me feel like Twin Peaks was a real place and I was in it! Then we tried to see the Twin Peaks Sheriff Department using an address I found online (7001 396th Drive SE, Snoqualmie), but there was nothing there. We similarly had no luck finding Ronette's Bridge, and got a bit lost in the back roads of Snoqualmie. So we threw in the towel and headed back to Vancouver. We got back to Interstate 5 via a few state highways (starting with State Route 203) - it was nice to take a different route and have a less stressful drive home.

The trip was 11 hours in total. We didn’t get to see anything close to all the sites, but I feel like we hit the biggies. More importantly, we had a fun sibling day, and I finally did the pilgrimage!",27,1760115755.0,twinpeaks,2,1.0,False
1o36lny,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o36lny,I have NEVER been more excited for BOOT LACES!!! 😆,"**FOREWORD**

First off, Shout out @fade.dept u/OmarFromEarth for getting these laces to me straight from Canada to TX duty free! This is huge for me as I could never find paracord laces stateside. I’m sure we all know & love Pisgah laces but I can confidently say that these fade.dept laces are right up there with them at the top of the boot chain! 

Seriously high quality, hard-wearing laces. I have been putting off this post about 2 weeks longer than necessary just because I really enjoy seeing what they can handle at work. Also getting pics of my Significant Other (SO) has been challenging when working opposite schedules 😅. Anyway: Wet/humid conditions ✅ extreme hot/cold conditions ✅ Chemical exposure (both acidic & alkaline) ✅ Dusty/gritty/abrasive conditions ✅ Safe to say they can handle just about anything other than a bandsaw haha!

**THE JUICE**

So… Specifics! All 3 sets of laces went straight to my SO and I pairs of Thursday boots. The green/gold paracord w/ brass aglets set went to her pair of Captains in coffee brown. The Indigo & gunmetal gray aglets pair went to my Black Label Challengers in Horween Whiskey Predator. Aaannndd, the Tan leather (chrome-tanned [notice the blue core]) laces went to my Black Label Maryam Teacore Horsebutt Challengers. 

I use my black boots with the leather laces for work (large scale craft beer brewer), usually worn with my SDA SP-108 for the Thunderdome & Indigo Invitational respectively. So they see the most abuse by a long shot. Before I even laced this pair I hit the laces with some boot wax from Drew’s Boots to darken them some. 100% the right move for a variety of reasons. 1. Darkened the laces a shade to better match. 2. Better water resistance. 3. Now that the laces are extra supple the knot locks in on itself when tied (never had a loose knot). 4. (And this is the #1 reason) oh my god they crock indigo from my jeans so damn quick!!! I LOOOOOVVVEEEE INDIGO PATINA 😍👖💙

**HERS**

My SO is a Registered Behavioral Therapist (RBT) so she spends her days keeping up with her kids with autism. LOTS of running around and rambunctiousness! I’m sure all of the parents in this community have an idea lol. So her pair of laces see the most physical abuse in terms of short, explosive movements. Gotta get up & GO at a moments notice! And so far no tearing, fraying, loose knots, or coming untied. Yes you still have to double knot your paracord laces, but that should be a given. So, aside from that these things are beasts! 💪🏼 oh and she usually wears them with her Red Tornado 55501!

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Honestly I’m too hyped on LACES of all things! But seriously, I feel like my boots have been given a new life. A breath of fresh air, truly. I’m all excited to wear my year old boots all over again like I just got them yesterday ☺️. The black pair is on their 2nd Thunderdome and back with a vengeance so I’m all giddy 😆 The fun is always in the details and these seemingly simple laces have plenty!!! 🔥🔥🔥

It’s about finding the right balance between the big statement pieces that define a space and the smaller accents that make it feel like your own. With the right mix of furniture, colors, textures, and thoughtful placement, you can create rooms that feel both stylish and livable.

**Step 1: Start with the Big Pieces (“Anchor Pieces”)**

Your larger furniture—sofas, beds, and dining tables—anchor the room and determine how it functions. These should be your first investments since they set the tone for the space. Once they’re in place, layer in smaller items like lamps, side tables, rugs, and wall art to bring personality and warmth.

**Step 2: Choose a Flexible Color Base**

A neutral foundation makes it easier to evolve your style over time without major expense. Keep your walls and larger furniture pieces in versatile shades, then add color through accessories you can easily swap. Some timeless base colors include:

* **Beige**: Warm and cozy, ranging from pale sand to rich caramel. Perfect for creating a welcoming vibe.  
* **Gray**: Modern and versatile, pairing effortlessly with bold hues or other neutrals. Works well for both sleek and traditional settings.  
* **White**: Clean, bright, and airy—ideal for minimalists or as a backdrop for colorful accents.  
* **Taupe**: An earthy mix of brown and gray that feels sophisticated yet approachable.  

**Step 3: Layer in Textures**

Texture adds depth and interest. Picture a room with a smooth leather sofa, a rustic wooden coffee table, and a soft wool rug. Mixing hard and soft surfaces creates contrast while keeping the space balanced. Don’t be afraid to experiment—velvet cushions, rattan chairs, or ceramic decor can all add richness to your design.

**Step 4: Use Patterns with Intention**

Patterns bring energy to a space, but too many can feel overwhelming. Keep your larger items (like sofas or beds) in solids and introduce patterns through rugs, pillows, or curtains. 

**Step 5: Place Items with Purpose**

Where you put things matters just as much as what you choose. Position a reading lamp where it’s actually useful, use rugs to define conversation areas, and hang artwork at eye level for maximum impact. Each item should enhance both the look and functionality of the room.

**Bringing It All Together**

Styling a home isn’t just about picking furniture or decor—it’s about how all the elements work together. By starting with solid foundations, layering in textures and colors, and being thoughtful with placement, you’ll create a space that feels polished but still personal. The end result? A home that reflects your style and supports the way you live, day in and day out.",1,1760115719.0,HomeLabFurniture,0,1.0,False
1o36lgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychicLasVegas/comments/1o36lgu/24hour_intermittent_fasting_omad_explained/,🌙 24-Hour Intermittent Fasting (OMAD) Explained,"# 🌙 24-Hour Intermittent Fasting (OMAD) Explained

**How it works:**

* You finish eating at **9 PM**.
* You **don’t eat anything until 9 PM the next day**.
* When your fast ends, you eat **one full, balanced meal**.
* You can still drink **water, black coffee, or herbal teas** during the fast.

# 🕒 What Happens in Your Body During a 24-Hour Fast

* **0–12 Hours** → Your body digests your last meal, insulin drops, fat burning begins.
* **12–20 Hours** → Fat becomes your main fuel source, hunger hormones stabilize, focus increases.
* **20–24 Hours** → Autophagy (cell cleanup) peaks, inflammation lowers, growth hormone rises, fat burning intensifies.

# 🌟 Benefits of 24-Hour Fasting

1. **Deep Fat Burning** – longer fasting window burns stored fat efficiently.
2. **Autophagy** – cellular “spring cleaning,” removing damaged cells & toxins.
3. **Insulin Reset** – better blood sugar control, improved sensitivity.
4. **Mental Clarity** – many report sharper focus and calm energy.
5. **Simplified Eating** – one big meal = less meal prep & decision fatigue.

# 🌿 Tips to Make It Easier

* **Stay Hydrated** → Water, sparkling water, black coffee, and herbal teas.
* **Add Electrolytes** → A pinch of pink salt or electrolyte drops in water.
* **Cinnamon Tea or Green Tea** → Helps curb hunger naturally.
* **Stay Busy** → Distraction is your best friend when hunger hits.
* **Break Gently** → Start with something easy to digest (soup, broth, salad) → then enjoy your main meal.

# ⚠️ Things to Watch Out For

* **Don’t Overeat Junk** → One meal a day isn’t a free pass for fast food overload. Go nutrient-dense (protein, healthy fats, veggies).
* **May Cause Fatigue for Beginners** → Start with shorter fasts (16:8) before jumping to 24 hours.
* **Not for Everyone** → Avoid if pregnant, nursing, underweight, or with certain medical conditions.",1,1760115714.0,PsychicLasVegas,0,1.0,False

\-Harvard 34.5 (-120) | 0.5 Units

**Why This Pick?** 

The Crimson are 3-0 ATS so far this season, friends – and in this matchup, they are far and away the more formidable squad. Cornell has lost their last 3 straight games by double digits, while Harvard has won their last 3 straight by at least 34 points. I expect the Crimson offense to have little issue here (especially at home). My money’s on Harvard to cover.

On another note, **we bagged an epic Player Prop sweep (4/4) last night**! A huge congrats to everyone that tailed, and for those curious, here's what we had:

\-Dallas Goedart Over 34.5 Receiving Yards (-110) ✅

\-Cam Skattebo Over 49.5 Rushing Yards (-110) ✅

\-Jaxson Dart Over 37.5 Rushing Yards (-110) ✅

\-Dallas Goedart Anytime TD (+230) ✅

\----

**I still can't believe the NY Giants beat the PHI Eagles** – Jaxson Dart might be the real deal guys... The Giants *are so back*. 😳

On the NHL front, **shoutout to the Carolina Hurricanes for bagging the 3-way ML (-105) ✅** last night for us 🔥😍 Between that cash and the Player Prop sweep, we came out of yesterday profitable overall. 💰

Alright friends, that's all I've got for the day. Cheers, and best of luck with today's Pick of the Day!

**I have tried all of the common troubleshooting techiniques found on the internet:**

1. SFC Scannnow

2. DISM commands

3. CHKDSK

4. Memory Integrity tests

5. GPU driver update and DDU.

6. Updating Chipset Drivers

7. Updating a few drivers which I saw as warnings on the event log from my laptop OEM (Intel RST, Intel Dynamic platform and Thermal manager)

8. Reseating my M.2 Boot drive.

9. Checked drive health with Crystal Disk Info, They are all good.

10. Reinstalled windows

11. I have also had all of the thermal paste redone by a reputable PC repair store near me recently to rule out that issue.



I have seen people mention this can happen if there are power supply issues, but being a laptop, I assume that the battery should take over if my adapter is failing.



I have come to terms that my aging machine may be on it's final legs. I was going to replace my boot ssd as a final attempt, as I noticed that some warnings on the event log seem to indicate that it it failing, and these seem to occuer during some crashes (The IO operation at logical block address x for Disk 2 (PDO name: \\Device\\00000051) was retried), but I've put this post up just in case you man know something which I don't yet know.

  
Any help would be greatly appreicated.

1o36f8u,https://i.redd.it/cedbkbj4ebuf1.png,The secret hacks that got me into Harvard,"Last year, I got the email I’d been dreaming about for years: “Welcome to Harvard, Class of 2028.” a year before that I was failing,I couldn’t focus for more than 20 minutes, my GPA was tanking, I was 0 productive. So I treated my focus like a system, rewired my habits, and built routines that forced consistency, sooo here are the 10 (or 11 idk) things that actually changed everything for me:

**1. Time-block like you actually have a job**  
Instead of saying “I’ll study later”, I plan study blocks on Google Calendar and treat them like real meetings. This short video helped me a ton:  
[https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb](https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb)

**2. The “5-minute activation” trick**  
When I don’t feel like studying, I promise myself *5* minutes only. That small start almost  
There’s some science behind it, it’s called the “activation energy” principle (worth Googling if you’re curious).

**3. Study with others**  
I started using [this site](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=14) it’s a 24/7 virtual coworking space where you join live focus rooms with other students. No talking, just accountability. Seeing 200+ people studying in real time kills procrastination, like you are in library  
  
**4.  Lower the pressure, raise the consistency**  
Stop chasing the “perfect study day.” Two consistent hours a day beats ten chaotic ones.  
I stopped aiming for motivation and started building systems. 

**5. “Different chair, different task”**  
Desk = notes.  
Bed = reading.  
Couch = review.  
Your body learns context cues, it’s like conditioning focus into spaces

**6. Block distractions like your life depends on it**  
Apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/?irpid=56411&subId1=1-g-Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=56411&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=808733665&gbraid=0AAAAADLv4uSBNq1p5LzMwxGpG1MCeruAH&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB) are lifesavers, but honestly, the simplest hack is to put your phone in another room. If you want to understand why your brain keeps reaching for it, this video blew my mind: [Why you can’t focus – Andrew Huberman explains dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY)

**7. Romanticize the process**  
Make your study setup feel good, clean desk, warm lighting, lo-fi beats, your favorite drink. It may seem silly, but the brain needs a lot of order.

**8. Reward yourself like you’re training a dog (because you kind of are)**  
I set small rewards: finish a chapter: take a coffee. finish an assignment: 15 min scroll.  
This alspo sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.  
  
**9.Get sunlight before screens**  
10 minutes outside before opening a laptop = focus upgrade.  
Resets your circadian rhythm and improves dopamine regulation.  
[Huberman – Why Morning Sunlight is Crucial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PzZy3QX0qI)

**10. Keep a “done list” instead of a “to-do list”**  
Writing what I completed instead of what I still need to do gives a crazy dopamine boost.  
I track mine in Notion

**11. Change locations once a day**  
Studying in the same spot drains you. I rotate between my desk, a café, or my bed (controversial, I know). If you can’t leave home, just change the lighting or background. it tricks your brain into a “fresh start.”

**12. Mix subjects and methods**  
Alternate between reading, note-taking, and active recall. Active recall literally reprograms your memory  
[Ali Abdaal’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE) explains it way better than I can.  
Hope these can help some of you :)",122,1760115350.0,GetStudying,10,0.86,False

1o36c61,https://youtube.com/watch?v=FvEL2ny0SSs&si=rwGVRtls8UJsXsgV,It Had Its Moments,"The clock is slow, the sun reluctant
Shadows drag their feet across the floor
All my life I’ve been waiting
For someone, for something, for the end of something
Today I realize
I’ve been waiting for him to die

Across the border, on the news, in my head
The orange face grins, impossible to ignore
A carnival barker, a chaos salesman
Bankrupting dignity, bankrupting hope
I’m Canadian, but the shadow falls north
Like acid rain, like bad TV
No explanations left, just exhaustion
I confess: I’m waiting for him to die

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die

But Death—
He’s checking his watch, polishing his sickle
He’s got a special spot picked out,
Front row, popcorn ready
He’s waiting for this one too
History’s hands wringing
There’s a punchline waiting,
And Death wants to deliver it

My beloved, my heartbreak, my boy
Twenty-four years young, but a century old in the eyes
Street-smart, heart-dumb, milking the brittle system
Addiction his only loyalty,
A scavenger of goodwill, a ghost in daylight
No one’s been able to reach him—not teachers, not cops, not me
I love him, but I can’t save him
In this city, some of us are just waiting for him to die

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die

And Death—
He paces the alleyways, counts the empty bottles
He’s a patient predator,
Sniffing out the lost boys
He’s not cruel—just hungry
He hums lullabies for the ones who slip through cracks
He’s waiting too,
And he’s never in a hurry

He used to fill rooms, loud as thunder
Now he’s a whisper in a hospital bed
Two years since the stroke, twenty since I let him go
Once a tyrant, now a feather
My brother and I, reading stories to a fading ghost
He weighs less than memory,
But sometimes—he smiles
We visit, and, quietly, we are waiting for him to die

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die

Death sits at the bedside
He wears slippers, sips weak coffee
He’s gentle with this one,
Unraveling him thread by thread
He waits for the last story,
The final breadcrumb of recognition
He’s not in a rush—
He enjoys a long goodbye

Fifty-two years of being a question mark
A thousand résumés, a thousand rejections
Middle-aged, middle-of-nowhere,
Supported by women with more patience than I deserve
Three grown kids, no one calling
A partner who shares silence more than conversation
Some days, I look in the mirror and joke
That I, too, am waiting for him to die

Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die
Waiting for him to die

Death grins in the fogged-up glass
He likes a man who knows the punchline
He’s been waiting since the first sigh,
Collecting all the almosts and maybes
He’s not offended by the waiting—
He waits for everyone, in the end
He wonders what kind of note you’ll leave
He’s curious, too

The sun sets, the clock ticks
And all of us—waiting
Death and the living,
Each keeping score in our own way
It had its moments
It was interesting
We wait for him to die
And Death waits for us, smiling",1,1760115159.0,u_jatygu,0,1.0,False

I’ve cruised Royal Caribbean and Norwegian, and I’m also considering a Norwegian cruise for this time period (RC is overpriced for solo cruisers). I’m super impressed by the Seascape, Grandiosa, & World America from MSC.

Work has been crazy for me this year and I just want to treat myself to an escape with some pampering. But in this economy, I’m trying to make the most of my budget.

I’m trying to make sense of the different MSC Aurea and drink package options given what I’m looking for and my budget. I won’t be drinking more than 3 drinks a day (don’t need specialty coffee), I would like WiFi for one device, and I want a quiet outdoor space to relax. Aurea seems like a good call for the pampering & quiet areas, but it seems to be available only for balcony and higher. If I have a balcony I don’t really need access to the exclusive Aurea outdoor areas. So I’m not sure that $540+ extra for Aurea would be worth it. But I like that there’s some treats and drinks (champagne & minibar) included.

I’m also seeing that WiFi & drink packages would run me $700+ on my cruise fare. Given I won’t drink more than 3 drinks a day and I just need one device for WiFi, this seems like a waste of money for me to do the package.

But this is all to say: I don’t know MSC at all! There are probably other things at play that I’m not aware of. I don’t know how much a spa area pass would cost me, how much a WiFi only package would cost me, and so on. 

Could some of you experts help me to think through this? Thanks!",5,1760114916.0,MSCCruises,13,0.86,False

1o365j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1o365j9/the_house_of_gone/,The House Of Gone,"That old house at the end of wedgehall street. It used to be a small den for the local politicians to collude on regional affairs including votes.  
No one lives there now, the owners keep the lights on because there are still offers, through the front door- you can see a tall narrow coffee table infront of the guard rail on the stairs. There´s a thing a slender glass vase sitting on it, with a long dried brown rose poking out.

My mother approaches and investigates the house  
It is dusk she looks around there is nowhere else  
Like a moth to the light her awareness melts  
In she walks as if it were where she dwelt

Blue cold light of dusk and encantations from the ghosts of monks. Begging the light to extend time just another minute. And the homely comfortable looking inside of the house appeared even more inviting.  
Once my mother had disappeared, my brother came strolling up to the porch. Again without reservation opened the glass frame front door that looked in toward the rusty rose in that vase.  
  
He achieved much he had beliefs they were contributed as sculptures  
In the shadow of midday which was the only time he postured  
In midday light no mistakes or out of shape areas were exposed  
He always saw the slender vase never the dead brown rose

So he too went in and disappeared before he reached the stairs. The vase subtle sparkle, or weak reflection blinked, laughing at having brought in two outside visitors, before nightfall.  
At this point the day was almost dark and the inside of the house was emiting the yellow relaxing light with almost a tinge of orange. You could look inside and feel comfort in your stomach. A plenitude of homely emotions.

The hour has struck darkness is falling about my person  
I must enter this dead end house before it all worsens  
I enter the door blinded by yellow orange intensified notes   
instead of a glow it´s chipped paint through a hundred coats

It´s an extinguishing of my true identity. The chipped paint is the understanding of myself. It is being chipped off the wall´s of the entity I thought myself to be. Whispers come softly at first, then in dreadful deafening screams... Saying... Life is hoax, Life is a hoax. The image of the dead rose now follows my vision as I walk through the house, not a human just a ghost, one that could invade any living creature. But the rose wasn´t alive. it was crispy and rusted. preserved like a relic, a reminder of the temporary nature of things.

The voice kicked in and I froze, lost the strength to climb the stairs   
Life is a cosmic prank, a hoax, duped by your hopes and fears  
You believed it most when you were pretending not to care  
Losing the impression of yourself just too much to bear

I needed some help taking orders and making coffee, so I reached out to a long-time friend who works in the restaurant industry. The event itself was kind of chaotic, but overall it went really well. My friend refused any payment, saying it was his contribution to the party and that he was happy to help. So far, so good.

To thank him, I wanted to find a meaningful and original way to show my appreciation. I recently started working for a large company that produces meat, and employees can get special discounts on frozen products that aren’t usually available in stores. I thought it would be a nice idea to order some and make a special gift box for my friend.

I received the meat yesterday and spent the whole evening driving around to drop off orders for my parents, my sister, and finally my friend. The problem, when I opened the boxes, I realized all the meat was expired, by anywhere from 3 to 6 months. My mom told me not to worry since it was all frozen, and frozen meat can last up to a year safely. I didn’t overthink it and decided to bring it anyway.

When I stopped by my friend’s appartment, he wasn’t there, so I handed the box to his girlfriend and explained that some items were past their “best before” date but that it was frozen and totally fine. The next day, we received a long message from his girlfriend.

Here’s a part of it: “It’s hard to know how to bring this up, but let’s just be honest: we were told the meat was past its date when we got it, and after checking what to thaw first, we saw it really was — by months! Some are even six months expired. I know the intention was good, but honestly, this feels kind of tacky, especially as a thank-you for helping at your birthday brunch. Offering expired meat is definitely... original, but probably not the most appreciated gift. We’ll pass next time.”

Later, my friend called me and we talked things out. They threw away the meat. I apologized, but the whole situation is still very awkward. AITA?

Edit: The meat came from a large producer with over 10k employees and high safety standards. I didn’t know in advance that it would be expired, but when I saw the date, I had no reason to believe it wasn’t food safe because the company is reputable and all my colleagues consume it without issue. I assume it was frozen well before the date under proper sanitary conditions. There’s no way it could be dangerous since all my colleagues would have warned me otherwise.

**TL;DR:**  
I gave my close friend a box of frozen meat as a thank-you gift for helping at my birthday brunch. I realized last minute that the meat was expired by a few months but brought it anyway, thinking it was still fine because it was frozen. His girlfriend was upset, and my friend thought it was weird.

Understanding Dental Health Basics

What Constitutes Good Dental Health?

Good dental health encompasses more than just having cavity-free teeth. It involves a holistic approach that includes:

• Proper oral hygiene practices
• Regular dental check-ups
• Balanced nutrition
• Understanding potential oral health risks

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 26% of adults in the United States have untreated dental cavities, highlighting the critical importance of comprehensive dental care.

Essential Daily Oral Hygiene Practices

Brushing Techniques for Maximum Effectiveness

**Proper brushing is the foundation of good dental health**. Follow these expert-recommended techniques:

1. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
2. Brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
3. Use gentle, circular motions
4. Brush for at least two minutes
5. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months

Flossing: The Often-Overlooked Hero of Dental Hygiene

Many people underestimate the importance of flossing. Daily flossing removes plaque and food particles from areas your toothbrush can't reach, preventing potential gum disease and tooth decay.

1o35w6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o35w6e/sp_half_a_heart/,[SP] Half A Heart,"We were born two, but we only ever lived one life.

We learned young how to pass the body back and forth — like trading a coat in a doorway. One of us wears it for the day, the other watches from behind the glass, a warm dark pane where breath fogs but never marks. Sometimes we watch, sometimes we don't — the silence can be easier than seeing. At night, we hand over: memories, notes, the ache in the left ankle, the fact that the door sticks if you don't lift and pull. She can see what I see, but not what it feels like from the inside — not the pulse behind the ribs or the thought that dies in the throat. Those go in the ledger. 

During the day, the one in the body writes. The one behind the glass can only speak like a voice in the head, but the living twin cannot answer except through ink. The ledger is how we talk when the world is watching.

The body sleeps every night, as any body must. Dreams are the only place we are both absent, both gone. In sleep, we meet in the mind-space. Usually the glass is opened, the body is passed between us, and we go over the ledger face-to-face. In those hours, we can finally speak aloud. In the morning, one of us wakes in the body and the other becomes weather in the mind — present, invisible.

To everyone else, there has only ever been one of us.

College made the system [elegant.In](http://elegant.In) class, what one of us studies, the other receives like a secondhand book — notes scrawled in the margins but never the full lecture. That's why we write: not just the facts, but the meanings we carried, the half-formed thoughts that can't be seen through the glass. Knowledge passed between us feels like a photograph touched by too many hands — blurred at the edges, but still ours.

 We live off campus in a basement apartment with two narrow windows that only show hedges. We take turns: Monday/Wednesday/ alternating Fridays for me, Tuesday/Thursday/ alternating Fridays for my sister. We split the work of two jobs — café and campus library — so the rent is easy, and everyone just thinks I have tireless energy. Sometimes a café regular spots me shelving books, surprised to see me again. They laugh and say I must live here. I smile and let them believe it. Professors think I'm consistent. Our landlord thinks I'm punctual. No one wonders how ""I"" am always available.

We share a bank account, a phone, a closet, a face.

We are efficient. We are careful.

It was careful, at least, until Elias showed up. 

 He took the open seat beside me in Philosophy of Mind — an irony so sharp I nearly laughed. He had a smile that seemed reluctant, like it had to be coaxed out of him, and a habit of underlining the second half of his sentences in his notes. He wore headphones around his neck like a talisman.

When he asked if I had the syllabus, the way he listened to my answer made me feel like I was saying something important even when I wasn't. By the end of class, we were laughing for real about nothing at all.

It was quick, yes, but gravity doesn't measure itself in minutes. I fell.

We left together. At the steps outside the lecture hall, he asked if I wanted coffee. I said I was working next afternoon. He grinned.

""Then I'll come to you.""

That's all it took. I wrote it down in the ledger:

**Elias = coffee tomorrow @ 2. He's kind. He listens. Please-**

I didn't finish the sentence. I didn't need to. She would understand.

I felt her flinch.

 The next day was hers. At 1:55 pm, he arrived at the café, hair damp from drizzle, smile shy, shoulder hunched like he wasn't sure he was allowed to hope.  I watched through the glass as she set the coffee down between them, her silence cutting sharper than words.

""I can't today,"" she said, voice flat. ""Another time.""

His face shuttered. ""Sure of course.""

I pressed my palms against the glass until my fingers felt like they'd bleed. *Please*, I whispered. *Just an hour*

She didn't answer.

That night, in the ledger, she wrote it plain:

**He came. I sent him away. You are reckless. You aren't thinking beyond your want. I won't let you pull us apart.**

I read it like a ghost rereading its own obituary. Her words had no heat, no doubt, only finality. That left me colder than the glass ever had.

The next day, his warmth had a bruise on it. He still sat beside me but left a cautious space between us. I stitched it closed with jokes and long looks. He softened. By the end of class, he asked if I ever went to the Friday film series.

""Every other Friday,"" I said, carefully.

""I'll be there this week,"" he said.

In the ledger I wrote:

**Film this Friday. I want to go. We bet 10 on it being a black and white we pretend is good. Please.**

Her reply was neat,decisive: 

*""No. You are not thinking.""*

That night, when the body slept, I waited in the mind-space for the glass to open. Normally, she would step through and we would trade places, ledger in hand, our voices free at last. But this time she kept it shut. We floated on opposite sides of the dark pane, both speaking, both heard — but the glass warped every word, turning them thin and distorted. It was like trying to argue through water, close enough to see her lips move, too far to reach.

""Just give me a chance,"" I begged.

""You're not thinking past your want,"" she said, her voice rippling strangely through the barrier.

""What is there to think about? He makes me feel... present. Like I'm not a shadow waiting for my turn.""

Her voice came steady, quiet, almost kind. ""Present for you is abandonment for me.""

""You know that's not true.""

""Do I?"" She leaned against the pane, her outline wavering in the dark. ""If you fall in love, where do I live? Do you think I'll just fade while you build a life in our name? Do you think I'll watch you touch someone, kiss someone, while I rot in the dark?""

The words cut because I hadn't thought that far. I only knew I was drowning.

""Please,"" I whispered. ""Don't take this from me.""

She said nothing. And in the morning, she didn't open the door. The link went dark.

For the first time, I half-existed.

I drifted in silence, watching her live our life without me. Elias passed her in the hall, his smile faltered when she gave him nothing. He stopped trying.

At first, I whispered through the glass:

*""Please. Just let me borrow an hour. Just let me see him.""*

Then I bargained: 

*""I'll give up weekends. I'll take the morning shifts forever. I'll stop asking for anything else.""*

Silence.

When she didn't answer, I prayed. Not to God, but to him. He would understand, I told myself. *If he knew, he would stay. He would call me real, not broken. He would save me.*

The prayers turned into chants. 

*He will understand. He will love me. He will never leave.*

Over and over until the words stopped sounding like words and became the only air I knew how to breathe.

Belief was no longer thought. Belief was survival. Belief was my religion.

And religion demands sacrifice.

So I stopped knocking on the glass and started clawing at it. Not a coat to be passed, not a window to be opened, but a mirror to be broken. My nails scraped until I felt myself splintering with it. Each crack hurt, but hurt meant I was closer. Hurt meant the world could bleed for me as I had for it.

One day, the mirror shattered. It was early afternoon. A hoisted sky. The courtyard busy with backpacks and midterms. Elias was there at the far end, adjusting his backpack strap. My sister froze as I stepped through the broken glass and seized her hands, her voice, *her breath.*

*Finally.*

I can feel. I stepped into the sun like it was a stage light, the shattered pieces of me holding their breath. He hadn’t seen me yet — but I saw him. And I knew this time, I wouldn’t wait.

I rushed across the courtyard before she could stop me, heart hammering, the world tilting with every step. I reached him, breathless, and seized the moment like it was the only thing keeping me alive.

""It's me,"" I gasped. ""It's always been me. The days you liked me — that was me. I need you to listen. I'm not who you think I am. I'm only half.""

He blinked. ""Half of what?""

""Half of us. My sister and me. We share this body. We switch. Every other day. The cold days were hers, the warm were me. I swear to you, I swear on everything — I'm real.""

For one beat, the world made a place for a miracle. His eyes lingered on me, not with disbelief but with a searching I wanted to call recognition. I thought — if I held my breath, if I kept still, the truth might root itself in him and grow. I thought he might smile, might say my name like it belonged to me alone. For one beat, I believed the story I'd told him could be enough.

Then his face changed.

Confusion hardened into something worse. ""You've got to be kidding me,"" he said, but his voice cracked at the edges, sharp and trembling. ""All this time — what the hell was I to you? Some sort of science experiment? A joke?""

""No — no, never. I meant every— ""

""Don't."" He snapped the word, too loud, brittle as glass. A couple of students turned their heads. He laughed once, short and shaky, like it hurt coming out. ""Do you hear yourself? Do you have any idea how messed up this sounds? One day you act like you want me, the next you treat me like a stranger, and now you're telling me there's  two of you?"" 

He laughed again, brittle and angry. ""You're insane. You've been leading me on this whole time.""

""I wasn't leading you on,"" I begged. ""It was me. All the good parts — it was me. Please Elias, you have to believe me—""

He stepped back, shaking his head like he was trying to fling something off. ""You're sick. I don't know if you need a doctor or a padded room, but I want nothing to do with it. With you.""

""No — don't say that, dont—""

""Stay. Away. From me."" The words wavered but landed hard, like a door slammed shut. He looked at me — not like someone he'd almost cared for, but like something dangerous he had just barely escaped.

Then he turned and he left.

The world didn't stop to notice that I had shattered with the mirror. My sister slammed the door so hard it felt like it killed me.

Now I float in darkness. Elias is gone. My sister will not speak. The body goes on without me: studying, working, sleeping. Efficient, careful. And I can see it all through the glass — every borrowed breath, every step that should have been mine — but I cannot touch a single moment.

Sometimes I think the tragedy isn't that he didn't believe me. It's that I believed so hard I mistook hunger for proof.

And maybe the tragedy is older. We taught ourselves to be singular so no one would see the cracks. But I was never whole. I was always two mouths gnawing at one body — one for safety, one for love. Both starving. Both true. Both impossible together.

And sometimes—

I replay his face. The way his gaze lingered before it curdled. The way his voice trembled when he called me insane. The way his eyes slid away from me, as though I had already become a stranger.

I tell myself it was disgust. Hatred. Rejection.

But disgust does not shake the hands. Hatred does not make the voice break. Rejection does not look away like that.

Fear does.

And fear is not born from nothing. Fear means danger. Fear means recognition. Some part of him saw me. Some part of him believed.

That thought gnawed at me until hunger became vow.

If he saw me once, he can see me again. If he believed for a breath, he can believe forever.

The words circle, they beat inside me, a rhythm, a second pulse that belongs only to me:

**If once, then again. If again, then always.**

And if I clawed through the mirror once, I can do it again. Next time I won't stop. Next time I'll hold the body long enough to make him see — to make him understand, to make him stay.

Belief is still my religion. Only now the prayer has sharpened into something hungrier, a vow tangled deep into marrow:

**He will love me. He will.**

And when the chanting fades, silence swells. It coils through the dark, whispering what I do not want to hear: *there is no room for two hungers in one body. That to be whole, something must give.*

I do not answer it. I only listen.

And the longer I listen, the more it sounds like truth—

until the whisper curls into the old question, the one that gnaws and never loosens:

I have the Flair Pro 2, paired with a Commandante C40 MK3, also own the Flair Go (but dont have a lot of experience with it right now) and beside espresso i also like a good cup of Filter coffee (with V60, Chemex, Aeropress)
Well, many years it was totally fine with the Commandante, but i decided to buy an electric grinder. So the Commandante and Flair Go can take Position in the Camper.
I checked some Youtube Videos and Forums and the DF64 Gen 2 (~425€ in my area) is the grinder i want to buy. 
Can some of you guys give me a long time experience with this grinder?

I chose it because of the flat burrs, the range from Chemex to Mokka and also i really like the Design (compared to some other grinders)

I picked a spot between two large trees and dug a grave. I then decorated the grave with some branches and flowers. 

It was cathartic to say the least. It feels like I let go and quite literally buried a part of me through this act. Tears were running down my cheeks nonstop. My crying came to a full stop after I finished the adornment…how strange.

Step-Brother | Matsuda Yuki | 2 | Deceased | He was a smiley and happy baby. Shion loved him dearly even when he woke Shion up in the middle of the night crying for a bottle. He was happy to do it to see the sweet little smiles his brother would give him.

##Abilities

###Powers

Name | Type | Status | Description
---|---|---|---
Parley | Major | Locked | The ability to disengage combatants. Users are known to make such a powerful display of force that nearby combatants are either temporarily distracted or compelled to stop fighting. This ability requires a great deal of energy and thus can only be activated once a day (once a post).
Shame Inducement | Minor | **Unlocked** | The ability to induce feelings of shame in an individual. Should the effect take hold, the target may immediately feel self-conscious and look down on themself. Demigod psychologists have conducted studies to determine the particular difference between this power and the guilt induced by children of Dike.
Peaceful Aura | Minor | **Unlocked** | The ability to produce an aura that imposes a sense of serenity on those within it. This zone usually has a radius of 15 feet (4.6 meters), but it can extend up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) with concentration or increased effort. Those affected may not feel induced effects as prominently.
Surprise Buff | Minor | Locked | A trait where one's alertness and agility are elevated when the demigod is surprised or the target of a sneak attack. This buff comes into effect regardless of whether or not such an attack is successful. The buffed individual displays increased speed and more acute senses, leaving them less susceptible to additional sneak attacks. This buff does not stack with other buffs and lasts at most 3 RP turns (18 minutes). In 5-turn combat, this buff lasts only 2 turns.
Candid Aura | Domain | **Unlocked** | The ability to produce an aura that compels those within it to tell the truth. This zone usually has a radius of 15 feet (4.6 meters), but it can be extended up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) with concentration or increased effort.

Absorption | Domain | Locked | A trait where one can absorb energy-based attacks. Beginners best utilize this power to accelerate their healing rate (to that of ambrosia and nectar) or to have a boost of energy and stamina. At an intermediate level, users can fire back the energy, albeit with less potency. With electricity specifically, the user can absorb the level of energy that passes through live wires.

### Innate Powers:

**Description:** 
Shion is short for his age, coming in at five foot one. He’s lithe and scrawny but does have some muscles from all the work that he’s had to do since he was eleven. He has kind eyes that seem inviting and a smile, though rare, that is equally as inviting with his dimples giving him a boyish charm. He has an angular face that comes to a point at his chin. His hair is a tousled mop of black that sits un-styled on his head. He has twigs for arms and legs but there is some muscle definition there. As for style, he has none, he buys whatever is cheapest and doesn’t really care what he looks like.

As such, Shion struggles to express vulnerability, having grown accustomed to bottling up his emotions to maintain a strong front.

Beneath his serious facade lies a man of profound depth and compassion, who silently carries the weight of his past while striving toward a brighter future.

#Backstory
Aiko was young when she met a bright and kind woman. She had never been so swept off her feet by someone before. It was a sweet and lasting love that Aiko always remembered fondly, even after she left, even after she left Aiko with a squawling baby to take care of. Aiko always saw a piece of that lovely woman in Shion even to her last breath. 

Shion was a unique child. He was very polite and formal with people. He asked a ton of questions because he couldn’t be satisfied until he knew how something worked or why something was the way it was. However, his mother noticed early on he had a deep flaw in not understanding humor. People would tell him something in jest and he would fully believe what the person said because he couldn’t understand someone lying to him intentionally as a way to be funny. It always led to interesting situations where Shion would come home and tell his mom something bizarre a friend had told him at school and his mother gently walking him through how it was untrue and giving him the actual truth.

When Shion was two Aiko met a man who she fell in love with quickly. Hiroshi was suave when he first met Aiko, but Shion never fully warmed to him. But love does blind people and some cracks began to form at the foundations of their happy little life. However, they didn’t appear until after Nao and Takeshi were born. Shion, of course, was ecstatic to be an older brother. He was three when Nao was born and five when Takeshi was born. But slowly things began to change in their home. The suave man that Hiroshi had been at first had started to become sterner and colder as the days went by. A terse word given to Shion. An angry look that only Shion saw. But eventually the others in the house started to see it. 

Once Aiko had become pregnant with Hana, Hiroshi found more joy in the bottom of a sake bottle than at home. He was rarely there which put a strain on Aiko more and more. Luckily Shion, who was seven at the time, stepped up and helped his mother as best as he could. He would clean the house, make his siblings their lunches for the day. Take his siblings to daycare and school when his mom went to work. He also did odd jobs around the town to earn some extra money to help his family out. Throughout all of this Hiroshi got worse and more violent towards everyone in the house when he was around. However, Shion would often take the brunt of it in the name of defending his siblings and mother. This was also around the time Shion learned he was a demigod. He more pieced it together than was told because of all the strange unexplainable events that kept popping up in his life.

Then after years of this it was like a switch got flipped in Hiroshi’s mind and he became more like the man Aiko fell in love with. He was around and caring and made her feel like the center of the world. Well, until she became pregnant again. Just as suddenly as Hiroshi had become the caring man again he went back to being cold and angry. Shion had to step up yet again. At the age of nine he was able to do more to help around the house and it was good that he was too because shortly after Aiko gave birth to Renji she fell ill. Since the family was so poor they could not afford the proper care for Aiko and that was always something that had haunted Shion. 

Shion became the main caretaker for his family when he turned ten and essentially dropped out of school at that age. He needed to do odd jobs around the neighborhood to feed his family. Of course the community had pity on the Matsuda family and paid him far more than what they would normally pay a ten year old to haphazardly mow their lawns or paint their house. But, Shion was never aware of that fact. He just thought he had been lucky and made the best of a bad situation. Of course whenever his step-father showed up he would take any of the cash Shion had lying around so he learned how to hide it from Hiroshi.

Then like before Hiroshi showed up and acted like the perfect gentleman again. He took care of the ailing Aiko and helped around the house. Shion however, was not convinced of the change and kept squirreling away money just in case the nice man went away again. As Aiko’s health improved something also changed. She became pregnant again. Like before Hiroshi had instantly turned cold and angry, but unlike before he snapped and packed up and left the Matsuda house once and for all. Of course everyone was happy he was gone, but Shion felt bad for his siblings that they would have to grow up without two parents the same way he had been.

At eleven years old he was now the head of his house. His mother’s health went from bad to worse after giving birth to Yuki. On a good day she could walk from her bedroom to the living room. So, Shion took the helm and started to raise his siblings. He would continue to work those odd jobs and buy food for his family. Of course there were some nights he went without, but he was okay with that if it meant his family got full bellies. This was the way their lives went for the next two years, the simple hard, but happy life Shion had created was perfect to him until tragedy struck.

It was a Saturday. The cool winds of autumn had finally settled over Yokohama. The early morning dew sticking to the plants as Shion finished preparing the day’s food for his family. He wiped the sweat that had pooled at the brim of his brow and looked at all the neatly packed bento boxes he had prepared, each labeled with his sibling’s names with careful heating instructions on the box as well. Before leaving for work Shion slipped into his mother’s room with a bowl of cool water and a rag. He gently placed the rag on her forehead before a weak hand gripped his wrist.

“Shionie. I…” Aiko said to Shion her voice was weak from sickness but also something else Shion couldn’t place. “I wish things were different for you, my beautiful boy. That you didn’t need to take on this responsibility.” She said before coughing into her rumpled sleeve.

Shion blinked at her while cocking his head. “Mother, I am fully capable of taking care of each and every sibling that is charged in my care. Worry not, for I am adept in the field of child rearing and house care.” Shion said in his normal robotic tone. His mother frowned when he said that and coughed again weakly.

“I know you are. But you shouldn’t have to be. You should be out there hanging out with your friends. Watching cartoons in the late morning after sleeping in. None of this…” She said motioning weakly to his sibling’s rooms. “Should be your responsibility, you're only a kid.”

Shion nodded. He had understood that in normal family arrangements it was unusual for a child to take on such an active role in the child rearing of siblings. But Shion was not concerned about any of that. He always did what was required of him, even if he could choose not to. “I have heard this concern from you before mother, but I assure you I am in a state of zen with my life. Do not fret as it only makes your sickness worsen.”

She nodded weakly and closed her eyes. Soon she was out. Shion left the pills she needed to take on her bedside table before heading out the door. He went to each of his sibling’s rooms tucking them back in and making sure they were asleep before heading out for work that day. Little did he know that was the last time he’d see them alive.

Shion worked the majority of the day from the early part of the morning until late into the evening. The sun had finally set when he rounded the corner to where their small house was located. He walked up to the door and noticed it was ajar. Odd, but something that wasn’t usual. What was unusual was how dark it was on the inside and how quiet. Shion’s heart fell into his gut as he ran into the house and saw something that would wreck him to his core.

Later he would learn what had happened, but in the moment he felt pure panic and fear. The limp bodies of his siblings and mother were found throughout the house. Shion felt a rage bubbling up in his chest as he ran to his siblings. What had happened? Who had done this? What was happening? All rational thought escaped him in that moment and his tears clouded his vision. 

He was in a tunnel of grief until he heard something fall off a shelf behind him. Shion turned and saw a giant lumbering man behind him, but where most people have two eyes Shion saw clearly that this man only had one. The cyclops grinned down cruelly at Shion and then started to speak. “Ah little demigod finally is home. Now I can feast.”

Shion backed up as panic started to settle into his chest. He reached for something, anything to defend himself with. His hand grasped a baseball. He instinctually threw it at the cyclops. With a thwack it hit the cyclops in the head. It caused the cyclops to look at his head and yelled “ow”, but that was all the time Shion needed. He sprinted towards the door to run away from the monster.

Shion booked it out the door and down the street. He looked back and saw following close behind him was the cyclops that had a welt the size of… well a baseball on his forehead. Shion ran and ran, but he was not fast enough. Shion had been running, but suddenly he was on his back with the giant cyclops pinning him to the concrete. His breath smelling like rancid beef and mutton and drool pooling on his lips and dropping right onto Shion’s forehead. Shion squirmed and looked for something to hit the cyclops with but he came up empty. He looked at the cyclops and nodded his head. He was out of options and he knew that there was no use fighting. So, he shut his eyes and awaited his fate. He would soon join his family in whatever afterlife awaited them.

His eyes closed. It was dark. He was alone. He was afraid. Then he saw the face of Takeshi above him, panic written on his face. Shion looked at him confused. Takeshi was dead and none of this was real. Or had he already died and this was the afterlife? He didn’t even feel the pain. Maybe that’s what happens when you die, you forget the moment it happens because it’s too painful? Shion smiled softly at Takeshi and went to reach for him. Just as he was about to reach up and grab him, Takeshi's face shook left and right as if saying no. “Wake up Nii-chan! Wake Up!” He shouted and with a jolt Shion’s eyes opened and he was still there looking at the cyclops, but something was different. He felt something in his hands. He had not time to look at what it was but somehow he knew that this was a weapon. So Shion took his arm that was over his head and slashed down at the cyclops.

In an instant a purplish-blue beam of concentrated light swept through the cyclops who had a look of shock and pain flash upon his face before he started to disappear in golden light. Shion gasped as he looked at the energy sword that was in his hands. He wasn’t exactly sure how it had gotten in his hand, but he was not one to question when something saves his life. 

Shion after a minute of catching his breath and letting the adrenaline cool down he knew he had to deal with what happened. He went back to his home and called the mortal police. He sat by the front door until the officers arrived. It was a long and confusing process but eventually they collected their bodies and went on their way. There was an officer that was still with Shion until the social worker arrived because the police had declared it was a homicide and were concerned that Shion could be a target.

Once the social worker arrived, the officer left and the social worker came to sit by Shion who was still sitting in the front stoop of his house. He had a hollow look, he was empty because all the tears had been shed and all his limited emotions had been spent. The social worker was a large man with a paisley suit on, wildly tousled hair that was kept under a fedora style hat. Shion barely glanced at him because he was hardly able to focus on anything. “You’re brave. Not many at your age can fight a cyclops like that.” The man in the paisley suit said with an American accent.

Shion frowned. He had heard the man correctly. His auditory receptors in his ears were working properly and had not been damaged by the cyclops. So, he knew the man had said cyclops and fight. Slowly Shion turned to face the man sitting next to him. He blinked at the man as his mind was blank. The man gave Shion a warm smile. “Name’s Pasqual Rottingtree. Senior Protector with Camp Half-Blood. I know you fought a cyclops. I can smell his… stench from your home.” Pasqual handed Shion a business card that he pulled out of his suit jacket. It said exactly what he had told Shion but it too had paisley designs on it, Shion assumed Pasqual liked everything to match. Shion blinked, none of that made sense to Shion. How could this man know he fought a cyclops from just smell and what was Camp Half-Blood? So many questions started to bubble up in Shion’s mind.

It was as if Pasqual had sensed what Shion was thinking as he started to explain further. “I am a satyr, a magical protector of demi-gods such as yourself. If I had discovered you sooner I do say this unfortunate incident might not have needed to happen. For that you have my deepest condolences son of Eirene.” Pasqual said, giving Shion a sincere frown as he patted his shoulder. “Now, after you handle all of this business here, would you want to go to camp? It is safe for demigods like you.”

Shion thought for a moment. He had never known he was in danger until today. He of course did not blame this nice man. Wait… when did the man have goat legs? Shion thought he needed to start paying better attention to these sorts of details. He shook his head to get back on track. He also knew that after he buried his family he had nothing left here. No one else to turn to. Nothing to hold on to. In the end it was an easy and logical choice for Shion. “I agree to your terms Mr Senior Protector Pasqual Rottingtree. I will attend the camp you have outlined to me and become protected so you can fulfill the assigned task you have.” Shion said in his robotic tone.

Pasqual smiled and nodded his head. “Okay. I will take you there personally.”

# Introduction

**Scenario 1:**

Shion arrived at camp with Pasqual helping him carrying his bags. Shion wished he had known that the camp was in the states before making his deal with Pasqual. He got the feeling the satyr tended to forget that detail when conjoling potential campers. Either way Shion was walking with his luggage into camp. It had been a bit over a week since the incident (forever what Shion would be calling that night). The pair had just crested over the hill and were heading down in the direction of the Big House. Shion was tired, but also a bit hopeful that he might be able to start a new life here at camp. Either way he mostly just hoped someone could point him in the direction of his cabin.


**Scenario 2:**

Shion had finished unpacking his things in the Horai cabin and decided he would begin exploring his new home. His first agenda item was to head to the beach to see if the water was an acceptable temperature to swim in. He of course was not wearing any swimming trunks as he was not going to go swimming, he was just doing cursory research before deciding what he would do for the rest of his day. Of course he could be stopped anywhere along his journey to and from the beach by passersby.",4,1760113750.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,0.84,False

There’s so many notes that transitions throughout the course of the evening.  From the mix of hay, coffee and vetiver. As it develops, the heart brings out smoky leather wrapped in a touch of blooming jasmine, giving it both strength and a faint, sensual softness.

I’ve been trying to write this for an hour—hoping anyone with experience in Aus e-commerce or visas can help me out. I’m a marketer feeling a bit stressed right now!

  
**Situation：**I’ve worked in **e-commerce marketing** at a top Chinese tech company for 7 years. Lately, I’ve focused on **China-Australia cross-border trade** (like figuring out which products sell well in Australia and the other way around). My main skills are two things:**category management** (optimizing product lines, crunching sales data to cut underperformers, and working with suppliers) and **integrated promotion marketing** (running campaigns across social, search, and in-app, then tracking every cent of ROI). 

  
I just got approved for Australia’s WHV! I’m at the upper age limit for WHV, so I only get **12 months.** If I go, I have to quit my job in China—and that means my biggest fear (and goal) is simple: I need to land a real marketing/category role in Australia. Not coffee shop shifts or farm work .  **I want this WHV to be my “foot in the door” to Aus retail/e-comm, not a 12-month holiday I can’t afford.**

I’ve tried to prep as much as possible to avoid winging it:​

* I've already submitted an EOI for Marketing Specialist (to get the visa ball rolling)​,did't invited now.
* Right now, I’m buried in LinkedIn, rewriting my resume to sound “Aus-friendly”and practicing interview answers to “how would you adapt to our market?”

#  Is there anyone currently working at Amazon Australia, Kogan, or Coles? I’d be incredibly grateful to hear your interview tips and how to better prepare for opportunities at these companies. Thank you so much in advance!

1. **For e-comm/retail marketing/category roles—do overseas candidates even stand a chance?​**

I’m targeting big names like Amazon Australia, Kogan, and Coles because their Category Manager/Marketing Specialist roles look exactly like what I do now. But I keep asking myself:​

* Do these companies (or small/mid-sized Aus e-comm brands) hire people on WHV? Especially someone still overseas, trying to network via LinkedIn?​
* What skills should I scream about on my resume? I know data analysis (SQL/Tableau) and cross-border experience are my strengths—but is there something specific to Aus I’m missing?

I am curious to know where folks here fall.

  
1) The mom who kind of guides her kids through the process of playing, and stays within arms reach of the kids the whole time they play: Says things like: ""Give them a turn. Watch out for your friend. Share. Be careful."" Will play pretend with the kid and mostly focuses on playing/engaging.

2) The social mom on a playdate or chatting with other moms nearby. Will rush over to help a kid climb a ladder or shout ""Yeah, baby! That's a cool toy!"" across the space, but will otherwise only engage in play when they see something dangerous about to happen or if the kid specifically calls them over.

3) The mom who brings her kids to the place because they are tired of being touched and just needs the kids to run some energy out in a safe space while she drinks coffee, reads, or just kind of zones out. Kind of like the social mom when it comes to engaging with the kids, but doesn't feel like socializing with other adults.

4) The parents who fully engage with their work, book, phone, etc. until there's a bonk and tears somewhere on the other side of the room.

Full disclosure, I typically fall somewhere between 2 & 3, but I was in a play space this morning with a BUNCH of 1s. No hate on them, everyone parents in their own way, but it made me uncomfortable letting my kids play near those other kids because the parents kept saying ""Watch out for your friend!"" to their toddlers which made me wonder 1) are they actually kind of talking to me and wanting me to get my kid out of the way? or 2) am I expected to be within arms reach of my kids the whole time we're here? In our every day life or on playdates with friends, I typically let the kids just do their own thing and only intervene if someone is IMMINENTLY about to get hurt, but let them figure out things like turns and ""manners"" among themselves (to the extent it hasn't gone too far).

Anyway, I guess I'm curious to know where you fall AND I'm curious to know if I've gone too far in the wrong direction and my kids are potentially being looked at as troublemakers.",1,1760113593.0,sahm,10,0.67,False

First Encounter 

The sun pierced over the pages of her book, forcing her to glance at the scenery in front of her. She had forgotten herself in the park, her nose buried in her book, with the occasional adjustments of her glasses interrupting her focus. But now, the setting sun had snatched her attention as she gazed at the landscape. It was just her, on a bench by the lake, the hues of orange and green signaling autumn on the horizon. The sun's rays peaked through the orange leaves, warming her cheeks, and begging her to take in a deep breath. This was why she was here - peaceful, serene and most importantly far away from humans! She made her way back home to her little cabin, secluded among the trees and overshadowing the lake. Her cabin was laid out like a studio apartment, with some separation between the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. But she didn't care about all of this, it was her space, just her space. The cabin had a fireplace, and most important, a tiny sun tunnel that filled the room just the way she liked it. She continued her chores, taking her time and enjoying the slow pace of the countryside

The mug still steaming with hot chocolate warmed her hands. She laced her fingers in between each other, clasping the mug tightly and taking a sip. The robust chocolatey flavor filled her sense of taste and the warmth traced its way down her body. It was a cold night, and even though the fire was on, and a cozy blanket hugged her from her neck to her toes - it was still cold. It was a lonely cold. Her knees rubbed against each other trying to generate heat, but something was missing. The divorce, although very much a necessity, had left a gap. If only there was someone to share this night with. She looked out through her small cabin window, watching the moon reveal itself from behind the scattered clouds. It would have been a nice evening to share with someone. Not just anyone, someone kind hearted, and gentle, but strong and beautiful. This was a lot to ask for these days though. Relationships today have been reduced to transactions people make for status. Or at the very least to keep the depression away. She wasn't that foolish though, been there - done that. What she wanted was someone real!

She drank her cocoa and gazed at the moon, listening to wind whistle lullabies to her. The fire danced to the music as well, soothing her gently to sleep. Her small cabin, although empty was at least cozy, and the cold room had finally warmed up enough for her to relax. She questioned herself as she fell asleep, do I really need anyone ruining this? It's so quiet, and peaceful, I mean I have my life back, it's finally mine again. No, I'm gonna enjoy this country side a little longer, I'm going to take time for me, she thought. Her blissfully deep sleep was interrupted by the wind again. But this time howling. The calm night had shifted while she dozed off. The cabin was filled with the sound of leaves violently rustling, protesting the ferocity of the wind, or perhaps warning against it. It was completely dark too, just a small fraction of faint moonlight pierced the center of her cabin, bouncing off the coffee table. This cozy cabin felt so different now, but this was nothing - she was used to this. In the countryside, the weather dictates your day. There was a sudden thudding sound that enveloped the cabin, shaking the floor boards. She wondered if a branch had fallen on the roof. She decided to check it out. She grabbed her phone and turned on the flashlight. Reaching for her cozy slippers as she shuffled her way to the front door.

She opened the door and almost walked right into him. She had not expected anyone to be at her door, he was so silent and his clothes so dark. She followed his garments with her flashlight, pointing it higher and higher trying to make sense of what was in front of her. She realized this was a rather tall man standing in her doorway. His eyes locked with hers and for a second beamed red. But she looked closer, he seemed completely exhausted, lifeless and at death's door. She could barely make out his face because his long pitch black hair acted as curtains, only revealing pieces of his likeness to her.

You must be freezing she thought, and grabbed his hand dragging him through the threshold of her door and into her cabin. She immediately ran to the fireplace attempting to restart it. She always struggled with this task. ""Come on!!"" She yelled to herself. This was no time for mistakes, someone could die. His hands were so cold, she felt he didn't have much time left. She wrestled with the matches and her anxiety, striking the matchbox, over and over again. Suddenly she felt his cold lifeless hands wrangle her neck. It was very tight, his hands were very strong. Is this it, she thought, after finally getting my life back, I'm about to be killed by some serial killer?!? All because I decided to be a decent fucking person? In her panic, she let go of the match which she had finally lit. It hit the fireplace illuminating the cabin once more. As he pulled her effortlessly off the ground and towards his face, they finally met.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*PART 2\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The light revealed a very put together European man. Her eyes locked in with his but immediately started to analyze him. He had a strong brow, which looked groomed and matched the structure of his face. His whole face was neatly defined by his elegant and supple cheek bones, his nose protruding but not overbearing and his lower face anchored by a defined jaw line. He had fairly full lips for a European man and a full stubble covered his jaw, chin and neck. She couldn’t quite rationalize what she was looking at. On one hand he was clearly a man easy on the eyes, but at the same time, his pale skin and almost blue tint to his flesh made him look unalive. As she wrestled with the logic of what she was witnessing, his mouth opened revealing the final piece to the puzzle. Long, sharp, bright and glistening fangs divulged their existence to her, showing her the true gravity of the situation she was in.

A vampire?! And I let him in too, she thought. She understood that death had come for her, and it was going to be a painful and brutal ordeal. Why couldn’t I just die in my sleep? Why couldn’t I have a normal life? Thoughts of regret and despair and suffering crashed into her mind, drowning her. She continued to gasp for air as he brought her closer to his gaping mouth. The resentment never left her either, it simply got louder and more overwhelming. She could see herself drowning in it. It wasn’t just a feeling of “oh no, I don't wanna die yet” but more accurately she didn’t have anything to show for the 35 years she had lived. Her life was littered with traumatic experience after traumatic experience. She bounced around every environment, every milestone in life and every experience, leaving only with extra pain. No feelings of accomplishment, no growth, no happiness and at the very best a terrible caricature of love. And now her final moments will be getting ripped apart by a being no one would believe existed. Tears flooded her eyes as her lack of agency over her situation and life as a whole became abundantly clear. She was to die here, a lonely human, who lived a sad and painful life.

The tears from her eyes scrolled down her cheeks and dripped onto the knuckle of his index finger. The sensation carried with it, a plea for life that shook the primal being to his core. His red beaming eyes watched more tears pool on his hands, shouting at him to let go! Reminding him of his own humanity. The heat from her body that once commanded his hunger shrieked at him, demanding his benevolence! He stared into her sad indignant eyes and recognized his own mortality in them. At that moment, this immortal and ancient being could see his own formative years. One not unlike the woman in his hands. Even more painfully obvious to him, was that his loneliness ran for far longer than her lifespan. For centuries his life had been solitary and like her he resented that. Actually that resentment had grown to hate. He hated his loneliness and greater still hated that he was an agent of it. His once red gleaming eyes, now carried a brown natural color to it, as if he had been infected by life itself. 

At this moment, his grasp weakened and his now humane eyes started to fill with tears. She recognized the gap immediately, as her fight or flight instincts jumped to the front of her psyche. In an act of  both desperation and bravery she freed herself from the undead hands, ungracefully landing to the floor. Her limbic system was supremely aware of her environment and only needed the assurance of the floor, no matter how inelegant to act. Right as soon as she hit the floor, she reached into the fireplace, grabbing a lit piece of wood. Stake through your fucking heart motherfucker! rang in her mind like church bells. She lunged at him, driving the flaming piece of wood into him piercing a hole right in his chest. 

The immortal being accepted the stake, collapsing to the floor and almost smiling in relief as he did so. It had finally come! At last he could leave this plane of existence! Although, 300 plus years of despair still took its toll on him. Even as an immortal being, life dealt him the very same rat race of a piece of shit hands that most humans lived. Just like most humans, he was going to be dying a brutal death. He at least felt he deserved it though, his hands were stained with blood after all. As he tried to accept his fate, he couldn’t help but wish for something different. A life filled with more joy, one filled with love, a life where you thrived and not survived. He gazed at the marvelous human who succeeded in turning him, and saw a primal being. Is this what I looked like to everyone? Was this the last thing people saw before I inevitably ended them? She was a raw, cerebral being completely connected to “now” and nothing else. With his dying breath he muttered… blood as the world around him faded.",1,1760113589.0,CoffinbaitClub,0,1.0,False

Go to our facebook chat and look at the first message i sent you. i still feel that same way. I'm reminiscing on all the good tiems we had, all the things weve been through and how special it all was.

IM sorry.


Take this to your therapist and really think about if I’m narcissistic, if I’m manipulative. I was scared, I'm anxious, and I'm human and have my own issues. Everyone can be selfish or unintentionally manipulative if you let your feelings and impulses get the best of you, i was scared and anxious and when you started saying, “I don’t know,” and I need space. It triggered everything i was fearing, but it doesn't excuse unhealthy behavior.

You broke up with me and I don’t know why. we both have things we weren't being accountable for, but you just left. you didn't communicate. Vague surface level statements like ""i need you to do less"" and ""i don't know"" or communicating with TikTok's or reels you occasionally sent about real problems we were having aren't clear communication. **you wouldn't talk to me about things in a clear way that I could understand** and i really did try to understand, but i cant always be reading between the lines or trying to assume or guess how you're feeling. That hurt. I was constantly trying to learn how to communicate with you better and be curious about what you needed, and you shut me out.

# Here’s what I take accountability for.

I have multiple plans and systems in place to change these. With a therapist, a sponsor and multiple daily check ins and routines as well as support from family and friends who i have expressed my issues to. Im doing my best to fix it all, and be accountable.

Here’s what I’m changing for myself.

I put too much into you and forgot to take care of myself. I was giving you too much and i understand that you felt smothered. I wasn’t working on my fear of abandonment, or setting healthy boundaries, or trying to rescue you from the consequences of your actions, I wasn’t working on advocating for my own needs without feeling guilty or selfish so I didn’t advocate, I wasn’t building my tolerance for conflict and stopping myself from shrinking and apologizing for things I didn’t do. I wasn’t putting in enough work to end unhealthy or unsafe relationships in my life. I put too much effort into forcing you to see my side of how your behaviour was affecting me, instead of restructuring my behaviour I put all that work I wasn’t doing for myself onto you, and I started giving from a place of anxiety and was feeling resentful instead of giving from a place of safety. 

I need to self-regulate my emotions better. Most of my problems come from me not being able to self regulate well enough. ADHD makes it hard to do so, but I’m going back through my old workbooks to make it a constant habit and pattern that I will stay on top of to correct and adjust. I forgot to do this, I self regulated with porn, with games, with reassurance from you, instead of getting those things from myself and from my friends I relied on you and those crutches to regulate my emotions and urges. That’s not okay, it’s a struggle, but I’m doing what I need to with my therapist and with my own habits to change this.

I need to learn to be uncomfortable, and not in control of a situation, I need to not let my anxiety control my actions or emotions. I need to take a step back and realize that criticism isn’t conflict, it’s coming from a place of love. Being uncomfortable is okay, new experiences will be uncomfortable. If you behave the same way you did in the past in new situations, you won’t change the outcome. A new outcome can only be achieved by reacting differently to the same scenario.

I have unrepaired trauma from my parents and my childhood and teenage years. I need to learn to parent and show up for myself now in ways that I wasn’t able to in my childhood. I was abandoned and neglected, bullied, belittled and humiliated, abused mentally and physically by those around me whom I trusted. Regardless of this, it doesn’t excuse poor behavior.

Lying. I lied out of shame for my own feelings, I lied because I was too scared to ask for help. I was scared to face the truth, and I was dishonest with myself, that was wrong. A partnership shares their feelings and is vulnerable with each other.  It comes from fear, protection, embarrassment, and shame. It’s how I survived my childhood and avoided abuse. To keep people happy by telling them what they wanted to hear. To not have to admit to my shortcomings or mistakes. To help me pretend to be someone I wasn’t. To save myself from rejection and discomfort. I have struggled to unlearn this my whole life. The truth is always better than a facade, and it took me a long time to learn that. I learned early that no matter what I said that was truthful, it would be read as not enough, or disappointing, and I would get belittled and physically punished if I told the truth about messing up, even if I tried my best. So I learned to lie to protect myself. It isn’t okay. And I’m sorry about the things I lied to you about, big or small. No more exaggerations, just the truth.

I have trouble expressing my needs because it scares the shit out of me. I’m used to expressing my needs and having them ignored or being told that they’re not important right now. But my needs and boundaries are important, and they do matter. And in a healthy relationship, you need to communicate those in a way that can still reassure my partner that I love them and they matter to me. Otherwise you're doing a disservice to both people. Be vulnerable and let people in, it helps build trust by showing them how you are really feeling and what you’re really thinking and its helps you be accountable.

I have an intimacy and dopamine addiction that comes from having adhd and a poor childhood where I lacked having my needs met and lacked connection and closeness. And in turn, I use porn and adult content as a means of dopamine and self regulation. Both things that I didn’t think about and which I didn’t deal with on my own or come to you to talk about soon enough. That is why, when I felt I was losing closeness and intimacy (hugs, physical contact, sex, kissing) with you, I resorted to dealing with my problem on my own and in secret because that’s how I’m used to fulfilling my needs from my past, and it was shameful and selfish and inconsiderate. I chase dopamine, and I do it in unhealthy ways. I am changing that and breaking the cycle of addiction and self-medicating with unhealthy habits, forming new ones, and removing sources of temptation to control and remove those urges.

I’m quitting.

The pain I caused you by breaking your trust and making you feel unwanted or unattractive is horrific, and I’m so deeply sorry. You didn’t deserve any of that.

It was never about you. It was my issue, and I should have cut that part of my life out much sooner. I should have listened to you better and made you feel heard. I did my best to face the shame, do the work in therapy, and change, but I know I didn’t do it fast enough.

I broke your trust because of something I was struggling with, not because of anything you did. I was too focused on serving you and not enough on fixing myself. That was my failure. I’m not a bad person, but I made mistakes, and I own that fully. It makes me sick to know I made you feel that way.

It wasn’t your fault. It was mine. If you ended things after finding that picture, I understand. I truly thought we had deleted everything the last time we went through my computer, and I swear I haven’t done anything since then to hurt you. No messages, no transactions, nothing. I was trying to change.

I’m so sorry. You didn’t deserve any of it.

I appreciate the grace and chances you gave me to change my behavior, and I truly meant I would change it and stop. I’m sorry I didn’t do that fast enough. That’s on me.

I fucked up, and I’m still sorry that I made you feel worth less than you deserve.

When I say I’ll stop, I mean it.

I didn’t feel like I had enough direction or clear communication from you so I was just trying anything to help you and support you, but I didn’t listen enough to you. I spent too much time trying to manage your emotions instead of just supporting you and listening. It wasn’t me trying to control you it was me trying to to do my best to help, I’m used to being criticized and having my worth questioned by mistakes I make I constantly do in order to not be criticized I would plan and make sure everything was done “right”. it was for my own self protection from a pattern that I learned as a child, I need to be better at listening to others and sit and not be in control. That wasn’t okay.

I have a bad connection with self-confidence, self-worth, and boundaries to protect my own well-being. I need to learn to love myself and not try to earn love from others because if I continue that, I will never be enough. If I don’t, then I will continue to disrespect myself and put my issues onto others.

I abandoned my own self-worth to support you. I took on a parental role because when I first met you and saw how wonderful you were, but how much trauma you had, it reminded me of myself, and I wanted to care for you and make you believe in yourself. Because if someone had done that for me in high school, I wouldn’t have attempted suicide twice. Now, I didn’t think you were in the same state, but I saw someone with a heart of gold in a shitty situation, and I wanted to show you that there are good, kind, and compassionate people in this world. And that you deserved to have those same beliefs in yourself. Now, caring for someone and taking care of someone are two different things. And that’s where the codependency formed for us. I cannot fix your problems, I can’t control your choices, I can only support and give you grace to help you grow. And I pushed too hard and put you under too much pressure to make that happen in a healthy manner.

I didn’t respect your boundaries well enough when you tried to put them up, i was scared and felt you were pushing me out.

I needed to trust and respect your autonomy more and your intuition more than I needed to self-soothe. I started treating you the same way my mom treats me, I couldn’t take my foot off the gas and trust that you were okay, I needed to stop and trust you.

I have an abundance of empathy and patience, but I lack the skill to give those to myself. So I always strive for perfection, and that’s why I feel I have to be in control, so that I can’t be criticized or have something go wrong where someone can get mad at my mistakes. We’re human we make mistakes and that is how we learn.

I need to validate your feelings better, but not your behaviour. I enabled you to keep behaving the way you did instead of trying to be realistic/devil's advocate and give you an honest opinion. I waited too long to start doing that. And that came from my lack of self-love and worth. I parented you and tried to protect you too much.

I lacked the ability to be a safe space when I lost my patience with you. I didn’t make you feel heard because I got defensive. I need to change that because how can you receive someone’s hurt or issues with you if you respond by getting upset? I’m allowed to get upset. I am only human, I will make mistakes, I will fuck up, but I need to communicate that and ask for time or space to process if I need it, so that I can effectively and compassionately receive communication from my partner. But I will not give up, and I will always try to repair what I’ve done wrong. And I always appreciate when I am told what isn’t working because then I can make a change if I was unaware that I was doing so.

I need to learn how to truly love myself and appreciate who I am, and be able to be as kind, forgiving, and compassionate to myself as I am to others. I deserve to give myself that, and I need to teach myself how to do that so I don’t rely on others for my happiness.

We shouldn’t have used my therapist for couples counselling. After hearing what you said about biases, I stopped going to him on my own so that it would be fair and impartial. But we should have gotten a separate couples counselor, and I should have continued going on my own to work on my issues, instead of putting all my effort into helping you with yours. Again, I forgot to prioritize myself.

I need to move out so I can really begin to unlearn patterns and /stop repeating trauma from a safe space so that I can thrive and create new, healthier boundaries with myself and others.

Relationships open your biggest wounds that are unhealed, and your partner will hurt you more than you think anyone can because you trust them more. But that just shows what you need to work on and to reflect and see those things for what they are, past trauma you haven’t dealt with yet. And I plan to deal with it.

I tried my best.

I was not perfect, and I can accept that I lacked things in our relationship, and I know what I need to change and fix.

# The truth and honesty. How I really feel about you.

I saw you, I saw through your facade on our 4th date. I saw your hurt, I saw your damage, I saw your issues, and I loved every part. I saw that you were scared to be vulnerable, and it made me love you more. I saw someone who didn’t believe in themselves but had so much good shining through the cracks. I adored you, all of you. You are my favourite painting. Every brush stroke, whether it’s a little mistake or a happy accident, I admired every part of you. That’s why I told you so much about myself the night you asked me to ask you to be my girlfriend. I already thought you were, and I wanted to show you that you could be safe with me, and I let you in, all of my shame and my past. I wanted you to do the same. I trusted you and took a risk. Because nobody knows what will happen, but if you never take a risk, then you’re doomed to never grow. I want you in my life. Not because I need you, but because I choose you. I want us to have conversations that go deeper, without fear, without walls, without other voices stepping in. I don’t want to smother you or trap you. I want to be honest with you, so you can see the real me, not the silent version. And if you don’t want that, I’ll respect it. But if you do, I’m ready to show up differently than I have before.

I want to be in your life, not out of need, but because I value you. I want us to be open with each other, to share without holding back. I don’t want to pressure you, I just want to meet you where you feel safe.

I'm proud of you for who you are, for how smart you are. You light up a room when you walk in, you bring an energy like no other. My friends and family adored you, and these past few weeks, that’s all I’ve heard about. I’m proud of you for growing, even though it’s exhausting, and not giving up on your health. I’m proud of you for trying new things that you aren’t good at and sticking with them. I’m proud of you for standing up for yourself when it’s uncomfortable. I’m proud of you for doing what you think you needed to do.

I’m just proud to know you. I was humbled by knowing you. You built a kingdom in my heart. You gave me confidence I didn’t know I needed. You gave me safety. And I’ll miss having my hand on your hip every night, and hugging you and kissing your forehead each morning. You gave me strength and courage, and I wouldn’t be where I am now without you. But now I am without you.

Try to see the good in the world, improvement is improvement, and don’t be so negative about things. There are a lot of kind people out there. Some are annoying or have annoying habits, some can be mean, and some are just ignorant of others. Everyone has something good to give, remind yourself of that. It’s not all bad, there’s a lot of love in this world, and the little egg on my dashboard reminds me of that.

You will forever be in my heart, and I hope that you are happy when you think of me. I am when I think of you. You can come into my life just like you left, a goddamn hurricane. You changed everything. And I hope you know what you lost, what you gave up. I hope one day you can look back on me and on us and be happy about what we had, because it was special.

I don’t think many people get a shot at love like what we had. Truly.

If you could see even a sliver of yourself from my point of view, you would know how fucking worth it you are. How beautiful you are inside and out. I never could keep my hands off you. And my favourite fucking thing in the world was to listen to you ramble about your day or your friends or an idea or a dream you had. It brought me so much joy just to hear you speak about something that made you happy. You were more than good enough for me. I was good enough. I was good enough for you, and I always tried to show that.

I’m forever grateful for your patience and your ability to be compassionate and gentle. I’m grateful for how you helped me grow and see me for who I am, and gave me confidence that I am a good person and I deserve love. That I deserve patience and respect. I’m thankful for your influence on my life and for how you changed me for the better. I’m thankful for the habits you got me to start and the affirming words when I stumbled or succeeded. I’m thankful for you existing on this planet. And I’m grateful for every moment we have had. I admire your childlike wonderment and the way you make the simplest things feel like gold. It’s not sunlight, it’s sunshine. And that’s what you brought to my life. I'm sorry things ended like they did. I wish we could have been better together. In another life. You deserve love. And to be confident in who you are. You deserve happiness and to stop thinking you aren’t good enough. You deserve patience, honesty, and compassion.

You deserve sunshine.

Because you are one of the most incredible people I’ve ever had the honour of knowing. And it was an honour to be let into your world and be a part of it. I will always love you, and I will always be thankful for what you have given me.

What you have to offer to this world is why I never gave up on you. You are fucking incredible despite everything that you have been through. You are not broken, you are healing.

I always wanted to work with you. I was never going to give up on having faith in you, on believing in us. We did work, it was beautiful, and I’ll be forever thankful for what we had.

You built a kingdom in my heart and I will be forever grateful for that.

I will forgive you, will you forgive me?

Whether you choose to let this end or not.

I’m doing the work.

I’m here. I never left. I never gave up on you.

# I never quit on you.

I was always there. Always trying to be better for myself and to try to support you so you wouldn’t hate yourself so much. all of the driving, the trips, the surprise little gifts, the breakfasts, the lunches, the dinners, the seafood pastas, the mugs you weren't allowed to have more of but they made you so happy, the hockey, the soccer, the late night dates where i had to get up in 4 hours for work, the early morning and late night calls, the driving out to your school every weekend, the flipping my sleep schedule to match yours so we had time on the weekend when you were working, the vulnerable declarations of how much you fucking mean to me, the im proud of you for the little things, the reminders on my phone to make you feel loved, the dancing in the kitchen while making pancakes, the safe spaces i made for you so you could relax and just settle for once, the times when your mom actually let me help with something around the house, the times i dropped everything to come running to comfort you or take you home when you weren't safe, the be kind to yourself today, the gentle conversations about how much you've grown, and so much more but im just crying trying to write out all the things i loved every second of doing for you. Because I loved you and you appreciated all of those things. I was always there for you. I always wanted to be there for you

You pushed me out, you stopped trying to be vulnerable. You stopped letting me love you. You became emotionally unavailable.

# I was insecure and immature.

When we first started, my love was unrestrained. But I saw a girl who hadn’t been treated right, and I was trying to make up for it. I felt that we had dealt with similar emotions growing up, and I connected with you. And I feel a lot, I love a lot. I have an innate ability to love at a very deep level and to have confidence in people, and I try to believe that people have way more to offer and more good in themselves than they believe. I didn’t give you grand gestures, I was just trying to make you feel seen and worthy. I wanted to do any little thing I could to make you believe you were worth the time and effort. 


But I didn’t stop doing that, I didn’t stop loving you. I never stopped trying to show you I cared. Even when your imperfections or issues arose, I stayed. I kept trying. And I, yes, I made many mistakes, some big and some small. So did you, but we had the patience to let each other prove we were trying to grow.

I betrayed your trust. That will always be on me. I lied, and I made more trauma for you to deal with. But I tried to own that, I know I didn’t do it right the first time, and you gave me my chances to make it better, to let me heal. I found my issues that had nothing to do with you, and I owned them and sat with that guilt and shame and tried my best to do something about it to change that behavior.

I didn’t spend enough time just listening to you, making you feel heard. And just hearing and feeling your emotions. I went to problem-solving instead, because that’s what I knew how to do, but I realized that wasn’t the right way to immediately fix it. And it’s something that takes time and takes energy from both of us to fix. But I tried to fix it, I did my best because you didn’t deserve that at all.

And I tried to respect your boundaries as you pushed me away and asked for more and more space. Even though that was the most uncomfortable thing for me to do. But I tried to do that for you. To make you feel safe.

We were and are learning how to navigate love and an adult relationship. And I still want to learn with you. I don’t think many people get a shot at the love that we had before everything got scary and hard, and I don’t think that was a honeymoon phase

But when the relationship started to turn to real commitment, real accountability, and support. You got scared.

I was too, but when did I leave, when did I not support you, when did I walk away when your flaws and your avoidance came out?

I didn’t, I stayed, and I believed in you. But you couldn’t say sorry or admit your wrongs, you have issues to work on, and I won’t let my happiness and my need go unfulfilled.

I always felt at home with you, I always felt like I could be my true self with you, and I was always proud to know you and have you in my life. I didn’t need to pretend. I loved talking about you to my friends, family, and anyone who would listen. And they loved you too, and they did their best to support you and show you how wanted and valued you were in their home. Why do you think they called you their daughter-in-law?

I always chose you, no matter what the obstacle or what was going on, even though you say that you have too much to deal with, focusing on the obstacles instead of what we’re both truly saying. That we want this, and we love each other.

When I stopped only being empathetic and trying to understand your feelings, and just comforted you and made you feel seen. When I started addressing you and your problems and trying to help you be accountable, you turned my empathy against me, making me try harder to understand and hear you. You weaponized it, whether you like it or not. I had standards that I left in the dust because I felt awful for your upbringing and your home life. And I gave you everything you could have asked for to get out, to move forward, and grow, and you got scared and refused to.

# Things that are important in a relationship, this goes both ways.

Value the relationship the same way.

Communication.

Can’t vs choosing not to do something hard.

Commitment.

Accountability.

Saying sorry without having to ask for an apology after you’ve told your partner they hurt you.

Repair after mistakes.

Telling your partner when they've upset you.

Feedback on navigating conflict.

Feedback on support and head states

Promises kept

# You Hurt Me

When someone knows they hurt you but chooses silence instead of accountability, that’s avoidance, not closure. You didn’t disappear because I was hard to love. You disappeared because guilt is louder than honesty. It’s easier for you to vanish than to admit you broke something beautiful. But your silence is not my fault. And it’s not my responsibility to chase closure from someone who won’t face what they did.

You stopped making me feel safe, you stopped making me a priority,  you made me scared and unsure of myself, you avoided hard questions and any questions that would change the status quo, because you wanted love, but you didn’t want accountability. And when I finally got the courage to tell you what I really needed in a relationship, you responded by saying This is too much, I can’t do this right now. Or by changing your behavior and giving me what I needed for a week or two, and then stopping again. You are avoidant, and you lack accountability. I had to fight for every apology whenever I was hurt because of you. I had to fight for apologies, which let me down. You didn’t let me down as a person, but that behavior let me down as a partner. And you don’t want to accept that. Instead, you say I was manipulating you and was narcissistic. I don’t have to prove to you that I’m not. I know I’m not, I was just very in love with you and wanted you to see yourself in a better light, to have confidence and self-esteem, to believe in yourself that you were in control of your life, and you can’t blame everyone else for your problems.

When you spend 6 and a half years complaining about the same thing, and you never do anything real to change that. That’s manipulation. Action has a reaction, you fail or you succeed. And if you fail, you try again.

And when you’re making me feel bad when I’m trying to find any way to make you feel safe so that you don’t shut down when I try to talk to you about hard things. When I come to you for support, your issues always take the front seat over mine. And that is on me for not recognizing that and saying something sooner, but I didn’t want you to feel like a disappointment to me because you were already dealing with so much.

After 4 years, I asked you about moving in for 6 months straight, i made spreadsheets, mapped things out and asked you to help me but you kept saying ""not right now"" or ""i cant do this today"". When it finally came time to plan it together, you said you didn’t think I was being serious. That hurt a lot, that made me feel alone. And ever since then, I think everything got too real for you. Taking care of yourself, your health, and your mental health was a lot and i felt like you didn't have space in your head for me. 

I’m human. I make mistakes, and so do you, but I try my ass off to fix them, and I'm trying have the grace for myself and you, that we might not get it fixed the first time or the second, because failure is a part of life. But I will not stop until I have made peace with my demons and held myself accountable for what I’ve done. I will not stop until I’ve grown. Until my mistakes are not torturing me anymore, and until whatever or whoever I’ve done wrong notices I put in the effort. And I’m doing my best to make a difference. 

I just wanted to love you, and for you to love me. I wanted to heal. I wanted you to heal. Together.

I knew you were having issues, and learning your love language and attachment style was difficult, but I was trying to be better, it felt like you ignored mine and made me feel like I was manipulating you when I was just begging not to be left behind and for you to hear me asking for reassurance and consideration. But it became too much for you. I think it scared you, and you kept asking for space, which made me more scared.

I just needed you to communicate. But you only would if you felt perfectly safe. Not if there was conflict or you felt any type of discomfort with your feelings. You would just shut down and stone wall me, and I would have to fight to get it out of you, otherwise, you would just let whatever upset you eat you, and it was visible from your behavior when you were upset. That was so fucking hard for me. I just wanted to hear what you had to say, but you wouldn’t say it. i get you need time to process, but sometimes it would be a week or two and we wouldn't come back to the discussion or argument unless i brought it up again. I felt like it was too much for you, to be needed by someone and to be accountable when you make a mistake and have to repair it and own that you messed up. 

You didn’t do that consistently and that hurt every time.

I was trying to do everything you asked me to, I was trying to do it all for both of us, and i now know that was wrong. But you ran, you asked for space, you refused to communicate clearly. I’m not a mind reader. You weren't able to communicate in therapy. You stopped doing the bare minimum for me. What sacrifices did you make? You got a car finally, after I spent 6 years driving you everywhere. “I never asked you to,” but you accepted it every time. And when you finally got it and finally had that freedom and independence, you spent less time with me. You got more selfish and inconsiderate of my feelings. You expected me to always be there, and I was. You weren’t. You didn’t do what you are supposed to do in a relationship: communicate, repair, and keep promises. You ran, you avoided, you deflected. Your feelings are valid, but the way you treat someone because of those feelings is not.

If this was too much for you, too real, too much commitment, too many feelings that you aren’t ready to face. You could have just said that. You didn’t have to break my heart. You didn’t have to try to kill the best part of me, which is my ability to love, my ability to give.

I grew because of you, I grew with you. I tried my fucking best, and that’s the whole point. Trying has some kind of action. You fail or you succeed, and if you fail and it matters to you, you try again until you get it right, and the person you’re with gives you the grace and the support to keep trying and know they still love you and are trying to support you through something hard. 

That’s what I gave to you, every fucking day. Every broken promise, every time you said ""I’ll do that"" or ""i meant to do that"" or ""i was going to do that"" and then you didn't. Or you would do it for a week or a month and then fade away, be inconsistent again. Or you would just tell me you can’t do something. 

No, you’re choosing not to do something because it's hard or scary. Well, I was scared too, but I kept trying. You are the only one with control over your actions, and you refused. 

I know I put myself in this position by having faith, having confidence, and believing in you. And I still do. But you gave up. You refused to try and repair if you hurt my feelings. You hid away. Said I’m sorry sometimes, or I would have to fight for an apology, and we would both be upset. And the behavior didn’t change. But I still believed. 

Call me dumb or lacking self-respect for dealing with an avoidant who stopped giving me the bare minimum. But I thought you were worth it. I saw how hard you tried to take care of yourself, I saw how much time and effort you took to take care of your health. And there once was a time when I saw you put that same effort into us.

You were incredible when my grandparents passed away, you did everything that you could for my family. You took care of me when I was in school and stressed the hell out. You used to check in on me and ask about my hobbies and took an interest in the things that mattered to me and made me happy. And you joined me in those passions, you gave me the confidence to go to the gym and start turning my health around and you supported me as I was still learning to love myself and believe in myself. You were there for me at one point, you did the work. You made me feel like I could actually be the best version of myself and I believed you. You made me feel loved and safe.


#Not Fair

You threw things back at me that I told you in moments of vulnerability. You cherry-picked specific things I said and took them out of context because you could only hear the bad part of what I said, not the full message.

I drove fast because you said I was like your dad, who was an age-up human being, and it made me feel like I was 7 years old and my mom was telling me, “You’re just like your father,” who also was an awful human being. I overreacted, I was trying not to yell because I know how much it upsets you. It wasn’t a better reaction because it didn’t make you feel safe, but I was trying. I’ve been trying not to get as loud in arguments, that’s all I knew growing up was screaming and fighting, and I’m unlearning that. 

I told you that when I was in high school, I disassociated because I had so many overwhelming feelings and couldn’t handle them, and in turn, it numbed my empathy and emotions because I didn’t know how to handle them at 15. I never want to go back there. I’d rather feel the uncomfortable, awful feelings and realize they aren’t so scary, and I will live through this even if it is an overwhelming thing. It’s better to feel everything than nothing at all.

That’s why I hurt so much from this. I can’t be expected to be perfect, and neither can you, but you can expect me to not stop trying to be better for myself when my and for the relationship.

When there is clear communication and you challenge my behavior or i challenge yours, its from a place of love. And then we can reflect on it and give grace and compassion to each other to deal with our issues. But there needs to be clear communication that we both understand and its our job to respond and be curious and clarify if we don't understand, to make sure were conveying the right story and that were hearing the right story.

We didn't do that enough. We are both hurt and both struggling and learning to navigate our own traumas and experiences. That’s what life is, growing from what you know and what you are willing to learn from others.


#Why

The way you left is more psychologically traumatizing than anything else you could have done. I have never felt pain like this before, and you know exactly what I’ve been through in my life. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and all I’m trying to do is save myself from what is happening because I can’t process it. I didn’t know you had it in you to lie to me like that. For however long you planned this, I don’t even know. How long did you lie to me while you slowly moved your stuff out and still slept in my bed?

Knowing that you lied to me made me feel hurt and I’ve been going over it in my mind and realized I should just talk to you about it, and in truth I can’t have someone so close to me as you are lying to me, it’s unacceptable to me and I wanna talk to you about why that happened and I want to understand what led you there so we can make sure it never happens again.

But to come over the night before and treat me the exact way I have been asking you for months, a random act of kindness showing up out of the blue and surprising me, hugs and physical affection. Being curious and showing affection, that’s all I ever needed from you. And instead, you gave me your worst fear.

You left without a trace, you avoided everything, you abandoned me.

You left me with so much of your stuff. You said you took everything you paid for, but you didn’t. You just took whatever you could and ran. You left the gifts I have given you over the years. The sweet memories and took the Lego that you promised to build with me. I’ve packed everything up, I don’t have the heart to throw it out or donate it. Please come take it, if this is really over.

Was it just to hurt me, though? Was I that bad of a partner? Did I really deserve all this? I was kind, I was patient, and I always showed up no matter the reason.

Fine then, blame me. Blame it all on me if that’s how you want to go about this. If that makes you able to live with yourself. That I was awful and never cared and was manipulative and controlling. I was anxious and scared and needed support and communication.

I know you’re hurting, but all you had to do was actually talk to me. No subtleties, just straightforward words. Be uncomfortable in those feelings and sit and accept them for what they are, scary and overwhelming. It’s okay. That’s the patience of a relationship. I'll be patient, and you try. You be patient and I'll try. We give each other grace and trust that our failures aren’t a reflection of who we are, but instead just the trauma that we carry. And have the compassion to let each other learn to overcome those things.

I just want to talk to you again. I want to communicate and make this beautiful thing we once had work. Because it was beautiful. Getting rid of 5000 pictures of you. My whole camera roll was of you. We had so many good memories. We had so much fun, all of the photos I took of you that you hate, and I adore everyone, and remember each second with you. I miss the girl who waited at her door in a robe for me to show up, and when I left on Sunday night. The one who brought me a jar full of kisses so I wouldn’t miss you as much, the one who took care of everything in my house when my grandparents passed away. The one who let me nap on her chest when I was anxious or having a bad day. The one who wasn’t so negative all the time about the world and just enjoyed my company and doing mundane things with me. The slow, cozy Saturday mornings with coffee on the couch. Banana pancakes at the counter. Trips to cabins and seafood pasta dinners. Baking cookies when it was too dark and cold in the winter, and we needed something to cheer us up. Christmas coffee and driving in the snow. Our camping trips. The way you bob your head and do a little dance when you’re happy. All the cute dances you did when you were just being goofy and yourself. I miss driving around and listening to you talk or say “cows” or “horses” or pointing out something that made you happy or that you laughed at. 

My god, I love your laugh. I miss you. God, I miss you so much.

I just wish you had told me how you were feeling. You were more than good enough for me. Your love was always worth the work.

We had our problems, but so much of our time was golden, lots of laughs and kindness, and gentle moments. 

I have so much more to say, but I'm tired of writing to the void you left. I want to talk to you.

Before I go, you should know I loved you every day. You should know I am in constant awe of you. That I would’ve given you everything I possibly could. I just want you to be happy. Surrounded by love. To never know what it is to struggle. To always feel supported. To know your beauty both inside and outside. How captivating I find you to be. I am eternally grateful to have lived the same time as you. To have gotten the experience of knowing you. I wish everything were different, but it’s not.

I believe we can fix this, the strongest couples go through hard things, but i understand if you don't want to anymore.

I know you asked for no contact.

I’ll respect your boundaries. i know now i needed to give you more of that.

I still Love you To the moon and back, bunny.",1,1760113392.0,u_AbandonedAnxious,0,1.0,False

1o35jrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1o35jrk/unemployed_for_the_last_two_months_should_i_try/,"Unemployed for the last two months, should I try to go back to my old job?","Like the title says, in June of this year I quit my job as a Bartender to work as a Barista. 
While working as a bartender I developed an issue with alcohol, or better said, realized I’m an alcoholic. I knew all of the camera blind spots and would totally eat the bar every night I worked. Some days I didn’t even want to get drunk, but I drank because I was so deep into the routine of it. After over a year of profusely drinking 5-6days out of the week, I finally made my move and got out of there. 

Started working at the coffee shop, took a bit of a pay cut but I’ll take consistency over random. As a bartender some nights I’d make $35/hr and some I would make $15/hr. The barista position was 20/hr with minimal cash tips but still got some here and there. 

That barista position honestly wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. The only other women I worked with were also my shift managers, and I swear they would literally talk about me behind my back. Like I would be standing at the register and they’re standing just out of ear shot whispering behind me. I tried to let it go, tell myself “not everything is about you!”. But this went on for over a month, and when the feeling finally consumed me I confronted them about it. They said it wasn’t like that at all. But I still had a weird feeling. Everything went to shit after that. Even the general manager started acting weird with me. They ended up firing me for being late one day. I’m still upset at myself for letting it get to that point, but there’s no going back now. 

Now It’s been two months since then and I’m freaking out. I’ve applied to 200+ jobs, drove around the whole city dropping off my resume to places. Shit out of luck. This girl I met in AA actually offered me a position at her job to coach kids. I trained for a few weeks before realizing I never once said “I want to work with kids” nor was I that good at it, or seeming to improve. My thought process on quitting was that it’s not fair to anyone involved, even folks who would be interested/love to work with kids. She wanted me to complete training and I told her I don’t think I have what it takes. 

It’s like I shot myself in the foot. I feel like I’m out of options, I didn’t want to go back to my old job for many reasons, threatening my sobriety being the most important one. Still I feel like there has to be more options out there but not many places are hiring. I don’t know what to do, think I might try to find a position with my old job but at a different location that doesn’t have a bar. (Still fearful they don’t have any openings either, but it is about to be the busy season for them so maybe) 

I’m working on getting into community college for the first time, to get my phlebotomy license, but regardless of if I make that deadline or not I need a form of income, even if it’s just part time. I am also going to start selling stuff on Facebook marketplace, if anyone wants semi-rare plants and/or some music equipment hmu. 

My job experience is all over the place with majority being in service and retail. I worked as an executive assistant for 2 years and while all that responsibility was nice and made me feel like an adult (at the age of 22 but I’m 25 now) i was overworked and underpaid in that position. Now it’s been so long, that experience doesn’t really count on my resume. So when I try to apply to medical front desk jobs, although I have experience, they never hire me, and I don’t know why I expect them to. 
I’m mad at myself for not getting into college when I was younger, it’s been so difficult getting this process started on top of having no income. 

I genuinely feel like there is no point to trying anymore, and think about not existing basically every day, which I find surprising because I’m extremely afraid of death. My grandparents and others say that I have my whole life ahead of me but everything feels so impossible these days. ",1,1760113379.0,careeradvice,3,0.67,False

I'm on week 6 now. When I first started the morning pages were actually something I felt good about, I noticed that it sort of felt like they woke up my brain in a way that just opening my eyes or having coffee didn't. I planned, as is sort of advised in the book, to continue doing the morning pages for life if they're truly beneficial the way Cameron describes.

From last week into this week, I feel less and less urge to do them in the morning. It's begun to be a game where I'm looking at the notebook look back at me as I do something else with my morning until I finally give in and just throw up whatever on the page, typically repeating something I wrote yesterday or a conversation I can hear in the background of me writing, until I hit three pages. I wanted to point this out here as I feel guilt in the morning until I can force myself to do the pages, then it's a relief like ""Phew, that's out of the way for the day"", which, to my understanding is the antithesis of what the morning pages are supposed to be.

Adjusting the External Grinder
Adjusting the Internal Grinder
Temperature adjustment +- 2°
OPV valve adjustment: mine was factory set at 9 atm, I tested it at 12 and then returned it to the factory setting of 9.
IMS filters

After years of experience, I can tell you that, if you have the experience to properly adjust the machine, the biggest difference is the coffee, specifically the freshness of the beans for the crema and the type of roasting/quality for body and flavor.
The machine's grinder does an excellent job. 
If you have fresh, quality coffee and adjust the grind properly, you'll get an espresso like the best coffee shops.
This is what I had to say based on my experience. 
Try a coffee roasted just a few days ago, or like Lavazza Super Crema, roasted a month ago, and then tell me if this machine doesn't make coffee like the best coffee shops. 
If you can't, you still need to figure out how to set the various parameters.

Ciao a tutti, ho una Sage barista da 5 anni, nel tempo ho provato praticamente tutti i setting possibili che permette. 
Regolazione del macina caffe esterno 
Regolazione del macinacaffe interno.

Filtri IMS

Ecco dopo anni di esperienza vi posso dire che, se anche voi avete esperienza per regolare la macchina come si deve, la differenza più grande la fa il caffè, più in particolare la freschezza dei chicchi per la crema e il tipo di tostatura/qualità per corpo e gusto
Il macinacaffè della macchina fa un ottimo lavoro, se avete un caffe fresco e di qualità e regolate bene la macinatura verrà un espresso come nei migliori bar
Questo è quanto vi dovevo in base alla mia esperienza, provate un caffe torrefatto da pochi giorni o come lavazza super crema torrefatto un mese prima e poi mi direte se questa macchina non fa un caffè come nei migliori bar, se non ci riuscite dovete ancora capire come impostare i vari parametri",2,1760113246.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a project studying Parrothead culture and the way Jimmy Buffett’s music built one of the most joyful fan communities in America. The goal is to create a sort of *coffee-table book meets cultural time capsule,* preserving our stories, photos, and memories from life in Margaritaville.

I’ve put together a **short, easy survey** to help capture how we celebrate, connect, and keep Parrotheads alive.

👉 Here's a [link](https://qualtricsxmddvclbb6k.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9YsbQXMUNnywIT4) to the survey.

1o35fzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o35fzz/work_in_progress/,Work in progress,"The building was ablaze. Sun crawled to the door, coughing violently as the smoke filled his lungs, his eyes stinging and watering. He tried standing up as his legs trembled. Sun opened the door and went out slowly, he trembled as he took small steps into the hallway, trying to escape the fire. Suddenly, he collapsed to the floor, lying on his stomach. His consciousness escaping him. Right as he was about to pass out, someone lifted him, one arm gripping tightly around his back and the other supporting his knees, holding him close. Then, his vision faded into a dark blur as he fell unconscious.

Sun slowly opened his eyes and rubbed them, trying to clear his vision. As he sat up his head ached and in front of him was an unfamiliar wall. Confusion settled over him as he struggled to remember.
- Where am I? Sun mumbled.
He looked around trying to make sense of his unfamiliar surroundings. Suddenly a man came in. 
- Hello Mr. Yoon, I'm doctor Lee. How are you feeling? Do you remember what happened? Said the doctor 
Sun frowned.
 - I'm not sure.. Said Sun.
The doctor explained, - We found you outside the hospital and through a few simple tests we found that you've suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning due to smoke inhalation. We believe it's best for you to stay in the hospital for the next 3 days. 
Sun had a sour look on his face as he closed his eyes and tried to remember yesterday's events. At first his mind was blank, but after a short while he could remember dozing off in his office. Yet another late night working. The nauseating smell of smoke and a horrible headache. Suddenly his mind cleared. The building had been engulfed in flames. The doctor said that he was found outside the hospital, but he had no memory of getting there. 



Sun was outside the hospital waiting for his only friend and colleague, Hana. Suddenly Sun saw a familiar car stop in front of him. It was Hana. He got in the car and sighed.
- You okay sunshine? Asked Hana.
- I told you to stop calling me that! Sun exclaimed. 
- Yeah, yeah, whatever. 
- So first things first, was the doctor hot? single?
Sun glared at Hana in response.
- Haha sorry sorry, now seriously how are you feeling? Asked Hana.
- Like I was just in heaven and came back. Answered Sun sarcastically.
Okay so, how in the world did you manage to burn down the building? You really should stop working so much overtime.
Excuse me, WHAT?! What did I do?!
You didn't know?
 
Sun starts thinking
Okay so I was working and fell asleep. I must have spilled coffee on the computer. Damn it!





Sun checked the mailbox, he took out the mail and unlocked the door to his apartment and pushed it open. Stepping inside, Sun let out a deep sigh as he closed the door behind him. He made his way to the couch and sat down. Sun  opened the mail and saw that he had to pay for his damages. 

It can't be that much, right? Sun thought. 

Dear Sun Yoon, We are writing to inform you about the status of your claim related to the fire incident. We understand that this has been a distressing experience for you. 

The damages caused by the fire would be estimated to be 37,481,667 won. This includes structural repairs and additional expenses due to the incident. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

37,481,667 Won?! HOW am I supposed to pay that?! DAMN IT! 
The door opens

Hello?
Are you ready to go? 
Go where?
Right, I forgot to tell you.
Well, there's this guy I like and I want you to help me get with him. We are supposed to meet him at a cafe in twenty minutes.
I'm not helping you with that.
Pretty please.
Fine whatever. 


they go to the café

Where is he?
There! Elijah come here!

He looks.. familiar… Sun thinks to himself.

Elijah walks up to them. He's tall and has black hair. 
Wait a second.. 

* Flash back -

Sun stood on the crowded train on his way home from work. In front of him, a man held a Latte in his hand. Sun grimaced. Coffee brings him bad luck. The train stops and it's time for Sun to get off. He accidentally walked into the man. The latte flew, splattering hot coffee across Sun's shirt.  It's your fault.  Says the man. Bastard! This shirt is new! Still your fault.

* Flash back ends -

You! You spilled coffee on my shirt! Bastard!
Do I know you? Says the man.
He comes closer to Sun's face to get a better look.
Oh, you're that idiot that walked into me.



Sun pulls Hana aside.
I am not helping you get with that bastard.
Just because he spilled coffee on you?
You're taking his side?! Seriously?
Fine don't help then.

They sit at the table and Sun sits as far away from Elijah as possible with a sour look on his face.

Hana side-eyes Sun and looks back at Elijah with a “don't mind him” look.
So how are you?
I`m fine. What about you?
I'm good.
**blablablablabla**

“Are you kidding me? She isn't paying attention to me at ALL!”
“I don't understand how she likes that bastard, plus I met her first.”

*Suns thinking stops to hear*
Don't you just HATE people that never smile?  Elijah says out loudly.
And people that always have a sour look on their face.
*Elijah sneaks a glance at Sun*
Yeah I guess so.
 
“HE TOTALLY MEANT THAT FOR ME! AND SHE AGREED WITH HIM! WHY?” 

Wait, I need to use the bathroom. Be right back!
 Hana walks away

Elijah smirks at Sun

Sun mouthed “you bastard” to Elijah in response.

Elijah walks up to Sun and whispers.
You know, you should stop frowning. You're gonna get wrinkles.
Sun stands up and walks out of the cafe.
