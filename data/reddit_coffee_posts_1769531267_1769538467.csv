Until the other day, I ran out of Propanolol and didn’t think I needed it anymore. So I didn’t take it for 2 days. I chugged a coffee yesterday morning and within 20 min I had a panic attack. Suddenly I felt out of breath, my heart rate doubled, I felt weak and tired. Although, I didn’t feel much anxiety. Thankfully, my mom takes Propanolol, so I took one of hers. The rest of the day I was just tired and felt some anxiety but not enough to feel worried. This morning I woke up a bit anxious. And I just feel like it’s creeping back in. I have an appointment today. Should I ask to increase Lexapro or do you think this is a continued side effect from Propanolol withdrawal/ yesterday’s panic attack?",1,1769537408.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False
1qolkc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1qolkc8/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

Hey everybody, 

With an immense interest in the 6000m peak climbing in Nepal, aligning with my passion for mountaineering and outdoors, I am happy to introduce a fixed departure Climbing expedition for a perfect adventure for your first 6000m peak expedition. This **19 day journey through the grandeur of the lower Khumbu region, Hinku Valley and the Himalayas** could be a perfect mountain journey whether you are a seasoned trekker or an aspiring mountaineer who is looking to experience what the Himalayas has to offer. 

**Mera Peak at 6461m is a perfect beginner peak to hone your mountaineering skills and experience to understand the technicalities and attributes of being in this high-altitude environment.** Since, it is a non-technical peak, some have labelled this peak climbing experience as a beautiful glacial hike at the high altitude that develops your skill for rope-up glacial traverse w. technical crampons and possibly let you understand your aspirations more closely. 

This trip would be led by certified Climbing Guide in 1:2 ratio of Guide to Clients and would have additional Climbing Guides based on the number of clients. This would be an **all-inclusive climbing expedition that cover all the Gears/Equipment** including – Climbing Harness, Jumar, Rappel ATC Guide, Climbing Shoes and Helmet, etc are provided including 4 Season Sleeping Bag for Khare and Mera High Camp.

I live near Franklin Park.  The main roads are clear and the side streets just OK--still a little slippery. But why doesn't anyone plow the alleys? I got stuck trying to get to work, tires squealing, looking like a complete fool, even after carefully shoveling a path to and from the alley. Meanwhile, while I was working heroically to free my car from the alley, two girls (from elsewhere) easily parked their car, went to the coffee shop on the corner, came back, laughing like they were on a ski vacay, and drove away, probably (I was thinking) to their suburban homes where no alleys exist and roads are free and clear. I did finally get free, btw. But I'll have to park on the street until the snow melts or someone plows the alley. Seems like it would not be a big deal to have the plows go up and down the alleys while they are doing the side streets. ",0,1769537126.0,Columbus,7,0.4,False

And I feel gnarly myself questioning my friend in this way. You see, she befriended this guy at her job. She was a substitute teacher and so was he. Over the school year, they grew very close to each other. They would text outside work. Both of them would go out with another coworker after work to get coffee or to the mall. But over time, as they got closer, they'd go out together to these places. These hangouts almost always ended up with the two of them making out in the car. 

Keep in mind, this was over the course of months. Months of eating lunch together during breaks. Of texting. Of going out together. So of course she developed feelings for him. One time when they were texting, he sent a message strongly insinuating she give him oral sex. She said ""damn, at least take a girl on a date first."" Him: ""What do you think our hangouts in the past have been then?"" Basically retroactively calling the mall and coffee shop gatherings dates. 

During the summer, she lost her virginity to him. It was a hangout that started like every other - they went to the mall, and ended up making out in his car. And they ended up having intercourse. She and I hung out two days later. She was telling me how excited she was that she lost her virginity. She told me how gentle he was and how he asked her if she was okay after. But a week later, the guy completely ghosted her. Stopped replying to her text messages. She was completely heartbroken.

It's been eight months or so since that incident. And she says now that he SA'ed her. That when they were in the car making out, he was already on top of her (nothing out of the ordinary). And he unzipped his pants.

It's not that I think that she's lying. It's clear revenge isn't her goal. But I'm just wondering if it's an instance of hating the choices you made. So you try to tell yourself another narrative in order to save face?",1,1769537042.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

The Suns may have dropped their last 2 games, but this should be an easy cover. Brooklyn has lost 9 of their last 10 outings (including a loss to Phoenix just last week by 9 points…) And, to be frank, I’ll be *wildly* surprised if they manage to keep this encounter within 15. The Suns are at home, and I simply can’t remember the last time the Nets won a game on the road (it was just over a month ago, lol…) Give me the home team to win by at least 9.

Upgrading from a Breville Barista Express. I’m not brand new to espresso, but I’m also not a coffee nerd. I’m comfortable dialing in initially and making small adjustments every few months and when I change beans, but I don’t adjust shots daily.

Preferred drink types:

Mostly cappuccinos and Americanos. 

Drink frequency:

About 4 drinks per day. I don’t regularly entertain or need to pull many back-to-back shots, but I do want faster milk steaming than my current machine.

Space constraints:

Small apartment, limited counter space.

What I’m looking for:

	•	Strong, fast milk steaming

	•	Dual boiler (or similar) so I’m not waiting between pulling shots and steaming milk

	•	Reliable, consistent, and easy daily workflow

	•	Consistency and ease matter more to me than maximum manual control

	•	I do not need auto tamping, but I’m open to features that help with dialing in and repeatability

Grinder considerations:

I know a separate grinder is often recommended, but given my space constraints, milk-based drinks, and relatively infrequent dialing-in, I’m wondering if a higher-end machine with a built-in grinder could make sense for my use case.

Budget:

Up to $6,000 total, but I don’t feel the need to spend that much if I won’t meaningfully benefit!! 

Candidates:

None finalized yet — still early and looking to narrow options.

Questions:

	1.	For this use case, is a separate grinder actually worth it, or should I seriously consider an all-in-one machine?

Now back to three charge backs for businesses whose employees took it upon themselves to add additional tip after the fact. My tolerance for that is zero.

1qol6k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1qol6k5/my_diet_is_only_dairy/,My diet is only dairy🧀🥛🧈🐄,"Im just curious to know if my diet might be problematic long term and if there are people with the same diet.

As the title says, my meals consist of mostly dairy.

I start my day with 2 cups of milk and coffee. 

I have a cup of goat yogurt and some low sugar granola for a late breakfast.

I drink 2 more cups of milk until lunch which is usually a cup of cottage cheese, spelt bread and some honey if im feeling sweet, pesto if I’m feeling savory.

More milk. Like 1 more cup.

For a snack i have a cup of protein yogurt and sometimes a fruit.

Then for dinner i might switch up to chicken if i feel like it, but usually i have cottage cheese again. A fruit maybe.

And a cup of warm milk and honey before bed. If im still too hungry i have another cup of protein yogurt.

I haven’t had any digestive issues, if anything i feel great. 

My fiber intake is just fine, i sneak some vegetables throughout my day and i add fiber supplements to my coffee.

I wonder whats making me crave dairy so much. Id be happy to know if there are people like me somewhere lol",0,1769536613.0,nutrition,4,0.4,False

The design itself isn’t mine. I just focused on getting it made cleanly and finished in a way that sits well on a coffee station. It holds the Picopresso securely between shots and keeps things tidy instead of having it lying around.

I’m based in Bangalore and sharing this here because a lot of Picopresso and manual coffee users end up looking for small accessories like this.

1qol4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1qol4q4/update_on_whats_been_working_for_me/,Update on What’s Been Working For Me,"So long story short I began wet wrapping today for an hour after I woke up. I first rubbed water on my eczema areas, then I put Aloe Vera gel and sealed with a generous amount of Mango butter. I got a wet paper towel and placed it on top of the back of my knees and then saran wrapped and left it for an hour. I did one leg then the other to see if there were any visible or psychical comparisons. I also took pictures as I’ve been documenting since December of 2025.

I honestly wish I would have tried this sooner, my skin is still moisturized and it’s been an hour for the first leg. I have flexural eczema so bending when my skin is flaring and dry normally hurts. I’ve also been taking 3,600 mg of omega every single night and I’m getting back into my 1000mg dose of black seed oil and 2 moringa seeds a day. I was taking Vitamin C and zinc but decided to take a bit of a break from that because I’d prefer a more natural food source for supplements. 

The big thing that I also stopped doing was drinking coffee and wow did that one hurt to let go, I thought dairy hurt to let go but the withdrawals alone from the caffeine made it so hard. I do think it’s helped a lot with the overall heat/inflammation in my body and contributing to less histamine itch cycles. I’m still itchy but a less itchy it’s hard to explain, but those who know know. 

But yeah just an update. Is there anything that has been working for you guys that you’d think be helpful to me or someone else? ",2,1769536512.0,eczema,0,1.0,False

I work from coffee shops a lot and I'm always playing roulette: Will this place be packed? Is it a ""silent study"" vibe or is everyone chatting? Are there even outlets available?

I'm thinking about building an app where people can check in at coffee shops and tag the vibe, things like:

* **Social expectations:** no-expectations / optional-conversation / conversation-expected
* **Busyness:** not-busy / lightly-busy / consistently-busy
* **Stay pattern:** quick-stop / linger-friendly / settle-in
* Plus stuff like WiFi quality, outlet availability, seating type

The idea is you'd open the app, see nearby coffee shops with tags from people who have went and pick the spot that matches what you need.

**My questions for you:**

1. Would this actually be useful, or would you just keep winging it like you do now?
2. Are these vibe tags the right ones, or am I missing something obvious?
3. Would you actually contribute (check in and tag vibes) or just lurk and use other people's data?

Be brutally honest, I'd rather hear ""this is dumb"" now than build it for 6 months and have nobody use it.

I live around Waco so centrally located in the state. My trips are planned with the stops shown in this order but overall trips in no particular order.

I started looking into nad iv therapy because people say it helps with energy, focus, and mental clarity. Before spending money on it, I want to hear from people who actually tried it, not just clinic descriptions.

If you’ve done nad iv therapy, what did you notice after the first session? Did it help with fatigue or brain fog in a real way, or was it subtle? How long did the effects last for you? I’m also curious about the infusion itself. Was it uncomfortable, and did you have any side effects after?

I’m trying to figure out if this is worth trying or if the results are similar to just improving sleep, diet, and stress. Honest experiences would be helpful.",1,1769536057.0,NicotinamideRiboside,1,1.0,False

[$500],"Just dipping my toes into espresso and coffee making in general. From my research, I see a lot of recommendations for the Breville Bambino, more specifically the Plus version for milk drinks (of which I highly prefer) at under $500. I also want a machine with a PID. The speed and aesthetics of the machine aren't important.

At first glance, it seems like the price increase of $200 from the standard to the Plus seems like a big jump for what you're actually getting. I like medium to medium-dark roasts and not light roasts. I already have a Mokkom 64mm grinder that I bought more for big batches of cold brew but may switch to something smaller like DF54  or Encore ESP.

I have no problem buying off-brand machines that give you more bang for the buck in trade for brand recognition. I've been looking at machines like Hibrew H10 Plus and Casabrew Ultra which are less than half the price of the Bambino Plus. If I can get 85% of the performance of the Bambino Plus at half the cost, I'd be down for that. Can anyone show me the way here?",0,1769536026.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

1qokus7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1qokus7/im_opensourcing_my_local_friends_platform_find_a/,I’m open-sourcing my “Local Friends” platform (find a trusted local guide via chat/call/in-person) — Apache 2.0 — contributors welcome,"So… I’ve been working on this project for a while and I finally decided to **open-source it (**[**https://github.com/bultodepapas/local-friends**](https://github.com/bultodepapas/local-friends)  and [https://local-friends.vercel.app](https://local-friends.vercel.app) **)**.

The idea is pretty simple:

When you travel to a new city, instead of relying on fake “Top 10” blogs, ads, or tourist traps… you connect with a **real local person** who actually lives there.

Like:

* “Don’t go there, it’s overpriced”
* “That area is sketchy at night”
* “This is the place locals really eat at”
* “Here’s how you avoid getting scammed”
* “If you need, I can help you over chat / call / even in person”

Not really tours. More like… **having a friend in the city**.

You could use it for:

* quick chat help (30 min, 1 hour, etc.)
* voice/video calls
* meeting in person (optional)
* and the “payment” side can be flexible: tip, coffee, lunch, small fee, whatever makes sense culturally

# Why open source?

Because honestly want this to be something **useful for people**, not just another startup trying to extract money from everyone.

Also being transparent:

A big part of the code (\~90%) was built with the help of **AI agents**, but I’ve been doing the product thinking, architecture, reviewing everything, testing flows, fixing broken logic, etc. The project is real, structured, and working — I just used modern tools to accelerate building it.

By making it open source:

* Anyone can audit the code
* Anyone can improve it
* Anyone can adapt it to their city/community
* We can build something better together

**License**

I released it under **Apache 2.0** because:

* It’s friendly for contributors
* It’s friendly for adoption
* People can build on top of it without legal headaches
* It still protects contributors properly

Basically: use it, fork it, improve it, ship it

# What I’d love help with

If this idea resonates with you, I’d love input on:

* Trust / safety systems
* Reputation and verification
* UX/UI ideas
* Payment or tipping models
* Moderation and reporting
* Mobile/web flows
* Docs (always underrated but super important)

Even just product feedback like:

1qoklwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/1qoklwu/took_me_mass_of_failures_to_realize_satisfying/,Took me mass of failures to realize satisfying character consistency is a completely different problem than making good AI images,"Last year a friend opened a small coffee shop and asked if I could help with her Instagram. She had zero budget and no time to post anything herself. I had been playing around with AI image tools anyway so I figured why not.



We came up with this idea of creating a fictional character to represent the brand. Not her face, not generic stock photos, just a consistent persona that would show up in posts. Like a regular customer at the shop. Someone cozy and approachable that people might start to recognize.



First few weeks felt great. I generated images with a couple different tools and they looked solid individually. Warm lighting, good composition, exactly the vibe we wanted. Posted them and got decent engagement.

Then my friend texted me asking why the character looks different in every post.



I went back and scrolled through the feed. She was right. The face was shifting between posts. Hair color was inconsistent. Sometimes the character looked 25, sometimes closer to 35. I had been so focused on making each image look good on its own that I never noticed how weird it looked when you saw them all together.



Tried a bunch of things to fix it. Super detailed prompts describing every facial feature. Uploading reference images. Saving seeds and reusing them. Some of it helped a little but nothing stuck for more than a few posts before drifting again.



One Saturday I spent like four hours manually editing faces in Photoshop trying to make them match. Fixed one post. Looked at the content calendar for the rest of the month and just felt defeated.



That was when it clicked for me. I had been treating this like an image quality problem when it was actually a character consistency problem. Totally different thing. Most AI tools are built to make one great image at a time. They are not really designed to maintain the same identity across dozens of outputs.



Once I thought about it that way I started looking for different kinds of tools. Ended up with a weird little stack. APOB for locking down the character face and features, Midjourney for certain background styles, Canva for final text and layout. More steps than I wanted but the feed actually looks like one person now.



My friend is happy. I learned something I did not expect to learn. And now I keep noticing this same problem everywhere. Brand accounts with AI mascots that look like a different creature every week. Makes me wonder how many people just gave up on the idea entirely.



Maybe I overcomplicated this whole thing. Would love to hear how others approached it.",1,1769535443.0,content_marketing,2,1.0,False

He never ages, he never changes his outfit, and he’s always staring at me.","After my dad’s funeral, my sister and I went back home to pore over old family photo albums and reminisce. It’d been years since we hauled them out of storage. Their pages were yellowed, their covers coated thickly with dust. This was due in part to the divorce, not wanting to parade memories around our mother, who held fast to her resentment for many years.

She’d softened since his diagnosis, though, expressing her well wishes in the beginning, her sympathies toward the end. When we came back to the house from the cemetery, she fetched the albums from the basement for us, laid them out on the coffee table in the living room. Even hovered at the archway for a few minutes as we began our stroll down memory lane.

Before long, she receded down the hallway, however, leaving her children to their mourning. “Hey, look at this, Jay,” said my sister, pointing at a particularly old photo. It featured all four of us, shortly after we’d moved in, posing in front of the living room window. “I forgot about that nasty green carpet.” She rubbed her feet along the tan replacement. “Everything looks completely different now, huh?”

“Who’s this lookie-loo?” I asked, pointing at a darkly dressed man rubbernecking from the street. He wore jeans and a green bomber jacket, plastic-frame sunglasses and his dark hair short. With his fists stuffed into the pockets of his jacket, he stood alongside the mailbox, peering into the house.

Vicky laughed. “Oh, *weird!* I never noticed that before.” She leaned in for closer inspection. “I don’t recognize him, does he look like one of our neighbors from back then?”

“None I recall.”

A curious find that might otherwise have been shortly forgotten — if not for the fact we seemed to spot him lurking in the background again just a few pages later.

“Hold up,” said Vicky, index fingering the man once more. This time, he stood a few yards behind my father and I posing alongside the shark exhibit at the aquarium downtown. “Is that the same dude?”

We flipped back and forth to compare. Same jacket, same shades, shame ‘do. It even looked like the same pair of lightwash jeans. “That’s crazy,” I said, ignoring the gooseflesh creeping up my forearms.

By his third appearance, we became fixated on his mystery. He showed up in vacation photos from places as farflung as Greece and England, in backyard barbecues, pictures from my college graduation. Always the same outfit, same blank expression, watching us from the background. He never aged, despite the years separating the memories, an unchanging, omnipresent figure.

With a nervous chuckle, Vicky said, “This is kinda freaky, Jay. You think this is, like, some kind of prank?”

“An incredibly elaborate one if that,” I replied. “Who would’ve done something like this?”

We were at a total loss. We discussed sharing our find with Mom, but chose to delay that conversation. Despite the acrimonious divorce, the open wound of their separation that never healed, we sensed her private mourning for her ex. He was the father of her children, the man with whom she’d spent two decades of her life. And perhaps because of the unresolved conflicts between them, she felt his loss especially hard.

Besides, what did we have? A weird coincidence, nothing more. Yet, anyway.

Days later, when I returned to my life in Chicago, I took the photographs with me. I sleuthed to the best of my abilities, conducting reverse images searches, making use of facial recognition software, even reaching out to my father’s old business partners on a lark.

It was this last tack that bore fruit. A retired partner at the consultancy firm where dad worked returned my email, suggesting he might have some materials for me to review. So the following weekend I trekked back to Michigan and paid the old man a visit. He told me about how he and my father attended these conferences together, which I had a vague recollection of from my youth, dad flying off a handful of times each year for business.

After an exchange of friendly pleasantries, he supplied me with a box of old photos, awards, sundry other knickknacks from his lifetime of consultation. I sifted through the collection to find a handful of four by sixes of Dad.

At the sight of him, I felt the warmth of longing and affection, the twinge of absence, soreness like a bruise in my chest. A farrago of emotions quickly routed by disquiet when I came upon the man. Bomber jacket, light wash jeans, dark shades, short-cropped hair. He was sitting at the end of a hotel bar, seven or eight stools down from my father, who was enjoying a cocktail with his coworker.

I set the photo aside, went digging again. Sure enough, the man appeared in no fewer than six images, in the background, looking on like some kind of spy. Except in the final picture. In the last photograph, my father looked about mid-fifties, which would have been about ten years prior. He was on the deck of a boat, out in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight. There were a handful of other middle-aged men aboard, apparently deep-sea fishing, based on their attire and the fishing lines.

Among them stood the man, outfit unchanged, only he wasn’t in the background, but in the fore, shaking my father’s hand.

I brought the man to the attention of the firm’s former partner who merely glanced at each image, flipping between them with indifference. “What am I looking at here?”

“The man,” I said impatiently, “the man in every photo. He’s in the background except—except this one here.” I tapped the picture in which he shook my father’s hand with urgency. “Who is this man?”

His brow furrowed, he gave the image another once over, holding it near to his face, before ultimately giving up. “I don’t know,” he replied. “Doesn’t look familiar.”

“You don’t remember this meeting?” He shook his head. “Don’t you find it odd he’s in all of these pictures?” But no matter how stridently I hammered the point, he seemed incapable of absorbing it. He offered banal explanations, that the man’s style was not uncommon, that he could be many. Or, perhaps in a bid to offend me and thus drive me from his home, suggested it might’ve been my father’s paramour.

“I don’t know who the guy is,” he said with finality. “To be honest, I don’t much care for the past, which is why I keep it in an untouched box. Never spent much time looking back. Frankly, I don’t spend much time looking forward, either. I’m a man of the present, living his life one day at a time.”

We left things at that. I thanked him for his time and drove back home. In the course of that trip, I heard from my sister, who lived in the next town over. She said she would meet me at home. That she had something to show me.

She arrived at dusk, carrying a disc with her into the living room. Without explanation, she fed the disc into the DVD player and pulled up video of our father’s funeral service. After a bit of fastforwarding, she froze the frame. “There!” she said, stabbing a finger at the screen.

Seated in the pews, nonchalant among the others gathered in the church, was The Man.

And in the seat directly in front of him: me.

Chills. Terror. Cold sweat. “What is going on?” I muttered.

I returned to Chicago without answers. Days passed. Weeks. Minutes slid inexorably into hours, the lot of them conveyed swiftly into the graveyard of the past, and the ghosts they left behind contained echoes of a single visage, stonyfaced, middleaged, eyes hidden behind sunglasses. The Man.

One night, after a few drinks with coworkers in Streeterville, I went ambling through twilight, for a moment distracted by the transitional hour. When the beers finally caught up with me, I dashed into an alley to relieve myself. As I washed the backend of a dumpster, a silhouette appeared at the far end of the alley.

I cursed, quickly stuffed myself back into my pants, and when I looked up again, saw him. The Man. Looming over me, maybe six feet tall, maybe sixty. I froze while he raised his left hand to his glasses. He lifted them above his eyes, or what should have been his eyes. Instead, they were only the hollow orbits, shadow pooled in their empty cavities.

“I see you,” he told me. “Do you see me?”

I could only nod in reply.

He smiled. “Good. That’s one time. You’ll see me two more times. And the third time you see me, I’ll give you my eyes.” Here he dipped his fingers into the hollow sockets and laughed, the sound inhuman, fire chewing through kindling.

As he turned to leave the alley, he added, “Have a nice one, kid.”

I’ve yet to see him again. I don’t know his name. I don’t know how he knew my father. I don’t know his intentions, but I fear him now.

most of us don't actually want our ex back. we want the validation back. the comfort. the identity we had when we were with them. but that's completely different from wanting the actual relationship we had. and understanding that difference? game changer.

## the real reasons we want them back (and why they're BS)

**you're just lonely or bored**
if you're thinking about your ex primarily when you're alone on friday nights or scrolling through couples on instagram, that's not love. that's discomfort with being single. huge difference. loneliness makes us romanticize the past and forget why things ended. your brain literally rewrites history to make the relationship seem better than it was. it's called rosy retrospection and it's incredibly common.

**you want to ""win"" the breakup**
this one's subtle but toxic af. if you're motivated by proving you're worthy, showing them what they lost, or getting closure through reunion... you're chasing ego validation, not love. real relationships aren't about winning. they're about partnership. if your primary motivation involves proving something, you're building on a foundation of insecurity.

**you hate change and uncertainty**
humans are wired to prefer familiar pain over unfamiliar potential. we'd rather go back to a mediocre relationship we know than face the uncertainty of being single or finding someone new. this is called the ""certainty trap"" in behavioral psychology. you're not missing them, you're missing predictability.

Check out ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. this book breaks down attachment theory in relationships and explains why some people get stuck in cycles of wanting exes back. it's basically required reading if you keep falling into the same patterns. helped me understand why i kept gravitating toward emotionally unavailable people. legitimately changed how i approach relationships.

## when it actually makes sense to try again

**the core issues that caused the breakup are genuinely resolved**
not ""we'll work on it"", not ""it'll be different this time."" actually resolved. like if you broke up because of long distance and now you live in the same city. or one person wasn't ready for commitment and genuinely did the internal work to change that. vague promises don't count. concrete changes do.

timing matters here. Matthew Hussey talks about this a lot in his work. sometimes people really do need to grow separately before they can be healthy together. but growth has to be real and demonstrable, not just claimed.

**both people have grown independently**
key word: independently. if you've both spent time becoming fuller versions of yourselves apart, you might actually have something new to build. but if either person just waited around or used the breakup as motivation to ""get them back""... that's not growth, that's desperation with a glow up.

real growth looks like: developing new interests, going to therapy, building stronger friendships, becoming comfortable alone, addressing the behaviors that contributed to the breakup.

**the relationship had genuine compatibility, just bad circumstances**
like you were both stressed from external factors (death in family, job loss, mental health crisis) and took it out on each other. or you were too young and immature but the foundation was solid. circumstances can change. fundamental incompatibility doesn't.

Try the app Paired for relationship insights and exercises. even if you're not together, it has great modules on understanding relationship patterns and what healthy partnerships actually look like. helps you get clearer on whether your past relationship had real substance or just intensity.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to help you understand relationship patterns or attachment styles, and it builds a learning plan around your specific situation. 

The voice options are actually addictive, like you can pick a smoky, sarcastic tone or something more calming. It's useful during commutes or workouts when you want to work through these patterns but don't have time to sit and read. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on what resonates with you.

## the questions that tell you everything

**would you want this person if they were a stranger you just met?**
strip away the history, the memories, the time invested. if this exact person with these exact qualities walked up to you at a coffee shop today, would you be interested? or are you only interested because of sunk cost fallacy?

**can you list specific reasons why they're right for you beyond ""i love them""?**
love isn't enough. do your values align? do they treat you with consistent respect? do they support your growth? do they communicate well? can you be fully yourself around them? if you can't articulate concrete reasons beyond feelings, that's a red flag.

**are you willing to accept them exactly as they are right now?**
not their potential. not who they could be if they just changed xyz. exactly who they are today. because betting on potential is a losing game. people only change when they want to, not because you want them to.

## what actually matters

the thing is, most relationships end for good reasons. yeah it hurts, yeah you miss them, yeah there were good times. but good times don't erase fundamental problems. and missing someone doesn't mean being with them is the right choice.

Getting Past Your Breakup by Susan Elliott is weirdly comprehensive for understanding post breakup psychology. covers everything from the neurochemistry of heartbreak to practical steps for moving forward. i expected it to be generic advice but it actually digs into why we get stuck in loops of wanting exes back and how to break those patterns.

the brutal truth? if you're constantly questioning whether you should reach out, if you're looking for signs they want you back, if you're checking their social media obsessively... you probably already know the answer. healthy relationships don't require this much mental gymnastics. they feel right, even when they're hard.

sometimes the kindest thing you can do for yourself is accept that what you had was meaningful AND is over. both things can be true. you can love someone and still choose not to be with them. that's not failure, that's wisdom.

and maybe, just maybe, the energy you're spending trying to revive something dead could be better spent building something new. either with someone else or with yourself. both options are infinitely better than trying to force a relationship that already proved it doesn't work.",1,1769535132.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

You awake in Margareth's spare room and after a nice coffee and breakfast, you set off for the Mega Plateau she was telling you about.

After a short walk away from Cragmere, you finally reach the spot that Margareth told you about. It's a wide plateau, with loads of sparkling pink and purple rocks everywhere. You notice quite a few Pokémon hanging around, all of which are able to Mega Evolve.

You are in awe at the sheer variety of Pokémon around and you approach them, hoping to be able to attract one to join your team.

This encounter is fairly straightforward. PLEASE TELL ME THE TYPE YOU SPECIALIZE ON AND WHO IS ON YOUR TEAM CURRENTLY SO THERE ARE NO DUPES.

I will then randomly select 3 Pokémon THAT HAVE THE TYPE YOU SELECTED WHEN MEGA EVOLVED. This opens up the possibility that you can get a Pokémon that in its base form doesn't have the type you specialize in. HOWEVER, before you start thinking ""Uuuuh coverage"", no. If you use them in battle they HAVE to be Mega Evolved, in order to acquire the type you specialize in.

We play with ZA Rules so you are allowed multiple Mega per battle so no need to worry about it too much, but keep that in mind.

When I was a teen she forced me through various diets, and as soon as I had pocket money I started to buy food when she was not here and eat it outside as quickly as possible so there would be ""no proof"". This made me developp a binge-eating disorder which made my teenage years a hundred times worse.

Then I came out as trans, started to love myself more, and actually started to developp a safe relationship with food.

But then... I moved out of my parents' house. And it made me realize : when I was living with them, I was eating a lot of snacks to compensate for the small meals my parents gave me. So I decided that I would do full big meals instead. But the thing is : in some way, I thought that my mom was right after all, because I was ""eating less"" and was happier.

Then, the big meals became normal meals. And then, a big meal and a smaller one. Then two smaller ones. Right now, I only eat a small/normal meal a day (+ coffee/tea), and it's been that way since the beginning of january. I lost some weight and I'm so happy about it. But I feel weak.

I know it's wrong. I don't want to become frail and weak like my mom. But I can't stop starving. I have been an overweight kid all my life and I finally have the chance to be the thin one.

I’d like some honest design feedback on an indie game concept I’m working on and whether it sounds viable / fun from a game-design perspective. The core idea is a small-scale heist game (probably 1 - 4 players) where players control elderly characters (grannies) breaking into a bank. The tone is intentionally light-hearted and comedic rather than realistic or serious.   
  
High-level concept:  
First-person   
One main bank map for the initial release  
Players sneak around, avoid guards, and steal valuables from the vault and safe deposit boxes   
I intended for the humor to come from contrasts: slow, fragile-looking characters doing crimes  
No guns   
  
Planned mechanics (MVP scope):  
Low to mid poly graphics  
Slightly overactive physics  
Carrying physical loot (gold bars, valuables) that affects movement  
Simple guard AI with patrols, vision cones, and distractions  
Modular bank layout (rooms rearranged each run, same assets)  
Basic roles/skills (e.g. one character better at carrying, another at hacking doors, etc.)  
Grannies can pop a hip and the play would need to tap the space bar really quickly or do something silly like that  
Players could put laxatives into guards' coffees  
  
I'm trying to focus on replayability and “fun moments” rather than realism  
My goal is for the comedy to emerge from systems and player interactions, not one-off jokes.  
  
I’m not looking for validation, just honest opinions before I commit further time.

Since I was a kid I was able to sleep (on weekends) 12-14 hours. After high school I started working at a coffee shop so I was hooked on caffeine drinking 5 shots a day just to get through work and school full time. Even then, I was able to nap during the day and get a “pick me up” coffee or energy drink. 

Soon, I started getting icepick headaches and weird twitches so I decided to cut back on the coffee. 

After I college, I was able to have a normal sleep schedule again and getting at least 8 hours but I was still SO TIRED. I went to my doctor did some tests and everything was normal all the hormones etc. Then I saw a psychiatrist and found out I had severe depression and adhd. So I started taking meds for both and I’ve been on them for like 4 years now. And guess what… I’m still freaking tired and exhausted. 

At the start of my adhd meds I was mixing it w coffee and it was effective and helped me stay awake and alert alllll day but now I can take an adderall, have a cup of coffee and still take a 3 hour nap right after. The only downside w the caffeine and addy is that it makes my anxiety/skin picking disorder so bad!

I’ve tried all kinds of energy supplements; mushrooms, Ashwagandha etc,. Alllll the energy drinks. They work the first two or three times I drink the but my body gets used to it after.  I have a great workout regime and I eat healthy. I even tried sleep aid (bc I do get up a couple times during the night) to help me hit my REM during the night. 

 

I don’t want to go up on my addy bc I don’t wanna be tweaked out. I also understand if my body is tired I need to rest but I can’t get anything done if I’m sleeping my whole day away. Also when I do sleep the whole day, it makes me so depressed bc I feel like I’m just wasting away.

Alex (changed his name) was my best friend for about six years, and he’s been with me through very tough times. We were both raging coke addicts, I was going through financial hardship and was overall very emotionally damaged from past relationships (boyfriends and friends).

We both got clean 2 years ago, and we also started therapy 2 years ago, which did wonders to change and better both our lives. Succeeding at getting clean and also gaining lots of self awareness through therapy made us so much more close to each other. I had never been as open and vulnerable with anyone else in my life. I truly loved him like a brother. On a side note, I also met my boyfriend 8 months ago and he’s the first healthy relationship I’ve had, we are happy and in love.

Fast forward to now: after my dad’s near-death experience (he’s been a cardiac patient for decades), he decided to give my sister and me what you could call an early inheritance. He essentially gave us an apartment to flip and sell, which is how we each ended up with about $90,000 after paying back the renovation costs.

Not long before that, he had also bought me a beautiful apartment in a new development, although construction was taking a long time to finish. My friend was seemed very happy for me and was eager to see my home once it was finished. 

I used part of the money from the flipped property to furnish my new apartment, fix my car, and pay off some debts that I had accumulated during the years of financial instability. After all of that, I had about $40,000 left. This money for me represents financial security in a tough economic climate here in Argentina, where I’m already underpaid and have to dip into savings just to cover my monthly bills.

Alex knows all this. Yet he came to me asking for $10,000 to help his mother avoid bankruptcy and possibly even legal trouble. When I told him I couldn’t help, he didn’t immediately cut me off, but he grew distant (he had slowly been distancing himself after I moved into my new apartment, and also about the same time I met my boyfriend. We used to see each other multiple times a week, but since I moved, he only stepped foot in my home about 4 times in 8 months). He started either turning down my invitations or leaving my messages on read. I asked if we could meet over coffee to talk and he agreed. 

I told him I was hurt he didn’t check in with me after asking for a big favor and said it would be okay if I could or could not help. That I felt he didn’t respect my time every time he was 30 to 90 minutes late to dinner with no good excuse, sometimes even cancelling on me during the agreed meetup time. That I noticed he hadn’t been on time ever in the last year but he did manage to get home on time when he needed a favor for his mother, and he went back to being unavailable as soon as he didn’t get what he needed from me. I made it clear I picked up on that and that it was incredibly hurtful.

He told me he wasn’t a rigid person and didn’t want to relate to people with rules to meet up at a certain time. He told me he was distancing himself from people he considered “posh.” Said he’d been trying to live more authentically and that he saw me as part of that “posh” background because of my family’s wealth, even though he knew I hadn’t always had money myself. He even criticized me for speaking Spanglish (he speaks English too) in a Spanish speaking country, which I do naturally because of my upbringing (my mom’s from California). We ended that conversation with a hug, and I thought maybe he just needed space. But then he disappeared for almost threes months, and I realized he’d just let the friendship go entirely. In the end, when I didn’t give him the money, he had nothing left to lose and just walked away from our friendship. I saw him one last time to go get my stuff at his house, he acted like nothing had happened and that was the last of us. That was 2 months ago. Cried over him this week, I still miss him, even though I finally noticed he had been taking me for granted for a while now. ",1,1769534357.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

The story takes place on the real Cat Street in Tokyo, so we tried to recreate some actual locations in the background art.

Right now I’m thinking about what kinds of mini-games we can implement in Ren’Py to add more interactivity. I’ve been playing a lot of *Yakuza* and *Persona* lately, so we already have prototypes for a calendar system, character stat progression, fishing, and karaoke.

There are already 3 coffee chains here. Starbucks has been building(taking a long time btw) a new facility about 15seconds from a Dunkin donuts. I'm curious what the business thought behind this is about? 

Are they projecting the town is going to be getting bigger? I've read of the 'Starbucks effect' but I'm struggling to wrap my head around why they'd come to a location with not many people or close to a highway. I should add, it's next to a high school so i suppose that's endless revolving door of customers, but that alone cant be enough to keep the business alive (although my partner's excitement about it may be enough LOL)",1,1769534222.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False
1qok0br,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1qok0br/ryze_superfoods_20_off_discount_code_ray20/,RYZE Superfoods 20% Off Discount Code - RAY20,"I’ve been using Ryze Superfoods daily for about six weeks as part of my morning routine, primarily for digestive support and overall energy. I mix the powder into water or a smoothie fairly consistently, and the flavor is mild enough that it doesn’t overpower whatever I’m drinking. The formula blends well without clumping, which makes it easy to use even on busy mornings.  
  
The biggest change I noticed was in digestion and regularity — consistent use seems to help keep things moving and reduce bloating that used to show up by mid-day. I also noticed a modest uptick in baseline energy and focus, especially on days I pair it with coffee, though I can’t say how much is placebo versus real effect. There weren’t any dramatic overnight shifts, but the gradual improvements over time felt meaningful.  
  
Overall, Ryze Superfoods feels like a practical, everyday wellness supplement rather than a quick fix. If your goals are sustained digestive health, steadier energy throughout the day, and something that slots easily into your routine, it’s worth considering. It won’t replace a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, but it adds consistent support with minimal fuss.

Im 27 so im looking for someone preferably close to or around my age. I'm on pc, na (cst timezone) im very lucky to be able to be a stay at home girlfriend, so im always online and available to hangout, play a game, send each other memes, anything really!! If im not playing a game then im just watching youtube/twitch/netflix/hulu, im currently rewatching criminal minds, the walking dead, and the mcu movie timeline (currently on doctor strange) I have anxiety so when it’s bad I go days without talking (currently in therapy, and medicated for it) but otherwise I love to be silly and talk about whatever game or activity im invested in, my friends, a show or movie I watched or about my cats ฅ⁠\^⁠•⁠ﻌ⁠•⁠\^⁠ฅ

I love horror movies and shows so I’d love to watch them together as my bf doesn’t like horror. my favorite horror movie tbh is the conjuring only because it’s sentimental to me which is kinda dumb lol, and my fave show is ghost adventures cause it’s also sentimental and it’s what i grew up watching with my mom (she’s the one that got me into horror) I love coffee, and collecting cups. I love to read (okay more like I buy books that catch my interest so that they can collect dust….. but it *is* my new years resolution to read a book once a month, that being said, dont ask me which one I read this month lol) I like to cook, but it’s more like I like to eat yaknow?? I dont have a favorite music genre because it’s all over the place but I do enjoy metal/emo/screamo whatever you wanna call it more than anything. (⁠ ⁠/⁠\^⁠ω⁠\^⁠)⁠/⁠♪⁠♪ my favorite pokemon is eevee (lets go! eevee on the switch was my first pokemon game) oh, I also collect trinkets and random things that make people go “that’s weird.” I recently started coloring too, and am currently trying to learn how to crochet and embroider cause I think it’s cute (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)

ANYWAYS. I usually game with the same 4 people (my bf and 3 male friends) and I have more male friends than women and im honestly lonely, it’s not fun being the only girl in a group and being the butt of the (same) joke over and over. I’d love to have a girl or two that I can hangout with without fear of getting yelled at, or judged for doing something wrong. I try to ignore the negativity but it’s honestly starting to take it’s toll on me and im finding myself not wanting to play with them anymore (｡•́︿•̀｡) if there’s anything else you’d like to know just ask, im an open book ʕ⁠´⁠•⁠ ⁠ᴥ⁠•̥⁠\`⁠ʔ

I just wanted to share a quick update on where BFB stands and what you can expect in the future.

I want to thank everyone who has been contributing to making the software better over the last 2 months. Your ideas and feedback have been critical to turning this into a solid option so quickly! Since releasing BFB in December, it has truly become a completely different application in such a short amount of time.

I think it's fair to say that BFB is in a very functional and usable state as it stands right now. We've incorporated a wide range of features that cover most of the functionality found in nYNAB, YNAB4, and Actual Budget, plus a whole lot of other features that those don't currently support.

Like many of you, I have a day job 🙂 Which means going forward, most of my development for BFB will be done on the weekends. That doesn't mean new features won't be added, but probably not the same-day releases that many of you are used to. Of course, if anything critical is found, it will be fixed ASAP.

So please continue to think of great things that could be added to BFB, as  u/pgaunt  and I are always saving your feature requests to a list. However.. feature bloat is a real thing, and something I will avoid when necessary. You can expect weekly updates at this point.

I encourage you all to share BFB with others, and of course let them know that they can join free of charge with an option to support by buying me a coffee - [Support BFB](https://buymeacoffee.com/budgetfriendlybudget). ( Shoutout to all the members, you guys literally are the ones who keep it running for everyone )

Hopefully BFB can stay around for years to come, giving manual entry weirdos a solid option!",9,1769534042.0,BudgetFriendlyBudget,0,1.0,False

My client asked me this question:

“Where we can check if this logo not used by others so that when I will register I won’t have a problem with that?”

The logo is a simple symbol (coffee bean + letter “L”). I’m not sure yet about the business name or if it’s available.

1) How do you usually answer this type of question as a designer?

2) What steps do you personally take (if any) to check logo usage or similarity?

3) How do you usually check if a logo or symbol is already in use?

4) Is it normal to find similar ideas on Pinterest or Behance, and when does it become a problem?

I ruminate sometimes about my issues.

 My Dad who expressed regret in not beating me as a kid. 

My Mom, who while provided for me physically like food and shelter, did not do the same with emotional stuff and still neglected me in that way. 

My grandpa who is undiagnosed with several issues such as anger issues, likely autism,adhd,etc. Doesn't help that he is indoctrinated into the Christian faith and ""prays it away."" 

My grandma who is a chronic people pleaser and won't help herself.

My little brother, who is likely undiagnosed with some issues as well but for the moment he seems to be doing okay. 

My older brother, who I used to look up to but unfortunately he isn't  a good role model. 

I've been in a mentla hospital before and it sucked. I was constantly invalidated by the professionals there and I was gaslit about other things. Being told I was BPD instead of autistic. And me being gullible and wanting to believe the best in everyone, I believed them too. 

I followed their treatment plan, took their medication, and suffered for it. I went to a God Damn hospital and came out worse. The irony. 

Now im applying for disability and living with my grandparents, but even without working, I am still stressed. 

I have taken antidepressants, mood disorder meds, and sleeo meds. None of them helped me. 

The only thing I ""take"" is coffee and that's to help my ADHD symptoms. 

I am sensitive. I have done exposure therapy like crazy. It did not help my issues. 

What did help was actively partaking in my subdued autistic traits. Things like stimming. I leg flapping again. I tap my teeth again. 

With my adhd stimulated more through caffiene, I can partake in more routine which is pleasing to my Autism. 

It is upsetting when this routine is changed sporadically and suddenly.

1qojo5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1qojo5f/i_killed_my_subscription_model_last_week_heres/,i killed my subscription model last week. here’s what happened to my tiny design tool,"so i have this little side project called shotframe. it wraps screenshots in device frames. nothing fancy, just something i built for myself and figured others might want too.  
  
at first, i did what everyone else does: free tier with watermarks and low res, then a $19/month sub for the good stuff. result? zero paid users. and reddit wasn’t shy about telling me why. ""why would i rent a screenshot tool?"" was the general vibe.  
  
so i took a deep breath and changed it up. free tier now gives you high res, no watermark. pro is a one-time $12 payment for the power features like brand kits and saving presets. no more subscription.  
  
here’s what happened:  
  
\- traffic spiked because i stopped locking basic stuff behind a paywall.  
  
\- users stopped bailing immediately.  
  
\- i got my first few sales because $12 once feels like buying a coffee, not signing a lease.  
  
the real kicker? unless you’re actually providing ongoing value (like hosting, new content all the time, or ai that costs money to run), subscriptions might be killing your revenue. people are tired of them.  
  
anyone else seeing success with the ""pay once"" model in 2025? feels like the pendulum is swinging back.",1,1769533507.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1. I live 2 hours away from my workplace. I often leave at around 8 in the morning and come back at 10 in the night. This is hybrid though, so I only have to do this for 12 days in a month.

2. I am NOT a morning person. I suffer from insomnia and it takes hours for me to fall asleep and when I get up, I get up around 30 minutes before I have to leave for work. I’ve tried to get up early before, but I just find myself hitting snooze all the time.

3. I had thyroid issues. My thyroid was borderline, and I adjusted my diet and now I’m at a normal, balanced level.

4. I’m VERY lazy. I often find myself procrastinating even the littlest of things, it’s a huge hindrance, and I’m wondering if it’s because of my lack of willpower to do anything about myself.

5. I do not eat properly. I often skip breakfast, substitute it for black coffee and then eat my other two meals. Most of the time, I don’t finish those either because I just don’t feel like eating. I have no issue with eating junk food as unhealthy foods tend to give me headaches, so I usually avoid that. 

6. I have a fear of judgement. I’ve held back on going to a gym because I have a fear of people judging me or talking to me. I want to work out but only in a private area until I feel confident enough to go the gym.

I really want to start losing weight so that I can be the best version of myself. I often find myself feeling insanely regretful about the constant procrastination. I am not unhealthy otherwise, I’ve good stamina, do not get winded easily, and can even walk for over 5 km without breaking a sweat.

However I’ve been overweight almost my entire life and it’s began to make me hate myself and my body. I cannot blame my body, but I do blame myself and that causes me to be demotivated.

I need serious help in trying to lose weight. I know that I can do it, but I’m just having the worst time actually starting. I work out for a week before falling back to my old habits. I sincerely request everyone’s help because I am sick and tired of the way I look and feel. ",3,1769533481.0,WeightLossAdvice,9,1.0,False

I'm converting a 1907 house to retail/office and will be rebuilding the kitchen into commercial kitchen with floor sinks.  It will be a coffee shop/cafe kitchen, so fairly light duty use and only about 200 sf.  I would like to have a black & white small hex tile look to the kitchen floor.  Could you please let me have your thoughts on:

1. Does anyone make an old-timey black & white hex tile looking sheet vinyl?
2. Or would you recommend hex ceramic tile?  With epoxy grout maybe?
3. Am I correct that vinyl tiles (peel & stick, etc) are a no-go for this application?   I'm finding B & W small hex tile pattern in that.

I'm thinking the sheet vinyl will be less expensive, easier on the feet, potentially less slippery if wet, while the ceramic tile will be more expensive, potentially slippery, more repairable, longer lasting, and the vinyl tiles aren't a good idea for water reasons - right or wrong, do you think?

I would hire out the sheet vinyl, but might DIY the ceramic tile (maybe, I've tiled showers, floors, counters before, but was 30 years younger) or the vinyl tile.  I am pulling off the kitchen floor, so can rebuild with the appropriate substrate.  ",1,1769533435.0,Flooring,0,1.0,False

I finally got the Apple Watch version working (as seen in the pic) so you can log drinks from your wrist, and seeing actual people download it has been surreal.

I want to hook you guys up since this community helped me refine the idea.

**The concept is simple:** You don't ""try"" to change. You use **Persona Cards** to adopt a specific high-value identity for 24 hours. It bypasses the ego's resistance because it feels like a ""mission"" rather than a chore.

It needed a finer grind than what they were expecting - the lowest setting on their Ditting grinder (I understand the model they have is for all types of coffee, rather than espresso specifically, and naturally they have other grinders that grind finer.) They said that if I were to upgrade to a nicer portafilter, I'd need an even finer grind.

For the house, they recommended either a DF64 or a Mahlkonig x54. I need something that grinds by time because I need to make it as easy as possible for my partner. The Mahlkonig looks great but is a lot more expensive (over 400€). I'll be in China and HK in a couple of months so keen to take advantage and pick something up cheaper - I can get this WPM for about 160 euro, for example.

What I'm worried about is if the WPM will grind fine enough, as it grinds from espresso to filter, rather than specialised in espresso. I've only seen one review of the WPM as it's not a common machine outside of HK/Australia. Can anyone advise?

Looking for some perspective from frequent BA flyers.

We usually fly Premium Economy, but treated ourselves to Business on a recent night flight that was scheduled to depart at 9:35pm.

The flight ended up delayed by 2 hours due to an electrical fault, eventually leaving around 11:35pm. During the entire delay onboard, the only drink we were offered was the initial champagne on seating – no follow-up offers at all.

Once airborne, I fell asleep around dinner service time, so I accept that missing the meal I pre-ordered is likely on me. That said, in the morning, we weren’t proactively offered coffee, juice, or breakfast either. I noticed several passengers having to ask for drinks, and when I asked for a black coffee it was a very quick “yes, sure” rather than part of a service flow.

One other small thing that stood out: at one point a member of staff knocked/hit himself and muttered “ffs”. Not a huge deal in isolation, but it added to the overall slightly disengaged feel.

None of this was rude or hostile – just felt… very hands-off compared to what I expected in Business, especially versus Premium Economy where we usually find the service quite attentive.

So my question is: Is this fairly standard for BA Business on night flights… Or does this sound like an off day / crew-dependent experience?

Genuinely curious what others think before I chalk it up to bad luck. Cheers",12,1769532850.0,BritishAirways,21,0.7,False

Hello to friends I haven’t met yet 🌍

I’m holding a very small dream: to build a simple prefabricated home on my land in Đak Đoa District, Gia Lai Province, in Vietnam’s Central Highlands — a place still full of wind, sunlight, and quiet peace.

The land is 500m².

I only wish to build a 70m² house, just enough to live and rest. The remaining space will be for a green garden — growing vegetables, planting trees, and letting nature breathe.

This place has:

	•	Endless coffee hills moving with the wind

	•	Wind turbines slowly turning across the open highlands

	•	Bien Ho (Sea Lake), calm like a mirror

	•	Fresh air, deep silence, and nature that remains beautifully untouched

I’m writing these lines hoping to connect with people around the world — those who might share ideas, experience, materials, or simply walk alongside me in this very ordinary green-living project.

✨ In return, when the house is finished, I would love to offer a free 1-month stay experience — a chance to slow down, drink morning coffee, tend the garden, listen to the wind, and feel the rhythm of highland life.

If you see yourself in this small dream, please message me.

I’m building an AI platform for venture capital that automates dealflow, diligence, founder scoring, and investor/startup matching. Alongside that, I’m also working on launching my own VC firm, focused on early-stage tech (AI, software, frontier tech).

Not here to pitch, just genuinely enjoy meeting founders, builders, engineers, investors, or anyone interested in startups/VC. Happy to exchange ideas, talk shop, or just hear what others are working on.

If you’re around today (27th) or tomorrow (28th) and open to meeting up, feel free to comment or DM me.

Coffee or casual chat works ☕️

1qoj0p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Genkorin27/comments/1qoj0p6/the_next_best_author/,The Next Best Author,"The mountain didn’t have a name on maps, but everyone nearby called it the Spine. It rose out of the forest like a broken vertebra, stone ribs jutting through pine and fog. Nothing lived long on its slopes, at least, nothing that stayed human, except one person. Uncle Elric did.

His cabin squatted at the tree line where the forest thinned and the rock began. Smoke curled from the chimney year-round. Traps hung from nails. Claw marks scarred the doorframe, some old enough to be gray with age, others fresh enough to still remember blood.

Down in the towns, his brother told stories about him. The nephew heard them first-hand from his dad, whispering late at night like warnings dressed as entertainment. Those stories that keep you from wandering out late at night as a child. 

“Your uncle lives alone because he has to. Things come down from the mountain. He keeps them away from us.” The father always said it proudly.

In the stories, the monsters had names—half-remembered ones, forbidden to be said. Antlered things that walked on two legs. Shapes that peeled themselves out of shadows. Sometimes voices called from the forest, but nobody had seen them except Uncle Elric. Always, there was Uncle Elric, standing between the forest and the rest of the world.

The boy grew up loving those stories.

He grew up using them.

By the time he was thirty, he’d turned them into books. Bestsellers, according to his publisher. Horror novels with dramatic covers and clever prose. The uncle became a character—bigger, wilder, almost mythic. A lone woodsman battling metaphorical demons. A symbol. A brand. The nephew gave interviews where he smiled and said, “I’ve always been fascinated by folklore.” He still had never visited the mountain, or his uncle.

Elric read one of the books once. Someone left it at the ranger station. He didn’t finish it. When his nephew finally showed up, he arrived clean. City-clean. Expensive boots without mud. A notebook tucked under his arm like a shield. “I need authenticity,” the nephew said, grinning as he stepped out of the truck. “You know. Inspiration.” His uncle looked at him for a long moment. Not at his face—at his hands. Soft. Unscarred.

“You wrote lies about me,” His uncle said.

“They’re stories, you know that better than anyone,” the nephew replied. “And they’re good ones. People love them. I’m—” He hesitated, then smiled wider. “—the next best author, according to some.” That smile sealed it.

“You know what? Stay the night,” Elric said energetically. “See what you’re writing about.”

The forest swallowed the light early. By dusk, the trees pressed close, and the Spine loomed above them like something waiting to exhale. The nephew asked questions as they ate next to the fire—about symbolism, about fear, about whether the monsters were real or just a way of processing isolation. “I mean they’re really just bears and mountain lions, right?”

Elric didn’t answer.

When the first sound came from the mountain, the nephew laughed.

“Great ambiance,” he said, already scribbling. “Do you hear that? It’s like—”

The scream cut him off. High and wrong and close enough to rattle the windows.

The uncle was on his feet instantly, rifle in hand.

“Inside,” he said suddenly.

The creatures came down with the dark. Like they always did. Shapes broke from the tree line. Too many joints. Too many teeth. One crawled sideways, head bent backward so its mouth faced the sky. Another mimicked the nephew’s voice perfectly. “Uncle?” it called. “Uncle, help.”

His nephew was frozen in the window of the cabin now.

He saw his uncle fighting—steel and fire against claws and hunger. The man moved with brutal efficiency, every motion practiced. He killed what he could. He drove the rest back long enough to breathe. But the mountain wanted more. Something hit the cabin wall hard enough to crack the logs. Hands and claws burst through a window. His nephew screamed as they grabbed him, notebook falling open to a blank page. “Wait—wait—UNCLE!” he shouted as he was dragged toward the trees. Elric reached him once. Just once. Their eyes met in the firelight as he pulled hard on his arms, hearing the sound of bones pop.

“I’m sorry nephew!” Elric yelled, losing grip as his nephew was ripped from his hands screaming. Then the dark took the nephew whole, the sound of cracking bones and howls almost drowning out his screams.

Morning came thin and gray. The ranger arrived first, then the police. They asked questions, took notes, stared too long at the claw marks and blood leading into the woods before deciding not to follow them.

“So,” one officer said carefully, “you broke your one rule, did you?” He sat down slowly next to Elric on his porch. Elric nodded, holding the notebook his nephew dropped. 

“Why?” The ranger was looking at him puzzled while handing him a cup of coffee.

“He needed to know the truth. I thought he would learn, maybe then he would write the real story.” He kept his solemn eyes towards the mountains while he sipped the hot coffee.

The ranger shifted uncomfortably. “That's right, your nephew was… a writer, right?”

Uncle Elric and the men looked up at the top of the mountain, where the fog still hadn’t lifted.

1qoizns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qoizns/blocked_on_whatsapp_after_leaving_the_church/,Blocked on WhatsApp after leaving the church,"Hi there,

I need some advice. I had to leave the church I’ve been attending. I’ve known the pastor and his wife since 2021. He married my husband and me in 2022, and we’ve had a great friendship since then. It’s a really small church with only 35 members. 

Back in November, the pastor decided he was unhappy with the younger pastor he had “hired” to help. Not only did he ask her to step down, but he also kicked her and her husband out of the church. One of the other members was upset about his sudden behavior and left as well. I don’t agree with how things were handled; he showed her no grace and didn’t even allow her to remain a member. This has changed how we see him. However, the main reason we left is due to distance and service times that no longer fit our lives since we recently had a baby, and we hadn’t been attending church for months.

We invited them to meet us for coffee to share our news, and we also planned to attend church the following Sunday to say goodbye to everyone, as we love the congregation. However, when we told him, he became very cold and awkward. His wife didn’t even bother to say hello to us, and she blocked me on WhatsApp! When my husband and I messaged him to ask why, he replied that after everything that had happened (referring to the couple and the lady leaving the church), his wife needed space, which is why she blocked me. It seemed like an excuse since I wouldn’t have messaged her about anything.

I wasn’t planning on responding, but now I’m considering replying in a non-confrontational way. This isn’t his church; it’s the Church of Christ, and we’re still part of the body of Christ regardless of where we go next. We left honorably by meeting with him in person and going to church to say goodbye to everyone. We’re not involved in any drama or gossip, so their reaction is schoking.There's a lot of negativity out there being pushed by non-believers, so it's frustrating to see believers causing division in the church over something that small.

1qoizjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qoizjj/im_opensourcing_my_local_friends_platform_find_a/,I’m open-sourcing my “Local Friends” platform (find a trusted local guide via chat/call/in-person) — Apache 2.0 — contributors welcome,"So… I’ve been working on this project for a while and I finally decided to **open-source it (** [**https://github.com/bultodepapas/local-friends**](https://github.com/bultodepapas/local-friends) **)**.

The idea is pretty simple:

When you travel to a new city, instead of relying on fake “Top 10” blogs, ads, or tourist traps… you connect with a **real local person** who actually lives there.

Like:

* “Don’t go there, it’s overpriced”
* “That area is sketchy at night”
* “This is the place locals really eat at”
* “Here’s how you avoid getting scammed”
* “If you need, I can help you over chat / call / even in person”

Not really tours. More like… **having a friend in the city**.

You could use it for:

* quick chat help (30 min, 1 hour, etc.)
* voice/video calls
* meeting in person (optional)
* and the “payment” side can be flexible: tip, coffee, lunch, small fee, whatever makes sense culturally

# Why open source?

Because  honestly want this to be something **useful for people**, not just another startup trying to extract money from everyone.

Also being transparent:

A big part of the code (\~90%) was built with the help of **AI agents**, but I’ve been doing the product thinking, architecture, reviewing everything, testing flows, fixing broken logic, etc. The project is real, structured, and working — I just used modern tools to accelerate building it.

By making it open source:

* Anyone can audit the code
* Anyone can improve it
* Anyone can adapt it to their city/community
* We can build something better together

**License**

I released it under **Apache 2.0** because:

* It’s friendly for contributors
* It’s friendly for adoption
* People can build on top of it without legal headaches
* It still protects contributors properly

Basically: use it, fork it, improve it, ship it

# What I’d love help with

If this idea resonates with you, I’d love input on:

* Trust / safety systems
* Reputation and verification
* UX/UI ideas
* Payment or tipping models
* Moderation and reporting
* Mobile/web flows
* Docs (always underrated but super important)



Even just product feedback like:

>“As a traveler, I’d actually use it if it did X”

>is extremely valuable.

If anyone’s interested, comment and I’ll share the repo + roadmap.

I’m a 23F with minimal allergy history, mainly dust and a few antibiotics. My reactions are usually hives or itching, never anaphylaxis, never airway issues.

Over the past month (Jan 2026), I quit coffee and transitioned to tea. I’ve been drinking spearmint tea daily with no issues and chamomile tea on its own without problems.

Recently, I started drinking Traditional Medicinals “Nighty Night” tea, which contains:

	•	Passionflower herb

	•	Chamomile flower

	•	Catnip herb

	•	Hop strobile

	•	Spearmint

At first, I didn’t notice issues, but the sedative effect was strong, so I started drinking it right before lying down to sleep.

The next day, I developed pain on the left side of my throat, like a swollen tonsil. Swallowing was painful. I suspected reflux since I lay down shortly after drinking it and tried acid reflux meds, but the pain persisted.

Despite this, I drank the tea again for the next two nights (again right before bed). Each night, the throat pain felt worse. On the third night, I woke up around 4am with intense unilateral throat pain and swelling, swallowing water or saliva was very painful.

No fever, no voice changes, no visible rash. Just localized swelling and pain on one side of the throat.

I took Advil, which reduced the pain somewhat but didn’t fully resolve it. Later that day, I took Claritin, and by the next morning the pain and swelling were completely gone.

This makes me think it was histamine-mediated, but I’m confused about what exactly caused it because:

	•	I tolerate spearmint alone

	•	I tolerate chamomile alone

	•	The reaction only happened with this specific blend

	•	It worsened when taken right before lying down

	•	It resolved with antihistamine

I’ve read peppermint and chamomile can cause allergies, but I can’t find much on catnip, hops, or passionflower causing throat reactions, especially localized ones.

My questions:

	1.	Does this sound like an allergy vs local irritation vs reflux-triggered histamine release?

	2.	Can herbal combinations cause reactions even if individual components are tolerated?

	3.	Could timing (drinking right before bed) be the key factor?

	4.	Is it reasonable to avoid this blend but not all teas for now?

I plan to avoid this tea and mint blends entirely for the time being and will consider allergy testing if it happens again, just hoping for insight so I know what to avoid in the meantime.

Turns out he’s bisexual and interested in me.","Hi guys! I (22F) met this guy (23M) through mutual friends, and we quickly became close. He has always been very attentive and sweet toward me!

​As our friendship grew, we started following each other on X (twitter). Out of pure ignorance on my part, I always assumed he was gay... Not because of his mannerisms, but because his feed and posts was exclusively about men, queer media, or his attraction to guys. Since I never saw him express interest in women, I just jumped to that conclusion on my own.

​The other day, we went out for coffee with a mutual friend. I noticed he was being much closer and flirty than usual, but I didn't think much of it because I just thought it was just platonic. Out of nowhere, our friend asked: ""If you had to pick someone from our friend group to marry, who would it be?"" 

He laughed, looked direct at me, and said: ""Oh, definitely \*my name\*, I’d love to go out with her.""

​I was shocked and, thinking he was just joking, I laughed and replied: ""If you weren't gay, I’d definitely go out with you too!""

Silence followed immediately. He laughed awkwardly, and our friend blurted out: ""He's not gay, he's bi!"" He nodded, confirming it to me.

​I was mortified, ashamed oh god💀💀💀 for assuming something about his life without ever asking. He reassured me, saying it wasn't a big deal and that the offer to go out was still on the table. 

Despite that, I feel super awkward interacting with him now :( I’m a straight woman, and my biggest fear is that he thinks I’m prejudiced...I come from a rural area of ​​Brazil and a religious family, and I came to study in the USA, and only now am I educating myself about sexuality and gender. I’ve always thought he was cute, but I just thought I didn't have a chance with him.

​How should I act around him now? And how can I be more understanding and informed about his bisexuality so I don't say something ignorant in the future? ",128,1769532021.0,bisexual,29,0.98,False

It started with the coffee.

Same kitchen. Same morning. I poured hot water over the grounds, watched the steam curl up like it always did, and reached for the fridge.

My hand closed around the handle. I pulled.

Nothing.

Not resistance. Not a stuck seal. My arm moved, the motion happened, but the door didn’t respond. No visual confirmation. Like a screen frozen mid-frame.

Then it caught up.

The fridge door swung open all at once. Milk carton. Light humming. Perfectly normal, like it had never skipped a beat.

I stood there longer than I meant to. Told myself it was sleep deprivation. Or caffeine withdrawal. Or whatever excuse people use when something small feels wrong but not dangerous yet.

I poured the coffee. Drank it anyway.

The bathroom was next.

I brushed my teeth on autopilot, staring at myself without really seeing anything. Foam. Sink. The usual. I leaned forward, spat, reached for the towel...

...and stopped.

In the mirror, I was still spitting.

Not a reflection trick. Not a blur. Just… behind. My towel hovered in midair while the version of me in the glass finished what it was doing. Slow. Careful. Like it didn’t want to rush now that I was paying attention.

Two seconds passed. Maybe less.

Then the reflection straightened and met my eyes.

It looked afraid. Not confused. Afraid. Like it knew it wasn’t supposed to get caught.

I stepped back. The mirror stepped back with me, perfectly in sync again, like it had learned its lesson.

I didn’t finish brushing.

In the hallway, my hands shook as I pulled out my phone. I typed fast, no punctuation, straight into the group chat.

*Something’s wrong with the mirrors.*

The typing indicator appeared immediately.

*We know.*

Same profile picture. Same name.

My number.

I checked the timestamp. The reply was dated tomorrow.

I’m in my car now.

I didn’t pack anything. I just grabbed my keys and left. I’ve been driving for an hour, maybe more, but the streets don’t change. Latency Lane keeps coming back around. Same parked car. Same crooked mailbox. I’ve passed it four times without turning.

Every time I glance at the rearview mirror, I feel it before I see it.

The version of me in the back seat isn’t watching the road.

It’s staring straight through the glass.

At you.

Not in a guilt trip way, but more like genuine curiosity. I did the math on my wife and I’s “treat yourself” coffee purchases and it was kind of wild. $10+ a day over a few years isn’t just a few thousand spent, it’s also the money you didn’t get the chance to compound.

That’s how I ended up building [SpentWorth](https://spentworth.com). You upload bank or credit card CSVs (I didn’t want to do the whole Plaid or bank login thing, and it’s surprisingly expensive to integrate as a developer), it categorizes your spending, and then shows the opportunity cost of purchases based on an investment return assumption with real historical values.

For example, it will take a DoorDash transaction or a Netflix subscription, and show what that same amount could have grown to over 5, 10, or 20 years if it had been invested instead. I have a demo version to walk through all of this.

It’s not meant to shame anyone. Sometimes the convenience is absolutely worth it. For me, it just made certain “invisible” spending stand out so I could tighten up a bit without feeling like I was depriving myself. None of the budgeting apps out there, that I am aware of, directly show you your opportunity cost nor encourage you to change your habits, they only show if you met your budgeting goals.

There’s a free tier that covers the basics, plus an optional roughly $5 per month plan if you want more features.

Site: [https://spentworth.com](https://spentworth.com)

I’d really love feedback from anyone willing to take a quick look:

* Does the opportunity cost framing feel helpful or?
* What would you want to see first after uploading, top merchants, top categories, subscriptions, or something else?
* Do you trust a fixed return assumption like 7 percent, or would you rather choose a benchmark like SPY, VTI, or VOO? You can set your own % by the way.
* How often would you realistically upload CSVs, weekly, monthly, or just occasionally?
* What is the biggest thing that would prevent you from using something like this again?
* What feature would make this feel worth opening regularly?

1qoirby,https://www.reddit.com/r/walking_traveler/comments/1qoirby/things_no_one_tells_you_before_your_first_trip_to/,Things No One Tells You Before Your First Trip to Istanbul,"

This post is for anyone visiting Istanbul for the first time.

Let me start with something important: leave your prejudices at home. Every country and every city has good people and bad ones. Istanbul is no exception. What really matters is being aware of that and doing a bit of homework before you arrive.

Istanbul is an incredible city, and that’s not up for debate. You’ve probably heard the saying, “You leave Istanbul, but Istanbul never leaves you.” It’s true. On my very first visit, I was exactly like most first-time travelers. I jumped into the first taxi I saw, sat down at any restaurant that looked fancy from the outside, and assumed prices were more or less reasonable. Then I started checking my bank account and realized something was clearly off.

Prices aren’t fixed here. Many businesses set their own pricing, and often they’re not even close to each other. At some point, I caught myself postponing meals, thinking, “There has to be a cheaper place than this,” and sometimes I was right.

Everything I’m sharing here comes from personal experience. I’m not claiming these are universal truths. If you disagree or think I missed something, I’m more than open to talking about it.

Before you even land in Istanbul, one decision matters more than most people realize: how you’ll get from the airport to your hotel or Airbnb.

If you’re planning to use public transportation, research it in advance. Know which station is closest to your accommodation and how to get there from the airport. If you don’t, there’s a good chance you’ll meet a yellow taxi driver who really enjoys “showing tourists around Istanbul.”

If you do take a yellow taxi, which I personally don’t recommend, always enter your destination into a map app and ask for the shortest route. And this part is critical: make sure the driver turns on the meter.

In my opinion, the best option is booking a private airport transfer in advance. Do this online before your flight. Not every company is trustworthy, so stick to services recommended by other travelers. These companies track your flight, contact you via WhatsApp after you land, and tell you exactly where to meet them. Your journey starts inside the airport and ends right in front of your accommodation.

Just watch the pricing. Almost all of these services are private and usually offer decent vehicles. That doesn’t mean you should overpay. Also, if you booked your hotel through platforms like Booking, be aware that hotel-arranged transfers are often more expensive than necessary. Booking in advance, independently, usually saves money.

Once you’ve arrived and settled in, food becomes the next challenge.

If your accommodation offers free breakfast, take it. Most of the time, it’s not very different from what you’d pay for outside anyway. When you’re hungry later in the day, don’t make luxury-looking restaurants or hotel restaurants your first choice.

If a menu doesn’t show prices, walk away. This is non-negotiable. When the bill arrives, some people get a mild heart attack, while others convince themselves that this is just “normal for Istanbul.”

In places like Sultanahmet, Taksim, and Beyoğlu, there are plenty of local eateries and small restaurants. You’ll usually see price lists on the windows or outside. These are the places you should aim for. If your goal is to eat well and try food locals actually eat, you won’t be disappointed. Many experienced Istanbul travelers already know this. Sometimes I even see more tourists in these spots than locals, which always makes me smile.

As for coffee and drinks, prices are all over the place. I don’t overthink it. If a place looks nice, I sit down and enjoy it.

When it comes to sightseeing, especially in Istanbul, negative experiences are actually less common than people expect. I’ve never personally had issues with theft or harassment, despite visiting for years. In areas like Sultanahmet and Taksim, you’ll notice there are as many tourists as locals. If you need help, whether it’s directions or advice, local shop owners are usually more than willing to help. Sometimes they’re surprisingly eager to do so.

If you want a logical starting point, begin your exploration in Sultanahmet. Many of Istanbul’s most important landmarks are concentrated there, and you can reach almost everything on foot. Walk from Eminönü to Karaköy over the bridge and take a moment to watch the fishermen. It’s a simple experience, but very Istanbul.

If you prefer guided tours, pay close attention to what you’re actually buying. Most tours follow similar routes. The difference is in the details. Some packages include entrance to places like Topkapi Palace, others only take you around the outside. That matters, because prices can jump dramatically.

For example, a full-day Istanbul tour without entrance tickets might cost around 50 euros. If you want to enter major sites, that price can rise to 400 euros or more. I’ve visited all of them. If you’re not deeply interested, you can skip the interiors. Walking through the gardens, listening to your guide, and soaking in the atmosphere can be more than enough.

One small safety note: avoid wandering into quiet, empty streets late at night, especially in areas you don’t know. It’s just common sense.

For nightlife, Taksim is well-known. Kadıköy on the Asian side is another lively option, easily reached by ferry. Beşiktaş on the European side is also a solid choice.

There’s one more thing I want to share, but I’ll save it for another post: shopping. There’s a place where, if you know how to bargain and recognize quality, you can find almost anything for far less than tourist areas. Clothes, bags, electronics. I’ve had some interesting experiences there.

I usually enjoy exploring Istanbul alone, but every time I visit, I make sure to spend at least one day with local friends. I learn something new every single time.

If you’re visiting Istanbul for the first time, or if you’ve been before and had a different experience, let’s talk in the comments. Sharing real experiences is how we make travel better for everyone.",1,1769531632.0,walking_traveler,0,1.0,False

Log #6. 

Hey guys, this update is short. I’m writing this on my lunch break. 

I managed to talk to Miller. I told him about the hair tug. I’m not always the best at reading people, but I swear I saw pity in his eyes.

He shared another log with me, the one from my first day on board. 

We talked a little more below deck before I read it. It was quiet. The early morning, when everyone was either eating, taking a shit, or already hauling up the first catch of the day. 

We sat across from each other at the table in the kitchen. Steam rose from the cup of coffee in his hands. His legs kept bouncing under the table. 

“I have…a theory. Maybe,” He ran a hand through his auburn hair. “I don’t know. I’m going to pick up a book about it when we dock.” 

“Sounds like you have a specific book in mind.”

“Not a specific book, just anything halfway credible I can find,” He sighed, spinning the cup between his lanky fingers. 

“Are you superstitious?” He asked. 

I pondered the question, watching him

fidget with his cup. “Not usually.” 

He let out a sinking laugh. “Me neither.” 

He took a sip from his coffee, pressing his lips together as he swallowed. “But, you know what Gruner said last night?”

“Hm?”

He set the coffee down and looked at me. 

“He said he feels shit-storm coming.” 

I watched as he stood, leaving his coffee behind.

“And I think I agree with him for once.” 

He went back to the engine room. I finished his coffee. 

Here is his log:

When she was little my husband did mornings and school drop-offs.  At that time, it was very common for me to be working until 3-4am and he wanted me to be able to sleep at least until 8.  I started work at 10am.  (My job I was in the field from 10-3ish daily and then worked from home on the paperwork side of it)

The pandemic came and my job disappeared overnight. 20 years at the same company and then poof.  I fully did everything during the shutdown and zoom school. 

So when life started to get back to normal my husband wanted me to start to do mornings.  I fully refused. My husband never gets home until after dinner and I knew if l didn't put my foot down he would not spend enough time with our children. 

Im sharing this,  because I know the mornings can be trying,  but he has shared how much he loves his morning time.   They have car songs still,  they have routines of getting coffee before tests, etc. 

I look back and I am very proud of sticking my foot down about mornings. The bond he has because of the mornings would have never happened.

Because let me tell you, it's not all TED Talks and venture capital. For me, it started with a crazy idea hatched in my tiny apartment, fueled by way too much coffee and the faint scent of instant ramen. I was convinced my brilliant app, 'Pet Pal Planner' (think scheduling dog walks and cat cuddles with a gamified twist), was going to change the world. Or at least, my bank account.

The first few months were a blur of coding, late nights, and explaining my vision to anyone who'd listen – mostly my bewildered parents. Money was tighter than a drum. I remember living on literally $5 a day sometimes, making tough choices between new server space and, you know, actual food. There were days I stared at my laptop screen, questioning every life decision, wondering if I was just a delusional idiot destined to be a cautionary tale in a future business school lecture.

Then, a tiny flicker of hope. A small feature in a local tech blog. Suddenly, a few hundred new downloads! I felt like I'd just summited Everest. The positive feedback, the 'this is genius!' comments – it was pure adrenaline. For a brief moment, I thought, 'This is it. I'm on my way!'

But of course, the universe had other plans. A major bug crippled the app after a server update, users started dropping faster than my hopes, and a competitor launched with a suspiciously similar, but far more polished, product. I was devastated. I seriously considered throwing in the towel, selling my sad little desk, and getting a 'real' job. The emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship is no joke – one day you're soaring, the next you're staring into the abyss.

What kept me going? Honestly, it was the small community I'd built and a stubborn refusal to let that initial spark die. I patched the bug, completely re-thought my marketing, and focused on a niche feature that the competitor ignored. It wasn't an overnight success story, and I'm still grinding, but Pet Pal Planner is alive, growing steadily, and actually making a profit now. It's a constant uphill battle, but those small victories feel monumental.

So, fellow Redditors, if you've been on this wild entrepreneurship ride, what was *your* biggest 'ups and downs' moment? And what kept you from throwing in the towel?",1,1769531517.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1qoiotq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/1qoiotq/my_fire_story_43f/,My FIRE story - 43F,"I posted this in the CoastFI community a while back, but it's very relevant to this group since I'm a single, childfree woman. My numbers are quite low compared to a lot of other posts I see, so I hope this can inspire someone and show you don't need $2mm in the bank to live this life!

I’ll start with the highlights, then rewind and fill in the details.

Hit CoastFI at 42 and redesigned my life around something I genuinely love. I work less, travel more, volunteer weekly, and I'm living my best life!

**Quick Stats**

* Currently 43, Female
* Single, no kids
* Low to medium cost of living city in the Midwest
* Hit CoastFI in August 2025
* Own several rental properties plus my primary home
* Started my own travel company focused on African safaris and small group safaris that I personally host
* Have received $0 inheritance. I actually bought both my mom and dad homes when their house was foreclosed on and they decided to separate. 
* I have never shared a home or split bills with a partner. Roommates - yes. Also house hacked in NYC for many years (rented out a small room/den to Swedish guests on vacation as random as that sounds!). But everything I've built was 100% ME!

**The Numbers**

* $300k in taxable brokerage
* $325k in traditional 401k
* $15k in Roth IRA (just started last year)
* $40k in HYSA
* \~$550k in real estate equity across 5 doors

My plan is to sell two of the five doors in the next year or two, one of which is my current primary home. That would allow me to cash out roughly $300k of equity. After those sales, the remaining properties should still cash flow around $1k per month, though I’m not currently counting that as income for the sake of this post.

My current cost of living averages about $2,500 per month, which I’ve been tracking closely since August. After selling my primary, I plan to move into one side of my duplex and house hack, which should bring that number down even further.

**Life After CoastFI**

Honestly, it has been amazing!!! I wake up without an alarm. I drink my coffee slowly and check emails and the news. I create new posts and engage with social media content, which is technically my job now, but it doesn’t feel like work. I usually spend a few focused hours on emails, calls with safari clients, and building itineraries. I would say I work about 15-20 hours a week. Hard to tell though because it seriously doesn't feel like work...

I take my dog on long walks. I volunteer weekly at a local food pantry and absolutely love it. I just signed up to walk dogs at the local shelter and plan to foster a pregnant mama dog so she has a safe place to have her puppies.

I’ve also been downsizing intentionally. Selling things on eBay and local Facebook groups has been oddly freeing.

This year I have two extended safari trips planned and will be in Africa for about a month each time. That is something I could never have done in my previous career. I feel absolutely giddy about it!

Financially, my goal is to earn around $35k per year. I also have enough savings to give myself some flexibility, especially heading into 2026.

**My soapbox moment :)**

I want to be clear that for me, creating a niche safari travel company is not just a random CoastFI job. It is a huge passion for me. I’ve been on many African safaris, and for me.... watching someone experience their first safari is one of the best feelings in the whole world!!!

I see a lot of posts here that ask, “I hit my number but now what?” or the infamous 'one more year' syndrome. So I just wanted to post my story and hope it gives someone a fresh look at what is possible. I mean, it's not like a safari company called me and offered me this life. I built it intentionally. CoastFI gave me the space to focus on what I actually love, not just what pays the bills. Should you quit your job and start a niche safari company? Probably not, but whatever the equivalent is to you - definitely DO THAT!!!

I know I'm missing so many details - like the fact that I graduated college with over $120k in debt, and only started saving (and first opened my brokerage account) in 2020. I feel like that would be a whole separate post about how I actually got here. But I'm happy to answer any questions! ",48,1769531484.0,FIREyFemmes,17,0.98,False

**Question:**

_I don’t know where to start from so I’m jsut going to start from the beginning. I have all types of Atopic diseases, asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, conjunctivitis. I’ve always known that I have a dust allergy and my parents believed that my symptoms were caused by chocolate so I grew up not eating any chocolates. Obviously as a child, I ate chocolates from school every once in a while and realised that I only react to a few chocolates but not the others. But I never had an actual problem not eating chocolates, like, not a self control problem. In 11th grade I got an allergy test done and found out that I’m allergic to potato and sunflower oil. Again, not a big problem. Sure, I missed fries and other stuff, but it was manageable. I didn’t feel the urge to cheat a lot. It was a little harder when I joined college, but in a logistical sense, because my food wasn’t made for me, than a discipline problem. 2 years ago, I started falling sick a lot. A lot of allergic symptoms were there and it messed up my mental health BIG TIME but my main problem was allergic conjunctivitis. I kept treating it with steroids till my ophthalmologist pushed me to get a new allergy test done. I didn’t expect anything from it, but EVERYTHING was positive. I’m allergic to wheat, milk, egg yolks, chicken, oats, garlic, onion, tomato, etc. Basically everything but rice and vegetables. That doesn’t sound that bad right? Even I thought so. But turns out everything has atleast one of these ingredients. I basically can’t eat anything unless I make it myself. It’s been a year since I started immunotherapy and avoiding all these things. I was doing pretty well at first. Even if I went out with my friends, I’d just sip a soft drink or something while they ate. It started with small things. A mushroom dish because that was safest. A loophole that I could eat chicken because the antigen I’m allergic to gets destroyed by heat (which we proved). A few cheat meals. And then last month when I went to see my immunologist, I cried and begged her to let me slowly start introducing things. She gave me a green flag for everything except milk, wheat, potato, tomato and onion. Me and my friends went out a few times to celebrate that news. At a point it got too much, and I decided to cut back and avoid everything for atleast the next few months cause my finals are coming up. But this is my last week in college, this Friday we’ll go home for study holidays so we’ve all been meeting up a lot to hang out before we leave. Obviously most of it is food hangout’s because the rest of the time we’re studying. Even when we go to have coffee, it’s at McDonalds, so one day i lost control and order a burger and fries. And after that it just spiraled. Chips and milkshakes and an entire dinner tonight, filled with wheat and onions and potato. I was already feeling guilty for eating the other things because my doctor had only offered me that leniency as a backup, so that I would have options. And here I am eating the very things she asked me not to. I came back home and had kind of a mental breakdown because I was imagining the food getting absorbed in my gut and the antigens attacking me. I tried to puke it out, but I wasn’t able to so I just cried. Anyway, I’m going to go have an antihistamine now, just in case. What I really need is for this to not happen again. I need to build up more self discipline. How do I do this? Can anyone help me out? P. S. none of my allergies are anaphylaxis level, but a big fear of mine is that increased exposure to allergens can increase the severity of your reaction, which is why just eating whatever I want and popping an antihistamine everyday isn’t a viable optionP. P. S I will edit this to make it more coherent in a day or two when I am able to_

**Answer:**

It sounds like you're going through a lot with managing your allergies and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Your situation definitely has lots of layers, both physically and emotionally.

Psychosomatic processing might be an interesting avenue to consider here because sometimes our bodies can respond physically to what’s going on mentally or emotionally. When there’s unresolved stress or emotional conflicts, it might manifest as stronger or new physical symptoms.

Maybe there’s some deeper stress related to food and the social aspects of eating, especially with your history of avoiding certain foods since childhood. It could be about feeling restricted or anxious around food choices or maybe about how your allergies impact social interactions.

Here are a few questions you might reflect on:

1. When did your symptoms first start to intensify? Was there anything significant happening in your life at that time?

2. How do you feel when you're following your dietary restrictions strictly? What emotions come up?

3. Do you notice any patterns with flare-ups happening during specific emotional states or stress?

4. How do you feel about your relationship with food in general? Does it feel more stressful or calm?

5. What do you really want from your experiences with food and social interactions around meals?

I hope this gives you a new way to think about your situation, and I’m here if you have any more questions or just need to talk. Hang in there!",1,1769531480.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False

Obviously as a emetophobe I’m completely freaking out. If it was bad milk will a few sips make you sick? I’m trying not to spiral out of control ,1,1769531479.0,emetophobia,4,1.0,False

Anyone tried anything like this? It was unbelievably floral and fruity. I personally found it delightful. It was maybe even a bit overwhelming.

Before anything else, I’d honestly recommend leaving your prejudices at home. Every country and every city has bad people. Everyone knows that. What really matters is being aware of it and doing a bit of research beforehand.

Istanbul is an incredible city. Nothing changes that. You’ve probably heard the saying, “You leave Istanbul, but Istanbul never leaves you.” It sticks with you. The places, the atmosphere, the memories. It’s a city where you can have genuinely amazing experiences.

When I first visited Istanbul years ago, I was very naive. I got into the first taxi I saw. I walked into restaurants that looked fancy and just ordered food without thinking much. Then you start noticing your bank balance going down faster than expected, and you realize something feels off.

You quickly understand that prices are not fixed. Many businesses have their own pricing policies, and most of them are nowhere near each other. There were times I saw a price and thought, “Maybe I can find this cheaper somewhere else,” and ended up delaying a meal or a service for hours. That part still makes me laugh.

Before going any further, keep this in mind. I’m writing this as someone who visits Istanbul often. I’m not an expert, just a traveler sharing lived experiences. If you think I missed something or got something wrong, I’m open to discussing it.

# Before you arrive in Istanbul

One of the most important things to plan before arriving is how you’ll get from the airport to your hotel or Airbnb.

If you plan to use public transport, research in advance which stop is closest to where you’re staying and how to get from there to your accommodation. If you don’t, there’s a good chance a yellow taxi that really enjoys driving around Istanbul will find you.

If you decide to take a yellow taxi from the airport, which I don’t recommend, make sure you enter your destination in a map app and ask the driver to take the shortest route. Most importantly, ask the driver to turn on the meter. This part matters.

If you choose private airport transfer companies, which in my opinion is the best option, book your transfer online before you even get on the plane. Not every company is reliable, so try to choose ones recommended by people who have actually used them.

These companies usually track your flight using the flight code. Once you land, they contact you on WhatsApp and send you the exact meeting point. Your journey starts inside the airport and ends right in front of your hotel.

The main thing to watch here is price. Almost all of these companies offer private services, and vehicle quality is generally good. That doesn’t mean you should overpay. If you booked your hotel through platforms like Booking, remember that hotel-offered transfers are often more expensive because they act as middlemen. Booking in advance yourself is almost always cheaper.

# Food and restaurants

Once you’re settled, food becomes the next question.

If your accommodation offers free breakfast, take it. Honestly, it’s not very different from what you’ll get outside, and it saves money.

When you’re hungry and looking for lunch or dinner, avoid places that look overly fancy or hotel restaurants. One very important rule: if there are no prices listed on the menu, don’t go in. This is crucial.

When the bill arrives, some people feel a small heart attack, while others think, “I guess this is normal in Istanbul.” It doesn’t have to be.

In areas like Sultanahmet, Taksim, and Beyoglu, there are many local restaurants and workers’ eateries. These places usually have price lists on the window or at the entrance. These are the places you should choose.

If your goal is to eat well and try food locals actually eat, you’ll be fine. The food is good and filling. Experienced Istanbul travelers already know this. Sometimes I even see more tourists in these places than locals.

As for coffee and drinks, prices vary so much that I don’t overthink it. If I like a place, I sit and order. Simple as that.

# Sightseeing and safety

When it comes to sightseeing, especially in Istanbul, it’s very unlikely you’ll face aggressive or dangerous behavior in tourist areas. No one is actively trying to steal your wallet or harm you. At least, I never experienced anything like that despite visiting for years.

In places like Sultanahmet and Taksim, remember that there are as many tourists as locals. If you need help, whether it’s directions or recommendations, local shop owners are usually very willing to help. Sometimes more than you expect.

If you want to explore Istanbul properly, I recommend starting in Sultanahmet. Many of the must-see places are there, and you can walk almost everywhere. Don’t forget to walk from Eminonu to Karakoy over the bridge and watch the local fishermen. That walk alone feels very Istanbul.

If you prefer guided tours, pay attention to value for money. Most tour companies follow the same routes and visit the same places. Lunch and transportation are usually included.

What really matters is what’s actually included. Some tours let you enter places like Topkapi Palace or Beylerbeyi Palace, while others only walk around them. Also, make sure your guide actually knows what they’re talking about.

Entering these sites increases the price dramatically. For example, a full-day Istanbul tour covering places like Topkapi Palace, Sultanahmet, and Hagia Sophia might cost around 50 euros without entrance tickets. If you want to enter and visit the rooms, the price can go up to 400 euros or more.

I’ve visited all of these places. If you’re not deeply interested, you can skip entering. Walking through the gardens, listening to the guide, and enjoying the atmosphere is often more than enough. You’ll still get great views and photos.

# Nightlife and getting around

I wouldn’t recommend wandering into quiet streets far from tourist areas. This is just a basic safety precaution.

If you’re looking for nightlife, Taksim is known for its busy nights. You can also take a ferry to the Asian side. Kadikoy Square is very lively at night as well. On the European side, Besiktas is another good option.

# Shopping 

I know a place where you can buy clothes, electronics, and many other things much cheaper than in tourist areas. If you’re good at bargaining and know how to judge quality, you can find almost anything there for a fraction of the price.

I’ll share my experiences about that place in another post.

I usually enjoy exploring Istanbul alone, but every time I visit, I make sure to spend at least one day with Turkish friends who live there. Thanks to them, I learn new things every single time.

Let’s share our experiences and help first-time visitors have a better time in Istanbul.

Ultimate goal is that we become close enough to travel together but that may take time. Just want friends to try new things with or new destinations, to really be irl friends and build meaningful, quality connections. Friends who can support each other as we kick-ass in our careers.

We can have coffee, jogging, go on hikes, try different sports, travel when schedules allow, or simply enjoy good conversations. Activities will be around pasay, makati, bgc, manda maybe.

1qoilo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1qoilo3/i_built_a_simple_tool_that_shows_what_your/,I built a simple tool that shows what your spending could be worth if you invested it instead,"I constantly wondered to myself: what would this money look like if I hadn’t spent it? Not in a guilt trip way, but more like genuine curiosity. I did the math on my wife and I’s “treat yourself” coffee purchases and it was kind of wild. $10+ a day over a few years isn’t just a few thousand spent, it’s also the money you didn’t get the chance to compound.  

That’s how I ended up building [SpentWorth](https://spentworth.com). You upload bank or credit card CSVs (I didn’t want to do the whole Plaid or bank login thing, and it’s surprisingly expensive to integrate as a developer), it categorizes your spending, and then shows the opportunity cost of purchases based on an investment return assumption with real historical values.  

For example, it will take a DoorDash transaction or a Netflix subscription, and show what that same amount could have grown to over 5, 10, or 20 years if it had been invested instead. I have a demo version to walk through all of this.  

It’s not meant to shame anyone. Sometimes the convenience is absolutely worth it. For me, it just made certain “invisible” spending stand out so I could tighten up a bit without feeling like I was depriving myself. None of the budgeting apps out there, that I am aware of, directly show you your opportunity cost nor encourage you to change your habits, they only show if you met your budgeting goals.  

There’s a free tier that covers the basics, plus an optional roughly $5 per month plan if you want more features.  

Site: [https://spentworth.com](https://spentworth.com)    
  
I’d really love feedback from anyone willing to take a quick look:

* Does the opportunity cost framing feel helpful or?
* What would you want to see first after uploading, top merchants, top categories, subscriptions, or something else?
* Do you trust a fixed return assumption like 7 percent, or would you rather choose a benchmark like SPY, VTI, or VOO? You can set your own % by the way.
* How often would you realistically upload CSVs, weekly, monthly, or just occasionally?
* What is the biggest thing that would prevent you from using something like this again?
* What feature would make this feel worth opening regularly?
