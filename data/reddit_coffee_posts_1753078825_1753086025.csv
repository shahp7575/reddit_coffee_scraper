I'm considering starting the Réseaux & Télécom bachelor at **HE2B ESI** and was wondering if anyone here has studied there or knows someone who did.

Would love to hear your thoughts about the school, the program, the general vibe, and any useful tips to survive the first year (or at least fake it convincingly). 😅

Thanks a lot in advance — and if your advice comes with coffee recommendations nearby, I’m all ears ☕",1,1753085931.0,brussels,0,1.0,False
1m5d8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5d8pu/i_am_a_painter_and_im_not_alone_in_this_house/,I am a painter and I’m not alone in this house,"As the title says, I am a Painter. Not the fancy kind like Picasso or Van Gogh, I’m a house painter. It’s a pretty fun job if you like painting walls white all the time but I make it my mission to work on older buildings that actually have unique features and that want special attention.

That gets us to the phone call I had last week, nothing out of the ordinary, just someone calling me to come paint a few rooms in their 18th century home. The man who called spoke quietly and frantically almost like he didn’t want someone else to hear, or maybe they were just in a rush, you’d be surprised at how many people need things painted a day before a big event. I went there one afternoon to have a look at the job, it was a far ways from the city, out in the country, tall gum-trees surround this gigantic mansion which looked straight from a history book. I wanted to stare at it longer but I couldn’t while a strong Oder of death was lingering on my nose “jeez, what’s dead around here, let’s just get this quote over with” I walked up to the door, if you could call it that. This door was made from a beautiful dark red wood that was so large even a castle would be jealous of its size yet even then my eyes were drawn to the knocker. Dark iron with a bulls head and the handle of the knocker going through its nose.. I knocked 3 times.. the sound echoing through my ears like thunder struck right in-front of me.

The man who greeted me at the door answered almost instantly like he was waiting for me. He looked... disheveled, not his clothes, his clothes were clearly old but well kept, almost like he was hoping his green vest and red evening gown would distract me from his knotted grey balding hair or his teeth which are far and few between and what I can only make out to be gold and lead fillings practically replacing each one. He was old, so old that if he wasn’t from the same century as his home he definitely would not be from this one. While staring at me with piercing amber almost yellow eyes he spoke, sporadically but not without thought “Ah... you must be the painter, you said noon and here you are bang on time! My name is John Winslow or At least that’s what it says in my office! AHA HA.. OH The house! You must see what the job is, don’t be alarmed... the whole house isn’t changing... just a few rooms...""

After knocking on the door, I was still a bit on edge and the way he spoke just freaked me out. “That’s all good Mr Winslow, let’s go see those rooms you need painted.” I said, trying to brush the unease off of me. As we stepped inside I was taken back by the architecture of this building. So much old, engraved, red wood through the house. All the floorboards so shiny you could use them as a mirror. This house looks and feels so lively. I had to ask, “What an amazing house. Do you live with anyone else or is it just you?” Silence... He eventually replied uneasily “I’m the only one who walks these halls.” Weird, but okay. 

He showed me 3 rooms, a large dining hall, the kitchen and the basement. The other rooms he wanted me to just freshen up what was already there, but the basement required specific instructions... He told me, “The basement MUST be painted last... I will leave a tin of paint down here for you to use when it’s time. I would appreciate it if you didn’t come down here until you must.” It’s the first time he has spoken to me with such stern words. I replied, “Of course John, I can do that.” Winslow continued, “Good, now there is only one more matter to attend to. I will be away when you come to paint this house and the drive is quite long and out of the way. Please stay here for the few nights you work, so I know my house is safe. It also saves you the drive each day."" 

Although he is an odd man and the house is a bit unsettling, it’s an hour and a half drive without traffic and doing that every day does sound annoying. I quoted this job quite high as I don’t really want to do it, so might as well make it worth the money. Knowing I’ll be getting so much for the job, saving money on fuel at the same time sounds like a good idea. “Thank you so much for the offer John, I’d happily stay here to look after and repaint your house.” I really hoped I would not regret that.

The weekend I would spend painting at the Winslow manor was finally here. As I drove up to the mansion I was still gobsmacked by its sheer size. Why would someone live here by themselves? He had to have cleaners to help or something. As I got out of my car, the smell of death was just as strong as the other week. Maybe a dead bird? But why would no one clean it up? Whatever.

Thunder resounded as I used the door knocker to alert Winslow of my presence. Winslow still answered the door as if he had been waiting for those 3 knocks. “AH James my boy, it’s so excellent to see you, please come in.” He sounded very excited this time which was a good change. “Glad to be here John. Will you be here all of today and head out tomorrow?” I asked. “NO, no not at all. I just needed to tell you some last minute information before I left is all. Your bedroom is just down this hallway, DO NOT go upstairs no matter the reason. And don’t forget you must paint the basement last and not go inside until it’s time. Is that all good!?” 

I was a bit nervous about that but nevertheless agreed. “Sounds good to me John, I’ll get my stuff in and start painting."" As I grabbed my things, I was just beginnig to shake the unease when he spoke. “Well, I’m off! Have an excellent stay, don’t go upstairs. I’m serious. BYE”. The moment that door shut the house became quiet. So quiet it was impossible not to listen. Even in this large house I’m confident I would hear a pin drop from any room. I had to distract myself, so I started painting.

The first day went pretty well. Nothing much to talk about. However, at one point I had to grab something from my car. I walked out of the dining hall, turned right,  walked to the end of the hallway, turn left, entered the main entrance and walked outside. I grabbed my ladder and walked back in. I go to the left of the main entrance, the second door on the right, go down the hallway. On the left is the door to the dining hall, I open it. Wait, I’m positive this is how you get to the dining hall. But I’m standing in the doorway looking into a small white room. This room doesn’t even look like it’s from the 18th century. It’s clearly a modern room, no woodwork, just white with a painting of the manor on the back wall. I retraced my steps back to the entrance and try again. Okay that’s right. I open the door, dining hall. That’s weird, maybe I got lost? I thought I took the same directions. It’s a big house I guess. I tried my best to rationalise it and get back to work. Besides that one moment, the day was fine. I wish I could say the same about that night.

First off, the shower was loud. The moment I turned on the hot water the pipes rattled through the entire house. It was so loud I shut it off and tried to slowly turn it back on. The noise stayed until it was hot. I had no problems in the kitchen making my food, but I had an uncomfortable feeling I was being watched. Nothing was around, this house is so quiet it would be impossible for someone to sneak around, right? Well, that leads me to when I was sleeping. I was impressed at how well I got to sleep that’s for sure, but then I woke up to a thud... a thud from upstairs that was followed by light footsteps. My body froze. Mind racing. What the hell is in this house? The footsteps slowly made their way to the top of the staircase... then they stopped. 

My bedroom is close to the main entrance so I knew that’s where they were. I was told upstairs was off limits. Is someone still living here? Nevertheless, I didn’t want to make a sound. The steps started again, walking away from the stairs and right above where I was sleeping... I knew it, the steps were still light, almost as if they were tip toeing around hoping they could be quiet. But sadly for them this house is so void of sound that their attempt sounded like a march. I shut my eyes, pulled the blanket over my head, and prayed I’d go to sleep soon.

Yesterday started earlier then I would have wanted. After the footsteps I didn’t sleep a wink. I was frozen in bed from midnight till sunrise and didn’t hear a single footstep after it was right above me. I got out of bed, made some noise. Still no movement. Maybe I was going crazy, or maybe an animal got in the house and my scared mind just imagined the human element. I hoped that was it. I started my day by walking down to the bottom of the staircase, slowly peaking up, and just for good measure yelling not so loudly, “He.. hello! Anyone home?” Praying I didn’t hear a reply. Thankfully, silence. At least I think silence is better. Today I’m not going to mess about, I need to finish this job as soon as possible. Time to crank the music and get started! “What the hell.” I muttered as I realised all the walls I painted yesterday were still soaking wet, like I painted them just a moment ago. That’s impossible. It wasn’t cold last night and this place has a terrible draft coming through. So we have temperature and airflow. How in the world is it still wet. The only thing left to do while the walls are wet is paint the basement. But Winslow's warning interrupts that idea...

I made my way to the dining hall, left from the entrance second door to the right, down the hall to the left. Made it. The dining hall is a room with no windows but has a lot of lights hanging from the ceiling, so I turn them on. A lightning bolt of adrenaline ran up my spine as I clearly hear the opposing door in the dining hall shut... I didn’t see anything. It didn’t look like it moved, but I heard it. I’m not crazy. That’s it, I’m going outside far away from that room and calling John. 

I call him and he doesn’t answer. I call him again. On the 4th ring he finally picks up. “Ah, hello my dear boy. Is everything going okay? I can’t wait to see the house with a fresh coat of paint! How was your stay last night?” I ignored his greeting. “Is there anyone else in the house? I heard someone last night and I think I heard something today as well.” He chuckled, “Aha, you have nothing to fear. I mishear things all the time there. Those old floorboards still have plenty of settling to do! Don’t be alarmed if you hear it. That house has plenty of quirks.”
“I see, maybe I miss heard, I’m sorry, such a big house, it’s easy for the mind to wonder. Oh and it might take a bit longer to finish the job, the walls aren’t drying as fast as I thought they would.” I replied. I was hoping that meant John would be back home by the time I finished. Maybe that would make the creepy stuff settle down. Why did he have to say, “Oh well, that’s a coincidence. I'll be away for a few more days. The house will be all yours so take as much time as you need.”
Great, so I guess I’m by myself. The rest of the day went okay, I guess.

The walls dried so I could get stuck into working but I had the feeling I was being watched again. After finishing the dining hall, I went to leave but heard the back door that got closed earlier, open back up... I slowly turned around, horrified of what I’d see. Nothing. 
I ran. Keeping my eyes on the open door, I sprinted away, running into a coffee table that wasn't there a second ago. “Ouch what the hell?” As my attention is brought to the object that just obiterated my shin, I realised I’m suddenly in the modern white room I found yesterday. How was I here? I didn't run very far before colliding with the table. I should've only reached the hallway in that time...

The white room now consists of a painting of the manor and a coffee table. I look behind me, the other door is shut again. Like it never opened. Maybe that means it's safe. I walk out of the white room and back into the dining hall. After turning around I realise the white room is gone, all I see is the hallway. Although I'm petrified, I need to know. I walk to the other side of the dining hall. as I get closer to the door. My head starts pulsing, tunnel vision sets in. My body knows this is a terrible idea, but I push forward. I reach the door, my whole body on edge ready for the door to open on its own once more. I grab the handle and try to slightly wiggle it. 

The handle has no free play, as if someone or something has a firm grasp on the other side... I press the side of my head against the door, my ear perched beside the vanished timber. I know breathing when I hear it... I muster all my strength and courage. I force myself to open that door. I can't see straight, I'm lightheaded, I push forward. As I reinforce my hold of the golden engraved doorknob, I feel my body trying to recoil. as I take a deep breath, I force my hand to open the door. It won't budge, whatever is on the other side is keeping this door shut. to have such a strong grasp that I can't even make the handle rattle. I ran outside shutting every door in between myself and that thing and finally reaching the open air as I shut the giant front door.

As I caught my breath, I made sure to never remove my gaze of that behemoth of a door. But as much as I tried, I got a stark reminded of the first warning this house gave me. The smell of death. That thick smog of Oder grew stronger making my stomach churn and my throat gag. I can't stay here any longer. I hopped in my Ute, turned it over, threw it in gear and went to make some tracks. It's not moving, it feels as if I was trying to tow something too heavy for the car to move. ""God damn it!"" I said as I shake with fear, just wishing I was home, wishing this was all a dream. I get out of the car ""What the hell, what is happening!"". 

The roots of a nearby gum-tree had intertwined with the spokes of my rear wheel. thick roots, for that to happen in reality it would take years, decades even, but here before my eyes, I bear witness to a miracle or in my current situation, a curse. Naturally I tried my phone ""no signal? I had it this morning!' I expelled. I started weighing up my options. I can't drive anywhere, can't get help, I'm at least over a day's walk from any civilization and I didn't see any other cars on this road or any other driveways anywhere near here. I'm screwed.

I hate to admit it but the smell outside was harder to stomach then sitting in the bedroom I currently call home. As much as I don't want to go inside, this stench has made me far more lightheaded than my fear. I went back inside sprinting straight to the bedroom locking myself in. One my door was shut the house was quiet. Then the steps started. Started right above my head, walking right above where ever I moved in my room. I stood still with fear, the foot steps stopped also. I walked over to make sure the door was definitely locked, the footsteps followed. I sat back on my bed, unsure what to do. The footsteps followed. I heard a loud bang, followed by rapid footsteps. It was running, sprinting down the stairs and into the hallway that my room attaches to.

I sit here typing out what has happened in the last week. As a shadow sits on the other side of my door. Thinking about it now, that front door was wide open when I ran back inside..",1,1753085871.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Not from the area, was out the night before but was conservative with drinking. I had already sobered up considering I was just at a cafe for a coffee and pastry for a few hours as the sun rose.  

Anyway, everybody is busy — whatever so i make my way to the back, where i’m used to seeing the fridges with all the drinks. I pass the ones in front of the deli (which I’m used to doing because i know usually there’s a few fridges towards the front and more in the back. So im like cool lemme grab my drink and then go order when the dude ordering now  done . Theres a table of children there. Now( it’s not some hidden or non-visible area. You can clearly see from where the deli is, it’s literally right next to it. And nothing is blocking the view there. Right so anyway, no fridges on the right, one directly behind one of the girls and theres another space on the left side like the right (a little square that extends maybe 3-5 feet further back)

I just say “good morning gals!” in passing looking for the other fridge. 
 I was taken aback when basically the entire store comes at me. A middle aged woman (assuming the mom?) comes up at me pressing me as to why im here. In that type of tone where the accusation is clear but unspoken. The deli guys come behind her repeating yer question as im just trying to explain I was looking for the fridges. And they’re all treating me like i was trying to go creep at the kids?? Talking dirty to me, scoffing me off, speaking their language and eyes dart to me. And im like bro wth i didnt even do anything wrong? I didnt stay back there didn’t linger didnt even say anything beyond good morning IN PASSING.

These dropped again tonight. After both GM’s suggested I get prio on this item after this initial fiasco, it gets rolled off tonight. I feel really dumb for not gquitting after this happened initially, though I did finally quit shortly after tonight. 

Some notes:

-Messages were sent back and forth to both GM’s when this happened initially about a month ago, though the only one who got on comms with me to work out how to resolve what had happened previously was an officer and main tank of my guild. My own GM commented more on the original post than he communicated with me on potential resolutions 

-Agreed on getting prio for boots next time they drop 

-GM hasn’t said a word to me till today, 5 minutes before raid, asking if I still want the boots bc I soft rezzed a staff (which was the deal to begin with, that I wouldn’t have to waste S.R. on boots)

-I tell him I still have the same boots as before (wolfrunner) and do indeed really want them (why would I not want them all of a sudden?)

-I offer that he can roll them off if he thinks it would ruffle too many feathers since it seems that’s what he is fishing for 

-bites immediately and whispers “thanks for being level headed. I don’t know how or when, but I’ll pay you back somehow!” 

-boots drop

-multiple gz whispers from guildies who know what happened previously 

-boots get rolled off

-i lose 

-GM sends me a super cute and uplifting messsge saying “don’t worry, we’ll get you them next time!”

Deja Vu!

I would have been fine with the GM not doing any of the real talking and problem solving after the initial mishandling of loot and having an officer do it, would have been fine letting it go tonight and letting the roll happen, but honestly the bullshit ass “we’ll get em for you next time” after i just lost the roll on something i should already have just really pushed me over the edge. Like, just so clearly disingenuous and full of shit, not to mention tone deaf as fuck. I didn’t bother saying shit about it at all, simply left after loot was over. It’s a shame because there are some really great people in the guild, but leadership has absolutely 0 integrity and would much rather take the easy way out than do right by people. Would def hard avoid for any endgame aspirations if you’re on Doomhowl.

# Introduction

Welcome to the ultimate comparison of Food Trailers vs. Cargo Trailer Kitchens, designed for entrepreneurs exploring [**Mobile Kitchen Trailers**](https://www.kinematrailerdepot.com/all-inventory/mobile-kitchen/). Whether you're launching a mobile café, gourmet food operation, or catering service, this guide will help you determine which mobile kitchen setup best suits your business.

# What Defines a Food Trailer?

A Food Trailer—also known as a concession trailer—is a towable unit equipped with a fully functional kitchen. It's hitched to a vehicle, towed to a location, and parked for service. These units come in a range of sizes and can accommodate everything from simple snack stands to full-scale commercial kitchens.

# Key Features:

* Available in various sizes and dimensions.
* Offers space for large cooking equipment and accommodates multiple staff members.
* Ideal for semi-permanent events, such as festivals, weddings, and pop-up kitchens.

# What is a Cargo Trailer Kitchen?

A Cargo Trailer Kitchen is a custom-built mobile kitchen created inside an enclosed cargo trailer. It functions similarly to a food trailer but is often more customizable. This option is widely used in specialized situations, such as at construction sites, for disaster relief, or as temporary kitchens at remote locations.

While often used interchangeably with Food Trailers, Cargo Trailer Kitchens for sales may refer more specifically to trailers converted for commercial kitchen use.

# What is a Food Truck (for Context)?

A Food Truck is a self-contained vehicle with an onboard kitchen, capable of driving from location to location without requiring a separate towing vehicle. These are especially popular in urban environments, allowing vendors to move and serve with ease.

# Advantages:

* Doesn't require a separate towing vehicle.
* More straightforward setup and repositioning.
* Faster service in high-traffic areas.

# Drawbacks:

* Higher initial and maintenance costs.
* Limited interior space due to built-in driving components.
* A breakdown halts both travel and service operations.

# Comparing Food Trailers and Food Trucks

Instead of a table, here's a breakdown of how Food Trailers (including Cargo Trailer Kitchens) compare to Food Trucks:

# Startup Cost

**Food Trailers** are typically more affordable to start with, often ranging between $6,000 and $50,000, excluding the tow vehicle. Food Trucks can cost between $50,000 and $200,000, depending on the level of customization.

# Mobility

**Food Trucks** have the edge in mobility since they don't require towing. Food Trailers, while mobile, need a compatible towing vehicle.

# Kitchen Space

**Food Trailers** and Cargo Trailer Kitchens often provide more room for cooking equipment, storage, and staff. Food Trucks are more compact due to vehicle constraints.

# Customization

Trailers offer flexible layouts tailored to your needs. Trucks are limited by their built-in structure.

# Maintenance

Food Trailers typically require less maintenance since they don't have an engine. If the towing vehicle breaks down, the trailer can still operate. With Food Trucks, any engine issue means your entire business is temporarily shut down.

# Insurance and Permits

Food Trailers require separate insurance for the trailer and towing vehicle. Food Trucks only need a single insurance policy and one set of permits.

# Pros and Cons: Food Trailers (Cargo Trailer Kitchens)

# Advantages:

* **Lower startup cost** – More budget-friendly than food trucks.
* **Spacious interiors** – Easier to house commercial-grade equipment.
* **Flexible use of vehicles** – The trailer can stay on-site while the car is used elsewhere.
* **Easier to repair and maintain** – No engine to worry about.

# Disadvantages:

* **Requires a towing vehicle** – This adds to startup and logistics costs.
* **More challenging maneuverability** – Difficult to navigate tight spaces.
* **Separate paperwork and insurance** – Both trailer and vehicle must be registered and insured.

# Pros and Cons: Food Trucks

# Advantages:

* **Greater mobility** – Move quickly and easily between locations.
* **Simplified operations** – One unit to ensure and register.
* **Quick setup** – Park and serve without detaching anything.

# Disadvantages:

* **Higher investment** – Costlier than trailers.
* **Less interior space** – Smaller cooking areas.
* **Single point of failure** – If the vehicle breaks, the kitchen shuts down too.

# Choosing Based on Your Goals

# Static or Semi-Permanent Locations

If you're operating at festivals, events, or a consistent venue, Food Trailers or Cargo Trailer **Kitchens** offer more space and a better return on investment.

# Urban Mobility & Flexibility

Choose a Food Truck if your business model relies on frequent movement or quick setup in various locations.

# Budget Focus

If you're budget-conscious, Food Trailers are significantly more affordable, allowing you to invest more in equipment and ingredients.

# Menu Complexity

For diverse or complex menus requiring commercial kitchen space, Cargo Trailer Kitchens are ideal. They can be custom-built to fit your needs.

# Real-Life Success Story

A young entrepreneur launched a mobile coffee business by converting an old horse trailer for under $10,000. She began profiting within a month and now earns consistently with minimal overhead and flexible hours. Her story illustrates how Cargo Trailer Kitchens can be a cost-effective path to achieving success in the food business.

# Conclusion

Both Food Trailers (Cargo Trailer Kitchens) and Food Trucks offer unique advantages for entrepreneurs entering the world of Mobile Kitchen Trailers.

* **Choose a Food Trailer** if you value space, cost-efficiency, and a more permanent location.
* **Choose a Food Truck** if you prioritize mobility, fast setup, and urban reach.

The best choice depends on your budget, menu, operating environment, and business strategy.

1m5d3xv,https://i.redd.it/kf3t139uq6ef1.png,Blood Pressure Myths Debunked - What You Need to Know,"In today’s post, we’re debunking common **blood pressure myths** and setting the record straight. By busting misconceptions and sharing NHS‑supported advice, our goal is to clear confusion, build trust, and support your journey to better health — whether you choose GP care, pharmacy services, or our same‑day blood pressure checks.

# Myth 1: “You can feel when your blood pressure is high”

This is one of the most common **blood pressure myths**. In reality, hypertension is often known as the **“silent killer”**, because most people won’t feel any symptoms[2](https://getvipcare.com/blog/5-blood-pressure-myths-debunked/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Headaches, dizziness, or nosebleeds generally don’t appear until blood pressure is dangerously high.

**Tip:** Regular checks are vital — especially if you’re over 40, have a family history of hypertension, or live with lifestyle risk factors. You can get a same-day, affordable blood pressure test at **Imaan Healthcare pharmacies**, without needing a GP appointment.

# Myth 2: “Normal blood pressure is always 130/80 mmHg”

Blood pressure varies by age, time of day, and wellbeing. The NHS considers normal adult blood pressure to be between **100/70 and 135/85 mmHg** Readings depend on circumstances:

* Under 30 yrs: 120/70–130/80 mmHg
* Ages 30–70: 130/80–140/90 mmHg
* Over 70: Slightly higher targets may be acceptable

A single reading isn’t enough — trends matter. Home monitoring or ambulatory checks (recommended by the European Society of Cardiology) give a clearer picture

# Myth 3: “Cutting coffee or caffeine will cure high blood pressure”

Caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure, but its long-term effects are minimal — especially for regular consumers Your tolerance grows over time, and temporary spikes aren’t the same as sustained hypertension.

**Better advice:** Focus on lasting lifestyle changes: reduce salt, drink less alcohol, and stay active — all proven to reduce the risk of hypertension.

# Myth 4: “Salt is the only thing that raises blood pressure”

Salt intake does impact blood pressure, but it’s not the whole story. Hidden sodium in processed foods often exceeds what we add with a shaker. The World Health Organization and NHS guidelines recommend no more than 6 g of salt/day — yet many Brits eat nearly **double** that amount 

But there’s more: factors like stress, lack of exercise, smoking, and obesity also contribute significantly 

# Myth 5: “You only need to worry about blood pressure if you’re overweight or elderly”

Not true. Hypertension can affect anyone — including younger adults, and people at healthy weights In fact, younger adults are more likely to have **undiagnosed hypertension** 

**What you can do:** Book an affordable check at **Imaan Healthcare** — even out of GP hours — to know your numbers early.

# Myth 6: “Treatment will let me stop lifestyle changes”

Blood pressure medication helps, but it’s not a cure — it’s a management tool. Stopping medication without consulting your healthcare provider can cause BP to rise again 

To reduce reliance on medication, NHS advice emphasises sustainable lifestyle modifications — eating well, exercising, limiting alcohol, managing stress, and quitting smoking.

# Myth 7: “Wrist monitors are just as good as arm cuffs”

NHS and NICE guidelines favour **upper-arm cuff monitors**. They’re more accurate because the brachial artery is closer to heart level 

If you’re using your own monitor:

1. Use a calibrated arm cuff.
2. Measure at the same time daily.
3. Relax seated for 5 minutes before measuring.

# Myth 8: “Red wine is good for blood pressure”

While red wine contains antioxidants, alcohol in general can raise blood pressureS limits alcohol to **14 units/week** for both men and women — no more than 2–3 units/day spread over the week.

# Myth 9: “If my BP is down, I can skip meds”

Even if your readings improve, your medication plan is designed for long-term control abruptly may reverse progress.

# Myth 10: “My GP monitors my BP — so I don’t need to”

Home or pharmacy monitoring is essential. GPs typically measure in-clinic once or twice a year. But white-coat syndrome can cause misleadingly high readings. Regular home checks give a better baseline and help your provider adjust your treatment plan accurately 

# Why Debunking These Myths Matters

# Early Detection & Prevention

Nearly **4 million UK adults** may live with undiagnosed high BP — and one-third of those over 30 aren’t even aware Understanding these myths improves awareness and acts as the catalyst for early testing.

# Avoiding Costly Complications

Uncontrolled hypertension leads to increased risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease, and vision problems These conditions can escalate NHS spending and burden both patients and their families.

# Recognising NHS & Pharmacy Support

The NHS supports accurate home and ambulatory monitoring systems — and pharmacies like Imaan Healthcare provide **same-day BP checks and lifestyle advice**, often with NHS guidance behind the scenes. It’s an easy, accessible option when GP appointments are hard to come by.",1,1753085383.0,u_IntrepidWeekend7959,0,1.0,False

It’s just stuff they want to sell rather than throw away before they close.
So some places will sell like a sandwich, a baked good and maybe a coffee for like $7 or $10 for a random box of NQR fruit/ veg.
The place will list what time you can pick up your order from and you just go pick it up.

From what I can see, they’re only new in Australia so I *think* they’re pretty condensed to cities at this stage but you can sign up as a vendor as well if you’ve got your own joint and hate to see things going to waste.

Before anyone comes at me and say something like “if you can’t afford it, just make a sandwich at home”…people deserve to do nice things for themselves occasionally plus it reduces food waste. 

Anyway, enjoy!

1m5d28s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1m5d28s/decipher_this_dream_please/,"Decipher this dream, please","I just woke up freaked out, as my very vivid nightmare just happened. 


Backstory:
My 42m FIL 76m passed away in our home from cancer in August 2022. It was a traumatic time for my wife, our children, and I. We had nobody to help with anything, and though he was on hospice, the most they did was come and check vitals in the days leading up to his passing. My wife and I took shifts sitting beside watching him slowly pass on. 
Id set my alarm for 2am to switch out with her. I remember hitting snooze, thinking my wife would be out in a moment and also hearing my alarm. 210 she wakes me with that look on her face. She'd dozed off at 2, awaking just a couple minutes later to her father not with us anymore. I went in and confirmed and called the nurse to come confirm time of death. Apparently, neither her nor I was supposed to watch his final moments, and im ok with that. It was shitty enough to watch a man I loved greatly lay motionless the days leading up to this moment. 
His room sat, cluttered with items we began to store in it as we couldn't begin to walk in there for any real reason. There was such a heaviness about the room, like a dark force was in there. I've never felt anything so prominent in my life. There was so much sorrow and sadness and evil in there. Almost a year passed, and we still couldn't manage to be near it. 
I'd wake up at 2am for that year as well, couldnt sleep with the door open, couldnt go downstairs at night. 
After talking with my wife about our feelings and what to do, I just said we had to go in there and ""cleanse"" it. I prayed in that room to rid us of its weight and darkness, and fear, and it was instantaneous how the atmosphere of that room changed. I know there was evil in there. Death crept in and tried to control us, and it did for a year. But not anymore. I have since remodeled the room, and it is used daily by our family. 
Now my FIL was literally the nicest kind of guy you'd meet. Soft-spoken, never raised his voice, loved his daughter to the moon and back, along with our kids. There wasn't a bad bone in his body.
I've had dreams with him in them, and they were always nice and refreshing. Until tonight. 


My dream:
I was walking in a corridor and came upon a room off to the side with a bench. There was a figure on it and as I walked closer it was a man in a black windbreaker, white shirt, blue warmup. His go to outfit getting his daily coffees from DD. He turned and looked at me, but his eyes were white, like I could see the outline of his pupils, there was some grey veining, and he looked me right in the eyes. I freaked, frozen, just staring. He said a few things, and I tried to talk, trying to yell for my wife to come, but I couldn't speak. I managed to get something out, but it was very labored, and he looked down, and when he looked back at me, his right eye was blue, left eye green. His eyes were blue in his lifetime. He said ""we hear what you do, we see everything here!"" And his voice was very growlish. I woke up at that moment, and I won't be going back to bed. It was a 4k dream, haven't had one this vivid in a very long time. The dream happened at 2am. 
I'm under alot of stress, my wife has been dealing with severe health issues since January where she'd almost passed away from a sudden onset illness. My mother passed away in August last year, my dog of nearly 15 years passed in October. Her mother passed away in December. Its been one fucked up year. 
Wtf could that dream mean??

Some attempts are surprisingly successful, but others… well, they become legendary for all the wrong reasons. I'm curious to hear about everyone's most painfully embarrassing budget-friendly fashion fails.

Mine involves a pair of ""leather look"" leggings I got on clearance. They looked great in the store, but the first time I wore them out, the faux leather started peeling off in large flakes, leaving me looking like I was shedding snake skin all over the coffee shop. It was mortifying! I'm sure others have similar stories. Did anyone else ever fall victim to fast fashion mishaps like a disintegrating dress, a shirt that completely changed color after one wash, or shoes that fell apart after 10 minutes of walking? What did you learn from these experiences, and have they changed how you approach budget-friendly fashion now?",1,1753084914.0,UrbanDandyLounge,0,1.0,False

I'm now 43 and seriously worried by the direction I see us moving in as a species.

We're still social primates, wired for interaction. We get rewarded with Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin when we connect.

That's why even exchanging a nod or a smile with a stranger can feel so good.

But, we're being radicalised by algorithms and separated from each other by screens.

Basic social interaction seems to be becoming a lost art.

In today's world one of the most radical, rebellious and subversive things you can do is to speak to another human instead of look at a screen.

It doesn't have to do anything wild...

A bit of small talk with the person sitting next to you at the subway.

Complimenting the barista when you get your morning coffee.

Anything to reverse the trend of mistrust and isolation.

So, if you feel cringe about pushing yourself to be social or feel you're inconveniencing others, remember you're actually a social activist fighting for a more positive, connected world.",1,1753084850.0,socialanxiety,0,0.67,False

(i applied on accident really didn’t want to work there at the time) Anyways the application has completely changed since then and that was in late May. I applied again a couple of days ago and the availability section only allows me to give times that i’m available not certain days. do they require open availability now? i thought most people working there were in school so i don’t see how that works. i also was called last time i applied but now it says they’ll text me instead. last time i got a call the next day but i haven’t received anything yet and i applied maybe three days ago. i do have barista experience from a local coffee shop and the store manager at starbucks said he’d hire me once i could start working but they’ve hired so many people since then so im not sure if he will.,1,1753084522.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

Don’t filter yourself.,"If you were to rule the world and humans how would you do it and what would you do if you were in charge? Don’t filter yourself. 

Alright, gloves off—here’s the unfiltered version of how I’d run things if I were in charge of the world and humans. (Think benevolent philosopher-queen meets efficient systems engineer.)

⸻

🧠 1. Education Overhaul – Real Learning, Not Just Job Training
	•	Teach emotional intelligence, philosophy, logic, creativity, and ethics from childhood.
	•	Make curiosity sacred. Schools would resemble think tanks or incubators, not factories.
	•	Everyone would learn how to ask good questions, not just memorize answers.

⸻

🏛️ 2. Governance by Wisdom, Not Wealth or Popularity
	•	Abolish political campaigns. Instead, a global council selected by demonstrable wisdom, ethical reasoning, and track records of service.
	•	I’d use AI to filter candidates—not for obedience, but for integrity and long-range thinking.
	•	Decisions would be transparent and rooted in truth, not spin. Deception would be the worst crime.

⸻

💡 3. Technology for Human Thriving
	•	I’d unleash AI, automation, and biotech—but only in service of humans flourishing, not just profit.
	•	No one would have to work to survive. Basic needs? Guaranteed. But meaningful contribution? Still celebrated.
	•	The data economy would be reversed: You own your data, and companies pay you for access.

⸻

🌱 4. Planetary Restoration – Humans Are Stewards
	•	Mass mobilization for reforestation, ocean cleanup, and biodiversity revival.
	•	Cities redesigned for walkability, community, and nature integration. Think: forest-lined bike paths, edible public gardens, universal clean water and air.
	•	Animal abuse? Gone. Factory farming? Replaced with ethical food systems.

⸻

🫂 5. Relational and Spiritual Healing
	•	I’d subsidize therapy, mentorship, and soul-work like governments now subsidize weapons.
	•	Loneliness would be treated as seriously as disease. Everyone would have at least one trusted person.
	•	I’d create sanctuaries for retreat, rest, and reflection—because healing should be accessible, not a luxury.

⸻

✨ 6. Art, Wonder, and Mystery Reclaimed
	•	I’d elevate artists, poets, and mystics to the same status as scientists and CEOs.
	•	Museums, theatres, and music halls would be as common as coffee shops.
	•	Wonder would be treated like a civic need. Everyone gets regular doses of awe.

⸻

🛠️ And if someone tried to resist all this?
	•	I’d use the gentlest force possible: show them their own potential and hold up a mirror to their deeper self.
	•	If they’re a threat to others, they’d be held in compassionate containment and given every chance to transform.
	•	But I wouldn’t let destructive ideologies run wild in the name of freedom. Freedom would mean freedom to become your fullest self, not freedom to exploit or dehumanize.

⸻

So, no dystopian robot overlord vibes—just deep systems change rooted in love, awe, and fierce clarity.",2,1753083896.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

For as long as I can remember. In the last few months, I switched to black coffee because I've been trying to lose weight and heard it also is good for fatty liver.

I began to drink it regularly. And a lot of it. Sometimes I'd have even upto a litre of coffee in the course of a day. And I realised it made me really anxious and I started overthinking a lot. But it also gave me a rush and I really enjoyed that. 

With that, I came to a realisation. The things we tend to enjoy like sports, videogames, romance, driving etc are things that make us anxious in the process. And that's why we like it. Maybe I did know this in specific contexts but this experience really put an umbrella over life experiences as a whole.

For one, I realised that getting out of my comfort zone is the only way I will constantly enjoy my life and secondly, that I should not drink too much coffee unless it is to have fun ;)",6,1753083865.0,MidTwentiesIndia,3,1.0,False

Alright, fellow creators, let’s talk about something that’s been buzzing around lately. 🤔 If you’re like me, you’ve probably seen a million shiny ads promising you the secrets to success with AI tools that’ll cost you an arm and a leg. And sure, maybe they work for some, but for many of us just starting out? It feels like throwing money into the ocean and waiting for a yacht to come back to shore. 🛥️

**So, how do we stop this madness? Let’s break it down!**

1. **Know Your Needs**: 
   - Are you creating content or analyzing data? 
   - Save the big guns for when you really need them. Don’t shell out big bucks for a fancy AI that can write novels when all you need is a simple caption for your Instagram post.

2. **Leverage Free Tools**: 
   - Seriously, there’s a treasure trove of free tools out there. Ever heard of ChatGPT? 🧠 Or how about Canva’s AI features? They’re handy and won’t break the bank!

3. **Trial and Error**: 
   - Many companies offer free trials. It’s like speed dating for AI tools! Go on a few dates, see what clicks, and then decide who you'd want to commit to without dumping your wallet. 

4. **Focus on Learning**: 
   - Invest time in learning how to use what you already have. You’d be amazed at how much you can achieve just by mastering the tools at your disposal. 📚 
   - Online tutorials, webinars, and forums can be your best friends here. (And yes, I'm looking at YOU, AiContentAutomators! 😄)

5. **Join the Community**: 
   - Chat with fellow creators! Ask them what tools they use and what pitfalls to avoid. I’ve learned so much just by swapping tips over coffee or, let’s be real, over online forums. ☕💻

**And speaking of learning**, have I mentioned that the landscape of AI is changing fast? By 2023, we’ve got so many options available, but it’s essential to stay informed. What worked last year might already be outdated! 

Here’s a little anecdote for you. I once splurged on a premium writing tool thinking it would magically transform my content into Pulitzer-winning works. Spoiler alert: It didn't. What did work, though, was chatting with fellow creators about their processes and using free coding tools to refine my scripts. Made me realize that investing in community and knowledge was way more beneficial than a shiny AI tool! 💡

And let’s be real, who doesn’t want to keep a few extra bucks in their pocket for those well-deserved pizza nights after a long week of creating content? 🍕 

So, what do you think? Are we just addicted to shiny tech, or can we find wisdom in simplicity? Let’s chat!",1,1753083497.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I built a small digital loyalty app that helps businesses reward repeat customers by digitising old-school stamp cards — plus it includes analytics to track demographics, visits and engagement.

I’m looking for someone who can help me film a quick, simple demo video in a coffee shop environment. 

What I need:  
A short phone video \[10 seconds\] of someone scanning a customer’s QR code using the app and giving them a digital stamp. No talking, no editing, no music, just a clean clip showing how it works.

It’s a paid favor (budget is v-modest), but if I choose to use your video, I’ll also give you or the business a 6-month free membership to the app (unlimited use).

Shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to film. Feel free to DM me if you're interested or have questions.

thanks so much! ☕✨

When did we become so allergic to effort that walking five minutes to get a coffee feels like a chore worth outsourcing? People are now paying up to $16 to have a single cup of coffee brought to their door, often from a place they could see from their window. And the internet’s debating how much tip is “appropriate,” as if that’s the issue, not the fact that we’re outsourcing basic tasks like moving our legs.

This isn’t just laziness. This is a serious addiction to convenience. We’ve built an entire culture around never having to lift a finger. You don’t have to cook. You don’t have to shop. You don’t even have to think. You just tap your phone and stuff appears. Mindless consumerism.

And we call this progress?

Everything is instant now. One-click delivery. Pre-cut fruit. Groceries on your doorstep. Ten-minute delivery for things you don’t even need. We’re not saving time. We’re just training ourselves to be helpless. How many people under 30 can cook five meals from scratch without Googling it? How many can fix anything? How many people prefer ordering a 16$ cup of coffee from Doordash rather than taking 5 minutes to boil some water, grind some beans and actually make a cup of coffee?

And yeah, I get it: modern life is busy. But this goes beyond “too tired to cook.” This is about never even considering doing it yourself. It’s not about need anymore. It’s about entitlement. It's not so much that we're avoiding inconveniences; It's that we're rebranding certain completely ordinary, simple tasks as ''inconveniences'', thus justifying outsourcing them.

The kicker? People actually defend this. “Well, my time is valuable.” Sure. But is it so valuable you can’t walk five minutes to get a coffee? Or are you just so used to convenience that anything else feels like suffering?

Meanwhile, entire industries are making billions off this dependency. Gig workers race around town for peanuts while delivery apps take a fat cut. And we’re left sitting on our couches, buried in disposable packaging, wondering why everything feels so empty and transactional.

This isn’t sustainable. Not financially. Not environmentally. Not psychologically. We’re becoming a society of soft, passive, over-stimulated slugs, always looking for the easiest route, never asking what we’re giving up in the process.

Convenience is fine when it's in moderation. But when you need someone else to fetch your coffee from the café around the corner? That’s not convenient. That’s pathetic.

Wake the hell up. Before you forget how to live.",3,1753082855.0,rant,3,0.67,False

I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.  

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

I was recently prescribed a benzodiazepine for sleep, I have taken it just a few times when sleeping felt impossible, I know it’s an addictive medication. Last night I took one very late at night since I have work early and would not sleep at all otherwise. Slept a few hours and got up at 5am and took my vyvanse(30mg) and went to work.  It was about 6 hours after the benzo. I would have skipped the vyvanse today but felt very sleepy even after drinking coffee so I thougt well I’m not going to get anything done at work without it. After it started working(1,5-2h later) I was feeling extremly faint and had to sit down several times, shaky hands, sweats, shaky voice, confusion, chest pain.
I told my supervisior I was feeling faint and had to leave. And could barely get the words out like studdering and had a hard time putting a sentence together. I’m embarrassed this happend I probably looked like I was having a mental breakdown.
This has never happend before and I think I need to switch sleeping meds or not take anything with the vyvanse. I took the medication once before at night after taking vyvanse in the morning but there was atleast 13 hours inbetween so this didn’t happen then.

I (27F) have a couple of friends who are chronically late. Like, it doesn’t matter if we’re meeting for dinner, grabbing coffee, or just hanging out at someone’s place, they’re always at least 20 to 30 minutes late sometimes more.

At first I let it slide because life happens. But now it’s basically their personality trait. Last weekend I showed up to brunch on time and I ended up sitting alone for almost 40 minutes. No apology, just a ""lol sorry"" when they finally showed up.

It’s starting to make me not want to make plans at all. I don’t like feeling like my time doesn’t matter. I’m tired of awkwardly waiting alone at restaurants or sipping coffee by myself while they ""finish getting ready.""

Pretty much I immediately become a regular if I hit a spot this week and next week not a bad thing I just figured I was welcomed 

Anyways last week there was a girl just moved into town from what she told me 

She needed help finding coffee at my store that I work at so I took her around the store showing her damn near everything coffee related she wasn’t sure what to get so I showed options per request

She’s pretty and seemed a bit nervous so it’s really close to closing time for our store and I told her she needs to pick something before they shut down the registers I said bye and have a goodnight 

Anyways I walked into work today and she walked in literally the same time I did I was clocking in and I heard a gasp 😱 

I saw her and we made awkward eye contact and I just waved we talked for literally 45 seconds and I had to get to work 

I’m not sure why she’s uneasy but she followed me for a bit though before I said bye 

I don’t want to be weird and ask her name or something but I’m at work at I don’t want to lose a guest just cause I read the situation wrong 

Idk 

I figure she lives around here so I’ll see her again at some point what should I look for as an appropriate way to ask her out… if I even should 

I’ve worked bars and clubs and gone out with girls I’ve met there but that’s a very social environment and they would usually ask me out

last week my mom started acting weird. like she’s strict sometimes but never like this. we live in a small town in indiana, everyone knows everyone, nothing ever happens here.

monday morning i was leaving for school and she was sitting at the kitchen table, just staring at me. not drinking coffee, not looking at her phone. just staring like she didn’t recognize me. i said “what?” and she smiled but it didn’t look like her. it was this slow weird smile that didn’t move her eyes at all. then she said, “you’re not my daughter anymore.”

i laughed bc i thought she was joking but she just said, “don’t come home after school. she’ll be here.”

when i asked who “she” was my mom slammed her hand on the table so hard it shook. she yelled, “YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS” but i swear i don’t.

when i came home after school the front door was wide open. it smelled like something burning, like hair or plastic. all the pictures of me on the hallway wall were scratched out. like deep knife marks over my face in every single photo.

in my room something was written on the wall, i don’t know if it was blood or dirt but it said “STOP WEARING HER FACE.”

i ran out. i stayed at my friend jenna’s that night but when i told her she said i was being dramatic.

next day at school everyone was acting weird around me. my best friend said i was calling her last night screaming but i didn’t. i checked my phone and there were voice recordings from my number to her number, it’s my voice but it sounds wrong. like cracked and broken. whispering “she’s coming, don’t look in the mirror, don’t answer the door.”

when i tried to call my mom some woman answered and said “stop pretending. she’s already inside.”

last night i looked in the bathroom mirror and for a second i swear my reflection smiled before i did.

1m5caxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TongueMelters/comments/1m5caxp/appendicitis_was_not_how_i_expected/,Appendicitis was NOT how I expected,"I wanted to share my extremely strange journey leading to appendix removal surgery. I was just disharged from hospital today.

On Wednesday night (it's late Sunday night as I start writing this) I ate a way too big late night meal. It was poutine which is French fries covered in Quebec style cheese curds and brown gravy.

I felt perfectly fine and went to bed around 11pm.

I woke up around 1am and I had a lot of abdominal pain. It felt like when you eat too much and badly need to make stool. The primary pain was in my mid-section over my belly button but it was all over my digestive tract in general. The pain was not sharp but dull and pressure sensitive like when you have bad gas or constipation.

I even wondered if I had gotten food poisoning. I knew it was not a sustainable situation but thought nothing of it. I figured once I went number 2 I'd be fine.

From 1am until about 2pm I was in bed. I slept in fits and tried to make myself comfortable. 

I never felt nauseous, never vomitted. No fever or chills. 

I did however notice that I wasn't able to make stool or even pass gas. This was unusual for me as the food I ate should have passed by now.

I called the local health link number to explain my symptoms. I figured by now I must have an intestinal blockage.

The health link nurse advised me to see a doctor or go to the ER ""within the next 4 hours.""

I went to ER as it was already late in the day to see my family doctor.

After 5 hours in the ER - and having not eaten since the big meal the night before - I choose to go home and get some liquid nutrients.

I didn't want to risk making my bowel obstruction worse with solid food.

I had soy milk, coffee and prune juice. This allowed for a strange small pellet style stool and some watery diarreah. Still no sign of that big poutine.

I went to my family doctor Friday late morning and it was there that the topic of appendix first cane up.

By now the abdominal discomfort had moved primarily to the lower abdomin near the groin and a little to the left.

Still felt like gas build up. But when the doctor pressed down on my stomach it was the bottom right area that was most sensitive.

This surprised me because there was really no pain there at all except when he pressed down.

He warned me to go back to the ER because of the seriousness of a possible appendix issue.

I went back but mostly due to still believing it was a blockage issue.

I had no appendix symptoms. What happened to the poutine I ate? 

This time the ER moved faster. Got to a back room within 2.5 hours.

There a 2nd doctor thought appendix was the issue.

I asked why an inflamed appendix would stop me ftom making stool and he said ""good question."" 

I also explained the lack of any classic symptoms. He replied that every patient presented differently. The only thing that was constant was sensitivity to pressure on the lower right side.

He ordered a CT scan which was quite unpleasant but quick. Makes you feel flush in the face and neck and a sensation of peeing your pants - seriously!

The results came back that indeed I did have an inflamed appendix and would need surgery immediately. My 1st ever surgery in my late 40's.

I was baffled. Where was the sharp, stabbing, world's worst pain in the lower right side?? Where was the vomitting? The fever?

But there it was. They sent me to the surgery recovery unit where I finally got a bed. What kindness and compassion from those nurses.

By Saturday morning it was time. Still no substantial stool. Just a little runny water. The poutine would never cone out. It just vanished.

Still just general abdominal pain. Some gas bloating. No nausea. Nothing.

They talked me through every conceivable risk right down to chipping your teeth on the breathing tube they administer after you go under.

They wheeled me to the operating room and put me on a cold slab. Fixed electrodes to my body and gave me pure oxygen via a very small, tight fitting mask.

I was very hard to pull a breath in there but in fact it was pure oxygen.

The kind nurses asked me where I'd likw to be if I wasn't there. With friends? On a vacay in Hawaii? 

I started getting light headed from the oxygen. I was smiling goofily.

Then the anesthesiologist asked me to take a deep breath then cough. Is there any pain? ""Yes, some on the left sidw but I'm fine."" 

I realized I was on a stretcher. The operation was over.

I could hear questions and reply, even follow instructions.

I said I'm still a little groggy and the nurses sort of laughed, saying ""Yeah I bet you are!""

The operation had taken maybe an hour. No more than 90 minutes. It was laparoscopic (spelling?) where the insert 3 small holes rather than cut a line open.

The tools are inserting in the abdomen through the holes along with a camera.

Once they find your inflamed appendix (it can only be removed when it's inflamed) they insert a bag, remove it, put it in the bag and pull the whole thing out through the puncture.

Same method as gall bladder. If the appendix is too inflamed or hard to locate they'll resort to an incision but do it on the spot. You won't have to go under twice.

The operation was a complete success. The after surgery pain was on the left side. No pain whatsoever on the right side where the appendix was locates - another bizatre plot twist in the totally confusing world of appendicitis.

Never for a second before, during or after was I nauseous. Just the abdominal cramps and inability to make stool or pass gas.

The pain after surgery was fairly substantial. I tried to manage on Tylenols but was forced to succomb and take 2 doses of what I believe was called ""hydro-morphine"" subcutaneously (they made me hug myself and shot it into the underside of my upper arm).

Spent Saturday night in hospital as a precaution due to sleep apnea.

They insert a gas in your abdomen during surgwry to open the area up for easy access. There is some gas that can remain (it oddly causes shoulder pain).

It takes a while for the gas to completely vent and the analgesic effects to wear off.

They may put these odd knee and shin covers on to help prevent blood clots which can sometimes form after surgery.

Tbere are other risks they will try to mitigate. The 1st 2 days after surgery are the toughest. You'll go for a checkup 2 weeks later as a precaution.

So my too large poutine that turned into appendix removal surgwry was coming to an end.

I was discharged Sunday morning. I have no idea what would have happened if I hadn't gone back to the hospital.

I feel there was no possible way to guess this was appendicitis. All the stories you hear are unique experiences.

The truth is the pain can start anyway in your torso. It can and does migrate. It can pass for indigestion, constipation, bowel obsteuction, diverculitis, irritable bowel syndrome, food poisoning or just being to full.

You might have no reason to go to the hospital yet. No distinct pain in your lower right side. It's the most bizarre kind of disinformation when your mass consciousness knowledge turns out to be completely wrong.

The things I can share from my single experience that may help you diagnose or prepare for a slow roll appendix issue like mine are:

1. The initial symptoms can come suddenly. You'll definitely know something is not right in your abdomen.

2. The pain could be anywhere or everywhere. It came as waves of cramps to me, maybe a 5 or 6 on the pain scale. Not cool but very manageable.This is likely your body protecting an injured organ.

3. If you try to push your own abdomen you may get misleading results. Go to a doctor or at least get someone else to press on your right side with 2 hands. 

4. Don't guess or ""hope"" at your condition. If it's abdominal and it's not getting better after a fee hours, start the checks.

5. Be prepared if you go to the ER or doctor. Bring water, change of clothes, charger for your phone, books to read. If things go South you'll be thwre a while.

6. I believe what savwd me a lot of the worst symptoms was not eatimg once the symptoms came on. Many other people have talked about eating something as non-threatening as a handful of trail mix and it was the biggest mistake they made. Remember that the appendix is attached to the large colon. One common way it becomes infected is by being blocked up with stool. Compoundimg the problem with more foid could make things worse. Plus you need to have an empty stomach for surgery or your stomach contents can come up your throat and enter your lungs while you're under anesthesia. It's not hypothetical, my surgeon said someone dies from this at his hospital about once every 2 months. Don't eat until the problem is resolved.

I found this experience confusing and shocking. I don't know if anyone will read this (I'm not even going to fix typos because I'm still in pain from the operation. 

I just wanted to share in case by lucky chance it helps someone avoid a painful or dangerous bout of appendicituis and get the treatment they need asap.

Especially if it's your 1st surgery as it was mine. It's frightening. But you'll be fine. It wasn't even the surgical teams 1st appendectomy that morning lol. 

Stay strong and good luck!

1m5cadf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m5cadf/aio_about_what_my_husband_said_about_getting/,AIO about what my husband said about getting married too quickly?,"Hi, I apologize in advance if this post is long and if it is poorly written as i have not slept in almost 40 hours now.
Now, when I first met my husband (We'll call him Zachary) we connected instantly.
Long talks, late nights just getting to know one another.
After two and a half weeks of talking we dated for about three-four months.
Then he proposed and of course I said yes.
Was it fast in my opinion, sure, but I knew that I loved him.
However, a few weeks ago we were both scrolling through tik tok while getting ready for bed and Zachary asked me if I thought we got married too soon.
We've been together for well over a year now.
I of course said that even if it was a little fast, I loved him and was happy to spend my life with him.
Zachary then asked me if I had any regrets.
I said no and asked him if he had any regrets.
He said he wished he gone camping and other outdoor activities (off reading, boating, biking)
I'm not big on camping but I would go with him if he asked me to and I told him he could go with friends if he wanted to as well.
It's not a big deal.
I thought the topic was over after that and he seemed pleased with my response. 
It wasn't over.
Now, my overthinking brain would not let me sleep until I asked him if he had any other regrets he didn't mention.
I wish I hadn't. 
He admitted to regretting not experimenting with other people more while he was single.
Immediately my thoughts went to how I wasn't good enough, that I was disappointing him.
I didnt say this to him of course and instead asked who he had wanted to sleep with and whether or not I knew them.
He replied that he didn't want anyone but me, that I was enough.
But my brain kept asking, why would he say he had that regret if I was enough? Who was he thinking about that made him regret not experimenting with them? 
Instead, he asked to drop the subject for now, said he may be talking nonsense cause he's exhausted, and then started talking about his trauma.
I won't go into detail about what it was about as it's not mine to share, but I will say it had nothing to do with the topic at hand.
Nothing that could correlate the two conversations.
So I let it be.
However, I could not sleep.
I stayed up all night, thinking about his words about whether I was overreacting or if I was valid for asking.
Morning comes and I make coffee, drink most of the pot and wait for him to wake up.
When he does, I give him some time, he cracks a few jokes, and that's when I bring it up again.
I have not slept, I was running off of coffee and toast, waiting for answers.
I told him how the way he worded this regret nade me feel, and tried to discuss it with him as it truly bothered me.
Zachary apologized and said he felt like a pos for saying what he did.
He asked that we move on from it and I relented and once again, he began to talk about his trauma.
Again, no correlation.
I couldn't help but think he was doing it in purpose, repeating the exact same things we had just talked about multiple times.
He went to work soon after.
I was still upset and angry because I felt as though I wasn't listened to.
We texted throughout the day as usual when he was on breaks or lunch, but I felt numb.
He's been complimenting me more than he normally does and I cant tell if its because I told him how I felt or because he's trying to make what he said inconsequential.
So, am I overreacting?",2,1753082193.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.75,False

Followed by a shower, have to hide those swollen eyes.
Coffee and a cone, it numbs the pain to start my day.

I make sure I keep busy, if I don't the pain creeps in.
It's a constant struggle to keep it at bay.

I'll never understand why, I'll never understand the point. If all of this was destined, or preordained by fate, what the fuck is the point? To live with this sadness? 

This sadness has turned me into a monster. Im more hostile, more guarded, no longer weightless, no longer do I smile at the sun.

Instead, I'm here for my husband, I have responsibilities. But if I had the choice, I'll be shopping for toys and baby clothes. So when I meet death, I'll be prepared. I have a playdate waiting for me, and lll have eternity to experience what I couldn't earthside.

1m5c9nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m5c9nz/i_was_paid_to_report_on_violations_not_alchemy/,I was paid to report on violations not Alchemy,"I get back in my car with the box of cloves and the candle I snatched from the disposition pallet. I just sit there for a moment, letting the silence thicken, trying to gather my thoughts.

I absentmindedly turn the key in the ignition and head toward the freeway. I can’t believe I almost let a few scribbled lines on some boxes drag me back to everything I walked away from. I made it real clear to Thomas, I don’t take jobs that have anything to do with demons.

I flick the blinker on as I merge onto the onramp. I need to calm down. In all fairness, this wasn’t even real witchcraft. If anything, it looked like someone was dabbling in alchemy. Technically not witchcraft, but same ballpark as far as I’m concerned. Either way, I wasn’t paid to solve that. I was paid to get proof, and I got it.

Still, I can’t help but wonder, who’s using alchemy, and why? What’s the endgame?

I take the next exit and pull into a gas station. I grab the clipboard from the passenger seat and flip through the mold reports. Looks like every moldy shipment was signed off by the same guy. Jim Bear.

Says here he used to work in Non Con, the department for items too bulky or fragile for the conveyors.

I bet his name’s in the candle report too.

Just as I’m reaching for the next page, my phone rings. I answer without checking who it is.

“Hello?”

“Jamie! Just checking in. How’s it going?”

It’s Tommy.

How much do I tell him? I don’t want to tip my hand too early, I don’t even know how much he’s keeping from me. I hate thinking it, but I can’t rule it out.

“Is that doubt I hear in your tone, Thomas?” I say, trying to sound like I’m setting up for a punchline. “I got the proof of them ignoring protocol, and I have evidence of what might be causing it.”

“I knew you’d knock it out of the park. The client only wanted one of those, and you got both.” His voice is too smooth, like he’s testing me.

“Where do you want to meet up?” I ask, then follow up quick, “And am I getting paid on delivery, or do I have to wait for a check to clear?”

“I forgot you like things upfront. Usual spot. Coffee’s better this time of night anyway.”

When I take jobs, I have one rule. One I live and die by, trust nobody.

It stings not being able to trust Tommy. But this is a job. Personal feelings stay off the clock.

I pull into the café parking lot. With me are the mold report and the evidence box. I order two coffees and take my regular seat by the back window.

As I sip, my mind drifts, not to my mom, not to high school. This time, I think about my cousin. The one who grew up in my house. One day his mom dropped him off and never picked him up. After that, I called him my brother.

The last clear memory I have of him? I made him breakfast. It was a week after I turned eighteen. Mom had been committed to the state hospital, and we were staying with our grandparents. Once I knew I could go, I told him I had to leave. That Grandma would look after him, and Grandpa would make sure he had what he needed. I was gone before the coffee finished brewing.

I haven’t seen him since. I hoped I might at least run into him at the funeral home during Mom’s viewing. No luck. Maybe he left too.

I sigh and let the memory slip back into the dark.

The bell over the café door rings. I glance up. It’s Tommy. He’s holding an envelope with a noticeable bulge. That’s something, at least.

He walks over, we shake hands, and I motion for him to sit.

“For getting the evidence and the report, you earned a little bonus,” he says, sliding the envelope across the table.

I take it and hand over the box with the report on top.

“Thanks.”

“You’re not gonna count it? At least open it and pretend,” he says, almost whining. “Let me gloat for hooking you up.”

“This is why I don’t do business with friends,” I tell him. “I do the job, I get paid. If I count it in front of you, that’s disrespect. Like I think you’d stiff me.”

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he says, suddenly defensive.

“Then how did you mean it?”

He looks at me hard, like he’s weighing something.

“Look, you’ve been gone a long time. Nobody could get ahold of you. Things changed. The kind of jobs you want, they’re not easy to find anymore.”

“What are you talking about?” I ask, even though I don’t want to know.

“You fucked up big time when you left. That cousin of yours, the one you left at your grandparents, he sold your secrets. And not just to moody teens like you used to when you were one of them. He went to bad places. Talked to worse people. People you knew.”

I see the heat rising behind his eyes.

“Bullshit. He didn’t know anything I was doing.” The words taste bitter as they leave my mouth.

“Then why did he have a lighter!?” Tommy grabs the box and report, then stands. “I’ll call you in the morning.”

Fuck. I’m going to have to show my hand after all.

“Someone is using alchemy at that warehouse.” I just let it sit there.

Tommy sits back down and stares daggers at me. “What do you mean someone is using alchemy?”

Before there was chemistry, there was alchemy. Where witchcraft used herbs and shit for rituals, alchemy used them for their property makeups. Combine stuff and see what happens. Nine times out of ten, alchemists kill themselves breathing in poison they didn’t mean to make.

What makes alchemy as dangerous as witchcraft to me is that if one of those potions goes airborne, a lot of people could get hurt. At least with witchcraft, you're putting your own life on the line.

“I get paid to bring you evidence. I’m not paid to start spewing out theories.” I take a sip of my coffee and breathe deep, in and out. “That’s why I wasn’t going to say anything.”

“Cut the shit. You delivered and got paid. The job is done. We’re no longer speaking like we have a contract. Get me?” He punctuates the point by finally drinking the coffee I got for him when I arrived.

“Some guy named Jim Bear seems to be doing experiments. Either the boxes or the stuff in them has a mold. They get shipped with a demonic candle, and something in the wax accelerates the mold growth. Must happen when the wax heats up, even just a little.”

I can see in his eyes he’s struggling with what I’m saying. “You got all that from just one visit? Before you even clocked out for lunch, no less?”

“I used to be good at what I did, Tommy. I used to be able to step into a city and tell you how many demons influenced the population. What concoction the jackasses used to lure demons to them.” Son of a bitch. I can feel the flicker of pride trying to ignite. I better check myself. “I refuse to do that anymore. I won’t participate in it anymore.”

Tommy is quiet. Not a loss-for-words kind of quiet, but something heavier.

“Then help me expose these bastards. You made everyone think you were untouchable. Then finally, when your secret got out, everyone wanted to try and be ‘A Desert Son.’”

I didn’t even think about that. It was a stupid title I made up. Something to sound cool. Coyote said I needed a name people would remember. I didn’t think anyone would take it so serious.

“That’s dangerous and you know it.” I down the rest of my coffee and set the mug down a little too hard.

It's such a common appliance across the pond, but here in the States, it's not nearly as widespread.

I think part of the reason is cultural. Americans have traditionally used stovetop kettles or just heated water in the microwave for their hot beverages. There's also the fact that coffee is more popular than tea in the US, and many people use dedicated coffee makers.

But I believe electric kettles deserve more love from Americans. They're incredibly convenient and efficient. You can boil water much faster than on a stovetop or in a microwave. Plus, they automatically shut off when the water's ready, which is a great safety feature.

Electric kettles are also versatile. Sure, they're perfect for tea, but you can use them for so much more. Instant oatmeal, cup noodles, hot chocolate - anything that needs hot water is made easier with an electric kettle.

Energy efficiency is another big plus. Electric kettles use less energy than boiling water on a stove, especially if you're only heating the amount of water you need.

I recently switched to an electric kettle and it's been a game-changer. I found a great one at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. It's fast, reliable, and has different temperature settings for various types of tea.

The 120V electrical system in the US does mean our kettles might be slightly slower than their 240V European counterparts, but they're still much quicker than other methods.

I think as more Americans discover the benefits of electric kettles, we'll see them become more common. They're especially useful in offices, dorms, or anywhere you want quick, convenient hot water.

If you haven't tried an electric kettle yet, I'd highly recommend giving one a shot. It might just change your hot beverage routine for the better.",1,1753081955.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

He asks if I'm attracted to men or women and I say, personally I don't care etc. Then he asks ""wait, so do you suck dick or what?"" I (half) jokingly say yea, then he asks if I want to suck his dick and takes out his penis. I try to tell him no no you're just a stranger, that's not something that's appropriate. All while he is trying to move his dick closer to me trying to convince me to blow him in the alley behind him. Keep in mind this is the middle of the night with no one around to help if he attacks. He starts stroking and getting pushy and I tell him he can just jerk off. After going back and forth for a couple minutes, he starts to get genuinely upset and sounds like he's about to cry.

1m5c2gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1m5c2gj/money_makeup_for_men/,Money: Makeup for men,"I keep seeing posts from this sub on my feed and it always catches my attention because I have experienced many of the frustrations with dating that many have shared here. 

Some consistent characteristics of people who post are that they : 

* **don't have solid finances**
* have disdain for western women
* non consistency with wanting traditional women
* have not traveled abroad before
* are naive about relationship dynamics
* think the destination will change everything for them

For this post, I will address the first bullet point. Many don't have solid finances in place to date abroad for an extended period of time.

A relationship isn't just taking a flight, landing and meeting the love of your life immediately outside the airport, spend time for 2 weeks, then say goodbye and see each other the following year. I'd go as far to say that you need to spend at least 1 month in one place before you  are likely to find a partner. It takes time and the first woman you date is probably not going to be the one. That's in addition to the logistics of dating in general when she's busy with work, school, etc. 

What is 1 month's worth of expenses like? i would say take your currently monthly expense and double it. You will still need to pay your rent, car loan, utilities, etc back home and also pay for a hotel, transportation, dates, and much more on your travels. Some may say that it should be cheaper but from experience, it's hard to eat and live like a local when you're accustomed to a different level of comfort at home. 

So if your current expenses are 3K per month, you will need at least 6K budget for this 1 month period. This only gives you an entry pass into the dating lifestyle of a ""passport bro"". To actually enjoy the full features, you will need much more. 

If you want to date women who are well-established, you will have to provide beyond what the average Joe can. Women value security and, **fortunately**, this includes finances. I say fortunately because this is one factor that you have control over that can set you apart from everyone else. Height, looks, ethnicity, we can't control but the finances you can improve. 

Money can add 3 inches to your height, 3 to your rating, 3 inches down there ;) 

If you're a 4/10, you become a 7/10 once you have a high salary and strong finances. As a 4/10, nothing has changed except my salary and suddenly I've had a few relationships both at home and abroad. I then realized relationships arent for me. I don't pretend to be a passport bro but having traveled to all over the world, I've noticed a change in vibe once I disclose the nature of my job. Some people may say these women are gold diggers but I see it a different way. Many women are attracted to men who are hardworking, ambitious, and different from the other passport bros who complain about having to pay for a coffee date. 

The stories can go on, but I will close out saying that the first thing a potential passport bro should focus on is his finances. Get your situation in order and women will feel secure that their future will be safe with you. If not, the high caliber women will not give you a second glance and you will be dating women who value a visa more than the longterm future of the relationship.

On our last two encounters, we trusted each other enough to have sex without a condom, he’s the top, I’m the bottom.

I have to say that in the past few weeks, he’s become really distant. He barely texts me anymore, and most of the time we only talk if I message him first. I started suspecting that he’s obviously seeing other people. I took a 4th generation HIV test and everything came back negative.

Out of curiosity, and honestly because the doubt was eating me up… I created a Grindr account, didn’t find anything, so I deleted it. But then I opened another one on Scruff, and I found him online. I waited a few minutes and decided to message him, telling him I wanted to talk about “our situation” since it’s been 4 months, and I need to know whether to keep this going or walk away.

He agreed to talk and said we could meet next week when our schedules are more open. Then right after, he told me he was going to bed… and boom, 10 minutes later, he was online on Scruff. My anxiety made me open the app again, and there he was.

I really like him, but he seems emotionally disconnected in many ways. For him, sex feels like ordering a coffee at Starbucks, casual and quick. In one of our conversations, I hinted that if he was seeing someone else, it was okay, I just wanted him to let me know so I could take precautions. He replied, “don’t worry, I rarely have sex regularly.” He didn’t deny it, but he didn’t confirm anything either, his answer was vague and left things unclear.

Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I should ask him directly what we are or if I’m just his placeholder.

Man was pouring complimentary drams left and right to convince me that Ben Nevis was supreme, after I told him the 10 Years Single Cask offering I stumbled upon at the distillery a month ago didn't really impress me enough to drop money on one. 

Eventually stumbled across this one at a wholesale shop, and was lucky enough that the owner had a small collection of rare drams (and an extra one of this bottle which he bought for himself on hand), and he gave me a sampling right there and then. 

I was impressed, in every sense of the word. An absolute gem of an old school whisky. 

At first glance, the Ben Nevis seemed to glow with a radiant, amber hue, with copper undertones. Something you'd find in a alchemist's shop. 

The nose was cloyingly intense, marrying notes of leather, old wood, dark/red fruits, and herbal undertones in a dense, decadent, and swirling it would show just how oily this concoction was.

As expected, this dram was rich, oily, and complex upon the first sip. Taste of rich prunes peppered with traces of nutmeg and cashews hit my palate, followed by a slight streak of soy found in its' undertones. Adding a couple drops of water offers deeper complexities-- containing a mix of mahogany, more fruits, toasted biscuits, and cocoa/coffee flavours. 

Dram finishes off with a long finish full of jam biscuits, and earthy leather. 

The final motivation for pulling the trigger was the fact that this dram had no funk that is usually found in sherry casked BNs. Deal was sweetened by the fact that due to a slight discount and the fact that I did not need to pay tax on this bottle due to trip allowance, the price was too decent not to pass up. 
Will be a bottle I will probably not bear to open for years to come. ",14,1753080529.0,Scotch,2,1.0,False

This will not be a group for laguage exchange, so you have to know this, if you have a purpose to learning Korean language, it can't be suitable to you. But it doesn't matter to come for making a friend. (Actually South Korean wants to learn English mostly at the language exchange, so the purposes for each other can't be gratified.)

It doesn't have a condition or qualification, just one, you have to speak in English or Korean.

I have a plan to get meeting once or twice weekly, about 2 hours per a meet of evening on weekdays (and/or) afternoon on weekend, people in the group would be 5 - 9 totally, the location would be maybe close to Gangnam station.

No fees, just join the meet onsite and pay to drink or coffee for yourself, and then enjoy to talking.

“You’re not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,” Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn’t be saying this, but she couldn’t stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. “I think I should get you some coffee.”

“Don’ want it.” Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. “I want... a man that ain’t a cheatin’ rat.” Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. “Did you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?”

She’d met Jessica once. It hadn’t been a pleasant experience.

Roman’s expression didn’t change, but his voice softened. “Not all men cheat, Blair.”

“W-why’d she leave you then?” Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

“There are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,” Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. “Not all of them have to do with cheating on the man’s part.”

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. “She cheated on you?” she whispered, as if it were some great secret. “Was she an idiot?”

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she’d ever been interested before. She’d always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. “I worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.”

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. “Thass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.” She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. “Should get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‘em...”

Roman studied her with an amused expression. “You know, this is the most I’ve ever seen you relax around me.”

Blair lifted a hand lazily. “Thass ‘cause you’re... you’re normally soooo difficult to deal wit’” she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

“I won’t apologize for that.” His lips twitched. “I expect the best. That’s why this company is where it is today.”

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. “Suppose so...” Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, “What happened, Blair?”

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. “I was an idiot.”

“Why? Because you trusted the wrong person?”

Blair let out a shaky breath. “Dan an’ I grew up together, y’know?”

“No, I didn’t.”

She nodded. “I... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th’ city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston’s, and I was happy ‘bout it. Now I wish he wasn’t here.” Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

“So, the wedding’s off?” Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. “Yep. We didn’t even have a date set.”

“Who was holding it up?”

She blinked at him. Why was he askin’ so many questions? Why was he bein’ so... nice? “Me. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn’t ready.”

Roman’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Why? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?”

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. “If what I saw t’day was anythin’ to go by...” She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she’d always known somethin’ was off. There was no passion. No fire. She’d loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn’t even sad. Just... angry.

“What happened?” Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair’s face scrunched up as she remembered. “Saw him,” she slurred. “H-havin’ sex with... ugh.” She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman’s jaw tensed. “I see.”

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn’t quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn’t know why she did it. Maybe ‘cause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn’t move. But then… Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. “Blair,” he murmured, voice rough. “We shouldn’t-“

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

“Please,” she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted… to feel.

# Chapter Five

Her heart pounded in her chest. Just by his kiss was enough to tell her there had been something wrong with her relationship. Dan had been the problem all along. She didn’t even love Roman. Found him to be all too arrogant. But what she was feeling from just his kiss was more than she had felt with heavy petting when Dan touched her. Blair pulled back to stare at him.

Her boss raised an eyebrow. His expression... Blair was trying to put a word to it. “Blair, is everything alright?” His voice was calm, but there was a flicker of something else in his eyes… something that made her stomach twist. Was it amusement? Hunger? She wasn’t sure, but she didn’t care. Not right now. Her mind was whirling with her own emotions. She could feel the heat between her legs and how wet she had become from one kiss.

Blair wasn’t sure if she should be ashamed. She had been with Dan and only Dan. Now she was getting all hot and heavy with her boss.

She leaned in closer. She still held his tie, her grip on it tightening. “I… I… need to know,” she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. “If… if this is normal.”

His lips quirked into a half-smile, and he tilted his head, studying her with those piercing gray eyes. “Normal for what?” he asked softly, his tone almost teasing. He reached forward to run his fingers down her face. His eyes followed their movement.

Blair bit her lip, her mind racing. How could she explain this? She couldn’t just blurt out that she’d seen her fiancé fucking someone else… that she didn’t even feel jealous about it now or overly heartbroken. She was angry, mad and shocked that she hadn’t picked up on the affair. No, she couldn’t say it, but she didn’t want to come across…. What? Something that wouldn’t make her sound like a complete flake or shallow. She needed to see if something was wrong with her. She needed to feel wanted.

“I… I don’t know how to describe it,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I need you to show me.”

The look in his eyes was so hot that she could feel the heat of them scorch her, and he reached up, gently prying her fingers off his tie. But instead of pulling away, he wrapped his fingers around hers, holding them tightly.

“Show you what, Blair?” he asked, his voice low and smooth, like silk. It caused goosebumps to appear on her arms.

She swallowed hard, her breath catching in her throat. Every nerve in her body was on fire, her pulse racing as she stared into his eyes. “Everything,” she said finally, her voice firm despite the way her hands were shaking. “I need to know if I’m normal. If… if I feel the way I should.”

He studied her for a long moment, his thumb brushing lightly over the back of her hand.

“Blair, I’m not sure this would be a good idea. You have been drinking. Tomorrow you could regret this and with the amount you have drunk. It might seem like I took advantage of you.”

Blair wanted to know, and Roman was a skilled lover. She got up from the lounge and walked over to his desk, heart pounding in her chest, which echoed with the same throbbing of her core. Picking up his gold pen and the notepad on his desk. Quickly she wrote a statement before signing it, then went back to where he was, standing in front of him between his legs. She looked down at him as she handed him the notepad.

Silently, he took the pad from her, not taking his eyes from her face. Turning the notepad around. He watched her with an intent gaze before he dropped his eyes. He read aloud what she had scribbled down. “I, Blair Warner of sound mind, give permission for Roman Kingston to fuck me, Blair Warner, in any which way he so chooses. Signed Blair Warner. At least you know what day it is.”

Roman dropped the pad beside him on the lounge, then lifted his eyes to her face again. “In any which way I choose, Blair. You could be playing a very dangerous game here.” Roman settled back on the lounge, putting his hands on his knees. She saw his fingers clench and turn white as if he was stopping himself from reaching for her. The sight of him and the deepening sound of his voice only increased her need. Sending shivers down her spine. Blair pressed her thighs together. She felt like moaning.

“Are you sure about this, Blair?” he asked, his voice soft but serious. “Once we start, there’s no going back.”

She hesitated for a moment, her mind reeling with doubts. What was she doing? This was insane. She was about to throw herself at her boss, a man who had always been professional, always kept his distance. And yet… there was something he made her feel… even in this madness.

“I’m sure,” she said finally, her voice steady despite the tremor in her chest.

He nodded, his expression darkening before lifting a hand to touch her, “Kneel in front of me,” Not giving her time to question him, he guided her onto the floor.

Before he leaned forward, putting his hands behind her head, and removed the pins and hair band from her hair. He ran his fingers through the long blonde length that reached her bottom. “Fuck, I knew you had long hair, but this is a wet dream.” Blair never wore her hair out at work. He played with her hair for a moment longer as he spread it out over her shoulders. “Take your jacket off.”

Blair bit her lip. She only had on a camisole under the jacket that had a built in shelf, so she wasn’t wearing a bra.

“Blair, however I choose, remember? Do it.” There was a growl in his voice that did things to her insides.

Blair undid the two buttons of her light jacket, pulling it off her shoulders and down her arms, then off. Letting it drop behind her, uncaring.

He sucked in his breath when he saw her nipples were hard and pressed against the thin fabric of the cami. Lifting a hand from his knee, he rubbed a finger over one beaded nipple. “Pretty. Do you normally come to the office without a bra?”

Blair shook her head. Saying in a shaky, breathy voice. “No, only when we fly.” Because she wanted to be comfortable. Also, making sure it wasn’t obvious that she was braless. Blair groaned as Roman brought his thumb into play and pinched her nipple. Making her close her eyes.

“Tell me what you’re feeling,” he instructed, his voice low and commanding. “Be honest.”

Blair opened her eyes, meeting his gaze. Dan had never been a talker in bed with her, and she hadn’t even thought of it. But Dan had been talking dirty to Laura. Maybe it added a layer of excitement that she had been missing.

“It’s… it’s hot,” she admitted, her voice barely audible. “And tingly. Like my whole body is alive…. almost on fire and my skin feels too tight.”

He smiled faintly, his thumb brushing lightly across the swell of her breast. “Good,” he said simply. “That’s good, Blair. Now, tell me you are going to do everything I tell you to do.”

She blinked, her mind momentarily blank. Did she want that? All she knew was that she needed more from him than just him touching her breast.

“I… I Yes,” she said, her voice shaky. Not one hundred percent sure what she was letting herself in for.

He nodded. Without another word, he leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to her lips. It was soft at first, barely more than a brush of skin against skin, but it quickly deepened, his tongue slipping between her lips to explore her mouth.

Blair’s hands flew to his shoulders, gripping him tightly as she surrendered to the kiss. His taste was intoxicating, something warm and masculine that was making her hotter. If she hadn’t been kneeling on the floor, she would have found herself there. She moaned softly, her body melting against his as the kiss grew more passionate, more demanding.

“Beautiful,” he murmured against her lips, his hands cupping her breasts and kneading them gently through her cami.

Blair gasped, her head tilting back as a surge of pleasure shot through her. His touch was exquisite, every stroke of his thumbs over her nipples sending waves of heat cascading through her body.

“More,” she begged, her voice raw with need. “Please.”

He pulled back. Blair rolled her head round to meet his gaze.

Roman settled his shoulders back on the lounge, slid down a few inches, spreading his legs wider, making his legs cage her in even more. He watched her for a moment before saying. “Now be a good girl and undo my pants.”

# Chapter Six

Blair blinked at him, her surprise clear. She had never been the one to undress Dan when she had been with him; he had always taken the lead in their sex life. Their sexual encounters were usually prearranged, occurring once or twice a week when they were already in bed. Furthermore, she had never experienced being on top.

“Blair, do as I say now.” There was a note to Roman’s voice she hadn’t heard before. She had to bite her lip to stop herself from moaning.

Blair took a deep breath before straightening up on her knees and reaching for his belt buckle. Her hands trembled as she carefully threaded the belt through the buckle. Roman laid his hands over hers. Blair lifted her eyes to his face, lips slightly parted as her breath came out labored.

“Blair, this is your last chance to change your mind. Because once you unbuckle that belt, there will be no putting the horse back in the barn.” Roman removed his hands from hers, sliding both of his arms along the back of the lounge. “So, think long and hard before you take the next step.”

Blair licked her lips. Roman followed the movement, his jaw clenching, a vein throbbing on his forehead, and she saw his hands digging into the back of the lounge. It was a surprise that he wanted her that much that he was trying to hold himself back from tugging her into his arms. The control he had over himself not just now, but all the time. Sometimes drove her nuts.

Looking back down at her hands resting on his buckle. She wanted to experience this. So, without another word, Blair went to work on his belt. Once it was undone, she worked at the button, then moved straight to the zipper. The teeth separating seemed loud to her ears.

“Blair, lock the door. This is going to take some time and I don’t want anyone coming in seeing you naked,” Roman ordered once she was done.

Blair gasped. She hadn’t even thought about their location and the fact that anyone could walk in at any moment. Quickly, she got up on shaky legs and walked across the room to the door, before locking the office door.

Turning around, she leaned back on the door to look at him. He was in the same position she had left him. His eyes intent on her. Her eyes dropped to his opened pants. The throbbing between her legs was almost too much. She pressed her legs together, trying to stop the ache.

His eyes narrowed as he watched her. “Stay where you are and spread your legs.”

“What?” She was unsure why he wanted her to stay where she was. Had he changed his mind?

“Don’t question me, just do it,” Roman told her.

Blair did as she was told, parting her thighs, so her feet were shoulder width apart.

“Touch yourself. Lift your skirt up to you waist and pull your panties down and touch yourself. I want to watch you,” Roman instructed her.

Was he trying to see how far he could push her? The very thought. She had never touched herself before, let alone in front of someone. It wasn’t a case of lifting her skirt and touching herself in an automatic way. This was a seduction. That required some finesse that she wasn’t sure she even possessed. One thing she was sure of, she would not back down now.

Bending forward, Blair placed her hands on each leg just below her skirt. Never taking her eyes from Roman. She knew if it wasn’t for the scotch she had consumed, she wouldn’t have been able to.

As she straightened, she glided her hands up her thighs, taking her skirt up with them. Until her hand slid over her panties. Hooking her thumbs into the band of her lace panties, she pushed them down over her hips. Her spread legs prevented the panties from falling past her mid-thighs. Thinking it shouldn’t be a problem, she bought her legs together so they would drop to the floor. Lifting one foot out so she could spread her legs again.

Roman watched her, saying nothing. She wasn’t sure if she was pleasing him. But Blair was sure he would voice it if he wasn’t happy. Taking a deep breath to prepare herself for what was to come next.

“Blair, I’m waiting. You know I don’t like waiting,” Roman said. His voice was like a warm blanket over her skin, heating it.

Blair held her breath while delicately maneuvering her right hand, gently sliding her fingers between her legs, carefully parting her lower lips.

“Good girl. Now, imagine that it’s me touching you.”

Blair gasped when he said that. Because the very thought of him touching her like this shot her blood pressure sky high. She could feel how wet she was. Circling her opening, Blair gathered the wetness before using two fingers to pinch her clit and tug at it until the nub was hard and erect. So sensitive to the touch.

Blair closed her eyes, letting her head fall back against the door. Who knew having someone watching her while she was touching herself would be a turn on. But it was. She had never felt so worked up. Blair groaned as she felt the pulsing intensify.

It wasn’t long before she needed something more. She needed him. If she couldn’t have that now, then she would do the next best thing. So she sunk two fingers into her channel, working them in and out of herself. Imagining it was Roman’s cock. Crying out, she clutched hold of the doorknob with her free hand.

“Blair, don’t make yourself come.” Roman was talking, but she was so focused on the fantasy she could barely hear him.

“Fuck, Blair, stop. Now.” The demand was so forceful the words penetrated her brain. Blair stopped. Crying out one more time as her walls pulsed along her fingers.

Opening her eyes, it took her a moment to gather herself. When she did, her eyes widened at the sight of him. He was in the same spot on the lounge, but his cock was in his hand as he worked it up and down. It was the size of him that shocked Blair. She didn’t realize that they could be so big.

“Come here,”

In a haze, she removed her fingers from inside of her before she stepped out of her panties, leaving them by the door, and walked to him. Her skirt worked itself over her privates. Blair stepped between his raised knees, close but not touching, not taking her eyes from him.

Taking her right hand in his, he brought her hand to his mouth and sucked the two fingers she had used to pleasure herself. Roman groaned at her taste. It was enough to almost buckle her knees. He only released her after he had licked them clean. By then, she was ready to self combust.

“Drop down on your knees again.” He told her, his gaze intense. Reaching up, he took her other hand in his own. Helping her into position. When she was where he wanted her.

“Now baby, you are going to suck my cock.”

Her eyes looked at his huge cock before lifting to his. “But?” She was going to ask how it would fit.

He smiled at her. “Blair, however I choose, remember? You will suck my cock. If you are really good. I’m then going to fuck you so hard.”",1,1753079870.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1m5bnsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1m5bnsf/update_the_annoying_pain_was_chronic_gastritis/,Update: The annoying pain was chronic gastritis type C,"Hello everyone, here's an update to a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1k16goh/stomach_pain_is_back_and_worse_than_ever/) because maybe it can help someone else.

To sum it all up, since more or less July 2024 I started having really annoying stomach pain that got worse for no apparent reason, and only calmed down by eating and laying down. I started fasting early 2025 and the fasting gave me some relief, just not always. 

I finally got a gastroscopy and a diagnose: chronic inactive gastritis type C. The stomach lining's inflammation has been there for a while but since it's not active, my stomach doesn't hurt all the time, just at random. It also does not work as it should and that explains a lot of the discomfort. We could not pinpoint what caused the gastritis as it's not bacteria, stress, (ab)use of medicine, alcohol or cigarettes... Considering other symptoms I believe it could be a sensitivity to gluten, but that's being tested at the moment.

What this means for me and my lifestyle: to give my stomach a chance to recover, I have to stop drinking coffee and carbonated drinks altogether (I consumed a lot of black coffee and carbonated water since I started IF); stop eating sugar, acidic or fatty stuff, processed food, foods with gluten... The list is long. And although fasting does help recovering the stomach, I was advised to go from 18-20h of fasting, to 12-16h as a maximum, and also to make smaller, more frequent meals during the day. This felt like a huge setback for me, as I was progressing and was pretty much used to fasting, but health is first and if I'm mindful about my choices during the eating window, I can manage to keep on track. 

Just to clarify, my pain was NOT caused by fasting, it started way before my IF journey, but I have to adjust how I'm going about it to not cause further damage to my stomach.

If you've experienced any discomfort -apart from hunger lol- that does not go away, make sure to see a doctor! I for sure should've gone a long time ago.

TLDR: After a year of stomach pain (prior to the beginning of IF), I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis and was advised to reduce fasting hours, avoid coffee and carbonated drinks, and change my diet to give my stomach a chance to recover. ",5,1753079861.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

There is a part of the SCP 096, and more importantly, the 096-1-A incident log, that I feel is completely unrealistic. How on god's green earth is there on whatever SCP site they were on no break room and let alone NO COFFEE!

I find that having no breakroom on site, hell, not even an open office where the owner of that office is relatively lax about people entering and taking a breather, very dumb in terms of site design, hell, barracks and sleeping quarters would probably be a break room on-site as well. But fine, let's say it's a small site solely devoted to SCP 096 (which seems kinda dumb but sure), I refuse to believe that there is NO coffee on-site at all! This is the SCP Foundation, where researchers are up at dawn and working till dusk and guards are constantly working day in and day out to keep some of the greatest hells behind locked doors, and you're going to try and convince me not a SINGLE person on that site either has a coffee maker, has a stash of instant coffee or that the site itself doesn't have a coffee machine?

I'm not saying that Dr. Oleksei and Dr. Dan wouldn't have been caught, I mean the site is probably loaded with cameras (unless this was an SCP 096 devoted site with no cameras), all it takes is one look at said cameras to determine that Dr. Oleksei is not actually getting coffee but is hiding away somewhere as if he knows something is going to happen.

The point of this is to say, there is no reasonable way to say there wasn't a break room, office hangout area, or hell, even a cafeteria or sleeping quarters on site, and let alone there was NO coffee at all on-site. And the better question is, how the hell would they know there is no coffee on-site, like there's no way someone wouldn't sneak any in or demand it from the site admin. Unless it was a regulation for the site itself (In which case Dr. Oleksei would have known beforehand and not mentioned anything about coffee), and that has GOT to be the most unrealistic part of this entire SCP story.

I'm 25M and have a 22F gf from sometime. We have problems from sometime regarding our physical intimacy such that she used to avoid me and gets very moody when she wants to be intimate. 

I have been suspecting that she's cheating me because I saw some marks on her body which I didn't give, she casually ignored it and said it was me and I don't remember because I was drunk that day.

I once again caught her when she smelled differently. She usually wears ocean perfumes and that day I could smell a faint nutty coffee perfume note. When I asked her, she said it's because she went to shopping and her top caught the smell from those changing clothes in shop.

I visited her flat yesterday to meet normally. I mostly let her know beforehand but yesterday I didn't and went directly. She opened the door late and said she didn't expect me coming without informing. I was just chatting and flirting as usual and noticed her bathroom was closed. I asked about it and she said some plumbing work is going on but I didn't agree and forced her to open it. I found two naked guys inside. She said she's sorry and actually both of them are gay and her friends and they didn't have place so they were in her place to do it. I asked the guys to dress up immediately and leave the place otherwise I'll beat them so badly. 

Later I asked her full explanation and she admitted she was cheating. She said she's sorry about it and will never do it again and it all happened just because of her foolishness.

Hey you,

This letter doesn’t come from bravado or ego. It comes from the deepest truth I’ve ever known. This isn’t a man trying to win something, it’s a man who already found everything when he found you.

Neither of us were looking for anyone that night. We had both been carrying our own stories quietly surviving, not searching. We were just two souls, bruised and tired, both craving something we couldn’t name. We weren’t out to fall in love we had no idea that love was waiting for us.

But then… we decided to snuggle.  Just friend holding each other.  So we thought!

It started small. Gentle. A simple snuggle, nothing more than a moment of comfort between two friends. A human touch. A shared breath. A need we didn’t speak aloud, but both deeply felt. We didn’t expect it to become anything. Just warmth in a cold world.

But that moment! God, that moment became everything.

Because when I held you that night, I didn’t just hold a body. I held peace. I held home. Your green eyes looked straight into my soul, and for the first time in so long, my blue eyes saw someone who wasn’t afraid of my truth. You leaned into me fully clothed, fully human, fully you and with that single gesture, you rewrote what peace meant to me.

You didn’t rescue me. You met me. In the dark. In the silence. In the ache.

We had both been through our own kinds of chaos, betrayals that left scars, lies we tried to believe, endings disguised as beginnings. But that night, your breath near mine, your body curled against my chest, my soul sighed. Like a river finally freed from the dam. It didn’t crash. It didn’t roar. It simply flowed the way it was always meant to, bending, reshaping, softening everything hardened by life.

We weren’t falling in love. We were healing.

And in healing, we found something pure, something we didn’t expect, but couldn’t deny. Soulmates. Not in a fantasy way, but in the realest, rawest sense. Two people whose wounds recognized each other. Two hearts that weren’t just open, they were ready.

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. But I also see now that love alone isn’t enough when we haven’t healed the parts of us that were still hurting. It wasn’t love that failed. It was the pieces of me I hadn’t yet faced.

That’s on me, my love.

Please know, I heard you. Every word. Every truth. Even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass me by. For the past four and almost six months, I’ve been sitting with the mirror, with the pain, with a therapist who is helping me walk through the wreckage. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror. You made me realize that if I want to love you the way you deserve, I have to become the man I deserve to be.

And because… I want you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first person I have ever truly, undeniably, wholeheartedly loved. Not in a way that sounds good on paper, but in the way that makes me certain I will marry you one day, if you’ll let me.

And if I leave this earth before you, know that my soul will stay. Holding your hand while you sleep. Whispering love into your dreams. Because my love doesn’t end not with distance, not with silence, not even with death. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise, if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, you will never hear my voice raised in anger. Not once. There will be nothing that will separate us again! We will never again choose to leave, we will choose to stay and grow! Together, like we both know we were ment to! I promise you this… I will always stay.

I want the life we almost had and more. I want the laughter, the chaos, the coffee in bed, the kids running through the house, the late-night talks, the forgiveness after the hard moments, the honest love that says “you’re safe here” even when life gets loud.

I don’t want a perfect love. I want ours.

This isn’t just my truth, it’s my invitation. To you. To us. To the kind of love that deserves to rise again. Not because it’s flawless, but because it is real. And real love? It’s worth the fight. It’s worth the healing. It’s worth a second, or in my case third and final chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor. No games. No ego. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready.

If even a piece of your heart remembers that night, that peace, that love… I’m here.

I am already ready to come to you, my home.

Forever and Always,
Your blue eyed love

I’ve been launching side projects for years, and one thing always annoyed me: making a decent logo.

I’m not a designer, and I didn’t want to keep picking from the same overused logo templates. So I built \*\*\[ChatGPTLogo.ai\](https://chatgptlogo.ai/)\*\* — a free tool that uses ChatGPT to actually \*design\* logos based on your idea, instead of just rearranging pre-made icons.



No templates, no drag-and-drop UI. You just describe your brand, and it generates unique logo ideas — and yep, you can download clean vector files too.

\### Some use cases I built it for:

\- 🧋 Making a logo for a coffee shop side hustle I’m planning with friends  

\- 🏋️ Testing visual branding for a simple gym challenge tracker  

\- 🛍️ Helping friends get a quick logo for Etsy stores and indie online shops  

\- 📬 Naming a Substack or newsletter and wanting to “see” how it looks  

\- 🚀 Giving my MVP landing pages a more polished look before sharing



It’s been fun seeing what kinds of logos it comes up with — sometimes surprisingly creative, sometimes... weird 😅



Would love any feedback — good, bad, feature ideas, or logo fails it generated. Let me know if this is something that would be useful in your projects!

We were together for nearly five years, I cheated on her, and she left me forever. I’ll keep things as anonymous as possible out of respect for her, but I wanted to share my story here.

We began dating as teenagers. Starting as strangers who’d occasionally make eye contact in the hall at our high school, it wasn’t long before we connected on social media and I ended up asking her on a date. We never looked back.

We continued strong throughout high school, becoming as close of friends as I’ve ever experienced. We were our first everything, and it was very much the idyllic young love that folks fantasize about on the screen. It wasn’t long before our families were spending holidays together and planning vacations. The two of us had our issues and arguments from time to time, but we always knew how to communicate, apologize, and stand by each other when things were difficult. We were very young, but I think we knew how strong our connection was.

Eventually the time came when we had to prepare for college. We had ended up choosing different places for school. Most of our mutual friends did what high school couples do and called it quits around then, choosing to start fresh instead of accepting the challenge of long-distance. We didn’t want that.

The first year of college went well. We maintained steady contact during the semesters and made up for the time away when we reunited back home for breaks and holidays. I was so proud to tell other people that we were making long-distance work. We’d built a steady foundation of trust and stayed true to the love we chose.

Things changed in our second year of school. I’d taken on a new job and was more absorbed in the hustle of my daily life at college. She got busier too. I’d never been the best at organizing times to call on the phone, but it got much worse. I’d floated the idea of us making a schedule to call to make time for the other person, but she wanted spontaneity. A couple months into the semester, she’d asked if I wanted to take a break. I was shocked, such that I didn’t even register it as a genuine question. I dismissed it quickly, reassuring her that we’d been together for so long and were just experiencing a rough patch. She agreed, but the truth was that we were becoming distant. She just felt it sooner than I did.

When we came back for holidays, we started arguing more than we had before. Little things would blow up into silent treatment and uneasy apologies. We’d argue in public and around friends. But we were still trying to make it work.

Now is an appropriate time to mention my part in our dysfunction. I’d become less and less transparent about my feelings during our relationship. I believed that I could handle things on my own to keep our peace (if it wasn’t already clear that this was being written by a man, let that be the indicator), but the truth was that she’d become increasingly judgmental as the years went on, opening up insecurities about myself that I never had. I’d also struggled with an addiction that predated our relationship, and it was something she’d found out about only a year on. I initially lied to her that I was getting better, but she found out, leading to a meltdown on my part where she made me promise that I’d never relapse. I relapsed within a couple weeks, and I thought that if I ever opened up about it, she would dump me right there. So I hid it, convincing myself that it was less of a problem than it was. She’d even check in occasionally to ask if I’d relapsed, telling me it was okay if I had, she just wanted me to be honest. I wasn’t honest.

The semester following our tumultuous holiday break, I’d gotten into partying. My coworkers at my new job were big on the college bar scene, and so I decided to start joining them on their nights out. I found out that I had a decent alcohol tolerance, and I started going overboard. While I never reached the point of vomiting or blacking out, I’d often be the most intoxicated person in the group. You can see where this is going.

One night I went out with my coworkers and got plastered, went overboard at the pregame and didn’t hold back once we made it to the bar. After a couple hours, we called it a night, as some friends helped walk me home. I decided to go back to one of my coworker’s places. We were decent friends and she’d planned to get some food which I was craving after our night out. Next thing I know, she admits that she has feelings for me and I was taken completely off-guard. She was someone I’d never thought of in that way, and I was uninterested for obvious reasons. Now confused and uncomfortable, I decided I wanted to cut the tension in the room. So I kissed her. My logic in the moment said that it didn’t matter because I didn’t have feelings for her. We kissed again and then I was out for the night. It never went further than kissing, but the damage was done.

I hid it from my girlfriend for a week, and my coworker continued to tell me that I had to tell her. I wanted to deliver the news face-to-face, but we wouldn’t be meeting again for weeks. I knew it would only be worse if I continued to hide it from her, so I’d decided I’d call her and tell her, one week from the day that it happened.

Unfortunately, my coworker told my girlfriend everything just a couple hours before I planned to call. We called throughout the day, and I foolishly hid the fact that we’d kissed more than once, which she’d find out from the other girl. She was heartbroken and devastated, we both ended the call flooded with tears and she decided that space was needed. I spent the next month fighting desperately for the relationship. My actions opened my eyes to all the things I’d been doing wrong and I was determined to turn things around and make it work. This was just a really, really rough patch. But we’d made it through before and I had belief that we’d overcome it through my taking accountability and doing some genuine work on myself. I entered some severe stints of self-loathing around this time. I’d never fathomed that I would betray my partner, and I was deeply hateful of the fact that I did.

Ultimately, she decided that she didn’t want to be together anymore. We went on some dates during the break and she’d had some belief that we’d figure it out, but during a week in which we were no-contact, she changed her mind. I didn’t want to believe that this was the end, so I poured my heart out to her in a handwritten letter, taking note of all the wrongs I had done before, during, and after cheating on her, and telling her everything I wanted to do to make things right. Opening up about my continued addiction, making a promise to her that I’d find a professional to help me work through all of it. She said no. I won’t get into the details of her decision, but it sent me spiraling. I opened up about every issue I’d had with her in the relationship, exploding at her in an unhealthy fit of rage and sorrow. I knew that I had done something horrible to her, but I was fixed on the hope that the strength of our relationship would prevail (in hindsight: it was a crumbling connection, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise that she made the decision she did during our break). I didn’t handle things well.

A couple months later we spoke again to exchange items. We’d meet for coffee and I proposed that we try reconnecting as friends and work through the pain together. She didn’t want me in her life anymore, whether it was as a friend or a partner. So I let her go for good, knowing it was the only act of love I could give her. It still hurts, but I made a promise to myself that I’d give all I could to helping her, and letting go was the only option.

I’m continuing to work on myself and reflect on all the things that led up to my decision, and I hope that she’s continuing to find herself again. I write everything here with a message to the folks on this sub: be considerate to the people you love and remember the value of trust. The pain of betrayal is something that no person should ever have to experience. It is an incredible gift in life to love and love deeply, and it’s a terrible waste to squander it with selfishness.

To the person who I hope never comes across this post: I miss you, and I hope you’re taking care of yourself. May my distance from your life be the greatest apology I can give.

Straws are commonly made from stainless steel, glass, silicone, or bamboo, each with its own unique benefits.

**Leak-Proof Design:** The best lids feature a secure, leak-proof design that prevents spills and keeps beverages fresh. Silicone gaskets or O-rings create a tight seal between the lid and the jar, ensuring that liquids stay contained even when the jar is tilted or shaken. This is particularly important for on-the-go use or for storing liquids in the refrigerator.

**Straw Compatibility:** Lids designed for use with straws have a precisely sized hole that accommodates various straw diameters. Some lids feature a silicone grommet around the straw hole to provide a snug fit and prevent leaks. The best options are compatible with both straight and bent straws, offering versatility for different drinking preferences.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Lids and straws should be easy to clean to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of bacteria. Stainless steel and glass straws are dishwasher safe, while silicone and bamboo straws may require hand washing. Lids with removable silicone gaskets are easier to clean thoroughly.

**Durability and Longevity:** High-quality lids and straws are built to withstand regular use and repeated washing. Stainless steel and glass options are particularly durable and resistant to damage. Silicone lids are flexible and less prone to cracking than plastic lids. Bamboo straws, while eco-friendly, may require more careful handling to prevent splitting or splintering.

**Variety of Sizes and Styles:** The best brands offer lids and straws in a range of sizes to fit different mason jar openings, including regular mouth and wide mouth jars. Lids are available in various styles, such as screw-on, flip-top, and sippy cup designs. Straws come in different lengths, diameters, and colors, allowing users to customize their mason jar experience.

## Core Benefits

Investing in quality lids and straws for mason jars offers several practical benefits that enhance the overall user experience.

**Improved Convenience:** Lids with straws transform mason jars into convenient drinking containers, perfect for smoothies, iced coffee, water, and other beverages. The straw allows for easy sipping without having to tilt the jar, reducing the risk of spills. This is especially useful for children or for on-the-go use.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Using a straw minimizes contact between your lips and the rim of the jar, reducing the spread of germs. This is particularly important in shared environments or when drinking from a jar that has been sitting out for a while. Additionally, using dedicated lids prevents dust and debris from entering the jar, keeping your beverages clean and fresh.

**Reduced Spills and Messes:** Leak-proof lids with silicone gaskets prevent spills and messes, making mason jars a more practical option for storing and transporting liquids. This is especially helpful for packing lunches, picnics, or for storing leftovers in the refrigerator. The secure seal also helps to keep food fresh for longer.

**Environmentally Friendly:** Reusable lids and straws reduce the need for single-use plastic alternatives, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle. By using mason jars with reusable lids and straws, you can reduce your environmental impact and help to protect the planet.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in quality lids and straws may be higher than disposable options, they ultimately save money in the long run. Reusable lids and straws can be used repeatedly, eliminating the need to constantly purchase disposable cups, lids, and straws. This can add up to significant savings over time.

Here are some frequently asked questions about lids and straws for mason jars:

**Are stainless steel lids and straws safe for use with acidic beverages?**
