Off The Vines (last one) - another surprise! Smells like tomato vines, but not like in a ""omg you smell like tomato"" kinda way 😅 Eathy, fresh, and long lasting. I could still smell it after showering!  

And look at that cute squirrel candle holder! I wish I could pop the bottom of the leafy one to put lights in though...

I'm using a bottomless portafilter, run the machine and as soon as I start to see coffee seep through the screen, I cut the shot and let it infuse for about 10 more seconds and then restart.

I notice when the shot runs again that it has some spurting.

I run a 1:2.5 ratio (17g ground coffee :42g liquid coffee).

Curious if this is normal? My prep is the same as always, and I don't have any channeling.

Shot tastes fine and it helps reduce the acidity a bit better, but curious as I'm not very educated on pre-infusion. ",1,1760835464.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 and a half years and have lived with him in our house for two years. Technically his house I’m not on the mortgage. I have no where to go live if I wanted to leave. We have three dogs and two cats and if we split one dog and both cats are mine. I love my animals and cannot part with them. And I would miss the other two so much. None of my family can take me in or help me financially my mother is in the same boat, stuck in a relationship she is miserable in because the economy is fucked and can’t afford to live alone. There is no way I could afford an apartment with prices this high right now on top of bills as well. I am so depressed and have thought about ending myself for a while but don’t think I actually could. My boyfriend is a useless piece of shit who thinks just because he works until 6 and I work until 4 it’s my problem to do the dishes, clean the house, make the bed, feed the dogs, play with them, feed the cats, do their litter while he gets home he shouldn’t have to as he worked later then me. I’m so tired of living with a child who doesn’t clean up after themselves and leaves clothes on the floor when the basket is five feet away. Whenever I ask for him to do the dishes or empty the trash it’s such a big deal and takes it as me nagging him. He probably wonders why I don’t touch him or barely kiss him anymore, I’m so disgusted and he gives me the ick! We have sex maybe once every two- three weeks. Video games are my only escape and he hates that all I do on weekends is game on call of duty with my friends. He’ll fall asleep at 9:30 and I will stay up until 3 am gaming with my only friends. So tired of this life. To add he also wants kids really bad, but there is no way I am having a kid with this lazy piece of shit. He says he’ll change and do better if we have a kid but nope! I don’t believe it. No way am I doing double the work I already am when he gets home from work all he wants to do is sit on the couch and drink beer, no way is he going to want to take care of a kid. I have tried talking to him many times about how just because he gets home later doesn’t mean he shouldn’t have to help clean the mess he made. Fuck he’ll dirty a whole ass laundry basket in two days! And I won’t for a whole week. I’m just so fed up with everything he does he never wipes the counter after making a huge meal, always walks through the house with his boots on after I busted my ass cleaning, toilet seat always up, clothes on the floor, beer cans on the coffee table the list goes on.  Anyways is anyone in this boat with me? I am just so done I don’t know what to do, I want to leave so bad but I am so trapped and cannot get out.

My name is Elias Thorne, and when it comes to surviving the rigors of life; chess has always been my cope of choice. In a world brimming with chaos, deadlines, breakups, and endless doom scrolling; the board was my realm of sanctuary. 

Sixty-four squares of pure logic, where kings fall and pawns rise, all under my control. Or so I had led myself to believe.

It started last fall, during one of those rainy afternoons that make you crave the old and forgotten. 

I wandered into an antique shop on the edge of town, the kind with dust-caked windows and a bell that jingled like an unheeded omen.

The owner, an elderly man with eyes like marbles that have lost their once splendorous sheen, nodded from behind the counter. ""Looking for a challenge?"" he rasped with a smirk on his face; as if he knew exactly why I was there.

Tucked in a corner, half-buried under tarnished silverware, was the chess set. Ebony and ivory pieces, carved with intricate details; knights with snarling horse heads and queens with crowns like thorny vines. 

The board itself was comprised of mahogany, worn smooth from countless games, with faint scratches that shared a striking resemblance to runes I have read about. 

I could not identify them, but the exquisite craftsmanship of this etchings magnified my desire to acquire this antique; a desire I struggled not to reveal on my face as I conversed with its seller. 

""Belonged to a grandmaster,"" the old man said, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""Lost his mind in the end. Played one game too many."" I laughed it off. Classic salesman pitch. 

I had already been convinced to buy it; now it was a game of how low the price could go. His initial price was $333 Employing my strategic bartering skills I haggled him down to 200 bucks. 

As I left, he muttered something under his breath: ""Beware the eternal match."" I didn't think much of it. Was this roleplaying part of his stores appeal? Well it worked.

I had already begun to fantasize what I would purchase on my next visit. Maybe something to with an aesthetic that would pair well with this new game. That night, back in my cramped apartment, I set up the board on my coffee table. 

The rain hammered against the window like impatient fingers. I brewed myself a cup of tea, dimmed the lights, and decided to play a solo game. Me against myself, to practice openings. 

I moved white's pawn to e4. Standard King's Pawn Opening. Then black's to e5. Mirror image gambit.

But as I reached for the next piece, I froze with hesitation. The black knight... had it shifted to another square? Just a fraction, from g8 to... no, it was still there. *Must be the shadow*s, I told myself. 

Or my excitement of playing on such a luxurious board. Shaking my head I continued, but the air felt thicker, like the room was holding its breath. 

By move ten, I was deep into the match, queens exchanged, rooks eyed each other across the board. 

That's when I heard it; a soft click. Like wood on wood.

I looked down. My white bishop was gone from c4. Not fallen over.... gone! My heart skipped. I searched the floor, the couch cushions. Nothing. ""Okay, Elias,"" I muttered, ""calm your excitement."" 

I looked at my cup of tea which should have been soothing my nerves, but was seemingly failing to do so. 

I reset the piece from memory and finished the game. White won in a checkmate that felt too easy. As I packed away the set, I swear the black king toppled over on its own, rolling under the table with a clatter.

The dreams started that night. I was at the board, but my opponent was a shadow;  faceless, with hands like claws. Every piece I captured screamed, tiny voices echoing in my skull. ""Sacrifice,"" it whispered. 

""The game demands sacrifice."" I woke up sweating, the clock read 3:33 AM. My mind whirled to the boards original price; $333. Coincidence, right?

The next day, I couldn't shake the anxious cloud around me. Work was a blur. I'm a data analyst, crunching numbers that suddenly looked like chess coordinates. On my lunch break, I googled the set's markings. 

Nothing definitive, but one forum post caught my eye: ""Cursed boards from the 1800s. Tied to Reznura or some forgotten master. Players vanish."" Bollocks, I thought. Urban legends spun up for clout. 

But that evening, I set it up again. This time, I played black.

Move one: White's pawn advanced on its own. I blinked, rubbed my eyes. No, it hadn't. Had it? I laughed nervously and responded. But by move five, it happened for real. 

The white knight had leaped forward. Not slid, leaped! Landing with a thud that vibrated through the table. I jumped back, knocking over my chair. 

""What the hell?"" The room grew cold, frost was creeping on the window despite the blasting of the heater.

I should have stopped. Thrown the thing out. But chess players... we're addicts. The challenge pulled me in. ""Fine,"" I whispered. ""Let's play."" I made my move. 

The board responded instantly; pieces glided like they were alive, guided by invisible strings. The game was brutal. It anticipated every trap, and every gambit I threw at it. 

I lost a pawn, and outside, a car alarm blared – my neighbor's, the one who always parked too close. Hmm coincidence?

Then I captured its rook. A sharp pain stabbed my finger; a splinter from the board? No, blood welled up from nowhere. And in the distance, sirens wailed. Later, the news app pinged: ""Local accident. Pedestrian hit by reckless driver."" 

The victim? My ex-boss, the one I'd cursed under my breath a hundred times. My hands shook as I stared at the board. The captured rook lay on its side, stained red.

That night, the dreams intensified. The shadow opponent leaned in, its breath like decay. ""Each capture claims a soul,"" it hissed. ""Play to the end, or join the pieces."" I woke to find the board set up again, pieces in mid-game position. 

My white king was surrounded, one move from checkmate. But I hadn't touched it.

I tried to research more. Dug into chess history; stories of Paul Morphy, the prodigy who went mad, seeing ghosts in every endgame. Or the Mechanical Turk, that hoax automaton that hid a human inside. But this... this was no hoax. 

I posted anonymously on Reddit's r/chess ""Haunted chess set? Pieces move alone."" The replies were mixed; trolls laughing, and a few serious ones linking to occult sites. One user DM'd me: ""Destroy it. 

It's the Immortal Game reborn – but with real immortals.""

I couldn't destroy it. The pull was too strong. That evening, compelled by the mystery, I sat down. The board waited, white's turn to move. As I advanced a pawn, my phone buzzed, a text from an unknown number: ""Your move."" 

My blood ran cold. I responded on the board. Click. Another text: ""Good. But the queen is vulnerable.""

The game dragged on for hours. With each capture, reality warped around me. I took a bishop, my landlord called, screaming about a burst pipe flooding his apartment below mine. He slipped in the water, broke his arm. 

Ambulance lights flashed outside. Coincidence? No. The board was feeding on the last few strands of stability my life had to offer. The irony that this board I had assumed; like many other boards would provide my life with peace and serenity was injecting chaos into my world with surgical precision; was not lost on me.

It captured my knight. Pain exploded in my leg. A cramp? No, I collapsed, my knee buckling like it'd been kicked by an assailant with a steel toe'd boot. I limped to the mirror: a bruise forming, shaped like a hoof. 

Panic set in. I swept the pieces off, but they rolled back into place, one by one. The black king up righted itself with a defiant click. ""Finish the game,"" a voice echoed. Not in my head, in the room!

Low, gravelly, like the antique shop owner but distorted.

I played on, sweat dripping onto the squares. The entity was masterful – it forced me into a zugzwang, where every move worsened my position. 

I sacrificed my queen to buy time. Outside, thunder cracked, and my sister's FaceTime call came through: ""Elias? The power's out, and... oh Goodness, the dog's not breathing!"" Her golden retriever, Queen, dead from a sudden seizure. 

I screamed, hurling the board against the wall. It landed perfectly, pieces undisturbed.

The final night. I barricaded the door, but the board was there, glowing faintly in the dark. The shadow from my dreams materialized; not fully, just an outline at the table. ""Resign, and you lose your soul,"" it said. 

""Win, and claim mine.""

We played. Hours blurred into eternity. It was the game of my life. Feints, deceptions, discovered checks. I cornered its king, whispering ""check."" The shadow laughed. 

""Mate in three."" But I saw it – a flaw in its defense. With trembling fingers, I moved my rook.   
  
""Checkmate.""

The shadow shrieked, dissolving into smoke that seeped into the board. The pieces trembled, then laid still. I had claimed victory. Relief washed over me. I boxed the set, drove to the river at dawn, and hurled it in. 

I watched it sink. But that night, as I lay in bed, a click echoed from the closet. I opened my closet to find waiting for me; the board, dry and waiting. A new piece on the white side: a pawn carved in my likeness, eyes wide in terror.

I keep on changing. I love espresso, lungo, Allonge, and pourovers. I love the variety I get from the Fellow text, but lately I have fallen pretty strongly for 3 brands main brands. My top three these days are: 

PERC, Brandywine, and Saint Franks.   
I love the bold flavors Brandywine is pushing out, and have had so many good beans from them. I love their fun branding and the fact that they keep making coffee a fun and unexpected thing -such a good start to the day. Bringing Brandywine with my travel pourover system really saved me when I have been traveling a lot. Last year I had around 180 days in Hotels...and I hate most hotel coffees with a passion. 

Lately PERC had some good 30% offers that made me buy a lot from them, and every coffee is good. They are super good at expectation management with their (3) color-coded weirdness meter. Even their weirder coffees are not as weird as the weird ones from Brandiwine. I find that balance in their fermented coffees is just a dash better right now. 

Finally Saint Franks - one of my offices is right beside one of their outlets and every cup is good. Their beans are usually super good, well-balanced, good notes across the board and predictable but maybe not with as much wonder. Much more traditional, albeit very high quality. 

So I am thinking....any other brands to test out? ",1,1760835233.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have the Costco signature version ninja luxe. My wife and I went back and forth between the Costco signature and pro but ultimately decided on the Costco signature version. Mostly this was due to cost as we got the Costco signature version for $440. I am normally drip coffee person do to convenience, but I have always enjoyed a good Americano which the Costco signature version can't do as conveniently as the pro version. 


So on my little journey to figure out the best way to make an Americano on my machine. I tried a couple of different things. 


First was doing an empty shot of classic coffee with the quad filter. However, this just took too long and I had to do a rinse shot to clean the screens adding to the time. The Americano turned out really good, it just took too long to complete in the realm of 6 to 8 minutes.


Playing with it a little bit more over the past couple of days and I think I have found The Sweet spot.

1. I will do a double espresso shot with an empty portafilter to rinse the screens. 

2. Still with the double espresso basket on. I will select the quad espresso with an empty portafilter on strength one. This gives me about 120 mls of hot water This step only takes about 45 seconds if that. 

3. I will then do the normal process for a double espresso and voila a better than good Americano in my opinion.

All in all, it takes about 2 to 3 minutes from my initial rinse to the completion of my Americano. Overall, I'm happy with the quality and quantity of the Americano. 

If anyone else has some cool tips or any questions let me know.",2,1760835168.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

Morning came faster than most anticipated. As the sun poked its head out from beneath the distant horizon, it signaled a wake-up call to the busy residents of Sunny Town. Most mons knew the drill by now: wake up at sunrise, eat breakfast, say goodbye to loved ones, drop the kits off at school, or head straight to work.  
The routine was simple for most. Some would find it soul crushing, but many found comfort in its simplicity. It was something they knew to be their own, and even if they faced death on a daily basis, this routine became their lifeline, something to give them respite, everymon's own little bubble in their crazy world.  
But, as is true for any rule, there were exceptions. Mons that wanted nothing more than to not have to work a single hour in their lives, or mons that were chasing distant dreams, while being supported by their parents. The latter was the group a particular Sylveon and her pervy brother fell into, still undecided about their future... which only meant one thing, when the sun came up.

\-""Mornings... I hate mornings... five more minutes, Mister Sun!!""- The sleepy Sylveon proclaimed. Another morning, another chance to think about what she wants to do with her life, at least that's what her father keeps telling her. Why can't she just... not? There are still so many things she wants to do before choosing a job, why rush such an important decision.

But suddenly... as if a switch was pulled inside her brain, Silvia jumped up from her bed and raced out the door. After she got ready, the Sylveon rushed over to the living room where a Glaceon wearing glasses was currently reading a newspaper, and drinking a cup of coffee.  
\-""Good morning Daddy!""-  
\-""Hmm? Morning Silvia, you sure are... excited today""- Looking over at the Sylveon who was practically bursting with excitement. Her pink tail was wagging with feelers wobbly aimed at the Glaceon, practically one command away, from picking up her dad, to jump around with him.  
\-""Rem-Remember what we talked about?!""- Blurted out Silvia, her words barely hearable due to the sheer excitement she was feeling.  
Frank put down the newspaper and looked at his daughter. His expression was the same bland look he wore all day, every day...  but suddenly... was that a hint of regret? Sadness whatever it was Silvia failed to notice as she waited for her fathers response  
\-""Look, Silvia... I know how much this means to you and your friend, but... is it really a good idea to live with six complete strangers? I mean even that Espeon has-""- But before Frank could continue Silvia interrupted.  
\-""Daddy the treehouse will be on the other side of the town in the nearby forest. I can come visit whenever I want to! I'm not an Eevee anymore! I can take care of myself!""- Frank just sighed at her daughter's words, not saying another word before the Sylveon continued.  
\-""You always tell me to think about my future! This is the perfect opportunity for me to think outside the box! Please-please-please-please I would-!""-  
\-""You certainly learned some big words, haven't you?""- chimed in the Glaceon, cleaning his glasses before continuing.  
\-""The point I was trying to make is... you're right. You're not an Eevee anymore, and If you really want to live with complete strangers in the middle of the woods, then I wont stop you.""- Hearing these magic words the Sylveons eyes lit up, as she almost fainted.  
\-""Thank you daddy!""- She cried while rushing in to hug her father.  
The hug turned out to be much more suffocating than Frank anticipated, with Silvia squeezing the last bit of air out of him.  
\-""I-I can't breathe!""-  
\-""Is everything alright in here? Also good morning!""- Wandered in an unaware Umbreon. Hearing his voice Silvia immediately let go of his father and raced to greet him.  
\-""Big brother! Big brother! Daddy said yes big brother!""- she shouted while wrapping the Umbreon in her ribbons, and rushed to hug him.  
\-""Silvia you're going to-""-\***CRACK**\* An audible crack came from the Umbreons back which shattered in mere seconds upon coming in contact with his amped up sister.  
\-""My back!!!""- Gai screamed before losing consciousness

After 2 hours Gai finally started to come to his senses. He found himself in a hospital bed with a worried looking Sylveon overlooking him. His dad wasn't far, sitting in the corner of the room still reading the same newspaper he had during the ""incident"".  
\-'Yeah dad, don't let your only son's hospitalization stop you from catching up on this week's latest news story""- he thought to himself. Next to the Sylveon stood an Audino currently writing something on her clipboard.  
\-""I'm sorry big brother!""- Silvia said with tears streaming down her cheeks.  
\-""It's fine Silvia... happens""- responded Gai in a nonchalant voice, while screaming internally.  
\-""Is he... Is he going to be okay""- Asked the Sylveon in a worried voice. The Audino just looked, then back to her clipboard and with a big sigh continued.  
\-""He's going to be okay, he fainted out of panic, not due to any real injuries.""- Hearing this all three mons were relieved, until Silvia looked at the clock, panicked and began rushing out of the building.  
\-""Oh I just looked at the time! I need to run! Bye Daddy, big brother!""- Gai was left flabbergasted as his sister went from worrying about his safety to not caring in an instant. Frank just nodded and told Silvia to be back by nightfall.  
\-""She... she just left,""- Gai said.  
\-""Yes, she did,""- Frank replied, returning to his paper.

\-""Coming through! Sorry!""- Silvia yelled as she raced past mon after mon.  
\-""Ow... Watch where you're going Silvia!""- A Garchomp yelled as Silvia stepped on his tail.  
\-""Sorry Mr. Rag!""- Silvia yelled back as he continued running to her destination. After a couple of minutes she finally arrived.  
In front of her stood a white, hyper sanitized complex, with construction all around.  
\-""What's going on?""- Silvia asked a nearby Excadrill, who was hard at work reinforcing the walls of the laboratory. When the Excadrill went to answer, he was cut off by a familiar voice coming from behind the Sylveon.  
\-""That, I'm afraid, is classified Silvia.""- Answered a little Shinx slowly walking down the stairs.  
\-""Oh Terence! I've been waiting... Wait, where's Speedy?""- The Sylveon asked, looking confused at ""Terence"" the Shinx who just face pawed.  
\-""It's still Trace Silvia... remember? We've known each other for what... two years now?""-  
\-""Oops...""- Replied Silvia just hoping Speed didn't witness the whole ordeal. Although, looking around she couldn't spot the Jolteon anywhere.  
\-""Umm... Where's Speedy?""- She asked the Shinx.  
\-""Oh didn't he tell you? He quit this morning.""-  
\-""He... he quit?""-  
\-""Yeah, told me he wanted to quit and that I may not see him again in a long time.""- Hearing this, Silvia's heart dropped.  
\-""He-He just left?""-  
\-""Yep.""-  
\-""Did he tell you why?""- Trace went to answer the question, but before any words left his mouth, the Shinx bit his tongue, and rather than continuing said something the Sylveon really didn't like.  
\-""Look... Silvia. If he didn't tell you, then I have no right to. I don't really understand it myself but it might be related to Cl-""- The eyes of the Shinx went wide open as he stared at the ground, quickly gazing back up at the still present Sylveon. Then nervously started scratching the back of his head.  
\-""Oh! You caught me rambling again! Darn! Silly me! Oh look at the time! My lunchbreak is over! Well Silvia it was nice talking to you, see you soon!""- With that Trace ran back into the laboratory disappearing behind the revolving doors.  
Silvia was left even more confused than before, but defeated she began walking away.

The once full of joy Eeveelution now walked with her head held down, ribbons dragging along the ground and ears hugging her pink and white head. Her serene blue eyes were barely visible as she trodded along the path.  
How was she supposed to find him? What happens now? How could Speed just leave without a word, were all things circulating in her head. Were all boys like this? It first happened to Pearl, now her. Then she started thinking back to what Terence was talking about.  
\-""Cl is certainly an interesting reason to quit your job, I wonder what that could b-""- \***BAMM**\* Before she could even finish her sentence she bumped head first into a different mon, walking in the opposite direction.

Opening her eyes, she couldn't believe what she saw. Standing on all fours in front of her stood a feline creature with blue and white fur. He looked hurt as he kept rubbing his head over and over and over again.  
\-""Owie!""- He shouted. Silvia quickly recognized the mon as her expression shifted once again with joy overtaking her once more.  
\-""Oh my Arceus! Cloudy! What are you doing here?! It's been so long sissy!""- She shouted, wrapping the Shiny Sylveon in ribbons.  
\-""Oh, it's you... It's good to see you too, Silvia.""- Cloud proclaimed,after snapping out of the confusion from the head on collision.  
\-""It's so good to finally see you again!""- Silvia continued before remembering something, and immediately letting go of the hug.  
\-""...Wait...""-  
\-""...What?""- Cloud asked before being slapped on the cheek by one of Silvia's ribbons.  
\-""Ouch! What was that for!""-  
\-""For breaking Pearl's heart! How could you do that to her?""-  
\-""Silvia...""-  
""Do you know how upset she was?! She cried for days! She-""-  
\-""I left to s-save my little brother's life!""- Cloud shouted, catching Silvia off guard.  
\-""He is more important to me than anymon in the world. So goodbyes had to wait until I got back.""-  
\-""...You have a brother? Cloudy... You never told me... Does Speed know?""-  
\-""...No. Speed doesn't know either.""- Replied Cloud trying to hide the truth from Silvia as much as he could. Silvia just pondered Cloud's response. A secret brother she didn't know about... how could it have never come up? But it doesn't matter, there are more pressing issues at hand.  
\-""By the way... Have you seen Speedy? Trace said he quit his job and disappeared without even a goodbye... Sounds familiar?""- she nuzzled Cloud's cheeks before he pushed her away with a ribbon.  
\-""Ouch! Cut that out Silvia!""- Silvia however, wasn't playing around and grabbed Cloud with all of her ribbons holding him up in the sky for everymon to see.  
\-""Have you?! Seen?! SPEEEED!""- The Sylveon shouted, ready to practically snap her shiny counterpart in half.  
\-""N-No! I have no idea where he is! Please don't hurt me!""- Cloud squealed as Silvia held her up with her ribbons. Then suddenly he fell to the ground.  
\-""Hmm... you can thank our old friendship, for me letting you live.""-  
\-""My saviour.""-  
\-""Well I would love to dilly dally, but I need to run. Talk to you later Cloudy!""-

With her goodbye going unanswered Silvia hurried over to Pearl, where she was greeted by a kind Flareon.  
\-""Hi Miss Blaze! Is Pearl home?""-  
\-""Oh? Hello dear! Yes, she's in her room. Do you need me to call her or...""-  
\-""Thanks Miss Blaze, but I want to surprise her.""- With that the Sylveon sprinted into the house past Blaze who was left standing in the door. She smiled at the Sylveon who had become one of her daughter's best friends.  
\-""Kids these days...""- She mumbled to herself.  
Silvia ran straight to Pearl's room where she almost broke down as she entered.  
\-""S-Silvia?""- Exclaimed the Espeon currently sitting at her table, baffled by her friend's sudden appearance.  
\-""Daddy agreed!!! Also Hi Pearl!""- She screamed. Pearl needed a second to understand what the Sylveon was even talking about, but when she did a small smile came over her face.  
\-""That's great! We're so close now. Only 2 left....""-  
\-""Yep! Also, guess who I just ran into! Hint! His name starts with C and ends with d!""- The smile quickly disappeared from Pearl's face as the Espeon looked to her side.  
\-""Yeah, I-I know he's back...""-  
\-""Is everything alright?""- Asked the Sylveon with worry in her voice. After taking a deep breath Pearl managed to compose herself and the smile came back over her face.  
\-""Yeah, don't worry, I'm fine. How was your day?""-  
\-""Ooh where do I even start!""-",1,1760835116.0,u_Heroend1,1,1.0,False

A few weeks ago I started having some bloating issues, which is something that I have almost never dealt with in my life. It started as light bloating at first and then ramped up to be a very extreme burning sensation in the front left side of my abdomen somewhat quickly.

The bloating eventually turned into a burning sensation, kind of like a hot cold pack, right around my spleen area. I went to a walk-in clinic a couple of times. I went in a second time when it had gotten very bad. They told me that they could either schedule labs for me or I could just go to the hospital. I opted for the former. They did some blood work, X-Rays, and an Ultrasound. They said that they did not find anything alarming and that I would need to talk to my primary care provider for more information. I have an appointment with my PCP in a couple of weeks.

For now, they have me on Omeprazole, which is helping significantly but not completely. The burning is heavily reduced, but I still feel more pressure in that front left side area than other areas. I get bloated from just about everything, including water if I don't take it down very slowly throughout the day. The thing that has been the most friendly and perhaps even soothing for me is Greek yogurt, which I have been doing pretty much every morning.

I expect that my PCP will refer me to a specialist so that I can explore this more.

Let me go over things that were different about that week.

* This happened around the same time that I was having some car issues, so I was experiencing a bit more stress than usual.
* The only thing that was unusal about my diet that week was that I had a lot of [Spinach and Herb Wraps](https://www.walmart.com/search?q=spinach+tortilla+wraps) with LandOFrost Sliced Turkey Breast, and different spices including cheese (cheddar and pepper jack), Louisiana hot sauce, and Terry Ho's Yum Yum sauce. The Yum Yum sauce had been opened a while back, but was not past expiration. I am suspicious that it may have been bad.
* I had a coffee maker that had a bit of coffee in it with some mold on top. I cleaned it out using dish soap and baking soda. I'm concerned that this may not have been enough and I consumed mold.

Here is what I'd hope to find from this Reddit post.

* What are some probable causes in a situation like this?
* What kinds of things might they have ruled out with the labs that they did?
* How can I best take care of my health to make sure that I don't make the situation worse before I have a long term plan?
* What should I be doing or thinking about that I may not be?

Final note: I take a lot of supplements. I started getting more serious about my health and fitness a couple of years ago and have added these over time. The rules say I should include as much information as possible so... have fun.

Morning:

* Omega-3 fish oil
* Vimersom Health Multivitamin for Men
* Mushroom supplements: Host Defense my community, Turkey tail, resihi
* Taurine
* Ashwaganda (I don't take this frequently) and usually only a few weeks at a time)

Mid Day:

* 5-10mg of creatine monohydrate with a protein shake or a Huel meal replacement shake

Night:

* L-theanine and aspigenin (usually cycle these)
* Magnesium L-Threonate
* Zyrtec
* Melatonin (infrequently)
* L-Lysine, Glycine, NAC (I started taking these in the last couple of months by recommendation and have not researched them as much of the others.. they made me sleep like a baby though.

Surface-level content like coffee chats, makeup videos, getting ready with friends, keeps the casual viewers entertained…It’s light digestible, and doesn’t demand emotional investment.

Deeper, emotional content - processing grief and therapy targets the more discerning audience: the “smarter” or more empathetic viewers who care about context, vulnerability, and authenticity. These videos also subtly signal credibility and emotional intelligence from her, and notably rack up hundreds of thousands of likes more than her pumpkin bagel hauls.

Posting makeup and coffee chats in the bathroom just five months after a traumatic loss shows she’s testing boundaries on SM and using her own comeback like live A/B testing. She’s seeing which types of content resonate, what drives engagement, and how far she can push the narrative with Brady before the full reveal of their relationship and regular programming returnable. There’s a calculated risk bcuz coming back too soon could alienate viewers if mishandled, but blending surface-level relatability with structured emotional dialogue softens the re-entry, and is creating dependability on her posting and videos.

This serialized rollout is a controlled narrative she very clearly cares about where she can manage pacing, perception, and audience reactions in real time while constantly adjusting based on what she sees.

4 years ago resting heart rate randomly shot up to over 200. Bp shot up to 240 over 180. Head felt like it was about to explode. Took ambulance about 40 minutes to arrive and by the time it did everything went back to normal, hospital is 5 blocks away... they did an ekg said everything was fine and sent me on my way


3 years ago intestines swelled visibly as in you could see the outline. Every step felt like something was tearing. I could barely breathe. ER docs said the swelling was putting pressure on my diaphragm but the CAT came back normal so they were just going to kick me out. I was sweating from the pain and had to beg with tears in my eyes for some anti inflammatory medicine as nothing helped. They finally did gave me some steroids through IV and it cleared up almost instantly


2 years ago It was basically the same thing as the year prior but not as bad this time. 


This year stopped breathing in my sleep as that little flap in your throat kept randomly getting stuck. Esophagus began swelling causing impacting. Teeth became insanely cold sensative. Could not drink coffeeat all that started hitting me like a new allergy. Began getting uncontrollable migraines that left me confused and with blurry vision. Walking left my throat so raspy that I was constantly using an emergency inhaler and water actually made it worse. And had a feeling of impending doom, never had that before it is horrifying. Began passing blood from the bum. And bp suddenly went from normal to normal 160/110

They thought I had an ulcer but nothing on the endoscopy. They did like 3 cats on my gut due to the massive pain and bleeding that accompanied it but it showed nothing and the colonoscopy showed only hemmeroids but nothing that looked bleeding

They ran some tests but only thing that came back was a high ALT of around 85 and early stage fatty liver. But nothing else. 

They tried telling me it was anxiety but the only thing found was that benadryl for some reason cleared my upper throat problem but nothing else the blood pressure stayed high. At the same time no allergies... thought it might be chronic sinus infection with post nasal drip but still getting tests done

Overtime its mostly gone away still get the swollen throat oh and dramatic weight gain and loss keeps swinging between the two. One month down 15 pounds another month up 10 with no changes. Also can drink coffee again with no issue



Now that January is coming around soon Im decently afraid and just need to write this down. 

Like if I know why something is happening im fine with it and can face it head on but not knowing what random BS is going to hit me this year is honestly just a paranoid fear that is getting under my skin. This year has really turned me into a hypochondriac. Been to a cardiologist pulmonologist Gastro immunologist ent 

The last 3 are still ongoing with immunologist and ent bouncing be back and forth between each other and Gasto looking for silent reflux but im convinced it was some hormone break down but primary doctor said during that time he knew nothing about hormones and endocrinologist said they would only see me if tests came back which primary just refused to run.

Description: # CRO Lead
**About Euc**
‍
**We’re making good health last a lifetime**
‍
More than 1 billion people globally live with obesity — a major leading indicator of many preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
‍
**Eucalyptus** (or 'Euc' for short) is the company behind Juniper**,** one of the world’s largest weight management programs combining GLP-1 medication with a tailored nutrition and exercise programme, supported by our multidisciplinary care team. It is also behind a growing family of digital healthcare clinics (Pilot, Kin, Software, Compound) across men’s health and well-being, fertility, skincare, and preventative health. These clinics create one ecosystem designed to make good health last a lifetime. 🌿
‍
Our published clinical research on Juniper demonstrates that patients in our program are 4x as likely to lose significant weight through their course of treatment. For our other clinics, we apply the same evidence-based philosophy of combining medical science, personalised care, and behavioural insights to improve patient outcomes.
‍
Since launching, we’ve grown fast to support millions of patients. In the last 12 months…
‍
  * Globally, grew revenue by >130% YoY, while reducing cash burned by 90% YoY, with over $100M USD raised from global investors such as BOND, NewView, Blackbird and Airtree (early backers of companies like Canva, Stripe and AirBnb)
  * Grew to over 100,000 monthly active patients globally across our weight management program
  * Grew from 4,000 to ~40,000 patients in the UK, and received selective NICE endorsement to provide service to the NHS
  * Tailored our offering to over 5,000 patients in Germany and Japan, with a goal to extend our patient base to over 30,000 patients across both markets in 2025


‍
**What’s next?**
‍
Our goal for the next 3 years is to be supporting 1 million patients globally - to live better for longer - by launching into new conditions, demographics and geographies as we move towards our vision of creating a preventative healthcare ecosystem.
‍
We’re going to build the world’s largest international digital healthcare company. This will be really hard to do, but very rewarding and possibly, the adventure of a lifetime with some of the best operators you will ever work with.If that gets you excited, let’s talk.
##### About The Role (What You'll Be Doing)
‍
**Build the experience that transforms how Australians take control of their health.**
‍
Starting treatment isn’t a simple transaction—it’s a decision shaped by emotion, uncertainty, and often, years of hesitation. In healthcare, the real barrier isn’t just process or price—it’s fear, confusion, and a lack of clarity around what comes next.
‍
As our **CRO Lead** , you’ll be responsible for building the most thoughtful, effective, and emotionally intelligent conversion journey in the world. This isn’t just a test-and-optimise role—it’s an opportunity to reshape how patients experience care from the very first interaction.
‍
You’ll uncover what builds trust and what creates hesitation. You’ll design journeys that feel safe, clear, and supportive—helping people move from _“maybe one day”_ to _“I’m ready now.”_ With the right mix of creativity, experimentation, data, and empathy, you’ll turn friction into confidence, and intent into action.
‍
  * Deeply understand our patients and the problem we’re solving for them. Go deep into the science, get hands on with the product, dive into the numbers, speak to patients and our patient-facing teams, leverage our panel of experts, learn from other industries
  * Leverage these insights to identify opportunities and prioritise a conversion optimisation strategy and testing plan
  * Collaborate with Design, Copywriting, Product and Engineering, Lifecycle analysts, etc. to execute each test to a high standard and ensure every change aligns with brand, tech, and clinical requirements
  * Track and report key metrics and test outcomes, and iterate your strategy accordingly
  * Analyse test outcomes, communicate results, and iterate your strategy accordingly
  * Build a culture of rapid experimentation, continuous learning, excellence, curiosity, and deep patient empathy
  * Continuously improve and scale the team’s CRO processes


‍
##### **About You (Who You Are)**
‍
  * You have between 3-5 years experience working in either:
    * CRO, experimentation, or growth/product roles
    * A high-pressure environment (law, consulting, investment banking) plus operational experience, preferably in a high-growth digital start-up
  * **Clear communicator with a creative instinct** – You have a sharp eye for copy, UX, and user journeys that convert—not just because they’re functional, but because they speak to how people _feel_. You instinctively translate insights into high-impact creative or structural changes that address emotional and psychological barriers. You communicate incisively, honestly, and often—able to synthesise complex concepts into clear, compelling narratives that resonate across teams.
  * **Creative problem-solver and detail oriented** : You are highly organised, and not fazed by complex or ambitious problems. You are able to think critically, and break down big goals into smaller workstreams to empower others to act. You can design, manage and scale processes, adapting them as required at the various scales of the operation, and ensure a high degree of accuracy in your outputs. You’re not just solving for logic—you’re solving for human behaviour, and you account for the emotional friction that often shapes conversion in complex decisions.
  * **Analytical and tool-savvy** – You’re highly comfortable with numbers and bring an analytical mindset that turns performance data into clear, strategic recommendations. You know how to identify the right tools for A/B testing, experimentation, and analysis—and you’re confident figuring out how to use them effectively. You’re comfortable building and launching no-code or low-code experiments, and you collaborate with Design and Engineering to scale the winners.
  * **Craving for curiosity** : You are self-motivated to understand the reasons beneath the surface of the numbers. When metrics are off track, you are not satisfied until you have interrogated the system deeply to determine whether the issue is intermittent or persistent and requires thorough evaluation and improvement of the system. When metrics are ahead of track, you seek to understand whether it can be replicated across the business before celebrating the win.


‍
**As our CRO Lead,**
‍
  * **You’ll shape how patients experience care** – At Juniper, your work doesn’t just move metrics—it helps people overcome fear, shame, and hesitation to take control of their health. You'll build journeys that make starting easier, faster, and more emotionally supportive.
  * **You’ll test and ship, fast** – We’ve removed the red tape. You’ll have the **budget, tools, and stakeholder buy-in** to run high-impact experiments and bring big, bold new ideas to life quickly. No long chains of approval. No over-engineered process. Just momentum.
  * **You’ll join a high-trust, high-autonomy team** – We hire smart people and let them lead. You’ll be the go-to expert in your lane, with full accountability and support to drive change across landing pages, messaging, UX, and full-funnel experiences.
  * **You’ll grow faster than anywhere else** – CRO at Euc is at the intersection of product, performance marketing, creative, and patient psychology. You’ll stretch your skills daily, get regular feedback, and be supported with a professional development budget and mentorship. We're championing the next generation of talent – Euc has been recognised in Hatch's Hotlist as a Australia's top employer, as rated by Gen Z's.


‍

We're past the halfway point in OCTOBER!!! The time to get swept away in the amazing vibes that come with Fall is HERE! Even though I ammm framing this as a fall thing, I am definitely looking for something long term! Its just that fall is so romantic, I just want to experience all of it with someone!

I love everything that fall has to offer, the seasonal coffees/teas/treats (I want to know your favourite cafe for these!), the fall events (whether its food, or otherwise!), the FASHION (shopping dates!!), fall DRIVES (goodness me, driving through the outside of the city when the leaves are all colourful is SUCH a treat!) and of course, the finale to top it all off, HALLOWEEN!! Fall brings so many amazing, wholesome, and heartwarming vibes, and I'd be looking for someone to engage in it with!

What you get with me:

* A chatty conversationalist, who wants to know all about you, and make you feel seen and appreciated
* Someone who's always happy to try something you'd like to do, while also pitching interesting date ideas you might not've heard of
* Someone who's physically affectionate (cuddles, hugs, proximity), but also understands boundaries and isn't here to overwhelm you or make you feel objectified
* I'm emotionally intelligent, literate, and empathetic! I can read the room and am always doing so. I'm here to make sure we BOTH have a good time, and this is built on COMMUNICATION and UNDERSTANDING
* Someone who's super nerdy, and is all about making you feel comfy with your hobbies
* Physically (if this matters), I'm 6'1"", on the larger side, and South Asian (ethnically)

I don't think I'm looking for anything specific in terms of YOU, but I'd just ask that you also love fall, or are looking to be won over by it, and that you maybe not be a dry communicator! I don't do well with 1 word/curt replies, and actually struggle with those a lot, thats not to say you can't be an efficient communicator, but I'd be looking for a back and forth, not wanting to feel like I'm bothering/spamming you!

I'm not too concerned on where you'd be located, I drive, and am happy to spend time doing so if I know you're as into this as I am!

This feels like a product that we've all been waiting for....finally a true plastic-free lid option for our travel beverage containers. It does have a silicone gasket to ensure proper fit but is entirely made of ceramic aside from that. I'm incredibly tempted to buy one to try it but thought I would ask my fav community if you have any experiences with this first? Or if you know of any better options out there?

It does not fit all travel containers but sounds like it fits many standard ones that are on the market right now (most Yeti's, Stanley's, etc.). And it is a replacement for those plastic lids that coffee shops use for their hot beverages. (Yes I'm aware of the microplastics in the cups so I don't get those, but maybe we have friends or family who get those hot beverages and might like this lid option!)

Also, I reached out to the company for more details and learned that they are made in China and are lead-free. Just to pass along some additional information :)

Turns out he was an AI-assisted NPC, and now my app is bricked. Worst $5k I ever spent.","Hey y’all, I need a serious vibe check because I’m spiraling.
I run a small side hustle—an automated inventory tool for small-time e-commerce sellers—and needed a solid backend dev to integrate a new API, which was low-key essential for scalability. My budget was tight, so I posted on Upwork and a few other international boards, looking specifically for talent outside the usual high-cost zones.

The Interview- I found this guy, let’s call him ""Liang."" His resume was immaculate—perfect English, degrees from impressive-sounding unis, and a portfolio that looked like it was designed by a graphic artist, not a coder. He crushed the initial interview (over WeChat video, slight lag, but whatever). He was super polite, constantly saying ""bet"" and ""fire"" which I found cringe but, hey, points for trying to adapt to the culture. His price was $25/hr. I thought I had found the jackpot.

The Red Flags (Which I Ignored Because I Have Main Character Syndrome)
 
The Code Velocity- For the first week, he was a machine. He was pumping out boilerplate functions faster than Copilot. I was like, ""Wow, I’m getting so much value!"" In hindsight, he was literally just using ChatGPT and templating the easiest parts of the project.
 
The Time Difference Vibe- His replies were 12 hours late, which is normal, but they were always identical: ""Will investigate now, friend."" or ""Progress is strong, very optimized."" It felt like I was talking to a custom-trained NPC with three dialogue options.

The Meltdown - The moment I gave him the complex task—a truly custom, proprietary encryption layer for handling user data—the performance dropped to 0.
 Day 1- Very complex. Need extra time. Will deliver EOD (End of Day).
 Day 2- Nothing.
 Day 3- I ping him aggressively. He sends a massive .zip file with 5,000 lines of code. I check it. It’s literal spaghetti. It’s full of deprecated libraries, comments in Mandarin (which I Google Translate, and they just say things like ""This is bad code"" and ""God help me""), and the encryption layer? It was a plain text file. He didn't even try to secure it.

The Final Boss Level: I jump on a frantic video call. His camera is off. I ask him to debug the single most critical function (which was now actively crashing the entire database). He starts reading error messages back to me from the console in a slow, stilted voice, as if he’s never seen them before. I realize he has absolutely no idea what’s happening in the code he submitted.
I fired him on the spot. I demanded the money back for the 20 hours I paid for the brick he delivered, but obviously, he just ghosted. Blocked me on WeChat, Upwork, and deleted the Slack account.

Paid $5,000 for a “senior developer” who was clearly just a kid with an excellent resume and a reliance on LLMs to generate simple code. The moment I gave him a non-standard task, he nuked my entire development environment with junk code and disappeared.
I’m currently in a panic trying to hire someone to unf*ck this mess, and the database is still giving me the silent treatment. Send coffee and good energy, fam. 😭

I tried to eat less spicy food, was really watching what i ate and if I’m being honest i feel like i hardly ever ate anything besides drinking my coffee and lots of water.

Still yellowish seedy. Crying wasn’t bad. Today, crying has been bad. Made him a breastmilk bottle since I pump and he would cry throughout the feeding. Latches on and off all while crying. Sounds kinda phlegmy after feeding. Takes forever to burp. Stiffens up and only seems to be comfortable if he’s on his stomach. Like lying on my chest. Poop looks seedy yellowish greenish but also stringy? Is it mucus? Idk i guess im just confused like is this normal 4 week old behavior and their little bodies need to adjust? Is it acid reflux? Is it an allergy? Has anyone ever been through this? I do have an appointment scheduled with his pediatrician soon.

IMDb Summary: In 1882, a young Russian aristocrat goes on an epic adventure to find out what happened to her grandfather and save her family's reputation.

Starring the voices of Christa Théret, Féodor Atkine, and Thomas Sagois. 

This is a beautiful animated film. While we’ve had it for a few years, it’s not one we pull down off the shelves terribly often. 

The story, while interesting and beautifully rendered, is a rough one. 

While our young traveler is off on her adventure to bring the honor her family deserves, she is robbed, left in a few horrible situations, and experiences great loss. 

While noted in a few places that the animation is simplistic, Zedd and I both melt into it after we begin to watch. 

There are a few of these foreign animation productions that we have already purchased, like *April and the Extraordinary World* and *A Cat in Paris*. There are a few more still on our list like *Calamity, a Childhood of Martha Jane Cannary* and *The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales*.  

The stories tend to be a bit more complicated and absolutely gorgeous. Animation, but not necessarily for kids.

my personal experiences as a chef and business owner — 
I hope they help anyone planning a food trip to Nashville!


Fat Belly Pretzels:
Friendly service and a clean space. We tried four different sandwiches — all well-balanced and delicious. They use balsamic dressing generously, maybe a bit too much since it overpowers the other flavors. The Jalapeño Cheddar pretzel was a bit greasy and heavy for me. Overall, a great spot for lunch.

Buttermilk Ranch:
We tried twice (Tuesday and Wednesday), both times had a one-hour wait. They don’t take reservations, so be prepared. I’m not waiting an hour for breakfast on a weekday, so can’t comment on the food.

Hearts:
Since we couldn’t get into Buttermilk Ranch, we went to Hearts — and it was amazing! No wait, great coffee, and a nice vibe.

Edley’s BBQ:
Sadly disappointing. We got the tri-meat platter (pulled pork, chicken, brisket) — all dry and lacking flavor. The baked beans were overly sweet, and the coleslaw needed more acidity. The only highlight was the cocktails. Not worth a visit.

Arnold’s:
A true southern gem! The roast beef and pork ribs were incredible, and prices are very reasonable. Great service and real passion from the owner. Highly recommend.

Husk:
Think of it as the fine-dining version of Arnold’s. Everything was outstanding. The menu changes daily, and they list where each ingredient comes from — impressive and definitely worth visiting.

Sho Pizza:
One of the best pizzas I’ve ever had — incredibly light crust and excellent desserts. A must-try.

Noko:
A recent James Beard Award winner. The appetizers and cocktails were great, but the chicken and cod dishes fell flat — dry and bland. The dessert was disappointing, made with cheap soft-serve. For Noko’s standards, I expected much better.

Two Hands:
Fantastic breakfast spot. The smoked salmon toast was delicious and well-balanced. Highly recommend.

Hattie B’s:
Skip it. Quality has dropped as they’ve expanded. Chicken isn’t as crispy as it used to be, and the mac & cheese and banana pudding were terrible.

Brave Idiot:
They offer 10 spice levels for their Nashville hot chicken. I went with level 3 before my flight — still insanely spicy! Flavor is okay, but their brine and spice balance need work. Google rating (4.9) feels overrated.

Opryland Hotel:
Not a restaurant, but absolutely worth visiting. Don’t say you’ve been to Nashville without stopping by.

Maiz de la Vida:
Nice ambiance and good service, but food is average. Nothing special from a chef’s perspective.

The Iberian Pig:
Extremely overpriced. The Iberico pork was good, but portions were tiny, and they even charge extra for almonds and olives with the charcuterie. Not worth the money.

Jeni’s Ice Cream:
It’s commercial, not homemade. Tastes fine, but I prefer Van Leeuwen — much better flavor and texture.

Either way I have been out of my lisdexamfetamine (generic Vyvanse) now for 5 days (it wasn't until I was fully out that I realized I didn't get my usual text message from the pharmacy saying I could pick up my next batch). 

I've been on this medication for 5 years at a pretty high strength, so naturally I am having a rough go of it and now it's Saturday so I will be waiting till at least Monday to get this sorted out. 

Since I've been on medication so long I feel like I've just forgotten all of my coping skills that I had built up in the 24 years of life I had beforehand and now I'm just a fidgety, exhausted, forgetful, and impulsive mess. I work in a coffee shop and today I felt completely useless. I've worked really hard to be a dependable, hard worker and am considered to be one of the best trainers they have. I've explained my situation to my manager and she is very understanding, but of course that doesn't make me feel like less of a lazy lump.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this, what did you do? Does anyone have any tips for ways to cope in the short term so I can be somewhat useful at work? 

I know being at a coffee shop would make caffeine and obvious answer, but unfortunately my daily level caffeine consumption is much to advanced for that avenue to be effective. I just get more fidgety with the same amount of brain fog. Not that that stops me from trying lol.

Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you 😁",2,1760833222.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

Should I move forward?","So some context i messaged an old friend from school who i havent talked to in a while. We went out for coffee, caught up and it all went great. We then bonded over several things, pets, anime (we watched anime movies together, and she even felt comfortable sharing stuff about her past. She knew I liked her all throughout this and it all seemed good. Then her pet passed away, keep in mind the bond between these 2 was huge. This made her tell me that she cant reciprocate my feelings for her and we've been distant ever since. She went silent for 2 weeks, and is now occasionally sending memes to me but no real conversation. While this is happening she is back with other friend and getting back into her life. One thing is I dont blame her, I understand grief is what's happening right now and I was more than happy to give her the space she needed. My question is, is it foolish to still have feelings for her? 

Its not like either of us messed up or disrespected the other. Life simply happened to get in the way of an otherwise healthy thing we had going. ",2,1760833205.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

1oabrui,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1oabrui/eating_lunch_together_every_day/,Eating lunch together every day,"Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I just started a new job a few weeks ago and I feel ridiculous complaining about this, but they provide us lunch every day (and it’s quite good) but it means we all (my whole team, including my boss) eat together… every day. It’s usually at a fairly inflexible designated time, too, kind of early in the day (I prefer to take lunch later, like 1 or 2, and power through the morning.)

The thing is, everyone inevitably ends up talking about work or work-related topics, or just the company in general. So I don’t feel like my lunch break is an actual break. I’ve had previous jobs where I didn’t really take a lunch break but I usually would walk across the street and grab a coffee and a snack, so like 15 minutes or so, but getting up and getting some alone time to disengage from work felt good. 

The thing is it’s not required but the one day I had something scheduled at the designated “time” (a training) literally four different people came by my desk to ask why I wasn’t at lunch. 

Is there any option to get out of this in the future (while I’m new, I do plan to comply) or do I have to suck it up and deal? Has anyone else ever had this and what “excuse” do you make? It really sucks to not even be able to run an errand or take a quick walk to clear my head because it’s not a real lunch “break.” ",0,1760833171.0,jobs,3,0.5,False

What I'm planning to do:

1) sprinkle pink salt on a plate and draw a cross with dominant hand

2) write a petition and burn it and mix the ashes with coffee and cinnamon and add it to the cross, add orange peel powder on all sides (to call in happiness from each direction) and place star anise on top 

3) sprinkle rosemary and basil (for protection and clearing obstacles), catnip (for joyful and playful love), lavender (for calm and peaceful love), rose petals (great romantic love), jasmine (spiritual love) cloves (flame of passion) lemongrass (to clear obstacles) 

4) place pink and orange candles in the middle, anoint the candles with return to me and come to me oil, light the candles, write petition on bay leaves and burn them with the candle flame and put the ashes on the crossroads

5) dispose of the remains in a nearby lake

Sadly, where I live I can't get my hands on Abre  Camino so I'll have to use what I have.

My goal is to clear the obstacles between me and my ex partner reuniting. The problems we had were mostly mild and related to his doubts and fears.

It will be built with insulated panel walls and roof, so that will help with keeping it at a proper temperature, will have ceiling fans and ductless mini splits

The common area/ community center will be where people talk, there will also be a community kitchen in that area, we also plan to have some rescue cats living in the common area, we will have wall furniture and perches for them

We will have rescue dogs but they will be on the other side of the property

  
I figured since the slab will be placed that just sealing it would be cheaper, or a bit more expensive would be polishing it and sealing it

We will have some rugs, tables, chairs, bean bags, etc; so people can talk, play board games, etc;

For the kitchen we plan to have durable plastic plates and cups and steel coffee mugs to avoid breakage

There will be lots of traffic in this area

Which would be a cheap and durable option?

People say that concrete is bad for talking and that its more fatiguing, for the kitchen we could put rubber mats all around it

Perhaps groutless tile for the bedrooms to help reduce noise levels? Groutless is an idea cause we might not remember maintenance every 2 yrs

Concrete for the bathrooms and shower?

I only have my son 3 weekends a month, so before i picked him up yesterday my partner and i set up the computer in the back room where he normally stays, hes brought his computer before and we've set it up on the desk in there before, my mom agreed thatd when he's here he'd stay back there unless my brother (40m) came to visit.
While setting up my partner moved a table (like a coffee table)  my mom had in the back room along the wall and stacked 3 boxes on it, 2 totes one larger one (12 gallon tote with a folding lid) with photos and family history paperwork for my moms geneologie stuff, a smaller tote (16qt) with more paper work and a box with toys in it (transformers and some legos and a throw blanket) its not a heavy box, i called my dad to ask about moving the tv into his room after we moved the boxed up computer, desk chair and stand mixer we put it along side his bed where the other stuff was to keep it out of the way, the issue came with the table, when i got  home from picking up my son, my mom proceeded to tell me it was disrespectful to move stuff in her house (which shes right i only asked about moving the tv and not the table or totes). The table and totes have not left the room only moved about 4 feet from where it was to along the wall, she said we could have damaged her photos in the tote, and that i dont live here im just staying here, we've been here since wednesday the 15th, my mom told me to leave when i was 21 because i got a tattoo and again at 28 when i stayed with them when i found out my ex wife was cheating on me and went through a divorce, i dont understand whats wrong with me or what, my oldest brother has lived with them his whole life and they have no issues with him, im not just not sure what im doing,  if i get depressed (diagnosed with major depression, an anxiety disorder) she tells me im manipulating her and making her feel bad, i felt alot emotions coming so i went to the garage and cried in the bathroom so my son wouldnt see me upset.

I met this women through work, at time see was married and I recently single.  I was seeing other woman at the time on and off.

I struck up a friendship with this woman and grew to like her and find her attractive and jun overall fun to be around 

One day she told me that she found out that her husband cheated on her.  She seems mortified and lost.  I said I couldn't offer advice, but perhaps we  could grab a coffee and let her air it out.

We messeged back and forth over Facebook, till I decided to give her my number to go for that coffee.

Which we did and she talked about issues and not being happy at work.

Messages continued, but found out she briefly tried to go back her husband and had a pregnancy scare, which she was relived didn't happened.  She then kicked him out.

She ramped up he messages to me and became more flirty.  Turned out that we both liked each other.  And we wanted to go the next level.  Intimacy which was a risk for me due to my position.  But we agreed it to be low key and casual 

Things delevoped and we became more.

Few months ago by and see falls pregnant and tells me.  She worried about my reaction, I was fine with it.  Unfortunately she lost it, when she finally told me I sat in silence, Tru ng to process what she told me.  

Once she told me and went to her parents house, I cried and drove home.  I struggled to process what she told me, and we still intimate and she fell pregnant again not long after.   

Around this time she told me she was going to a concert with a female friend.  And she posted it social media, it turns out her ex also went to same concert so I challenged it, she was adamant of the female friend.

She also tell me she getting a divorce.

We attended a function few weeks later and both caught COVID, feeling rubbish from that and still reeling from her miscarriage.  I text her and I dumped her.

Very next day I had instant regret and realized what I had done.  But she didn't want to hear it.  Following week's I acted desperate trying to talk to her, that I made a mistake.  One time turning up at her house, which looks old ng back as wrong.  She said she needed time.

Fast forward few months I hear that she back with her ex husband, so again I challenged it.  She denys it 

She still ranges to see me and hang out.  One time we go back to mine and be intimate again.  But see was like it a one time deal 

She again aranges to see me but this time at her place and she admits to me that she was intimate with her ex husband, and deny that they are together.

We continue to meet and intimate on few occasions.

The birth of my son comes round Feb 2023 and I was  excluded from it all.  And I found out he was born two days days after his actually birth.  

It later turns out she was back in a relationship with her ex husband from the previous October and it was in attendance of my son being born.

This rocker me hugely and I became angry at her.

He ex husband was posting pictures of him and my son together as if he was the father.

I met my son two weeks after he was born and she told me she had made a mistake, but didn't say more than that.

We continued to meet so I could see my son.  And told me she was with no with her ex again, again intimate on a few occasions.  

She was messaging too in evenings, sometimes calling me.  One night we exchanged messages then went quiet.  Then I received few messages, but not in her style so I exchange a few.  I was like this is odd so I took a drive and found his car outside the house.  I left a voicemail saying she was lying to me.

She heard it a called in a panic in the morning saying what was I on about, that the messages weren't her and not on her phone.  He deleted them after he sent them.

She told me she deal with, but guess what she did nothing. 

So I took matters into my own hands and I messaged her so called husband and I told him everything we had done together he was in denial.  But mention that my son could be his.

Go forward again few weeks and I'm at hers visiting my son and she acting all flirty, we kiss.  Implying  she wanted me but now I restrained myself, good thing I did because ex husband turns up and stands in the door way.

I say few choice words to him and he try toi blame me for trying to break up his relationship.  I point he did that by cheating in first place and not to use me as the excuse. 

And that she had consistently denied that they back together.  

He grabbed my son and said that it was his son, I lost it and pinned him against the wall and said that if he claim to be father, do DNA test to prove it, he instantly went quiet and she even said to him you know your not the father 

He went on to say that they had sex together when me and her together and she glared at him to say you know that not true.  So with that I told her m everything well done in the house and he instantly went quiet and asked me to leave.  She was going to call the police.  I left.

Went quiet for awhile didn't hear much from her then one day she messaged to say that she didn't want to hear from me again   that yet again she left her so called ex husband.  

We met few times across to son, but I didn't believe she actually left him.  She said she was at her sister's.

Few months ago by and again she pop up in messages say that she been having casual sex with a guy and now she wants to explore that with him.  

I reacted badly and overreacted, 

She messaged that she not well and she in hospital with kidney stone, we exchange messages, nothing nasty and she lets slip that she left recent fella.  

I said that I still liked her and cared about her.

She come out of hospital and messages say that it was nice that I messaged her when she was in hospital.  And I was the only person she wanted a visit from.  I didn't visit because I didn't want to bump into her ex, husband coz I'm sure he would of visited, turns out he didn't 

I gotten close someone new and decided to be more.

Goes who pops up on my phone l, she does saying that she won't stop messaging me 

I tell her I'm with someone new, and she loses it saying that I liked her and wanted, now I new gf.

She continued to message casing issue my new relationship.  I realize that new girl wasn't right for me so I left her.

I then told my ex I left my girlfriend and she asked why.  I told truth that I still liked her

She of course doesn't believe this.

We continue to message and now at this hostile because of what she put me through and she is why you being horrible to me, if you care you wouldn't.

She went to explain that she suppressed her feeling for me when she was with her bf.  And that he was reckless so she left him.

So now we are at current time and she now said again she having casual sex with a friend and that noting will come of it.  To her it's just a bit of fun.  

She says she dislikes me and despite that I like her as I claim I wouldn't be horrible to her.

I asked her to stop having casual sex coz it risky.  Her reply was you had sex with your recent gf and didn't stop so why should I.

She acknowledges that I like her.  

Am I wasting time explaining things to this woman ?

Do I cut my loses ? 

Or does she like me, but wants to punish me ?

Anyways, he dislodged that and then continued to cough unproductively for about 10 minutes and my roommates and I delivered some gentle back blows. He was still breathing and my nursing roommate even pulled out her stethoscope and listened to his lungs to confirm there were no blockages. He showed no signs of any discomfort for the rest of the night.
 
Today as I was making lunch he slipped into my room and I believe vomited this onto my bed. He’s not lethargic, no change in appetite, and really just seems fine. He’s puked all of 3 times in his life, and 2 of those were induced. Both times we induced vomiting we found out that he had not actually ingested any of the toxic substances we thought he had. He doesn’t eat anything besides food. 

It also looks to be bile but he has eaten 3 meals, 2 greenies, and a couple little cubes of plain freeze dried salmon skin in the past 48 hours. 

Any suggestions as to what may have caused this are welcome!",2,1760832722.0,DogAdvice,3,0.67,False

Hey Reddit, my wife was just rear-ended on 80 in San Francisco and I’m hoping someone who sees this might have gotten photos or video of the other car involved. Post tagged as local crime since this was a hit and run, but Mods please let me know if there’s a better option. 


Wife’s car is a gray Honda Fit and she was rear-ended on Saturday 10/18/25 around 3:45ish p.m. the other vehicle was a boxy truck or SUV, silver or possibly white (light and reflective). My wife believe the driver was a woman. The accident marked on the attached map was from her accident we think. 


The other car drove off without a word to my wife and we just want them to take responsibility for the damages. Based on the damage we’re probably looking at insurance totaling it out and now is not a great time for us to have to buy a replacement car. 


Before anyone mentions it no she does not have a dashcam. I know that’s a risk in 2025 but I can’t go back in time to change it now.

1oabm3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oabm3e/th_numbered_days/,[TH] Numbered Days,"Recovered near Deadman's Ridge, Bitterroot Country.



Day 1

The money weighs more than my sins, and my sins are getting heavy. I never meant to shoot him. Hale came around the livery doors quicker than a thought, badge bright, gun brighter. A shout, the reflex twang in my shoulder, the muzzle bucked, and then the sheriff's hat did a small surprise dance before he folded like a wind-broke barn. I didn't even hear the first scream—only the second, from myself.

We ran, but it was mostly me after Rook took a bullet in the gut and went down clawing straw like it was a rope to heaven. Jory got the horses, got spooked, bolted without me. I grabbed a saddlebag of cash and staggered to the river bottoms, bleeding from where the deputy's bullet had kissed my shoulder. I buried half the bank's money in a double-wrapped feed sack under a black willow by a crook of the creek that kinks like a lying man's story. I marked the bark with my knife—two slashes, a cross—then dragged a brush to hide the scuff. I'll come back for it when the dust quits trying to find me.

Animals and lawmen both are drawn to blood and motion. I got both. I'll move at night.





Day 2

Spent the day under a tangle of fallen cottonwood, the kind of natural ribs a river leaves when it changes its mind. Flies found me. I let them have the sweat, swatted them off the wound. It's a neat groove, hot to the touch. Smells wrong. I dribbled whiskey over it, bit a strap, cursed every saint my ma ever threatened me with. My horse—Sour—pulled the reins with his teeth and watched me like I'd gone peculiar. Maybe I have.

Close to sundown, I crossed the creek at the stones that don't wobble, climbed the shale slope to the sage flats, and kept to the deer paths. Left no fire. Cold makes a man honest about the company he keeps in his head. I kept repeating: *didn't mean, didn't mean*. The words got lighter until the wind could carry them.





Day 3

I found a trickle spring in a seam of rock, sour as a coinsmith's mouth, but clean. Filled the canteen, sipped with the careful politeness of a man drinking from the last friend he has. Ate one strip of jerky and a heel of bread gone blue on the corners. I pinched off the spoiled parts and told my belly to be grateful anyway. Heh, hopefully I don't regret it after. 

Late morning, riders on the ridge. Four shapes, one with a white hat or blond hair catching sun, moving slow and fanned wide like a rake combing. I tucked into a gully and pulled brush over me till bugs marched down my neck as if my body was just new ground. They passed. I counted to two-hundred for their shadows to thin out of me.

I scratched at the wound through the shirt and felt wet. Took the bandage off. The edges are angry, shiny—skin going gray around the red. The bullet went through, but dragged a bit of me with it. I cut new strips from my undershirt. Whiskey again. The world tunneled and narrowed and I woke with my cheek pressed to gravel, ants working my breath.





Day 5

Hunger makes everything look edible: grass seeds, pine pitch, my own regrets. I trapped a jackrabbit with a snare line and couldn't risk the smoke of cookfire, so I ate it near raw, barely kissed by flame in a pit choked with green twigs to keep the smoke low and dirty. The meat slid slick, my stomach lurched, and I made bargains with a God I never remembered to speak to when I had better food.

I mapped my path in the journal's back cover with a nub of coal, then tore that out and crumbled it, in case someone found me and got clever. The map's in my head now. That scares me more than the posse. My head's not reliable—keeps replaying Hale's face, not when he died, but when he laughed with the blacksmith last week about the winter hay. He had a decent sound to him. Doesn't square easy with the way he fell.

I peed brown today. That can't be good.





Day 7

The old hunter's shack above Bitterroot Pass is where I'm headed. He was a quiet man named Abel, who once sold me a pelt without asking my name. I helped him lift his dead mule out of a ravine with a rope and a May prayer. He said if I ever needed a roof, I could borrow his until the rain let up. He didn't say what happened if the rain was the law.

Got turned around in a patch of tangled aspen and willow, where every direction looks like indecision. I marked trees like a badger, little cuts at knee height, double for north. By afternoon I smelled smoke not mine. Dropped to my belly. Smoke means men, unless lightning has found a tree in October, and I don't believe in that kind of luck. I crawled to the lip of a sandy arroyo. Down below, a camp: three men, two mules, a skillet, and a pot of beans fragrant enough to make my kidneys weep. They talked about a bounty that's gone up—$500 posted at the mercantile, extra if brought in living. One of them chuckled and said living's a fuss.

My name wasn't said, but it stood up in the middle of them like a wind.





Day 8

I followed bear scat to stay off the human trails. A bear's not hunting me on purpose; a man is. That thought got me through a stand of black pine smelling like pitch and antiques. I sang low to Sour so he wouldn't spook—an old lullaby my ma used to hum when she had the patience to pretend I was better than I was. 

The wound's slick and sweet-smelling, which is wrong. Flies adore it. I wove a net from horsehair and tied it over the bandage. The skin around it puffs like someone else's knee and feels hot as a kettle. I used to be good at cards. Thought I could count my odds here and beat infection the way I beat a greenhorn holding a pair of eights like it was a bible. Can't bluff your own blood.

I'd pay ten dollars for one clean needle and a man who knows where to push it.





Day 10

Reached Abel's shack by noon. Roof's got a new hole—the sky staring through like a nosy neighbor. I almost tripped on a rock and planted myself face-first into the mud. Unnecessary piece of information, but it's my damn journal. Sue me. The shack's door's been chewed by time and one side hangs lower than the other. Inside: a chipped porcelain bowl, a cracked mirror, a blanket—folded, a bible with pressed wildflowers at Isaiah, and a rusty coffee pot with a note scrawled on the side in charcoal: *""Winter comes early this year.""* No sign of Abel, only a walking stick with a notch for every year—forty-three of them. The last is shallow, impatient, as if winter interrupted the counting.

I swept the place with a bunch of dried weeds. Habit. I'm hiding like a rat and still I want the dirt to look tidy. Maybe I'm trying to impress the dead. Maybe I want to feel civilized enough to deserve a bed. I lay down on the bare plank and my bones complained. I took the blanket and the coffee pot. Whispered, *""thank you, Abel""* to the dust motes. They didn't answer.





Day 11

I shaved with a razor so dull it was more like negotiating with my beard than cutting it. In the mirror, the man staring back startled me. Yellow eyes, hollows under them deep enough to hide a mouse. Beard like scrub brush after a fire. When I swallowed, the cords in my neck stood out like the ties of a bridge. I forced a smile to see if I remembered how. It looked like a pocket picked of meaning. 

Bound the wound tighter. It leaks through everything. I boiled the bandage and poured whiskey over it anyway. Whiskey's nearly gone. I tell myself I won't drink the rest, I'll save it for the cleaning, because if I drink it, I'll wake up with my arm gone black and no courage to cut. After I told myself that, I took a small drink. It was either that or cry, and I don't have the water to spare.





Day 12

Snow teased the ridge at dawn—nothing that stuck, just white breath to remind the world of its bad habits. I checked the snares and found them empty. A magpie followed me for thirty paces, noisier than a gossip after church. I gave it a look that would've made a sensible bird reconsider. It didn't

In the afternoon, the sound of a horse came up the old wagon road: not the loose plod of a stray, but the settled rhythm of a rider who knows the country. I tucked my journal and Colt under the loose board by the cot and eased to the window, keeping left so if a bullet came through it wouldn't meet anything useful. A lone rider in a canvas duster, hat pulled low, a scar across the jaw like a lightning mark. He stopped by the creek to water his horse and rolled a cigarette with fingers that didn't hurry. He looked at the shack once, the way a man glances at a grave to read the name and keep walking. I held my breath until my eyes watered. He smoked the cigarette down to the mean end and flicked it into the water. Then he rode on. 

I let out my breath and it sounded like someone else's.





Day 13

Dreamed of the bank. Not the shooting. The part before: the way the girl at the counter rounded her vowels when she said ""deposit"". The smell of floor soap, lemony like a clean lie. Jory making his little click with his tongue when he's nervous. Rook's fingers twitching as if he could count the money by muscle. If I hold the dream right, I can keep it in the second before the door swung open and the world broke. I hold it until my hand shakes and the second spills.

Woke with my arm throbbing like a drum. The skin's the color of old tallow, speckled with red. I lanced the pocket of pus with the point of my knife, sterilized by fire and a prayer. Not that it holds any power when it comes from me. The pus ran clear, then cloudy. I grunted, and Sour lifted his head from where he'd been dozing and watched me with the long patience of things that outlive us.





Day 14

I rationed the jerky down to thumb-size strips. Found wintergreen leaves under a log and chewed them for a pretend meal. My hands are too shaky to set snares proper. I ground a handful of acorns, leached them, baked a flat cake of bitter stubbornness on a hot stone. Tasted like biting a fence post—don't ask how I know the taste of that. I ate the whole thing.

I drew a map of my hiding places on the inside of my skull and a map of Hale's face around my heart. The first is for getting out. The second is for never getting out.

Around midnight, I heard a sound like cloth on bark. Stepped out with the Colt ready, then lowered it when I saw the doe. She stood ten paces away and looked at me like the part of the world that isn't hunting. We stared at each other until she flicked her ear and let me be. I wanted to ask her if she forgave me for breathing her winter air. I wanted to ask everyone that.





Day 15

Heat in the wound today, but my fingers feel cold. That's a bad math. I rubbed my hands together until the skin burned and it still wasn't warmth so much as friction pretending. Physics or something like that. I set a small fire in the stove of Abel's shack, stuffed the gaps around the stovepipe with moss so the smoke wouldn't curl out like a flag. Even so, the shack filled with a ghost of it. I sat with my back against the wall and listened to the wood talk to itself as it burned down.

Found a sewing kit under the cot—two needles, crooked from use, a twist of thread that once was white. I stitched the bandage to a clean cloth so it would stop slipping. The needle went in easy; my skin's less skin now, more old leather. I tied off the kind of knots I trust for fishing and men.





Day 16

Woke with a fever that paints the ceiling with water I know isn't there. Spent the morning drifting across a river that never reached shore. At noon, I crawled to the creek and dunked my head into the melt. The shock brought me back into my body and I wished it hadn't.

I wrote down what I owe: Rook, proper burial. Jory, an apology for calling him yellow when all he was, was practical. The bank girl, a good night's sleep without my face in it. Hale—well. Hale I owe everything I don't have words for. If there's a way to fold a life in half and hand it to the next man, I'd do it. But I only know how to hand over money or bullets, and both of those are worse at forgiveness than words.

My pen ran dry. I chewed the end, coaxed one more desperate paragraph out of it like the last beans out of a tin.





Day 18

Two men came while I slept in the blind noon. Their tracks are loud—heels that dig, toes that hesitate. They circled the shack, stood on my steps whispering as if words were tools that could pry me out. One of them tried the door. I had wedged a chair under the latch, and it held. He laughed to hear a chair say ""no"". They walked the creek, came back, spat, and left. I will never again disrespect a chair.

I laid out the coins in my pocket and counted them as if counting could turn the numbers into bread. Seventy-three cents and a button. The button's brass, stamped with a star. I don't remember where it came from. Maybe it fell from a soldier and I picked it up and pretended I had some of his courage. Maybe Hale had one like it on his coat. I put it under the coffee pot and told it to hold steady all the things I can't. I'm talking to soulless objects now. Hell, it's a goddamn button.





Day 20

Sour's ribs show. Mine do, too. He licked my hand this morning, slow, careful, as if he was telling me I had salt worth keeping. You better not eat me in my sleep, boy. I led him to the last patch of green by the creek and watched him tear grass with the same intensity I put into breathing.

The fever breaks and returns, a tide with no moon to answer to. When it breaks, I think maybe I can make it to the willow and dig up what I buried. When it returns, I can barely lift the blanket.

A crow brought a sound that might have been laughter. I'm not sure if it was mine.





Day 21

I found Abel's old ledger, brittle pages full of antlers and dates, notes like ""doe with fawn—let go"" and ""storm ruined the north trap."" On the last page he'd written: ""When the world says no more, it means no more of that way. Find another way."" The ink trailed off into a smudge.

I took that as permission. I wrapped my bad arm tight, packed the journal, the Colt, the last jerky, the coffee pot because a man should carry one foolish hope, and I said to Sour, ""We're going to the willow, boy."" His ears twitched like a yes, though I don't think he really cared much about what I had to say at this point. We left before light, moving through the trees like we had a right.





Day 22

We crossed the flats with the sky low and mean. Twice I thought I heard riders. Once I was sure. We slid into a draw and waited while the sound of hooves braided with the wind. I counted breaths the way I used to count beats before I pushed open a saloon door—the difference between alive and a problem for the undertaker.

Midday, the creek announced itself with chatter. I found the black willow kinked like a bad promise. I scraped the bark where I'd cut it: two slashes, a cross. My knees went loose at the sight. I dug with my hands first, then with the coffee pot when the earth said quit. The feed sack was there—wet around the edges, but the bills inside still dry where the oilcloth hugged them. I laughed once, a hoarse thing, and the laugh turned to a cough and the cough turned to something that stung the wound like a brand.

I dragged the sack under brush. Sat there panting like I'd run a mile when all I'd done was say hello to a shovel-less grave. I could take it all and ride for the border. I could take a handful and buy a doctor in a town where the posters haven't arrived yet. I took nothing for a long minute and let the decision lean its weight on my chest until I could feel the shape of it.

In the end, I took a small roll of bills. and reburied the rest. All the gold in the world isn't useful if it only buys you a quicker death. A small roll can buy a horse and a silence.





Day 23

A storm rolled in from the west, fat drops of cold. We sheltered under a juniper that smelled like a cupboard of old hopes. Thunder spoke once and left. The ground drank. I thought about the bank girl again, the way fear made her mouth a flat line, then the way anger remade it into a bow you could shoot me with. If I live, I'll go to that town and put the money back. That's foolish. If I live, I'll make a mess of something else trying to fix this. The truest thing I can say is: I would try.

Riders again. Two, maybe three. One whistling the same three notes over and over, an ugly habit. We waited until they were a story someone else would tell.





Day 24

The infection is taking parts of me I used to be fond of. The arm's swollen from shoulder to wrist, and the veins stand up as if they want air. I cut a slit near the worst of it and pressed. The smell is what you'd expect from something that hopes to be free of a body. I pressed anyway. White, yellow, a string of something that looked like a lie. The pressure made my eyes go black around the edges and when they came back I was on the floor and the world had tilted two inches left.

I wrapped it again. Told myself I'm winning. Men have gone to their graves with less cheerful lies on their lips.





Day 26

Made it back to Abel's shack by inches. Sour stumbled once and I thought we were both going to kiss the stones. I talked to him like a Sunday preacher: ""Easy, easy, you're my only good idea left."" He twitched an ear and kept going like I'd convinced him. 

Inside, I lit a stingy fire and brewed coffee that could remove paint. It made my heart remember its job. I stared at the coffee pot's dented sides for a long time. I like to think it's remembered other men's faces and will remember mine with the same accuracy: flawed, necessary, trying...handsome..?





Day 27

A fox came to the door and looked in. We regarded each other, two red things with hunger behind our eyes. He sniffed, decided I wasn't food yet, and went about his fox business. I was offended and relieved at once.

I put on Hale's voice to keep myself company. ""You could've dropped the gun,"" he says. 

""I know,"" I tell him. 

""You could've turned and run without firing."" 

""I didn't,"" I say. 

""You could've been a decent man one more second.""

""I didn't know how.""

He looks at me in my head, not without kindness. ""Learned too late, did you?""

""Learning still,"" I answer. He nods like a teacher whose lesson will outlive the class.





Day 28

I saw the rider with the scar again. This time he stopped at the shack and knocked—a polite little rap for a man hunting a bounty. I held my breath. He waited, then pushed the door. The chair held again. ""Anyone home?"" he said softly, the way a man asks the woods to give him a deer. He laughed to himself, a sound that didn't mean joy. ""Not yet,"" he added, which I didn't like. His bootsteps traced the yard, the creek, the place where Sour sometimes rolls. He found my latrine and made a sound like appreciation. ""Neat,"" he said. ""Our man's tidy.""

When he finally left, I exhaled and almost swooned from the sudden permission to breathe. The air tasted like dust and luck.





Day 29

I tried to write a letter to my ma. I don't know where she is now, and I don't know if the letter would make it in less than a century, but the hand remembers old shapes. I wrote: ""Ma, I did wrong. I'm sorry I learned skill quicker than sense. I'm sorry I let a moment decide me. Tell me how to wash a soul like a dish and promise to dry it without leaving spots."" The pen snagged on the word *soul*. I didn't finish. I put the paper under the coffee pot with the brass button for a weight. If someone finds it, let them judge me by my wanting rather than my getting.





Day 30

A dusting of snow stayed through morning, turning the drums of the barrels into frosted cakes. Sour sneezed at it like a joke he didn't like. I broke the crust on the creek with a stick and watched fish flash under like a fast rumor. The cold put a knife edge in the air. It'll soon be that edge that cuts.

I inventory what I have: one and a half strips jerky, coffee grounds used twice and willing to try a third time, a little flour, a pinch of salt, a coffee pot, two needles, thread, the blanket, the bible I don't open because I don't want to bleed on it, the journal, the Colt with three rounds, a brass button, seventy-three cents (spent fifty of the secret roll on oats and a bottle from a trapper who looked at me and saw the same thing the fox did: not food yet, not money forever), and a horse who forgives me hourly for being human.





Day 31

Fever came back and sat on me like debt. I woke to find the journal open to the blank page, pen in my hand, no memory of how the two had made friends. I wrote a poem without meaning to:

*The creek keeps the willow,*

*the willow keeps the cross,*

*the cross keeps the burying,*

*the burying keeps the loss.*

I laughed at myself, a lawless man making hymns by accident. The laugh hurt. I tucked the pen away like it was a gun and I'd used all the bullets.





Day 33

The rider with the scar returned with two others. They made camp a hundred yards off, as if my shack was a well and they were waiting for me to come up for air. They talked about weather first—that's the way of patient men—then about money. Then about me. ""He's circling the drain,"" one said. ""He'll come down for water or die inside,"" another said. The scarred one was quiet. Quiet men pull the cord that drops the curtain.

I waited until they fell into that camp sleep that sounds like the day pretending to be night. I took Sour by the bridle and we went out the back way, the rabbit way, the way a stream would have gone if it wanted to avoid rocks. We made a loop that left my tracks going in and out of themselves. When the gray of morning made fools of men's eyes, we were on the ridge, watching them break their first fast on beans that smelled like another life.





Day 34

The arm's colder now. The fever's odd—less fire, more fog. I keep thinking I hear church bells, thin and far. I haven't had use for a church since I learned that men carry their own punishment and their own pardon in the same set of ribs. Still, the bells call a place in me that isn't outlawed.

I tried to write my full name. My hand did *Elias* fine enough, but stumbled at *McGraw* as if the letters had become a road washed out. I made the G twice and crossed the W the wrong way. I left it standing there, embarrassed but honest.





Day 35

Sour stood in the doorway this morning with the kind of stillness horses use when they're telling you a storm's inside the barn, not outside. I scratched his forehead and told him if he wanted to run, I'd understand. He blew warm into my palm until my fingers found the idea of heat again. He didn't run. He's either loyal or foolish. I'm not the right judge. He's been a trusty partner all the way through either way.

I tried to read Isaiah where Abel's flowers lay flattening like memories. *Come now, and let us reason together.* That line got me. It sounded like Hale in the door of the livery, right before the gun, asking me to be the version of myself I was always one beat behind.





Day 36

I cleaned the journal's cover with a damp cloth. Why? I don't know. Maybe because if this ends badly—and I can't find the shape of it ending well—I want the one true thing I made to be legible. Not the theft. Not the running. Not the shooting that a part of me will deny even when the worms shake their heads. This. Words. A kind of trap I set for the truth, where it can step and be held without blood.

I thought of returning the money in secret like a slow miracle. I thought of turning myself in with the roll I kept to pay a lawyer who has a laugh like a door opened on a warm room. I thought of dying in this shack. and becoming a warning other men tell themselves and ignore. I thought I'd pick the second. The fever picked for me.





Day 37

Hand shakes. Letters do a dance that isn't quite legible. If someone reads this, pull the words apart the way a careful woman takes threads from a ruined shirt to reuse them. The meaning's there if you have patience. I have patience but it keeps slipping out of my pockets.

A shadow stood at the window. at noon. Not a man. Me, reflected, but wrong—too tall, too sure. I waved. It didn't. That seemed rude. I told it to come in and share my coffee. It declined in a very silent way. I think I annoyed myself.





Day 38

Woke to find snow had decided to become serious. It erases tracks with the same enthusiasm I once brought to gambling. The world wears its quiet like fresh clothes. My breath makes ghosts.

I boiled the last coffee into a tar and spread it on a cracker of flour. Ate it like a delicacy. Told myself this is what rich men do: pretend something is better because they say so.





Day 39

These might be the last pages. Not because the book is full. Because the hand is empty. I can't lift the Colt. That's good. I can't lift the coffee pot. That's bad. Sour stomps once each hour like a clock. The noise is the only honest measure of time I have.

I wanted to say something like a benediction. I only know the gambler's version: may your next hand be better than your last and may you know when to fold without shame. Hale, if you can hear a man who never listened until echo was all that was left, I'm—





Day 39, later

It hurts to hold the pen. My name is Elias. Not Red. Not Mister. Not Wanted. Elias who once helped a man pull a mule out of a ravine and felt proud in a clean way. Elias who laughed with Jory that night by the river, stupid with plans. Elias who aimed badly at a life and hit something else.

I'm going to lie down and —

Now the details you actually need.

# What “white” means in a dental setting

Dentists don’t talk about “paper white.” They use shade guides. The most common scale groups teeth into families like A, B, C, D and then ranks shades within each. If your front teeth start at A3 and you finish at B1, that’s a big improvement. If you start at A1, there’s less room to move. Whitening can only move you toward your natural ceiling. It can’t turn translucent enamel into opaque porcelain. It also can’t change the color of fillings, crowns, or veneers.

# The types of whitening you’ll likely be offered

Creative Smiles clinics generally offer two routes:

1. **In-chair whitening** Quick visit. Stronger gels. Isolation to protect gums and soft tissue. Often with a light to activate the gel, sometimes not. You’ll usually leave the same day with your “after” shade. Expect one long appointment or a couple of shorter cycles in a single visit.
2. **Custom take-home trays** Slim, clear trays molded to your teeth and a professional gel with precise instructions. You wear the trays daily for a set period, usually over one to two weeks. Slower, but very controlled. It’s also the best way to maintain results long term.

Some patients do a combo. In-chair to get the heavy lift. Trays to keep the shade steady.

# How much change you can expect, realistically

Here’s what tends to happen across real patients:

* **Extrinsic stains** (coffee, tea, red wine, smoking) respond fast. You often see a big shift right after the first in-chair session.
* **Age-related yellowing** usually improves well, but not always to the brightest tab on the guide.
* **Grey or brown internal stains** (for example, some tetracycline cases or fluorosis) are harder. They can still improve, but the jump might be smaller and may need more sessions or an extended tray protocol.
* **Transparent edges** don’t “whiten” as much because there’s less enamel to reflect light. The center looks whiter than the translucent tips. That’s normal.

A typical in-chair session can move you 3 to 6 shades if you’re starting with a lot of surface staining. Two to three shades if your teeth are already fairly light. Take-home trays can add another notch or two and help even things out.

# Why the starting point matters

Your “max white” is limited by the optical properties of your enamel and dentin. Thicker, more opaque enamel reflects more light. Thinner, translucent enamel shows more of the dentin color underneath. Whitening changes the way light scatters in enamel by breaking down stain molecules. It doesn’t paint on a new color. So two people can do the exact same protocol and end up in different places.

# Why it matters to do this in a dental clinic

* **Strength and safety**. Professional gels are stronger than shop kits. Dentists isolate gums and control contact time so you get the benefit without chemical burns.
* **Diagnosis first**. Not every dark tooth should be whitened right away. A single dark tooth could be non-vital and need root canal treatment and internal bleaching. White chalky spots might need resin infiltration first. Creative Smiles teams will check that before they put gel on anything.
* **Sequence planning**. If you’re also considering bonding or veneers, whitening comes first. Then you color-match the new work to the lighter shade. Do it the other way around and you paint yourself into a corner.

# When to do it

* **Before cosmetic work**. As above, whiten first. Then match.
* **After a cleaning**. Removing plaque and calculus lets the gel contact enamel evenly. You get a more uniform result.
* **Before big life moments**. Give yourself a cushion. If you have an event in three weeks, do the in-chair now and keep trays for touch-ups.
* **If you’ve hit a plateau with whitening toothpaste**. Those help with surface stains. They don’t change the intrinsic shade.

# How the appointment usually runs

In-chair visits at Creative Smiles clinics tend to follow a simple flow:

1. Shade match and photos at the start.
2. Lip and cheek retraction. Gum barrier to protect soft tissue.
3. Gel applied to the visible surfaces of the upper and lower front teeth.
4. Timed cycles. Gel refreshed between cycles. Light activation may be used depending on the system.
5. Final rinse. New shade recorded. Desensitising treatment applied if needed.
6. Aftercare instructions and, often, a plan for trays or top-ups.

Time in the chair ranges roughly 45 to 90 minutes depending on the system and how many cycles are appropriate for your teeth.

# Aftercare that actually preserves the result

* **First 24 to 48 hours**: avoid strong pigments. Think coffee, tea, red wine, cola, soy sauce, curry, dark berries. If you do have them, rinse with water right away.
* **Temperature**: very hot or very cold can spike sensitivity for a day or two.
* **Desensitising gel**: use as directed. It helps block the fluid movement in dentinal tubules that causes zings.
* **Fluoride toothpaste**: good for enamel strength.
* **Custom trays for maintenance**: short refreshers every few months, especially if you love coffee or red wine.
* **Regular cleanings**: keep stain buildup down so the shade holds.

# Common mistakes people make

* **Overusing whitening strips or online gels**. More time doesn’t mean more white. It means irritated gums, chalky white burned patches, and sensitivity that hangs around.
* **Skipping the exam**. Whitening over untreated decay or leaking fillings hurts. You can push gel into a cavity or onto exposed dentin and then everything aches.
* **Ignoring white spots**. High-concentration gel can make white spots look whiter at first because the surrounding enamel changes faster. With a dentist, you can plan around that or pair whitening with resin infiltration to blend the contrast.
* **Forgetting about restorations**. Fillings, crowns, veneers do not whiten. If your front teeth have composite edges or an older crown, you may need to replace them after whitening for a uniform look.
* **Chasing “Hollywood white” with repeated high-strength sessions**. There’s a ceiling. Past it, you only get sensitivity and dehydrated enamel that looks matte and chalky.

# What happens if you do it wrong

* **Soft tissue burns**. Whitening gel on gums turns them white and sore. It heals, but it’s unpleasant and avoidable with proper isolation.
* **Severe sensitivity**. Shooting pain with air or cold drinks can last days if you over-bleach or use poorly fitted trays that flood the gums.
* **Uneven results**. Streaks, patches, or a bright center with darker edges when gel coverage is sloppy or plaque wasn’t removed first.
* **Worsening of underlying problems**. A dark tooth from trauma might need internal bleaching, not outside gel. If you miss that, the color mismatch remains and the tooth health issue is still there.

# How Creative Smiles clinicians keep it predictable

* **Pre-whitening assessment** to identify what type of discoloration you have and what’s realistic for you.
* **Isolation and controlled gel strength** so the active ingredient stays where it should.
* **Measured time cycles** rather than guesswork.
* **Desensitising protocols** during and after treatment when needed.
* **A maintenance plan** with custom trays, so your shade doesn’t slide back three months later.

# Who sees the biggest wins

* Coffee and tea drinkers with otherwise healthy enamel.
* Ex-smokers tackling the residual yellowing.
* Patients with mild to moderate age yellowing who haven’t whitened in years.
* People pairing in-chair whitening with disciplined tray maintenance.

# Who needs a modified plan

* **Heavy intrinsic staining** (long-standing grey or banded discoloration). Expect a slower, staged approach.
* **Sensitive teeth**. Lower concentrations, shorter cycles, more desensitiser, and spacing between sessions.
* **Lots of front-tooth restorations**. Whitening first, then replacement or cosmetic bonding to match.
* **Gum recession or cracks**. These spots can sting. Protection and careful gel placement are key.

# How long results last

Think in habits, not months. If you drink dark coffee twice a day and rarely rinse, you may touch up every 2 to 3 months with trays. If you mostly drink water and get regular cleanings, you might go 6 to 12 months before a short refresh. The base color you achieve with in-chair whitening stays fairly stable, but surface stains slowly build back. Maintenance keeps the shade where you want it.

# Quick expectations checklist

* You’ll likely lighten 2 to 8 shades.
* One appointment is usually enough to make a visible difference.
* Sensitivity for a day or two is common and manageable.
* Fillings and crowns won’t change color.
* Maintenance matters if you want to hold the shade.

# What to ask at your consultation

Use this to get precise answers for your mouth, not generic promises:

* What’s my current shade and a realistic target shade?
* Do I have any spots, cracks, or gum recession that need protection or treatment first?
* Will you use in-chair, trays, or a combination for me, and why?
* What’s the plan if I get sensitivity?
* If I have bonding or a crown in the smile zone, when should we replace it after whitening?
* What maintenance schedule fits my coffee, tea, or wine habits?

# Bottom line

Teeth whitening at Creative Smiles can take you several shades lighter in a controlled, medically supervised way. The result is noticeable. The process is fast. The ceiling is individual. If you want the biggest, safest jump, do it after a cleaning, follow the clinic’s protocol exactly, protect your gums, and commit to short tray touch-ups. That’s how you get white, keep white, and avoid the problems that come with trying to shortcut a clinical procedure at home.",1,1760832496.0,creativesmilebelfast,0,1.0,False
1oabjg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContaminationOCD/comments/1oabjg9/i_need_help_and_reassurance_i_guess/,"I need help and reassurance, i guess…","Hello everyone, it's a little shameful that I'm making this publication, because I hope to be ""reassured"" and have some advice or sweet words I don't know. Indeed, I have been suffering from ocd for years, and today I had an incident that for the time being, really undermined my mind. I know this incident would just remain a funny memory later for most people, but with my brain sick, for me, it's the end of the world. Not daring to talk about it to my loved ones here I am...

This morning I was on the phone with a friend, and while I was having my coffee and breakfast, I wanted to fart, except that... it wasn't a fart. I pulled down my pajamas to be sure, I noticed, hung up the phone, quickly finished my breakfast (didnt sit ive eat standing) and hurried to put on my underwear to wash in the machine, finished what I had to do on the toilet and took a good shower.

Everything could have stopped there and I would have continued my day normally, except that because of my ocd, I block completely. I always feel dirty, and my brain tortures me by asking me stupid questions like ""and if I had put some on my phone? ""Because at first I touched my pajamas with my hand to see if it was ""wet"", I specify that the incident had not ""perforced"" my panties, there were really only inside and not on my pajamas. Or ""should I have washed my hair? ""Stupid too because there was no direct contact, but as it is literally ""the disease of doubt"" well I'm just afraid of having screwed up somewhere, I also feel like I haven't done enough, like I hold back from cleaning my entire showet... which is stupid cause it's unlikely that there will be fecal matter in my shower since before going there I finished what I had to do on the toilet and wiped myself well with wet wipes, and then well the soap flowed in the shower so... I have the impression that this incident has contaminated everything..

If i listened to myself, I would clean my entire apartment and do a deep cleaning. I suffer from not being a ""normal"" person. Because I know people who, after a messy fart, wouldn’t have disinfected their phones, cleaned the entire bathroom and cleaned the washing machine where I put my dirty underwear. There is also the side where I am a woman, I am 28 years old, and I tell myself that it is a shame for a woman of my age to live this. I'm locked in guilt and disgust and can't get over this experience. I can't keep going my life normally since that, it's like i’ve been stuck on this experience since this morning and that until I've cleaned and disinfected everything i couldn’t continue living my life normally. Except that it's not a solution, if I do that I agree with my ocd (I'm already proud of having managed not to wash my hair), but now I don't dare for example by taking my evening shower because I have the impression that I'm going to get dirty if i go to the shower, or if i use the same towel ill be dirty which is stupid because, i use the towel after my shower so, i was clean…

To top it all off, my psychiatrist who follows me for this disease is on vacation for 2 weeks, so I find myself alone with these thoughts and this disgust.. I already have dark ideas cause the anxiety is so strong, no matter how much I do breathing exercises etc. nothing helps.

I am going to take a job in NJ near Hackensack and am curious where I should be looking to live.  I am considering upper west side of NYC but I do have to be in the shop every work day, no remote possibility except maybe a day or two occasionally.  Well paying, so not too worried about rent, maybe $3k a month cap, less is preferred.

About me: 

I’m a single 41 year old dude who likes getting out and seeing folk and also enjoys being alone outside or in nature.  I’ve lived in every major west coast city, Chicago, Baltimore, and numerous international cities.  I would enjoy being around places with good food, art, and coffee where I can also be able to go on dates, meet new friends, and bikeable if possible.  I’m most comfortable sitting on a stoop watching the world go by.

Is driving from the city everyday awful?  It seems like it would be.  

So I am looking to see if there are any gems I don’t know about nearby that cut my commute (especially because tolls and parking) but still allow me to see my friends in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

DISCLAIMER: I know this post is VERY long but if you are interested in a deep dive into my psychology please give it a full read. It will take no more than 10 mins. I really could not think of a TL;DR for it as there is too much important info on each paragraph.

So I often wonder what kind of personality type I am. I know the following makes me seem autistic but I don’t think I am because largely social norms generally don’t perplex me and I find them quite easy. That said it took me a while to learn some of them and I didn’t speak properly until I was nearly 3.

Anyways below are some of my key differences. I am no longer embarrassed, ashamed or angry at the following traits although I was at times throughout my formative years. I am looking for constructive and interesting insights not shaming or an “man up and be normal” attitude. But I’ve always felt so different to people.

I’m not complaining nor do I think my quirks make me either worse or better than other people. I believe in being open about my differences, listening to other people talk about their differences and celebrating them! Here goes:

•	⁠Since early childhood I have a tremendous facility for facts and information on a variety of topics that interests me (namely nature; history; politics; religion; pop culture - noticeably absent is remembering sports-related information!)
•	⁠I can socialise effectively and although I have a core group of friends who live in the same small town we rarely meet up and I don’t feel any particular strong connection to any of them even though I like them (some more than others) and wish them all well with their lives. Socialising doesn’t tend to bother me though, it doesn’t make me anxious although I feel a lot of it is going through the motions (e.g. generic small talk, friendly but not terribly intellectually stimulating or engaging a lot of the time). I have a good sense of humour, can do some impression’s and tell a story reasonably well but I would never be life of the party. I don’t know if not being able to have strong friendships with people is the fact that I spent a lot of my childhood and teens with no friends or if this itself was the result of lacking the inherent ability to form deep friendships with people. I still don’t have a strong desire to form deep friendships with people because it’s all I’m used to but of course I do at times feel that I may be missing out on something.
•	⁠People I know well have remarked that I seem to socialise easily and that I am charismatic but what they are seeing me do is what I have been practising for years where yes I come across as these things but generally I am not connecting too much with anyone. The same people who said this have, in the same conversations, voiced concerns about their perceived lack of social ability and that they may be autistic which bothers them. Some of them also have autism and neurodivergence in their families.
•	⁠I never was competitive the way most other people around me seemed to get competitive, in sports especially, but also other things like class tests etc when I was a child. It actually scared me how my peers would go from being friendly to all of a sudden ruthlessly wanting to win at all costs. This really perplexed me. I remember playing a video game with my friend of the same age as a young child. It was a 2 player car racing game and we were competing against each other. She was doing everything in her power to win and I had absolutely no interest in winning. I really wanted to explore the CGI generated landscape instead. Again it completely confused and even scared me a bit how my friend who I liked turned into this different person when it came to winning a race in what was essentially a collection of pixels on a screen.
•	⁠I remember never wanting to work too hard  at school as a child if the subject didn’t interest me. I remember being at a table when I was 7 and we all got our copies back from the teacher with corrections. All my classmates at the table had stickers on their copies with words to effect of “Fantastic result!” whereas mine said “Good effort”. I remember feeling annoyed and envious of their sticker but not being willing to put in the work to get up to there level which I can see now I was well capable of.
•	⁠Another thing that sticks out of my high achieving girlfriend saying to me that what motivated her to well in school was her mother telling her to do my best. My parents expressed the same sentiments to me over the course of my child and teenager years but I couldn’t generally be bother in my child year to kill myself to achieve the highest possible grade as I found it too stressful and wanted to do my own thing, at my own pace.
•	⁠As a teenager I started to be more ambitious in class tests and ended up doing well academically in secondary school and college but largely because I didn’t want to get in trouble with my parents and often if I did well (which was fairly regular) I would get a blast of happiness but then feel kind of hollow. I realise now I was largely doing well to avoid getting in trouble with my parents. The few times I get genuinely competitive and have a strong desire to do well is in pub quizzes and also when I am asked to write something or help someone with a piece of writing as I love writing and have a good facility for it along with a very strong vocabulary.
•	⁠I was never one, generally for following the crowd. This manifested itself in many ways not liking sports of any shape or form; not watching a lot of popular movies (e.g. Harry Potter, Star Wars, LOTR), not being into fashion, not playing video games, not playing board games, chess or cards etc; not proplerly enjoying music until I was in my teens. To this day one of the main reasons I don’t like socialising is because it often comes up that I can’t play this game or haven’t seen this film and people act shocked and often seem genuinely angry even if it’s laughed off like a joke. I personally don’t mind not being able to relate to a lot of stuff but it’s people reaction that really bothers me. Even if I try to explain things from my point of view politely and with a sense of humour they still get so defensive and angry at me and express shock that I haven’t followed a mainstream path as if it’s inherently better than less common interests. Also, I find trying to learn board games and chess other than games that involve trivia or word games like Scrabble difficult. This is similar to sport as I found it difficult to remember the rules.
•	⁠Now don’t get me wrong I’m no philistine, I have watched a lot of films, read a lot of both fiction and non fiction books and have listened to a lot of music that I enjoy and have in places a very deep knowledge about but it’s like there’s a gene to follow popular mainstreams things/trends (sports, popular movies, music, games etc) that I lack.
•	⁠In terms of never following the crowd I also never developed any kind of interest in following sports teams; political parties (even though I love watching and reading on the history of politics and the game that it really is!) etc. Again, it’s like I’m missing a gene.
•	⁠I have always had grand ideas for potential hobbies but hardly ever realised any of them. Some of this was lack of drive or willpower or not knowing where to look for help as well as feeling embarrassed about telling my friends and family, a lot of whom had different interests to me. I felt embarrassed and ashamed that I had barely any hobbies other than reading for years but now in my early 20’s I have made peace with the fact that I can achieve these hobbies but it will take time, money and patience.
•	⁠I never did many extra-curricular activities as a child or teenager. I did some but generally didn’t last too long due to a combination of not liking socialising; not liking being told what to do by adults or my peers; lack of interest in the activity itself which was often a sport; a strong desire to be on my own and do my own thing at my own pace (this often entailed wandering around fields or forests, pretending to be a dinosaur or other animal, or just solitary reading/talking to myself/imagining the future/ me and my grand plans)
•	⁠The previous paragraph makes it look like I was a kid who couldn’t take orders when in fact I could. I was a very polite, rule follower in class because I found it easier to do so rather than risk getting in trouble. I wish I had been more of a rule breaker and messer as a child. Not a menace but just more of a cheeky chappie than I was. Would have been more exciting that way!
•	⁠I genuinely find it very hard to hold a grudge against people who wronged me even though I wanted to form them sometimes. I watched with envy as other people formed grudges easily (often against me!).
•	⁠There’s always been a part of me that simply enjoyed being different from the crowd; not participating in mainstream activities; causing people shock and anger when they find out my interests differ from theirs etc. This part of me was strong as a child until I got suddenly very self-aware and self-conscious as a teenager. As I progress through my 20’s it is coming back but unlike the child me I have much needed self awareness and wisdom I didn’t have then so I feel with these traits I can harness that desire not to conform better and more effectively.
•	⁠I am quite conventionally handsome, am average height and am in very good shape especially for someone who has played very little sport. I’m not one of these alternative misfits who wear mad clothes and makeup, piercing etc. I really do not like piercings, tattoos, makeup, hair dye, lipstick, fake tan or attention grabbing clothes on men or women. I even find headphones too attention seeking and comical to look at. I genuinely find these things cringe worthy and instead like earbuds. I have an average hair cut and wear average clothes. As long as I am clean and smell good I am happy.
•	⁠I drink about 4/5 pints of alcohol a year as alcohol makes me feel bad and down. I have never smoked a cigarette and have vaped and smoked joints a literal handful of times. I also don’t like tea or coffee and have never touched an energy drink.
•	⁠I am very much heterosexual and had a girlfriend for a year as a teenager but broke it off after a year. It was great for the first while but I started to miss the freedom of being single. I went through my entire college years without so much as kissing a girl. I did fall deeply in love with a woman in college in my final year and we did some things together on our own and she as much as said she felt a strong connection to me but ultimately she was from a different country and had fallen in love with a man over there. Apart from this brief aberration in college I went on no dates as I generally preferred the idea of lifelong bachelorhood for various reasons (less stress; more freedom; more time; more money; overwhelmed at the thought of having kids and all the commitment a relationships and kids entail).
•	⁠I am still a virgin as I long have had some hang ups about sex that included fear of disease; fear of pregnancy; and being overwhelmed by the thought of penetration. I am slowly getting over these. I have considered going on dates (something I’ve never done before) and having short term relationships to see if maybe I might want to have a long term relationship at some point. I do like the idea of lying beside a woman, kissing and cuddling her, bringing her out for dinner, having deep stimulating conversations with her and doing activities together. Having said this the idea of a long term relationships can seem overwhelming and I don’t think I want children for the aforementioned reasons and also for the intensity of love; fear; worry etc you feel for your kids. It’s honestly unnerving to think about this even though I know having children is probably the most rewarding thing for most people. I want to stress that I do not feel like a loser for not wanting kids or a long-term relationship.
•	⁠My parents have had a strained marriage for many years now and this has affected me and my siblings in different ways. I now have a very open and transparent relationship with my mother and feel very comfortable talking to her about anything and for this relationship I am deeply grateful but this only started to develop in my early 20s. She was very concerned about me throughout my childhood and teens and tried to reach out many times but I said very little as it was greatly embarrassing for me. I also struggled to understand and thus articulate what was wrong as I was so full of anger and confusion.

Interestingly my sisters share some or my quirks especially the lack of interest in sport, in fact they actually have less of an interest in it then me. Over time I have seen the many benefits of sports and have taken up running competitively recently but still struggle to really get into following football teams or whatever. Overall, my sisters are more mainstream than me and have more genuine friends/boyfriends than me and have done very well academically too. I do not see eye to eye with them on a lot of them but am proud of all their achievements!

I am proud in different ways of all the aforementioned quirks even though I have to accept that many have held me back academically, socially, developmentally etc. I know many people secretly share at least some of these quirks but I still feel so different from others. I often have no desire to follow the crowd even if I want to have fun, develop hobbies, take part in some types of competition/community events in time and have people I can hang out even if I have no desire to form very close bonds with them etc.

Celia had lived alone in a quiet subdivision in Cagayan de Oro, tucked away behind rusting gates and tangled bougainvillea. Her neighbors were either asleep by 9 or never home. Which made the scratching sounds under her floor tiles, and the soft humming at 2:00 AM, feel like hallucinations only she was cursed to hear.
But someone was there.
Elias had fallen in love with her the first time he saw her — Pabayo, buying coffee and Yakult, with her torn converse shoes, laughing with the tindera. Something in her light pulled him into the dark. So he followed her home. No, he embedded himself in her life — literally. Through a loose maintenance tunnel under her rented house, he crawled in. Hid in the shadows of her walls. Slept beneath the plywood panels of her kitchen floor.
She never knew. But she felt watched. When her phone went missing and reappeared under her pillow. When her toothbrush was damp before she even woke up.
He whispered to her through the hollow air vents during brownouts:“Don’t cry. I’m here.”
She thought it was a ghost. So she started leaving offerings — old photos, salt, a glass of water. But the ghost didn’t want her fear. He wanted her.
One stormy night, the power cut out — again. She lit a candle, and that’s when she finally saw him. Wet hair. Muddy feet. Eyes wide with devotion and madness.
He said nothing. Just knelt in front of her, hands trembling like a man at the altar.
Celia should have screamed. Should’ve run to the barangay outpost, called her cousin who worked in the police.
But instead, she tilted her head and asked:
“Did you like the poetry I wrote last week?”

Hey, fellow language lovers! Let me tell you about a delightful day in my Italian class when I introduced the phrase *non solo... ma anche*. This phrase, meaning ""not only... but also,"" is a real gem for adding flair and depth to your sentences.

**Why is it so cool?**

- **Emphasizes two points**: First, you set up an expectation, then you surprise with more info.
- **Flexible structure**: You can mix things up and still sound fabulous!

Picture this: I asked my students to describe their favorite foods using *non solo... ma anche*. One student said, ""*Non solo* la pizza è deliziosa, *ma anche* nutriente!"" (Not only is pizza delicious, but it's also nutritious). We all chuckled, imagining pizza as a health food!

Another student shared, ""*Non solo* il gelato è dolce, *ma anche* rinfrescante!"" (Not only is ice cream sweet, but it's also refreshing). We could almost taste the creamy goodness!

**Real-life scenarios:**

- *Non solo* mi ha aiutato con i compiti, *ma anche* mi ha portato un caffè! (Not only did they help me with homework, but they also brought me coffee!)
- *Non solo* è un amico, *ma anche* un grande cuoco! (Not only is he a friend, but he's also a great cook!)

Have you tried using *non solo... ma anche* in your Italian conversations? Share your sentences! Let's chat and learn together.

Hoboken’s Bagel Drought Continues,"I overheard this gruff, older guy in front of me ask, “Where’s the rest of the menu? This is all you got? Three bagels?” Apollo feels like it was airdropped straight from an LA strip center anchored by Erewhon then sandwiched between Juice Generation and the kind of place that charges $20 for boxed water made with ethically sourced, upcycled Amazon boxes.

The menu offers three bagels, a handful of spreads, hot/cold coffee, fresh OJ and water. 

I waited (standing) an astonishing 15–20 minutes for two bagels: one with lox/cc and one with whitefish for about $15 each. You’d think they caught and smoked the salmon made to order but it’s really just bagels playing fancy dress up for the inevitable IG post.

When our food finally arrived, we competed among the modest Saturday afternoon crowd of bodies, strollers, genetically disadvantaged dogs for six tiny tables, each coated in a few hour’s worth of sesame and everything seeds.

The sourdough bagel is a bold move that actually works. Mine was a little stale at 2 pm, but that’s what I get for sleeping until noon.  

I get that Apollo has a loyal following in Manhattan and Brooklyn and it’s doing exactly what it’s designed to do. But if you were hoping this would end Hoboken’s mediocre bagel hegemony, I’m sorry to report the drought continues.

For those of us raised in the sacred bagel belt of suburban New Jersey, keep making that pilgrimage home. ",14,1760831996.0,Hoboken,17,0.64,False

1oabbzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1oabbzb/gaggia_accademia_terrible_coffee/,Gaggia Accademia Terrible Coffee,"TL:DR at the bottom...

My wife has a friend with a Philips 3200 that they use to make espresso drinks when they get together on the weekends. She loves the simplicity and hates trying to make drink with my Gaggia Classic. In an effort to make her happy by getting a superautomatic and also trying to find a high quality one that is truly as convenient as possible, I narrowed it down to a few options. Whole Latte Love had the Gaggia Accademia on sale for $1500, which seemed like the best deal on a new one I was going to find, so I pulled the trigger.

My thinking was, if she likes the drinks from the Philips machine, then the Gaggia should be able to make the same quality of drink since its literally the same exact brew group. The Accademia provides more drink options and more adjustments to ""tune"" the shot than the Philips. It also has the steam wand so I could, in theory, retire the Classic and stick to one machine and still be able to manually froth milk on the weekends. The removable self-cleaning milk carafe really dials up the convenience. Lastly, the machine is fucking gorgeous and has a reputation for lasting tens-of-thousands of drinks before needing service, and usually it can be repaired and keep chugging along after that (at least based on reports from the pre-2022 version).

Unfortunately, my attempts so far have been a dismal failure. I am very close to boxing it up and sending it back. I watched all of the official WLL setup and instructional videos, tons of videos on Youtube about the machine specifically and a ton more about ""tuning"" superautomatics, including James Hoffman's video. I've also read every guide I can find online about this machine specifically and went through the troubleshooting steps on WLL. When it arrived I got it all set up and started playing around with the Gaggia espresso beans they send with the machine. I didn't expect much from those beans but the machine needs to calibrate itself through the first 6 to 10 shots anyway so I figured I would see how it goes. Per the recommendations online, I started by simply trying to tune a single espresso shot. I am very methodical. I pulled and threw away the first 6 shots without paying any attention to the quality. After that, I started a painstaking process of tuning,

Grinder Setting: 1/8 (WLL Recommendation)

Aroma Setting: 3/5

Pre-Infusion: 2/3

Temp: Medium

Flow Control: Medium

Volume: 1.0oz

The result was pretty bad, so I increased the volume by .2 to .3oz increments until I hit the max at 2.7. I could detect the sour-bitter tradeoff but every shot was a combination of sour and bitter and also had a smoky/burnt smell to it. So I moved the grinder up one click and started the whole process again with the rest of the settings the same. The result was maybe a little better bit still rough. I did this until I hit grind setting 5/8 where the shot seemed to settle down a bit and I got an ""okay"" result that wasn't like drinking battery acid. At this point I started playing with the aroma, pre-infusion and temp settings. I also swapped over to some locally roasted french-roast that is less than a week old to try to get better results. The beans are a decent matte with maybe a slight sheen but no excess oil on the surface. I ended up here,

Grinder Setting: 4/8

Aroma Setting: 5/5

Pre-Infusion: 2/3

Temp: High

Flow Control: Medium

Volume: 1.0oz

This is the best I have achieved so far. Again, its an ""okay"" shot, but more drinkable than anything else I have come up with. 

Now the true frustration begins! I decide that I want to start making some milk drinks with the hopes that I can start to replace our $6.50 latte habit. I fill the milk carafe and choose the Caffe Latte setting, set the same settings as my espresso shot with \~6oz of milk froth and make a drink. The result was a terrible combination of burnt coffee and watery milk. I started playing with all the settings again and could not make a remotely reasonable drink. I finally got frustrated and pulled the shot alone into a glass and cancelled the milk. The shot, with the same settings as my espresso shot, was again a terrible acidic mess. I started to realize that the espresso option from the main menu has nothing in common with the coffee that gets extracted during other drink options. The machine changes SOMETHING when making these drinks and they turn out different than solo espresso shots. I went through the entire process above but for milk drinks and I'm to the point that a 1oz espresso with \~3.4oz of milk (close to the smallest allowable) is a complete watery disaster. Not to mention that if I want enough of this crappy drink to take with me in the car to go shopping, for example, I have to run the routine 3 or 4 times and its basically undrinkable. In the same amount of time it takes me to make 4 of these drinks I can pull an amazing shot from my Classic and steam my own damn milk and have cafe quality to go.

I also believe the software for this machine is terribly flawed or bugged. I have made several attempts to use the ""Coffee Boost"" option to try to increase the coffee flavor of the milk drinks and it just makes a horrible burnt bitter drink. I realized after several attempts at tuning THAT option, that it doesn't pull equally sized shots. Regardless of the size, 1.7 to 2.7oz, it pulls about two-thirds of the shot from the first grind and the remaining third from the second grind. It combines a very over-extracted first shot with a very under-extracted second shot and the result is a smoky acidic burnt coffee flavor that has no place in any coffee setup. I don't know if my machine is working as intended but I can't for the life of me figure out why one of the largest coffee machine makers (or any coffee machine maker) in the world would think this is a good idea. This function might as well not exist.

I've burned through almost 4 pounds of beans between the bag they sent and a few types that I've tried of the local roasted stuff and I'm not even close to having something I can live with. How can a $1500 to $2000 machine be this bad? I'm going to try a few more types of beans, including the ones that my wife's friend uses in hers (which are relatively cheap store-brand organic espresso beans) to see if any of those are different. I don't know where to go from here. There is no guide from Gaggia, WLL or anyone else that I can find that gives any information on a method to properly dial in this machine. Beyond a few recommendations about finding the best grind size and some basic alterations, its just ""try stuff till you find what works"". I'm going to see if I can schedule a service call with WLL and find out if I'm just doing something terribly wrong but I'm not holding my breath that they are going to magically fix it. Has anyone had any luck getting a good drink out of this machine or have any recommendations on what to try, including a more methodical routine to fine tune things? If I can't make any progress this thing is definitely going back.

TL:DR

I've tried almost everything I can think of and can make an ""okay"" espresso (not what I bought the machine for) and have not produced a milk drink that I would consider to be even remotely close to a replacement for a cafe quality drink. Is there anything I can try before I send this thing back?",1,1760831893.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

I only eat once a day and what's crazy is I feel better and don't crash like I used to when on a standard diet.

I will generally eat around 6PM and it will usually be a pound of 80/20 ground beef or a pound of chicken. Sometimes I'll add half a pound of bacon or so. For the last 2 weeks though I've gone wild with pork rinds. Prob 2-3oz's a night. That or I'll cut off half an inch of cheese from the brick and snack on that. Eggs and cholula hot sauce as well.

I live in Sydney and have a dachshund named Nomi.
Like a lot of doxie parents here, I could never find clothes that actually fit.
Everything was either too tight on the chest, too short on the back, or just… a bit too “cute” for our style 😅

So I started experimenting — learning some basic sewing, collecting fabric samples, and trying to make something that felt soft, simple, and comfortable for his long little body.
It took a few messy tries, but when he finally wore the first finished sweater, it just clicked.
Something that felt right, looked good, and made him even prouder on our morning coffee walks ☕️

Now it’s become a small obsession — designing pieces that feel calm, minimal, and made for real dachshund life.
Still learning, still adjusting, but it’s been such a fun journey.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, then yes, I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning, I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

I (22F) need to scream into the void about my ex (23M) because I swear I dated the human version of a financial parasite. This dude wasn’t poor, he was just broke minded. Like… he didn’t even try. No job, no plan, no shame. And for some reason I ignored every red flag like a clown in love.

At first, it was small stuff. We’d be out with friends, they’d be talking about splitting hotel costs, and this man jumped into the convo like, “You guys are splitting it, right?” then turned to me smiling like some dumb sitcom character. Another time, a friend’s girlfriend said her BF was taking her makeup shopping and then she invited us to join like, “Come with us, maybe your boyfriend can treat you to something too” Before I could even respond, mine goes “We don’t have that kinda relationship 😏.” Bro… read the room. I wanted to evaporate. It’s not like I’d even say yes, but dude was so terrified of potentially paying for anything that he cut me off before I could even respond.

Anyway, he couldn’t find an internship, so against my better judgment, I got him into mine. (Yeah, I know. I hate myself too for that.) From day one, it was straight up painful. Every time I ordered something, he’d be like, “Let’s order together, we can spilt it at the door paying cash.” Bro… he knew these places didn’t even do cash on delivery. It literally wasn’t an option. So, every. single. time. the order went through my phone, my card. And surprise, surprise he never paid me back. Not a cent. Instead, he’d grin like it was all a game and say, “Aww, you didn’t wanna pay cash, huh?” Like… seriously? Shut up, man. Just once, be embarrassed that you’re freeloading off me. Four months. FOUR. MONTHS. Of me paying for everything. food, coffee, snacks, you name it. His idea of splitting was “you buy the meal, I’ll buy the coffee” like sir, a $12 latte does NOT equal $45 dinner??? And even that coffee thing happened like once a month.

Once my sister came with us, we spent around 1500 TL ($45) on food, I paid. He goes, “I’ll send it later.” Instead, he drags us to a cafe and goes, “The meal’s on you, coffee’s on me 😎.” My sister looked at me like, “This dude serious right now?” He was. And he loved embarrassing me in front of waiters too “Let’s play rock paper scissors to see who pays 😝.” Like, what are you, twelve? I just paid to shut it down. I felt so small. So disrespected. Looking back, I wanna grab my past self and yell STOP PAYING FOR THAT MAN.

It’s not about the money , it’s the audacity. The way he acted like I was doing it for fun, like I enjoyed being his sponsor. I kept thinking maybe he’d grow up, maybe he didn’t realize. No. He realized. He just didn’t care. We dated for nine months, and I still get mad thinking about those moments. Even when I was breaking up with him, I tried to end things on good terms but instead I spent three exhausting days listening to him talk nonstop, defending himself like he’d done nothing wrong. And honestly, I’m not even getting into how physically inappropriate he could be sometimes, the boundary issues, the constant unwanted touching, the lack of respect for personal space. Just thinking about it gives me the ick.

Was I too soft? Too nice? Or are there just this many broke men with main character syndrome out here. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant. I’m officially done being the nice girl who covers it.

TL;DR: Dated for nine months (four months working together). My ex wasn’t broke, just shameless.

Hey, Reddit. I don’t even know where to start, and honestly, I’m typing this shaking so hard that my keyboard might explode. I just… I need to get this off my chest before I lose my mind completely.



I live alone in a small apartment in an old building downtown. Nothing fancy, but it’s cheap, which is why I took it. I’ve been here for about six months, and until recently, everything was normal. Or at least I thought it was.



It started last week, Monday, I think. I came home from work, super tired, and put my keys on the counter. When I turned around, the keys weren’t there. I swore I’d just put them down. I searched the whole apartment, thinking maybe I dropped them somewhere dumb, but they were gone. Eventually, I found them… in the kitchen sink. Wet. Like someone had washed them. I live alone. I never wash my keys.



I brushed it off as me being tired. But then Tuesday… things got weirder. My fridge was open when I got home. Nothing missing, nothing out of place, just… open. I locked it properly before leaving in the morning. The lights in my apartment started flickering randomly. Not the building’s main lights, just mine.



By Wednesday, I felt watched. Like… really watched. I would sit on my couch and just feel eyes on me. The weird thing is, the sensation was subtle at first, just the corner of my eye, something moving slightly, but not enough for me to see clearly. I blamed it on stress.



Thursday night, I woke up to the sound of someone breathing. Heavy. Right next to my bed. I bolted upright, heart pounding, and… no one was there. Nothing. My bedroom door was closed, my windows locked. But the smell… the smell of my apartment was different. I don’t know how to describe it, but it was like… plastic, or fake? Like the air was… staged.



I started noticing little things after that. My phone would be in a completely different spot than where I left it. My shoes… moved. Not just kicked around, like deliberately placed somewhere else. And my reflection in the mirror? I… I swear it blinked when I didn’t.



Friday, I didn’t even go to work. I stayed home, locked every door, sat in the middle of my living room like some idiot, watching. And that’s when I saw it.



It was me.



I came out of my bedroom to grab some water and… someone—or something—was standing in my kitchen. At first, I thought I was seeing double. But then I noticed the little things. My posture was wrong. The smile… not mine. It smiled at me.



I screamed. It didn’t move. Just… smiled. And then it started copying me. Every little gesture I made, it mimicked perfectly. I swear, I tried to run, and it ran after me. I locked myself in the bathroom, but it banged on the door. My own voice, but… not mine, was shouting through the door. “Come out. Let’s be us together.”



I don’t know what it is, Reddit. I’ve been sleeping in my car since Friday night. I haven’t touched my apartment. But last night, I got a text. From my number.



“You look tired. Want me to take over?”



I don’t know what to do. My friends think I’m losing it. I can’t… I can’t go back. And now… I think it’s not just trying to copy me. I think it wants to be me.



Please. If anyone has ever experienced anything like this… tell me what to do. I can’t go back. But leaving it there… I don’t know if I’ll even exist anymore if I don’t.



UPDATE: Okay, Reddit. I’d update, and I’m barely holding it together. I’ve been parked in my car for three nights now, drinking terrible gas-station coffee, and staring at my apartment like some lunatic. I know it’s watching me. I can feel it.



So here’s what happened last night.



I finally worked up the nerve to peek inside. I parked across the street and looked through my window. The lights were off, but I swear… it was moving. Or rather, it was moving. Me. My doppelgänger. Sitting on my couch, exactly like I would, scrolling on my phone like nothing was wrong. I froze. I couldn’t breathe.



Then it looked up. Straight at me. And smiled. That wrong smile. It waved.



I ran. Across the street. Down the block. Heart pounding, screaming, anything to feel alive. But when I turned back… my apartment door was open. Slowly. Like it knew I was watching.



This morning, I tried calling my friends. No answer. Tried my parents… voicemail. Even my landlord, who I normally talk to about dumb stuff like broken faucets… silent.



I went back to the apartment at noon. I know, dumb, right? I thought maybe if I just grabbed some stuff, I could leave forever. But the second I stepped inside… it was there. Not in the kitchen this time. Behind me. In the hallway. And the thing is… it doesn’t move like a person. It glides. No sound. And it’s always perfectly still when I look at it, but the moment I blink, it’s closer.



I tried to talk to it. “Who are you? What do you want?” I whispered. My voice shook so bad I think I scared myself more than it.



And then it spoke. My voice. My tone. My exact words.



“I want to be me.”

1oab2ef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oab2ef,Meet Journiv — A self-hosted private journaling & mood tracker inspired from Immich,"Hey everyone!

I got into self-hosting last year after discovering **Immich** — it was my gateway into realizing how good, and inspiring open-source software can be. As a software engineer, I also really connected with Alex Tran’s story and how Immich came to life.

While diving deeper into the self-hosting world, I was looking for a journaling solution and there wasn’t a proper self-hosted alternative to **Day One** or **Apple Journal.** Most of what I found were note-taking apps or old, abandoned projects — not quite the journaling experience I was looking for.

So I decided to build my own: **Journiv** — a private, self-hosted journaling and mood-tracking app focused on a clean, minimal writing experience with features like **“On This Day”** and **daily prompts**.

A lot of my motivation came from the Immich story, so I figured this community might help with some early feedback.

Demo video: [https://imgur.com/a/Z5oBMgU](https://imgur.com/a/Z5oBMgU) (also in post)

**Stack**

* **Backend:** Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
* **Frontend:** Flutter (cross-platform web + mobile)

**Features**

* Clean, minimal, distraction-free writing
* “On this day” view
* Prompt-based journaling
* Mood tracking
* Multiple journals + tags
* Full-text search
* Insights & analytics
* Light/dark mode
* Media gallery view

**Coming soon**

* Quick audio notes
* Apple Journaling Suggestions integration
* Weather & health metadata
* Location tagging (map view for travel entries)

I’m planning to open-source this soon and would love some early feedback first. Curious if folks here would find a self-hosted journaling app like this useful — and what features you’d want to see. It’s my first real project in Python + Flutter, so there are definitely a few rough spots. Early testers and feedback would mean a lot!

1oaas34,https://i.redd.it/sxphn5zngyvf1.jpeg,Story Time,"Yesterday I set out to play my second ever solo round of golf. After locking myself out of the house on my way out the door, with my car keys hanging there just inside, spilling coffee in the car on my way to the course, and then getting to the course and realizing I forgot my shoes (had to turn around to get them, fortunately I live close by), I should have known it wasn’t going to be my day.

I got started on my round regardless. There was a twosome playing ahead of me, a man and a woman, and a twosome behind me, two men. I could tell the guys behind me were good and playing pretty fast, and the group in front was slow. So I was feeling pressure and rushing to hit as soon as it was appropriate to do so, but it made me feel uncomfortable and I probably lost 4 balls on the first 5 holes.

Finally on the 6th hole, I hit a beautiful drive, cutting the corner on a dog leg right, just like I intended, so I was happy. As I drove out to find it I could not find it. There was a very small ravine running across the fairway, probably 80 yds from the green, and sure enough there was my brand new ball sitting in the middle of the mud. I dropped another ball on the front side of the ravine area, and had to wait for the couple ahead of me to finish at the green before taking my shot. In the meantime I thought, “I bet I could get my ball”… I made two steps out towards it by standing on some fresh dirt and then in my nice white shoes, I started to sink… water moving up towards the top of my shoe. In an effort to get out I pushed off my left foot towards the bank, then my right foot sunk in. I needed one more step to get my left foot to the bank, but as I pushed off my right foot, it sunk even further down, causing my foot to come completely out of my shoe. I should have snapped a pic.

So there I was, feet covered in mud, looking like a damn fool, after already having a bad morning and a terrible round so far. I had time to do a “fit check” style video so that I could see how much mud had flicked up onto my back side. I had sunglasses on and it was bright out, so it was hard to see, but in the moment it looked okay.

On the next tee, the twosome behind caught up to me as we all waited for the group in front to move off the fairway. They asked if I wanted to just play with them, and I said, “sure”. Second time I’ve played solo, so I was a little nervous but it was fine. I showed them my feet and said “you can see how my round is going today”, and the older gentleman said “were you partying in a puddle?” It was time to tee off and one of the guys starts heading to the blue tee box, while the other man starts to tell me that he was a former pro and played on the Nike tour. I’m just thinking to myself “great” 🙃

I honestly had such a nice experience with them for the rest of the round. I didn’t lose another ball and I even managed to get 3 birdies (still shot a 91 😂). They were encouraging, gave me tips, and we all hoped to see each other there again.

The story is almost over, but not before I mention that when I got home, I was looking through some pictures and videos I took from my round. When I watched through the “fit check” video I took after the mud incident, I noticed something absolutely horrific… I didn’t see it before because of how bright it was, and wearing my sunglasses, but I had a quarter-sized splatter of mud on my butt… in the mid-line… right where my you-know-what is…. How mortifying 😂😭 I started to think about how every time I teed off, these guys had to look at my backside with a mud spot right over my hole 😂 All I could do was laugh and hope tomorrow is kinder to me.",0,1760830351.0,golf,2,0.38,False

1oaamrz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oaamrz,"Testing effects of oxygen and light on alkaloid content, with implications on whether to obsess about spore dropping","A spirited discussion has been going on on another post about how quickly the actives degrade in fruits upon dropping spores.  u/SolidReporter8229 is quite assertive that product significantly declines in potency immediately upon spore drop.  For various reasons, I don't believe this.  Quite serendipitously, I happen to have the materials available for us to use science rather than Google to improve our understanding.  

This question came up when another user posted pics that had a bit of spore drop going on. u/SolidReporter8229 chided the poster for ruining his crop, and I weighed in that this is silly,  spores are messy, but the fruits do not instantly lose potency when the spores fall.  My colleague is insistent that psilocybin is damaged by oxygen and light, this happens quickly, and is sufficient to be highly concerned about  
  
My belief, based on psilocybin chemistry, fungal biology, and physics is that fruits from a tub the day after the spores drop are messy, but are essentially the same potency.  I have measured this in the past using miraculix tests.  

My proposal in the other thread is that lets not argue, let's measure.  I harvested the tub shown starting three days ago.  I dried the fruit at 145\*, and then ground up 5 grams to run the miraculix test on, and the results are shown.  The rest of the sample has been in the coffee grinder since them.  It is finely ground, and has been exposed to air, mild humidity and light for almost three days.  If oxygen and light have the power to degrade post sporulation fruits, then I would expect this sample to show significant degradation.  My expectation is that it won't, but I don't yet know.  Let's find out.  

I am running the sample through the dehydrator for  an hour to make sure it is dry, and then I'll test again. 

I have a dozen or so remaining fruits in the rub, I can let them drop spores, and test them as well, if anyone identifies a rationale to test further.

# Training

32yo, male, 80kg, 178cm.

Have been running consistently for 2-3 years with an average of \~30kms/week, 2-3 runs/week. **Marathon training block of \~4 months, 3-4 runs/week with an average of \~45kms/week, peaking at \~70kms with a longest run of 28kms, and a 2 week taper.**

Besides running, I lift 2 times per week, focusing on the key compounds lifts. 

Previous PBs: 1:45 half, 48min 10k, 23min 5k. 

# Pre-race

Race course was net downhill, weather was a cloudy 11-17C. Great conditions overall, I was anxious but pumped. 

Instead of gels, I made my own carb drink by mixing white sugar and maltodextrin, plus table salt and an electrolyte powders. This was about 250g of carbs and 2000mg of sodium in a 700ml bottle. In addition to the cocktail, I had 4 caffeine gels on me; I don't drink coffee at all, so I had them as a turbo/SOS button. Total planned carb intake was \~75g/hr. 

Carb loaded for 2-3 days, didn't really count it but just ate a lot more carbs than I used to. Had more carbs 3 hours before race, and popped a non-caffeinated gel 15 min before start. 

**Runalyze and Strava predictions had me at 4:20-4:30 finish, and my goal was sub 4hrs.** 

# Race

The whole thing is somewhat of a blur, but here's what I can piece together:

* **0-5km**: Started off really solid, pace was about 10-15 seconds slower than goal pace (so about \~5:50min/km or so). Felt fantastic, happy that I was sticking to the plan. 
* **5-15km**: Pacing strategy goes out the window. This was the biggest net downhill of the whole course, so I wanted to bank up some time. The plan was to run about 10s faster than goal pace, but it ended up being closer to 20s faster. At this stage, I thought that I had sub 4 in the bag, and even crazy thoughts of a 3:50 finish were entering my mind. Confidence at all time high, IQ at all time low. 
* **15-25km**: The course flattens, and I settle in at \~5s faster than my 5:40min/km goal pace. I begin to feel some fatigue, so I pop a 20mg caffeine gel at 25km mark as a just-in-case precaution. 
* **25-30km**: Reality sets in. I begin to slowly but deeply understand what is meant by ""a marathon begins at km 30."" I'm not yet cooked, but I'm getting there. Took a 40mg caffeine gel as a SOS at 30km. 
* **30-42km**: I can vaguely remember this as a trance-like state of horrible self-inflicting discomfort, with no end in sight. It's like voluntary hell –– you can leave anytime (slow down or stop), but that's somehow even worse. I popped my last 35mg caffeinated gel at 36km as a Hail Mary, but I'm not sure that anything could save me at this point. People say that after 40km it becomes easier, but I had hills at 38/39/42kms, so it only got easier after the final hill and within a few hundred meters of the finish. 

Finish time as per my watch, which I was using to pace myself the entire race, was 3:58:54. I thought I had a 1min gap, but at the finish line I discovered that my chip time was 4:00:26. Had I known that I was 26s behind, I (would like to) think that I would have pushed through, but it is what it is. 

# Post-race

No injuries, which I attribute to regular lifting. Extreme soreness for 2 days, which suddenly stopped on day 3. 

Looking back at it, I think that I've made 3 mistakes, which hopefully you can avoid:

1. **Went out too fast, too soon** – In the 5-15kms, I should have stuck to the plan and ran only slightly faster at max 3:30min/km. I think this contributed significantly to the severity of hell I was in the final \~10kms.
2. **Fueling wasn't precise enough –** My carb drink was solid, but unlike gels, it's difficult to accurately dose. Instead of timing fueling in X gels per Y minutes, I had to rely on X sips, which is far from accurate. All in all, I think that I likely underfueled. 
3. **Didn't drink enough water** – Besides the 700ml water in the carb drink that I had, I only relied on the drinks provided in aid stations, which was far from consistent. Also maintaining a race pace and drinking from a cup is surprisingly difficult, so I usually spilled more than half of it. I think that having a vest or at least a bottle that you can top up at each aid station would be much better. I definitely didn't drink enough water. 

All in all, I'm not sure I want to go through this again. But I'm also not sure that I don't. Which means that I probably will. Maybe. 

  
Good luck to you all!

AMA","I'm David Baxter and I spent the last 6 years of my life planning, building, and running Beanchain Coffee. 

I had been in poverty most of my adult life and broke out of it by teaching myself web development and lying on my resume. It really is a trap here in the US, poverty. 

After getting a small inheritance that I didn't expect some time later I left my job and started trying to use my life to fix the issues I experienced. No one should have to struggle to pay for medication, food, or housing and live in fear of debt to the point that they risk their life. We all deserve to live with dignity. 

I'm trying to tackle the problem like a developer. Thinking about it just one step at a time. The goal is to end poverty in the USA. I think the way to do that is to have more worker ownership and better wages for everyone. 

To that end we're building a worker directed model and a shop that will become a worker owned cooperative. Then we'll make a network of them around a non profit that helps them scale while staying local and worker owned. Lastly we will build a larger coalition of worker owned businesses, cooperatives, ESOPs, and any other business that puts people and workers first. 

I think this will take the rest of my life and Im happy to give it. I feel more motivated everyday though it's been the most costly and hardest thing I've ever done.

1oaakge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNightmareFactory/comments/1oaakge/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

I’ll be visiting Montréal from Sunday, Oct 19 – Wednesday, Oct 22 and wanted to share my itinerary to see if it makes sense / anything I should tweak. Hope I didn’t plan too much, I don’t want to stress myself out during my first solo trip lol 

Also got a couple of quick questions at the end. 

Montréal 3-Day Solo Trip Itinerary

Day 1 — Sunday, Oct 19: Arrival
	•	3:00 PM – Check into hotel (Hampton Inn Downtown)

⸻

	•	9:00 AM – Explore Underground City (RÉSO) & Downtown Montréal

	•	11:00 AM – Breakfast at St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmount Bagel (can’t decide!)

	•	12:00 PM – Explore Mile End (short walk from Fairmount I think?)

	•	2:00 PM – Coffee break at Café Olimpico ☕

	•	Evening – Open to restaurant suggestions! If the Jays are playing Game 7 Monday night, I’ll need another spot to watch the game.

⸻

Day 3 — Tuesday, Oct 21: Mount Royal
	•	10:00 AM – Head to Mount Royal Park
 • Hike to Kondiaronk Belvedere lookout – is it a tough hike or pretty chill? Worth getting a tour guide or fine solo?

⸻

Questions:
	1.	On arrival day, what’s the best way to get from the airport to downtown? Is it worth taking an Uber, or should I just hop on the 747 bus?

2. Where’s the best place downtown to catch the Blue Jays game Sunday night?

3.	How does the bus/metro situation work for visitors? Do I need a 1-week pass, or can I just tap with Apple Pay when boarding?

4. Any must-try restaurants or hidden gems I should swap in?

Sorry about the formatting, did this on my phone. 

Thanks in advance, really looking forward to this trip! ",0,1760829757.0,montreal,12,0.29,False

When I moved here, it was solely to go to college at CSUF. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize how hard it would be to make friends during my time there. I didn’t know it was mainly a commuter school and i was in a toxic relationship that made it difficult to join clubs/sororities (don’t want to get into the details of it).

Fast forward, I’m 26 met and live with an amazing man and have an adorable cat. I feel like the only thing left for my well being is to find/make some wholesome friends. Working remote 100% has added to the struggle of meeting new people. My bf’s friends have become mine, but would love to make connections of my own. 

Any advice? Some things to know about me:
- live in Orange, grew up in the Bay
- i love to do my own nails
- i love animals (except snakes and bugs)
- keeping up with pop culture (generally speaking)
- watching movies, docus, podcasts
- beginner/intermediate at-home baker
- cat mom
- foodie
-  enjoy visiting local breweries/coffee/matcha/boba spots
- open to walking or easy hiking groups (not really athletic but open to anything for beginners) 

Thanks in advance! ☺️

1oaaib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1oaaib5/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

With so many people having genuinely good espresso at home now, I’ve always found it a bit funny going away on holiday and the coffee is worse than what I normally drink. It feels backwards when the stay is supposed to feel like a treat.

I’m researching whether there’s a need for a fully managed espresso setup for Airbnbs (machine + beans + servicing included for a flat weekly fee), and I’m trying to understand what matters most to hosts, not guests.

If you were to consider something like this, I’d love to understand a few things from your perspective:
	1.	What would be the biggest factor in deciding whether this is worth it for you?
(cost, reliability, fewer headaches, perceived guest value, etc)
	2.	Would you even want a machine you don’t own long-term, or is ownership important to you?
(leasing vs buying outright)
	3.	How worried would you be about maintenance, cleaning, or guests damaging it?
	4.	Is having beans and servicing included genuinely useful, or would you rather supply your own if it meant lower cost?
	5.	What would make this a “yes” for you vs “not worth it”?

Not trying to sell anything at this point — just trying to validate whether this actually solves a problem for hosts or if it’s more of a “nice idea but not practical”.

Appreciate any honest replies from people who’ve either upgraded their setup already or thought about it.

1oaahq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1oaahq3/whats_worked_for_me/,What’s worked for me,"Hey everyone! M, 31. I have struggled with both internal and external hemorrhoids for years now. When it was really bad, I’d have a thrombosed that hurt like hell. Just about every other BM I would have an alarming amount of bleeding. 

About a week ago, I had another flare up and scheduled a doctor’s appointment. I was prescribed hydrocortisone suppositories. 

I got so tired of bleeding onto my clothes, which is not only embarrassing but expensive. I was with friends, and someone mentioned that I must have sat in something because I had bled on to my jeans. Never again. 

I swallowed my pride and put aside my vanity, and went to the store and bought some male Depends (adult incontinence underwear). I started wearing them backwards (so the urine incontinence pad is over my butt instead) and applying cream and suppositories after each bm. Not only did this decrease my anxiety around my issues, but it also seems to have allowed the area to heal a lot faster as opposed to sticking toilet paper in there, which almost certainly irritated it. 

I’m now almost completely healed with my external hemorrhoids. They are the smallest they have ever been, especially since I’ve had two BMs today- which would normally knock me out for a day or two. I am so happy, and I’m having normal BMs because I’ve also been taking miralax every morning with my coffee, and drinking a lot of water- there’s not a time during the day where I don’t have water near me. I’ll let you all know how this all ends up, but at this rate I might not have to have a procedure after all- wishful thinking, probably! ",2,1760829548.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

I’ve spent today doing fun things. I went to my new art class, I got my favorite coffee, I visited friends, I hooked up, and I’m going to a birthday party tonight. But I felt like a zombie.

I miss his family. I’ll never know if I even crossed his mind today. Or if he took another date to the wedding. It’s not my place to, but that’s tough anyway.

1oaadyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1oaadyw/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

1oaadj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AngelWithBrokenWing/comments/1oaadj2/bonk/,Bonk,"Part 5: It seemed like every day we faced new challenges we never could have expected, both big and small.  One that really stuck with me was when we decided to take India on a walk.  We put her in her stroller and set off towards the local park.  Just after we headed out, India started whimpering, then crying, then screaming.  To save our lives, we couldn’t figure out what was wrong.  We re-positioned her, held her, tried to feed her, adjusted her straps and finally gave up our walk and went home.  When we arrived back at the house, we undressed India so we could change her diaper and to our horror found a sharp sticker from some sort of weed embedded deep into the skin of her buttock.  Somehow this damn sticker found its way into the stroller and ended up penetrating her delicate skin. 

Although my little girl was old enough to communicate verbally, she couldn’t because of her Cerebral Palsy.  The only thing she could do was cry in the hopes we’d figure out what was wrong.  This was very rough for me because I was unable to understand what she was trying to tell us. It was especially hard because I felt so sorry for the frustration my little girl must have felt at not being able to communicate. 

Veruca and I pushed on, getting up every morning, putting on our shoes, taking that first step and doing the best we could.  Fortunately, after a couple of years my business began to take off.  I started to push Veruca to up the amount of therapy for India.  I truly believed that the more therapy our daughter could participate in the better; and since we didn’t know which therapy was beneficial and which one wasn’t, we just decided to do all of them in unprecedented amounts.  We began to travel around the United States and Canada for services.  I would rely on Veruca to find the services and I’d find a way to pay for them.  Our daughter did begin to progress as a result of the therapies, but I still wish I knew then what I know now. I wish I’d known that simple lifestyle changes with good routines and plenty of activities at home truly had the potential to help India’s progress and have a lasting effect, rather than twenty different types of therapies away from home. I didn’t know this then—I didn’t know how to create a stable home and beneficial routines, or how to encourage India to be independent—I thought I’d get all the answers from therapies. They did help somewhat though: India began to gain muscle tone and to sit with her legs crossed for short periods of time unaided, and she developed some strength.  She started eating better and clearly became happier.

We were ecstatic about these improvements; we thought she was beating the odds in a huge way.  So over the next nine years, we put absolutely everything we could into India’s care and rehabilitation.  \*The list is long and reached costs of up to $250,000 per year.  If we had the money, we’d pay cash, otherwise we’d max out our credit cards and use a second mortgage on our home to cover the expenses.  The intensive regiment of interventions and therapies kept India, Veruca, and at times our second daughter on the road for the better part of each year, including almost 12 consecutive months in Canada.

While all of this traveling was taking place, I also had to run my company, which was booming.  I often had to do this from wherever India was, remotely.  I was constantly in an airport, hotel, hospital, restaurant, or intervention facility with my laptop and cell phone, working away.  There was even a time where India was yet again on life support and I was forced to work while sitting by her side, but more about that later.

Almost two years after India was born, we had another little girl, Harriet.  As Harriet grew, she became best friends with India.  Harriett didn’t see anything wrong with her sister; she treated her like any other kid.  This included screwing with her big sister.  Harriett could execute guerrilla warfare on India, attack and run.  Of course India couldn’t pursue Harriett, which made the game all the more fun for India’s little sister.  There was one day that Harriett’s guerrilla warfare came to an end and I’m happy to say that I was fortunate enough to witness it.

Harriett must have been about 4 years old and had gotten her hands on a long tube from a roll of gift-wrapping paper.  She was running in big circles around the living room, whacking India’s head with the tube every time she passed her.  India was furious, yelling profanities in her own way after every whack.  What I didn’t notice at the time was that India was intently watching her sister’s every move, waiting to strike.  The moment finally came during one of her sister’s whacking raids.  India had patiently waited for her sister to become complacent, to get too close.  Harriett came in for another attack on her sister, and as she approached India, raising the long cardboard and preparing to drop the bonker on India’s cranium, India shot out her one good arm, grabbing Harriett’s hair.  Before I knew it, India was yanking her sister’s head back and forth.  Harriett was shrieking at the top of her lungs, India’s eyes were wide open, a smile from ear to ear as she performed her well earned payback.  I’d never seen India look so satisfied ever in her life. She was in control.  Harriett was screaming at an octave high enough to shatter glass, India was laughing at the top of her lungs, the dog was howling, the cats had run for cover, and there I stood, sipping a cup of coffee watching the mayhem in my living room, happy as a father can be.  My daughters were interacting just like other siblings do around the world, for the first time.

India was empowered after the whacking event, and she had much more confidence, not to mention respect from her little sister.  India began to tease Harriett as often as she could.  One of her favorite things to do that just drove her sister crazy was to mimic Harriett when she was talking to her mother.  You see India at the time really couldn’t talk.  She could however open and close her mouth at whatever speed she wanted.  Whenever her sister was talking to her mother and her mother’s back was to India, India would open and close her mouth at the same rate her sister would while speaking.  This would infuriate Harriett, she would turn bright red and yell, “Stop it, India!”  When the girls’ mother would turn around to look at India, India would have stopped mimicking her sister and would give her mother an innocent look.  India couldn’t ever keep the innocent look on her face though, she would curl up and giggle in a beautiful high-pitched laugh from deep inside her; it was heartwarming. 

As India became stronger and gained more control over her body, she learned to maneuver her manual wheelchair by herself.  She would wheel that thing all over the house using her one good arm.  This was a new sense of freedom for India.  The first time that India actually was able to move the wheelchair from one part of the house to another was an evening to remember.  Veruca and I were in the kitchen talking as dinner was being prepared.  We had put India in her wheelchair back in her room.  Until that point, India could only rotate her chair in circles.  Veruca and I were deep in conversation when we heard India yelling “eewww, no Gary no, eewww,” followed by a loud squeaky laugh.  As we spun around to see what was happening, we saw India in her chair, parked just outside the bathroom, watching the dog drink out of the toilet.  India had figured out how to wheel her chair out of her room, down the hall, and position herself in front of the bathroom door so that she could watch the family dog have a refreshing drink of toilet water!  India made a point of telling the story of her dog drinking toilet water as best she could to anybody who’d listen for many months to come.  It made her laugh like a loon each and every time she told her story.",1,1760829222.0,u_AngelWithBrokenWing,0,1.0,False
1oaad4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbianr4r/comments/1oaad4x/33f_europeanywhere_futile_devices/,33F Europe/Anywhere - Futile Devices,"Hello. I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here.

I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it. If more happens, I won't say no.

I want to connect so deeply. I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. I really want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it. 

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am but yeah.

The boring things: I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I starting crochet and painting abstract, knife painting, reading classics in coffee shops. 
I like doing different things. 

I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know.

1oaad1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnbhostsaustralia/comments/1oaad1r/hosts_would_you_ever_lease_a_premium_espresso/,Hosts - would you ever lease a premium espresso setup instead of buying one outright?,"Hey all. With so many people having genuinely good espresso at home now, I’ve always found it a bit funny going away on holiday and the coffee is worse than what I normally drink. It feels backwards when the stay is supposed to feel like a treat.

I’m researching whether there’s a need for a fully managed espresso setup for Airbnbs (machine + beans + servicing included for a flat weekly fee), and I’m trying to understand what matters most to hosts, not guests.

If you were to consider something like this, I’d love to understand a few things from your perspective:
	1.	What would be the biggest factor in deciding whether this is worth it for you?
(cost, reliability, fewer headaches, perceived guest value, etc)
	2.	Would you even want a machine you don’t own long-term, or is ownership important to you?
(leasing vs buying outright)
	3.	How worried would you be about maintenance, cleaning, or guests damaging it?
	4.	Is having beans and servicing included genuinely useful, or would you rather supply your own if it meant lower cost?
	5.	What would make this a “yes” for you vs “not worth it”?

Not trying to sell anything at this point — just trying to validate whether this actually solves a problem for hosts or if it’s more of a “nice idea but not practical”.

Appreciate any honest replies from people who’ve either upgraded their setup already or thought about it.

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

\*\*Training\*\*

I've been training most of the year using a phone app. I moved from the “42k runner” app to Runna and preferred its structure despite being initially skeptical of its algorithmically generated workouts. I think my experience training for a half marathon previously, and the reading etc. I had done helped me understand what the app was asking of me, and where required, listen to my body and modify my schedule. I think it is risky for injury trusting an app alone. I made keeping my cadence at around 180spm a focus this year and it greatly helped me.

Most significantly, I missed 2 weeks with a bad flu, so swapped the first pre-marathon de-load week with the final big mileage week of the workout, so I didn’t go from a 2 week break immediately to 33k long run! This worked well and I was able to practice my fueling and hydration strategy on my last 2 long runs.  Strength training could have been more consistent, I noticed the impact when I started doing it and foam rolling regularly during the week and wish I had started sooner. I do love long runs and really enjoyed getting to run on Sunday afternoons, particularly admiring all the wattle that blooms in Melbourne in August.

I quite liked having race pace sections in my longer long run, where I discovered a slightly quicker pace actually felt more comfortable in many ways.

Taper went well and I did some deliberate carb loading for the first time. On race morning, my legs felt fresh and ready, and I was not too full either. Pre race meal was porridge and rhubarb with a black coffee 2h prior

**The Race**

It was a fresh morning perfect running weather, got to start line at 6am for 6:30am start time. Started with the 4:30 pace group, but since I was carrying my own electrolyte drink (Rhise salted watermelon - which I very much like) in my Nathan running belt, I decided to continue on when the group slowed for the drink station to create some buffer for when I had to stop to refill the bottles midway. Refilling was a bit clunky but worked, I prefer to take more regular, shorter drinks.

Had to resist the urge to go too fast at kms 10 - 20km, and hoped I hadn’t gone out too fast after leaving the pacers behind, I was having a lot of fun!

I fueled every 6k as recommended with Maurten gels, regular Gel 100@at 6, 12, 24 and 36k, Caf 100 at 18k and 30k. Keeping my consistent pace rolling felt good, my watch died at km 28 and so had to trust myself from then on. Fortunately, given the age of my watch, I had mentally prepared myself for the possibility so I wasn't thrown off. I continued to move along quite happily, with the uphill requiring a bit of self talk to ""keep the machine moving"" every now and then, and then transitioning back to fun mode. Certain signs and spectators really boosted my feeling with wholesomeness and humour, which I had underestimated the impact of! Shout out to the grandma I saw on Beaconsfield Pde being an awesome supporter.

At around km 37 I didn’t hit “the wall” but got an odd stiffness in my left leg on the outer back of the knee, it didn’t hurt but surprised me and I wasn’t sure what to do with it or if it was risky, seeing the odd person being loaded into an ambulance at this stage as well also was a bit of a freak out. The 4:30 group caught up, and as I worked to stay with them and found picking up my pace helped get rid of the feeling so it was onwards to the finish line, which I crossed 30sec ahead of my target time!

**Post Race**

Crossed the finish line and as I stopped everything seized for a moment, so I kept putting one foot in front of the other slowly in a slight duck walk, and the sense I could walk properly came back! Wasn’t feeling especially tired at all in a cardio sense just usual long run stuff, which indicates to me strength is really my limiting factor for more speed. We had to walk down and later up a 45 degree ramp for our medals and t shirt 🥲 0/10 do not recommend. Stairs also followed to the event village for bathrooms and reuniting with friends in what I can only assume was some kind of cosmic joke 😅

Got home (via my friends scooting into the store for a bag of party ice on my behalf) and had a 10min ice bath, picked up a tip from pro dancer friend and did this in a garbage bag to avoid direct skin contact with the ice water and allowing me to wear compression pants and warm socks. Then into recovery slides and feet up after a post run meal. In the end I found it was better to keep gently moving around! Next day was able to walk to work and did a good foam roll in the morning, and felt pretty much as I would after a long run!

Keen to work on increasing my speed for next year’s races! I hope reading this is relatable, reflecting on my experience, the advice out there on cadence, strength training and practicing your fueling, hydration etc. do really help.

We have so many good food and drink spots in our neck of the woods, and many of them do free or low-cover trivia nights, so we should have plenty of options to find something convenient for all of us (whoever that 'all' ends up being).

About me 👋🏾

* 27 y/o woman, transplant to WS from NorCal by way of ATX (where I did trivia religiously once a week).  I live in the Alaska Junction but travel as far and wide as the Metro is willing to take me.
* I work remotely from home and am looking to get out of the house for more than just the necessary-for-life grocery trips and coffee runs.
* Specialist Subjects: World Geography, Classic Movies, (some) Pop Culture, History, and all the random shit one picks up from doing the NYT Daily Crossword for 2.5 years straight.

The long dark is coming, and I know most of us will be seeking ways to keep our spirits and mental health up, so I figured this was as good a time as any to see if we can put something together!

If you're interested or have a small group already and are seeking an additional teammate, shoot me a DM!",16,1760828918.0,WestSeattleWA,8,1.0,False

I have no real friends. 

I haven't spoken to a member of the opposite sex I am romantically interested in or who is romantically interested in me in coming up on 8 years now. 

Every day I fall asleep around 6 am and wake at 3 or 4 pm. 

I can't make progress on any of my goals. 

I just wake up mid-afternoon, walk to Tim Hortons, get coffee and come home and play video games for like 12 hours until I am so exhausted I pass out.

The thing is. I don't mind living this way. 

I wish I could do this forever. 

The only thing I don't like is how fucking lonely I am. 

I just want someone to hug, someone to kiss, someone to fall asleep next to. 

Someone to dream about the future, reminisce on the past and appreciate the present with...

But I have had such bad experiences with women that I don't trust them at all. 

Now it's been so long and my self-esteem is so bad I think I will be alone for the rest of my life. 

The loneliness is driving me insane. 

Some days I wish I hadn't woken up. 

I don't know what to do anymore. 

Everything is black. I feel like I can't formulate my thoughts properly. I have no motivation to improve my situation. 

I feel like a 16 year old angst filled teenager trapped in a 34 year old's body. 

When you are helplessly isolated like this, it is so hard to find the motivation to do anything because you have nothing to compare yourself with. 

There is no one there to guide you, tell you what you're doing wrong or what you need to do better. 

No one to confide in. No one to cry to. No one to share your excitement with, no one to remind you what love is or that the world can be beautiful. 

No one at all. 

Just me, my cold, lonely, tiny little room, and the soft glow of my computer screen.",5,1760828889.0,NEET,20,0.78,False

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

1oaa4zn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oaa4zn,Majzoobs,"***Majzoob***

In sufism, the word **majzoob** derived from the root jazba, which means ""to pull to oneself, to draw near"" in the dictionary is used to define the walis whom Allah has suddenly drawn to Himself, taken as friends, and keeps perpetually in His presence, without them ever returning to their former state.

Religious feelings and ecstasies are generally called jadhba, and in this sense, every devout person and salik (seeker) possesses jadhba to some extent.

Sufis state that the **majzoob**, who reach the presence of Haqq in an instant, do not attain this lofty station through their own efforts, but that it is a grace (lutf) from Haqq bestowed upon them.

Since jadhba is a state that overwhelms the intellect, **majzoobs** live their lives in a state of being completely or partially absent from themselves.

***Famous Majzoobs***

>My Great Murshid, **Muzaffer Efendi**, once spoke of the **famous majzoobs of Istanbul** in one of his conversation. First, he recounted the story of a majzoob named **Yuvaci Dede**. This majzoob would constantly wander around with a funeral pot in his hand. Whichever house or shop he poured the water from the pot in front of, a funeral would inevitably emerge from there. The populace would fall into a state of agitation in the places this majzoob roamed. Efendi narrated this cautionary tale of the majzoob as follows:

He comes, and whoever's door this majzoob pours the water in front of, a funeral comes out of there. Our Sheik (Sheikh Fahreddin) Efendi also used to go to the Aciceshme Coffeehouse. After the morning usul (rite), he'd drink coffee there; he'd converse and speak in the coffeehouse. The majzoob came there and poured the water in front of the coffeehouse owner's shop. When he poured it, everyone knows, everyone knows this, everyone is intimidated by this man, that is, by the majzoob; someone absolutely dies there. The coffeehouse owner fell at the sheik's feet. ""Mercy Efendi!, I am a man with a family and children, this fellow is ominous, a dead body will come out of here,"" he said, begging and pleading. Sheikh Efendi stood up and said to the majzoob, ""Come here, you!"" ""Come here!"" And Sheikh Efendi had a tasbih made of peach pits in his hand. In our tariq, they make tasbih rom olive pits and peach pits. ""Come here! Collect that water!"" he said. When he said that, the majzoob started to flee. Sheikh Efendi after him. He caught him, and beating him, making him scream, he brought him back. ""Collect those waters!"" he said. He had him collect that water from the ground, had him take it, and had him pour it, filling that funeral pot. He himself fell down and died right there, and the people were saved. Yaa! Some majzoobs are like this.

There is one more like this, here in Sahzadabashi. On the corner opposite Yeshildirek, there was an Osman Dede. **Pamuklu (Cotton) Osman Dede**. He too sits there, he's a majzoob too, throwing cotton onto the backs of the people passing by. Whomever he throws it at, dies. Everyone was intimidated by him, but there was no other road from there. Finally, they came to our **Yahya Serafeddin Moravi Efend**i and complained. They said, ""There is a cotton majzoob there, whomever he throws cotton at, that person dies."" Our hazrat took out a piece of cotton and said, ""Take this and go, toss it onto his own back."" They took it and brought it, and without him noticing, they threw it from behind him. When the cotton hit, he said, ""Ahh! Serafeddin, you have burned me,"" and he fell there and died. That is why there are some sheikhs who don't fear the majzooban.

>Efendi then brought the conversation to **Kopekci** (Dog-keeper) **Hasan Baba**, one of Istanbul's famous majzooban, and declared: He himself was a a great alim. At that time, Istanbul was full of great Islamic Alims, and this man was one, but he was a majzoob; he had entered a state of jazbah. Nobody could touch him.

At that time, there were five hundred, six hundred dogs in every neighborhood in Istanbul. A dog from one neighborhood wouldn't cross into another. Later, when the Ittihad Terakki Firkasi (Unionists) declared liberty, they gathered the dogs from here, put them on big barges, and took them to Sivriada and Yassiada, leaving them there. The animals died of starvation, howling. And the Europeans took pictures of them at that time; I got my hands on those pictures, of the dogs. Some of them threw themselves into the water; they came swimming. Some of them tore each other apart there; they ate each other. Afterwards, Allah visited great calamities upon this nation. Those dogs filled the neighborhoods like that, district by district. Our people wouldn't harm the dogs in that era, during the sultanete era. This Hasan Baba, they call him Kopekci Hasan Baba. In the morning, when he exited the mosque he was usually at the Fatih Mosque when he came out, the dogs would gather around his head; they'd come. He himself would shout, ""To the line!"" The dogs would come into a line. Like a prayer line. Then, if he had bread, it was bread, if meat, meat; he would take it and place it before them one by one. Not a single dog would break the line, wouldn't leave, meaning it waits its turn. He distributes it in order, everyone comes, they watch. If one of the dogs broke the line, broke the protocol, he would give it a punishment. ""Get out of there! You will go to the very back! Move to the end!"" The dog goes, it sits there. Like that, everyone knows this. And when this man died—he died in the basement of my deceased ex-wife's uncle's shop—he appeared to Abdulhamid II. ""I have died in such-and-such a place, you will conduct my funeral,"" he said. The padishah sent a carriage from the palace in the morning and had the funeral arranged. Meaning, Hasan Baba had entered the padishahs dream.

Now, there was also a Molla Efendi. The man's head just wouldn't grasp Arabic; his mind doesn't accept the lesson. He's the son of a rich man, and he can't go back to his hometown; he's ashamed. That is, the man had adopted the lesson as a role for himself. Thinking, ""If I go back, I will be disgraced."" He can't study. His friends have received their graduate three times over. This is a bit hard for me to explain, but let it suffice to say it this way. His friends graduated three times; he couldn't. On the fourth round, his father was also saying, ""Will you disgrace me? If you come here without becoming a hodja, I will strike you."" Eastern men. On this third time, he fell into despair. He went to Sarayburnu; he's going to throw himself into the sea from there, commit suicide. He understood he couldn't study, meaning he definitely won't be able to; his head doesn't take the lesson. And he went to death, to suicide. He saw a personage there; the weather was cold. ""Molla Efendi, what are you doing wandering here?"" that personage asked him. ""Nothing, just getting some air."" ""You didn't come here to get air or anything. They don't give milk to the one who doesn't cry; he who doesn't state his problem can't find a cure for his trouble,"" that personage said. ""And also, get that thought out of your head,"" he said. ""Don't set fire to Allah's building,"" he said. Meaning, ""don't commit suicide."" When he said this, the Molla began to cry. ""What happened?"" he asked. ""My friends received their graduate three times, but no lesson enters my head at all. Meaning, I know nothing; I couldn't study,"" he said. ""Tomorrow morning, you go to the Fatih Mosque. After the prayer, go among the dogs, sit down, and tell your trouble to Hasan Baba. Say, 'My head doesn't accept lessons.'"" ""Very well,"" the man said and went the next day. But he had seen the mujizah of the man. He went; in the morning, after the prayer, he entered among the dogs and sat there. Hasan Baba came up to him. ""You! What are you looking for in there?"" he said. ""Well, Hasan Baba..."" he started to say. ""Get out! You are a human being; what business do you have among the dogs!"" he said. ""Go sit over there, we'll talk later; let me feed their stomachs first,"" he said. And after feeding the dogs, he came. ""What is your trouble?"" he asked the Molla Efendi. He said, ""It's like this and this. My head doesn't accept lessons."" ""Come with me,"" he said. ""Buy one *okka* (a unit of weight) of bread,"" he said. He had him buy an *okka* of bread, and they went. We have a tekke on Otlukcu Yokushu; the tekke of Veliyuddin Hazrat is there. He took him there, and put the molla under the tekke. A dog is lying there, a mangy dog. The animal is sick, just lying there. ""Kiss the dog's hand,"" he said to the molla. Because he's a majzoob. ""And kiss its eyes."" He kissed its eyes too. ""Slice the bread in front of it,"" he said, and they sliced it. He went outside and, forgive me, cursed the mollaz with a very foul curse and chased him away. He cursed, said whatever came to his mouth, and chased the molla off. The molla was terribly upset. If he were to strike, he can't strike; if he were to kill, he can't kill, and so on. He said to himself, ""You stupid oaf! The man who follows a madman, comes here, and kisses a dog's eyes deserves to eat this curse,"" he said to himself. He went to the mosque from there, to the Fatih Mosque. He went inside; his friends are studying a lesson. For us, it is the most important book, that is, for religious men in philosophy, in Islamic philosophy, the Sharh Al-Mawaqif. The hodja was reading it. The hodja misread while looking at the book. The molla, while standing, spoke up, ""Efendi, wasn't that part supposed to be like this?"" The hodja said, ""Who is saying that?"" Look at that, the lazy molla, the book is in his memory. Yaaa! And they immediately gave the molla his graduate, just like that.

Also in the old days, when the tekkes was open, I mean, before the tekkes were closed, there were many in our tekke. There was a **Mum** (candle) **Bey**. Once he did his morning rite at the tekke, he would come straight to the Fatih Mosque. A bucket in his hand, carrying water. He takes the water, brings it, and pours it at the base of the minaret. He waters the minaret until evening. ""My, how it has grown, Mashallah!"" he says. Like watering a tree. And he stands there in winter, against the wind. The wind blows from the north. At that time, the buildings in Istanbul aren't tall like this. It's like ice; it freezes a man. He stands there, sending the cold onto the back of the Sheikh Al-Islam. Saying, ""The Sheikh Al-Islam's fur coat is sturdy, go to that side."" The poor Sheikh Al-Islam Efendi apparently couldn't get warm at all in the Sheikh Al-Islam's office. Later, they told him. ""Alas, I am having so many braziers lit here, yet I still can't get warm,"" he said. They said, ""There is a majzoob, he is sending the cold to you, saying 'the Sheikh Al-Islam's fur is sturdy, go to him'."" Later, he sent word, ""I am an old man, let him send it to someone else."" Then he sent it elsewhere, and the Sheikh Al-Islam was saved.

1oaa4sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1oaa4sc/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.
