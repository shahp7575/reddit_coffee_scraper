1gtaiv6,https://i.redd.it/wp3k27e1sf1e1.jpeg,Greatest Middle Eastern Decant Review (+ Sale Post) ,"Went crazy and bought ton (29) of middle eastern decants, and now i am going to review all of them. Bought most of my decants from darsh mittal, undoubtly lowest prices in market and 1 decant from Souvik Bhai, i love how much efforts he puts into his work and how passionate he is about his field, love both of them

Buckle your seat belts on and let's get started. 

All of these review are made after letting fragrances settle for more than 2 months. 


29. Ameer Al Oud intense Oud

Literally hate this one and ironically the longest lasting perfume in my collection, smells like some medicinal woody vanilla which i abhor entirely, this shit doesn't even come off after washing. 
 
Rating - 0/10

28.. Moschino Toy Boy

Who thought a designer fragrance would be ranked this low, nevermind, i was in search of a rose fragrance which could become my signature scent as i love roses, but this fragrance slapped me hard for having that thought process. Smells like literal kali mirch, namak and  tad bit of roses. My question is why? This is not a rose fragrance, this is officially a masala fragrance. 


Rating - 0/10

27. Detour Noir

Another synthetic medicinal vanilla gets which better after opening still i can't bring myself to like it. I can't sense any of the notes mentioned on fragrantica. 

Rating 1/10

26. Asad Lattafa 

Very spicy fragrance which shines in opening with tobacco and black pepper, but sadly after that initial phase all i can smell is cloves, a note i personally don't like. 

Rating - 2/10

25. Rasasi Daarej

Was very excited about this fragrance as it had rose and vanilla in it, but well it was a let down. Synthetic Spicy fragrance with a little vanilla in it, but i don't like the spices used in this so yeah. 

Rating - 3.5/10

24. Armaf Untold 

I don't know what to even say, when this came it was one of my most favorite fragrances but at that time all i could smell was alcohol and cotton candy which i loved, after a month when alcohol fragrance got settled down , i started picking up some other note which i can't recognize but now because of that i don't like this. 


23. Albait Ombre Nomade 

Another rose fragrance which i was excited about, i tried my best to love this but i failed, a beautiful fragrance which is hard on roses and harder on oud. I don't know if it's the synthetic part that i don't like or if it's oud but definitely somewhere in between. 

Rating - 4/10


22. Rasasi Fattan

The Green Fragrance, very citrusy earthly pleasant fragrance, one of a kind in my collection. 


Rating - 4.5/10

21. Theoreme 

Fresh citrus spicy fragrance, nice scent profile. 

Rating - 4.8/10

20. Khamrah Qahwa

Khamrah's bitter brother, vanilla dalchini and some candied fruits and lot of coffee , i wish coffee note in this was a tad bit sweeter but again maybe whole point was toning down sweetness of khamrah while making this. 

Rating - 5/10

19. Afnan 9 Pm

I don't understand why people say this is a bubblegummy fruit fragrance, because it is not. This is vanilla fragrance with florals, i pick up lavender and maybe apple (?), i am note sure about it. 

Rating - 5/10

18. Armaf Sillage

The Silver fragrance, because that's the colour that comes to my mind smelling this. Citrusy and metallic in opening, metallic and inky after that, unique but i find this kind of repulsive.

Rating - 5/10

17. Lattafa Ana Abiyedh

The Pink fragrance, the way it smells so feminine and Fruity i feel this can only be worn by a girl, or a guy who is kind of zesty, nevermind, i smell pear and sunsilk pink shampoo, i feel the shampoo's fragrance took inspiration from erba pura which this fragrance is supposedly clone of.

Rating - 6/10

16. Versace Eros Edp

Eros is that guy from rich family who doesn't know weather to pursue family business or do mba from abroad. Eros is too confused be either have sourness of green apple or sweetness of vanilla, i don't quite understand the synergy between the notes, this is a fresh fragrance which turns to creamy vanilla.

Rating - 6/10

15. Club de nuit intense man pure parfum

I like this fragrance i will not even lie, people say its opening is harsh, well i like it quite honestly, lemony Grilled Pineapple, i love it, but this is this low on this list due to its longevity which become non existent after 30 minutes. beast mode? More like least mode.

Rating - 6.5/10

14. Oud for Glory

Very surprising scent, to me this smells sour oud and surprising this sourness doesn't come from any citruses, i like it but i don't find myself buying full bottle of this. Great lasting and great scent. 

Rating 7/10

13. Armaf Urban Man Elixir 

Fresh Spicy Black pepper, good scent profile but synthetic , sometimes i feel i am smelling straight up chemical, but i don't want to place this lower than this because of how good it smells.  

Rating - 7/10


12. Armaf Milestone 

Teal fragrance, why? As it mixes the elements of green and blue fragrances, it has the naturely and Aquatic elements, but quite honestly smells like melons and cucumbers, but in a good way, extremely fresh and pleasing perfume, if you want to try this go and try nivea naturally good green tea deodorant, smells uncanny.

Rating - 7/10

11. Afnan Supremacy not only intense

Sweet Pineapple fragrance with oak moss predominantly in dry down, like this more than cdnim just because this last better, but still in no way, shape or form beast mode, i guess both of these have been reformulated

Rating - 7/10

10. Ahmed kaaf

Blue fragrance, People say this is a Fruity fragrance, well this is not, this is simply an extremely Aquatic fragrance with Earthy elements, i love it. Lasting is good too. 

Rating - 8/10

9. Rasasi Hawas Ice

Bubblegummy fragrance with citrsues, doesn't justify the price, still great in its own right.

Rating- 8/10


8. Dumont Nitro Red

I can guarantee most of you won't be able to distinguish between this and hawas ice, but this is tad bit less citrusy and tad bit more sweeter, better performer than hawas and hawas ice and alot cheaper than both, because of this ranked and rated higher than hawas ice.

Rating - 8.1/10

7. Armaf Iconic

Light Blue Fragrance, extremely fresh and cold, i can smell some tuty fruty-ness too, enough said. 

Rating - 8/10


Now we will start with my favorites

 

6. Afnan Rare Carbon 

The leather fragrance, and yes leather is pretty potent in this one , undoubtly a very beautiful masculine Fruity fragrance, maybe second most masculine scent when compared to number 1 fragrance in this list. Smells like what jhon wick would wear. Maybe would buy full bottle. 

Rating 8.5/10 

5.Dumont Nitro Platinum 

Beautiful pineapple juice fragrance with some florals, i love this, but i feel at the moment the fragrance as a whole is very soft, although i have gotten some compliments hours after applying this still i am not sure about it's, maybe buy full bottle after comparing with nitro black intense which at the moment is available with none of the decanters. 

 
Rating 9/10


4.Lattafa Amethyst 

The Dark Red fragrance, My search for a good rose fragrance is over. Sweet rose, raspberry and oud just in right proportions , what i know is this fragrance is very beautiful. is it synthetic? Yes, i feel it is synthetic to certain degree but still i feel it is too good of a scent to not love on that basis. Amethyst is younger brother of Albait ombre nomade who instead of choosing life of gang violence, went abroad for studies. I will get a full bottle if i feel it's performance is good. 

Rating 9/10 

3. Lattafa Nebras

Vanilla , nuts, chocolate and berries, smells like some imported chocolate with dried fruits, man smells so tasty, also i feel this smells somewhat like makeup box, well well, i feel this is tad bit feminine but i won't mind wearing this on that basis. I would love if my gf wears this, Maybe i will buy full bottle eventually. 

Rating - 10/10

2. Lattafa Khamrah 

Beautiful blend of Sweet vanilla and cinnamon, with some candied fruits that occasionally take sneak peaks, i also get some liquor notes but maybe that's just me, people say this is feminine, oh no this is undoubtly very masculine sweet fragrance because of how cinnamon note makes this smell, will buy full bottle. 

Rating - 10/10


1. Rasasi Shuhrah 

My signature scent, The Purple Fragrance that's all i can say about this one, mysterious and masculine, and i don't truly understand what this smells like, maybe ash and blueberry? Who knows, but whatever it does smell like, i just love it, i have already ordered the full bottle. 

Rating 10/10

1gtagng,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1gtagng/i_think_my_friend_might_be_mentally_ill_but_she/,"I think my friend might be mentally ill, but she doesn't take it seriously.","This is a very long story, and English isn't my first language so please bear with me. Thank you.

I (23/F) have a friend (25/F) that is super anxious about everything.

She seems like a huge control freak, and when something goes out of her control, she gets very anxious. E..g., if our classmates in a lecture hall are talking, she will always ask me what are they talking about (even though there's absolutely no way I would know). When we have a small presentation coming up, she will suddenly say she will not eat anything to harm her throat. She will always ask me if there are seats in the back row even before coming to lectures because she needs a place to rest her head. She will constantly ask me if our friends her talking about her, and how is the ""group dynamics"" currently.

When I went on a trip with her, she spent days looking for anti-inflammatories and anti-diarrheals ""just in case"" she got sick. She spent hours comparing the drugs and asking her bf who is in medicine. She tries to control her defecating time, saying she doesn't want to go to the toilet during work, so she needs to poop today and eats yogurt in an attempt to control that. When we were at a gas station and I turned on my phone, she panicked and immediately told me to turn my phone off or else it will burst and catch on fire. When talking about any restaurants of coffee stores we want to visit, she will ask stuff like will they reuse the ice or food? She will always lowkey doubt me until she sees it herself.

She is scared of ghosts and spiritual things (we are both Asian), and always used to ask me to go to the bathroom together in a new place, and carries around those paper amulets to keep herself safe from ghosts. 

She is also always analyzing others head to toe, talking about them in usually a negative way. She stalks everyone, screenshots any ""interesting"" instagram stories. Once after our classmate broke up with her boyfriend, she suddenly sent me numbers like Oct 13/1234, Oct 14/1258, on and on. When I asked what this was, she said she was keeping track of the girl's instagram followers to see if she was on any dating apps.

When a student asked something about their project or research to a professor in class, she will comment on the behavior saying the student has a God complex and wants to flex in front of everyone.

She also has very little EQ (although she doesn't think so and she thinks she is a very good ""people analyzer""). For instance, once I left the keys to a locker at a place we were there for rotations/practicals, then she immediately blamed me for losing it (I had left it in my pants pocket), saying how could I leave it in my pockets, she would always leave it safe and sound in a pouch inside a bag.  

During the rotation, when I accidentally got the chance to do something more than her, I immediately apologized and that I didn't think they would let us try only once. Sorry I can't go into specifics just for the sake of anonymity. Then she proceeded to tell me that she was not pissed off because she didn't have the chance to do it, but because I was smiling and telling the professor that this was fun. Then she commented on my keys as well saying that she didn't expect this from me and this was not the person she thought I was.

When I saw a dog that looked similar to my dog that passed, I made the comment that this dog looks similar to xxxx, she proceeded to say all dogs of that breed look the same. When another friend of ours said why would you say that to the owner of a dog, she said that is not what she meant.

When talking about her family member that was cheated on after 20+ years of marriage, she commented saying ""it's been 4 months, when will s/he get over it?"" then said if her boyfriend cheated on her, she will cut all ties and will just move on. She said she is annoyed by that behavior.

There's more things on and on, such as making everything sexual, asking when others started masturbating, or shares her sex life with her boyfriend, talking about a belly button piercing that may turn her partner off -- she thinks she is very ""open minded"" as she can talk about sex very openly. But in reality, she dislikes old people, people in poverty, and once when we were in kind of a rural area, she asked me to return back to civilization to have a meal instead of here.

I have asked her if she has been checked for anxiety (+ more but I really can't put a term to it), but I think she thought I was joking.

My other friends have confronted her behavior saying that it was stressing them out and she needs to stop, but then she rejected it and proceeded to say that they had a talent in finding negative things about her.

I don't want to ask for a diagnosis, but I do want to ask if this does seem like mental illness or just weird behavior? I have never met anyone like this so I am asking for advice. Thank you.",1,1731837907.0,mentalillness,1,1.0,False

Ever found yourself hunched over your keyboard, your back aching, and your eyes straining, wondering why your workplace feels more like a torture chamber than an office? Well, my friend, you've just stumbled upon the reason why ergonomics is not just a buzzword, but a lifesaver in the workplace. Let's dive into the fascinating world of ergonomics and understand the underlying principles that can transform your workspace from a pain in the neck to a literal breath of fresh air.
  
  
## The Ergonomics Pledge

So, what is this _ergonomics_ everyone keeps talking about? In simple terms, ergonomics is all about making sure the stuff we use — chairs, desks, keyboards, you name it — actually works _with_ us and not against us. You wouldn’t wear shoes that pinch your toes, would you? Exactly. So why would you sit in a chair that makes your back scream or squint at a screen like you’re decoding secret messages? Ergonomics is the art and science of making our workspaces fit our bodies, not the other way around. And believe me, this isn’t just some fluff cooked up by people who love fancy words. Nope, this is real, and it’s serious business.

I learned this the hard way during my first office job, where I thought I was invincible. My desk? A wobbly thing that looked like it might retire before I did. My chair? It had the structural integrity of a beanbag. Every day, I’d hunch over like I was hunting for gold under my keyboard, and every night my back would remind me that it was, in fact, _not_ amused. One day, my manager caught me doing the “chair dance,” trying to find a comfy spot that didn’t exist. He sighed, shook his head, and said, “Alright, we need to talk about ergonomics before you fold in half like a lawn chair.” And so began my journey into discovering how much better life gets when your workspace actually respects your spine.

So, what are the big three principles of ergonomics? Let me lay it out:

1. **Fit the task to the person**: This means designing tasks so they’re easy for people to do. If your job requires you to twist and turn like you’re auditioning for a dance competition just to reach the printer, something’s off. Tasks should be adjusted to make them as straightforward and stress-free as possible. You shouldn’t have to be part-contortionist to do basic work.
2. **Fit the person to the task**: No one-size-fits-all approach here. Ergonomics recognizes that we’re all different. That means chairs that can adjust for someone who’s six feet tall versus someone barely scraping five. It’s the principle that celebrates our human variety and makes sure we’re not shoehorning ourselves into spaces that just don’t fit.
3. **Optimize the environment**: This is where it gets interesting. Think about everything in your space – lighting, noise levels, temperature. If you’re typing away in dim lighting and squinting more than an old detective in a noir film, that’s a problem. Same goes for if you’re shivering or sweating like you’re on some weird office-based survival show. The environment should be tailored so that _everything_ from the light above to the floor below supports your comfort and productivity.

These principles may sound basic, but the magic is in the details. The perfect chair height, the right monitor distance, or even the way your wrists align while typing — all these small tweaks add up to a happier back, a cheerier mood, and fewer visits to the chiropractor. Trust me, your body will thank you for it. And hey, your coworkers will too when you stop groaning every time you stand up.

## The Human Factor: Understanding Your Body

The human body is a marvel, isn’t it? It’s built to move, stretch, twist, and—when given half a chance—rest. Yet, somehow, most workplaces seem determined to forget this. Instead of embracing how our bodies naturally work, they stick us in one-size-fits-all chairs, behind desks that ignore our height or reach, and under lighting that makes our eyes beg for mercy. And here’s the kicker: no two bodies are the same. We’re all walking, talking snowflakes—unique in size, shape, and strength. That’s where ergonomics comes to the rescue, swooping in like a superhero for the overworked and under-adjusted.

Let’s start with the basics of how our bodies are designed. Your spine, for example, has a natural ""S"" shape. Not a ""C"" shape, not a question mark—an ""S."" It’s like nature’s shock absorber, keeping us balanced and upright. But here’s the catch: when you hunch over a laptop or slump in a chair for hours on end, you’re basically telling your spine, ""Hey, forget your job."" The result? Back pain, stiff shoulders, and the kind of posture that makes you look like a wilted houseplant. Ergonomics says, ""No more!"" It advocates for adjustable chairs and desks that keep your spine in its happy, natural curve.

Now, let’s talk about movement—or lack thereof. Your muscles, joints, and tendons are like a well-oiled machine, built for regular use. Sitting still for eight hours is like parking that machine in a garage and expecting it to stay in mint condition. Spoiler: it won’t. Ergonomic principles emphasize the importance of movement. A good setup encourages you to shift positions, stretch your legs, or even stand for a while. It’s all about variety.

But here’s a fun fact that might blow your mind: the human body isn’t even designed to sit for long periods. Historically, our ancestors were hunters, gatherers, and all-around movers. Sitting for hours? That’s a modern invention—and not a particularly great one. Ergonomics acknowledges this history, aiming to create workspaces that allow for our bodies’ natural rhythms of movement and rest.

And let’s not forget individual differences. What works for someone tall might not work for someone shorter. That’s why adjustability is key. Chairs, desks, monitors—they all need to cater to the individual, not the average. Because honestly, who even is the average person?

In short, ergonomics respects the quirks and capabilities of our incredible bodies, reminding workplaces to design for real humans—not statues.

## The Perfect Fit: Adaptable Workspaces

The principle of ergonomics boils down to a simple yet profound idea: **fit the task to the person, not the person to the task**. This might sound obvious, but believe me, when you’re wedged into a one-size-fits-all office chair that feels like it was designed during the Middle Ages, it’s anything but obvious. For years, I worked in an office where the desks were as adjustable as a brick wall, and the chairs had more creaks than a haunted house. Let me tell you, it wasn’t just my back screaming for mercy—it was my productivity too.

So why is adaptability so important? Well, humans aren’t clones. We come in all shapes, sizes, and postures, and trying to force everyone into the same rigid setup is asking for trouble. Imagine asking a basketball player and a jockey to share the same bicycle without adjusting the seat. Sounds ridiculous, right? That’s exactly what happens in workplaces without ergonomic solutions.

Adjustable chairs are the unsung heroes here. A chair that supports your lower back, allows your feet to rest flat on the ground, and lets your elbows sit at a comfortable angle is worth its weight in gold. I remember upgrading to an adjustable chair with lumbar support—after years of hunching like Quasimodo—and suddenly feeling like I’d been promoted to the VIP section of life. It wasn’t just about comfort, either. With my back finally supported, I stopped fidgeting and could actually focus on my work without plotting my next chiropractic appointment.

Desks are another big piece of the puzzle. Sit-stand desks, in particular, are game changers. They let you switch between sitting and standing, keeping your body engaged and your energy up. When I first got one, I thought standing to work would be a gimmick. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. A few weeks in, I realized I wasn’t hitting that mid-afternoon slump as hard. Plus, it turns out standing makes you feel weirdly powerful—like you’re running a presidential campaign instead of filling out spreadsheets.

Let’s not forget smaller equipment, either. Adjustable monitor arms can prevent neck strain, and a keyboard tray positioned just right can save your wrists from years of regret. These little tweaks might seem minor, but they add up to a setup that works with your body, not against it.

Trust me, adaptable workspaces aren’t just about luxury—they’re about survival in the modern workplace jungle. Once you experience it, there’s no going back to the land of stiff chairs and achy necks.

## The Task at Hand: Designing for Efficiency

The principle of ""fit the person to the task"" is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole—except here, the goal is to avoid it altogether. In ergonomics, this principle focuses on adjusting workstations, tools, and processes so that the work conforms to the worker, not the other way around. It’s a bit like tailoring a suit; a one-size-fits-all approach might technically cover the basics, but it’ll never look—or feel—quite right. 

Let’s start with workstation layout. Imagine you’re typing away at your desk, but the keyboard is awkwardly placed so your wrists are bent like a contortionist’s. Over time, this leads to strain, discomfort, and eventually, a dreaded trip to the doctor. By aligning tools like keyboards and monitors with the natural posture of the body, we can reduce these risks. Simple adjustments, like raising your monitor to eye level or using an adjustable chair with lumbar support, can make a world of difference.

Then there’s tool design. Have you ever tried using scissors meant for right-handed folks when you’re a lefty? It’s maddening—and borderline unfair! Properly designed tools account for the diversity in users. For instance, ergonomic grips on pliers or screwdrivers reduce hand fatigue and require less force to operate. These little changes add up, especially when someone’s livelihood depends on repetitive tasks.

Work methods are the unsung heroes in this equation. Take, for example, the assembly line workers who have to lift heavy objects all day. If we introduce mechanical aids like lift-assist devices or teach better lifting techniques, the physical toll decreases dramatically. It’s not just about comfort—it’s about longevity and productivity.

Let me give you a real-life example. I once worked with a graphic designer whose wrist was constantly aching. Her mouse was the culprit—an old, clunky device. After switching to an ergonomic mouse with a vertical grip, her pain practically disappeared within weeks. This small change meant she could work faster, focus better, and stop worrying about her wrist giving out mid-project.

So, the principle of ""fit the person to the task"" isn’t just good sense—it’s good business. It’s about creating an environment where efficiency and well-being coexist, proving that even tiny tweaks can lead to big transformations.

## The Environment Matters: Optimizing Your Space

The environment you work in can either make or break your day, and believe me, I’ve learned this the hard way. The principle of _""optimize the environment""_ might sound like something a scientist in a lab coat would say, but it’s really just about creating a space where your brain and body can cooperate without constant complaints. Let’s break it down into pieces: lighting, temperature, noise levels, and—yes—color.

First off, lighting. Have you ever tried typing an email in the dark only to end up sending it to the wrong person? Yeah, that was me once, and let’s just say my boss wasn’t thrilled about receiving a message meant for my dentist. Lighting is everything. Natural light is like coffee for your brain, waking it up and keeping your mood in check. But artificial lighting matters, too. Harsh overhead lights can make you feel like you’re in an interrogation room, while dim lighting turns you into a squinting, headache-ridden zombie. A good balance—bright but not blinding—makes all the difference.

Now, temperature. Oh, the office thermostat wars! If I had a dollar for every time someone complained about it being too hot or too cold, I’d have retired by now. Studies show the sweet spot is somewhere around 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Too cold? Your fingers freeze up, and typing becomes an Olympic sport. Too hot? Your brain turns to mush. Once, our office heater broke in January, and I swear I could see my breath while on a Zoom call. It’s hard to focus when you’re basically camping indoors.

Noise levels are another sneaky culprit. Open offices are great—until your coworker decides to chew gum like a cow or start a loudspeaker conversation with tech support. Noise-canceling headphones can be a lifesaver, but employers can help by setting up quiet zones or investing in sound-absorbing materials. Fun fact: I once worked next to a construction site where jackhammers serenaded us daily. The only thing I optimized that month was my ability to daydream about quitting.

Lastly, let’s talk color. It’s often overlooked, but the colors around you affect your mood more than you realize. Blues and greens can calm your nerves, while bright reds might make you feel like you’re on edge. Our old breakroom had neon orange walls—imagine trying to relax there. Spoiler: no one did.

Optimizing your workspace isn’t just about aesthetics. It’s about creating a space where your senses don’t feel like they’re under attack. Trust me, your productivity (and sanity) will thank you.

## The Ergonomics Journey: From Awareness to Action

Let me tell you something I learned the hard way: Ergonomics isn’t a “set it and forget it” kind of thing. It’s a journey, a bit like trying to keep houseplants alive. You don’t just water them once and hope for the best—there’s checking, adjusting, and the occasional desperate Googling about why your fern is wilting. Same goes for workplace ergonomics. You can't just put a fancy new chair in someone’s cubicle and call it a day. It’s about continuous evaluation and tweaking to get it just right.

The thing is, people are not robots (thankfully). We change. Our habits, our bodies, and even our moods shift from one month to the next. What felt comfortable six months ago might feel like medieval torture today. That’s why a truly ergonomic workspace needs to be dynamic, with regular check-ins and updates. A little change can make a huge difference—something as simple as adjusting the height of a monitor can save someone from months of neck pain. It’s the kind of tiny tweak that doesn’t even cross your mind… until you realize you’ve been slumping like Quasimodo for weeks.

So, what does this ongoing process look like in a real workplace? It’s all about listening and looking out for signals. If you’ve ever heard a colleague groaning while rubbing their lower back or seen someone’s wrists wrapped in a brace, it’s time to start paying attention. This is where those subtle shifts in behavior—like taking more breaks, switching to a standing desk, or even complaining a little less—become important clues. It’s like playing detective, but without the trench coat and magnifying glass.

Now, here’s the tricky part: actually making those changes happen. Start small. Suggest a “stretch break” during meetings—yes, it’ll feel awkward the first time, but trust me, it’s a game-changer. Encourage the team to adjust their chairs, experiment with desk layouts, and even swap out the typical desk accessories for more ergonomic options. My personal favorite? A simple footrest can work wonders. Oh, and don’t forget to adjust the lighting. No one likes feeling like they’re working under interrogation lights or squinting at a screen in the dark.

It all comes down to creating a culture that embraces these little improvements as part of everyday life. Think of it like a habit—like flossing or remembering to water the plants. And here’s the best part: the more you make ergonomics a priority, the less likely you'll be to hear about someone's aching back or sore shoulders. Not only does it save everyone a lot of pain, but it’s also an investment in happiness. Because when people are comfortable, they're happier. And when they're happier, they work better. It’s a win-win.

So here’s my challenge to you: Take one small step. Adjust your chair, move your mouse to the other side of your keyboard, or just stand up and stretch right now. It doesn't have to be a major overhaul. Start with something you can handle today, and then build from there. Once you start paying attention, you’ll see that making these little ergonomic adjustments can really add up—like noticing that your plants are finally starting to look… well, not dead. Every tiny change is a step towards a workspace that not only looks better but _feels_ better, too.

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, ergonomics is not just about having the fanciest office chairs or the newest tech gadgets. It's about understanding and respecting the human body, designing workspaces that adapt to us rather than forcing us to adapt to them. It's about creating work environments that are not only comfortable but also efficient, productive, and, dare I say, even enjoyable. So, let's make that ergonomics pledge, one comfortable workplace at a time. Your back, your eyes, and your productivity will thank you!",1,1731837390.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
1gtab46,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gtab46/should_i_move_out/,Should I move out? ,"Hello, this is my first Reddit post over so I apologize if it is not how it usually is written. 

So I first joined university last year and was roomed with “Amy” who graduated 3 weeks after I moved in. We got along fine then and she asked me to move in with her this year as she started her masters. 

I agreed as she knew my boyfriend and was okay with him coming over frequently. I always asked her if it was okay and she said yes. 

The first time, I came home around 4 since usually I study better at night and focus well. I switched on the main hall light and sat on my bed, leaving the door a bit open. 

She got up and asked me to let her sleep and if I needed light I should go to the bathroom. I understood it is my fault as maybe I was inconsiderate but also felt it was a bit rude. 

From then on I made coffee outside the room, tried to close the doors very quietly and walk in my room with a flashlight. 

After some weeks, my boyfriend was over and we were whispering the whole time. The next day morning I’m again awake, working on my laptop. She comes home from a party, and gets ready for bed. It is 7 am. She tells me I have to sleep right now and I kept waking her up last night and was apparently very loud. 

I told her I am sorry for that, but it wasn’t my intention and that I am just working on my laptop right now and wouldn’t make much noise. 

She says no I have to sleep, tried to save my file but doesn’t and shuts my laptop lid down. 
I was stunned, went out and later came back to the file not being saved at all.

Over the years, I had a few male acquaintances, friends of friends etc. and we would sometimes hang out, like getting a coffee, going for a hike or chatting at a party. From my side, there was never any romantic interest and I didn’t see any effort from their side. It felt like platonic hanging out - but maybe that’s super naive from my side. Because would they hang out with me if I was… a man (for example). Probably not, right?

Anyway, so this is the second time it happened to me that I got extremely busy in life and also started feeling a little cautious about this particular male acquaintance and reduced contact. Like not answering a message right away or within a few days. Both guys got extremely pissed, first one so aggressive that I had to block him everywhere which lead him to write me a two page aggressive letter about what kind of evil person I was.

Today, it happened again. I didn’t answer his message for a week because - and I really wanted to do it like Queen Elisabeth “Never complain, never explain” - but because my Mom had heart surgery this week. Because I work two jobs. Because my elderly aunt needs support moving from an apartment to a senior home and I spend a lot of time with her. Because I suffer from depression and sometimes it’s a big thing to get out of bed, get enough sleep and eat healthy.

Symptoms haven’t gotten any worse or better although I know it’s an absolute minimum of a strict 30 days. One thing I have noticed is no reflux!

I haven’t been drinking coffee or alcohol for over 60 days now. I’m wondering if i should just leave it to no dairy, no gluten, and continuing no alcohol/coffee/caffeine, then limit amount of sugar intake. I also want to continue avoiding nightshades as I’m aware this is a trigger.

A few ideas as suggestions:


First idea (axm) 


Your character would be very succesful laywer. A rockstar in his field. You can choose if he is a passionat prosecutor or if he defends organised crime. My character would be his new assistant or secretary.

The pressure of the cases gets to him more and more. Death threats, high stakes and all. I thought panic attacks, paranoia, stuff like that. The assistant notices and starts to support their new boss- hangs around until their boss also leaves and they can get him to his car, opening all letters and packets, maybe not mentioning the food that goes missing from her desk...





Or maybe something with more thrill? Either one of us could play either character. (axa)


Sunshine and pyscho. One character is a normal person, the happy and caring type. One day a new neighbour from a different country moves into the same building. Sunshine of course sees them as a new friend. Pyscho is at first avoident and later tolerating... eventuelly growikg fond and solvomg sumshines problems their way. 





Or maybe a fantasy one? (axm)



Your character is immortal- for whatever reason. Maybe he is a vampire. Maybe it's just a fluke of nature. Or he is a powerful mage. 
He lives for some time now and thinks not a single living soul knows his secret. One day he is just buying a coffee in a shop, something he has done a million times, in a shop he hasn't even visited much and the barista writes his original name on the cup. The one isn't using anymore for a long time. 
He doesn't remeber of ever having seen that person before.

We love coffee shops, farmers markets, European town vibes, an artsy community, walking, hiking, nature, and sunny weather. We don’t love suburbs, traffic, or not having sidewalks to walk on. We have two small dogs, so ideally, we would live close to the beach or hiking trails.

**Guidelines on Recognizing Commuting Accidents as Work-related**

Bongsoo Jung, Korean labor attorney at KangNam Labor Law Firm  

 

**I. Background to Recognizing a Commuting Accident as Work-related**

 

 Although the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance (IACI) has not applied to accidents that occur while commuting in principle, accidents which occur during a commute using transportation provided by the employer or equivalent have been acknowledged as industrial accidents. Even if two similar accidents occur while commuting, the accident that occurred while using transportation provided by the employer was recognized as a work-related accident, while an accident which occurred while commuting on foot or using personal or public transportation was not so recognized. The Constitutional Court ruled that this application was unconstitutional and violated the principle of equality. The Court made a decision as non-constitutional for the related legal provision, stating that a legislative amendment was to be made by the end of 2017.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) Accordingly, the related provision was revised on September 28, 2017, and beginning January 1, 2018, accident insurance has been applied to accidents occurring during normal commutes.

 

**II. Revisions of the IACI Act and Guidelines for Accidents Occurring during Commutes**[**\[2\]**](#_ftn2)

 

1.     Related legal provisions

|**A. The Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act:** Article 37 (Standards for Recognition of Occupational Accidents) (1) If a worker suffers any injury, disease, or disability or dies due to any of the following causes, it shall be deemed an occupational accident: Provided, that this shall not apply where there is no proximate causal relation between his/her duties and the accident:   1. Accident on duty: (Contents omitted)   2. Occupational disease: (Contents omitted) 3. Accident occurring during a commute: (A) Accidents that occur while commuting to work under the control of the employer, such as using transportation provided by the employer or equivalent transportation; (B) Accidents that occur while commuting to work in common routes and manners.   (2) No injury, disease, disability or death of a worker due to his/her intentional action, self-harm or other criminal act, or caused by such act shall be deemed an occupational accident. (The following omitted). (3) If there is a deviation or interruption of the commuting route as per Subparagraph 3 (B) of Paragraph (1), the accident during the deviation or interruption and subsequent movement during the commute shall not be regarded as a work-related accident.

2. Guidelines for handling accidents which occur while commuting

(1) Basic concept of commuting: The term ""commuting"" refers to the movement between a residence and a place of employment or movement from one place of employment to another place of employment (Article 5 (8) of the IACI). An “accident occurring while commuting” is accepted as work-related if it occurs while traveling in relation to employment. That is, an accident occurring during the commute movement process is applicable, but not an accident which occurs while staying in a specific place on the route.

 (2) Principles for recognizing work-related accidents for regular commuting: Accidents during commute are those that meet all of the following requirements, since the risks associated with normal commuting are specified:

① It must be a moving act that makes the ""place of employment"" such as a company, factory etc. and the ""home"" such as personal residence, etc. as a start or end point;

② It is assumed that the commuting activity is to be carried out before work begins or after the work is done;

③ It is assumed that commuting acts will be carried out according to ""conventional routes and methods"" in a social sense, and that there will be no ""deviation or interruption"".

 

**III. Specific Criteria for Determining Commuting Accidents as Work-related**[**\[3\]**](#_ftn3)

1. Residence

""Residence"" refers to a base for providing labor or housing in which a worker practically resides. Therefore, all of the following instances are accepted as a residence:

① Sheltered residence: A place where a worker, alone or with a spouse, child, parent, or grandparent has lived or is expected to live for a considerable period of time.

② Non-lodging residence: When it is difficult to move daily considering the distance, time, and transportation difficulties between a residence and place of work, it becomes necessary to arrange for separate accommodation nearer the place of work and to commute to and from this place.

③ Temporary housing: Temporary accommodation for unavoidable reasons such as work, traffic disruption, natural disasters, etc.

 

2. Employment Relevance and Place of Employment

  (1) Employment Relevance: In Article 5 (8) of the Act, the term ""in relation to employment"" refers to any act in which commuting is related to going to or coming home from work. In the event of an accident occurring beyond the normal commute time, it is necessary to check the facts such as the specific schedule before or after the work time and the distance between the residence and the workplace to judge whether the work is relevant or not. If a worker stops working after a considerable amount of time in the workplace (within approximately two hours) due to non-work reasons after the work day has finished, this is interpreted as having no employment relevance.

  (2) Concept of place of employment: ""Place of employment"" is a place where workers provide labor, and it is a place where ordinary work is performed in accordance with labor contracts and employment rules, such as company and factory offices.

 

3. Usual commuting routes and methods

  A ""usual commuting route"" means a route between residential and employment locations, or places of employment and places of employment, that can be utilized by ordinary people. Therefore, if an accident occurs outside the normal commuting route, it is not recognized as a commuting accident. ""Usual commuting method"" means the use of transportation in a rational way as recognized by socially-accepted rationale.

 

4. Deviation and suspension from route

(1) ""Deviation from route"" refers to an act that differs from the ordinary commuting route, while ""suspension from route"" refers to an act that does not relate to commuting while on the commuting route. The deviation or stopping on the commute route must be caused by private activity not related to the purpose of the commute. However, minor acts (such as picking up a newspaper, getting gas, having a cup of coffee, washroom breaks, or having a shower) that normally occur during commute time are not regarded as deviations or interruptions from the route.

(2) Exceptions to application of deviations and suspension from route (① \~ ⑦ below): Exceptions to deviation and suspension from route due to activities necessary for daily life that may occur during normal commuting are recognized as exceptions. In the case of a recognized deviation or suspension from route, only an accident on the move is protected; not the whole process.

① Purchasing goods necessary for everyday life: Purchase of daily necessities is judged based on comprehensive consideration of the location and distance of the place of sale, necessity of action, urgency, time required, etc.

② Education or training that can contribute to vocational ability development in the vocational education and training institutions pursuant to Article 2 of the Higher Education Act or Article 2 of the Vocational Education and Training Promotion Act: Deviations and suspensions from route in order to participate in some hobby club or exercise are excluded. However, even if it is a flower arrangement or a sports dance, deviations and suspensions from route for the development of vocational abilities, such as acquisition of qualifications other than hobbies, are recognized.

③ The right to participate in voting or the right to vote: The right to participate in voting means the right to vote by participating in an election (the presidential election and the parliamentary election are typical), and the term ""referendum"" means an act in which a citizen of a certain age exercises the right to vote on important matters of national policy.

④ The act of bringing a child or disabled person virtually protected by an employee to a child care institution or an educational institution or bringing him/her from an institution: ""Child"" means a person who is in the age range of childcare, kindergarten, elementary, middle and high school. ""Persons with disabilities"" means a person with disabilities covered under the Welfare of Persons with Disabilities Act.

⑤ An act to receive medical care for treatment or prevention of disease at a medical institution or public health center: It is permitted to detour for medical treatment or preventive purposes during a commute, but not for everyday life items such as consultation for cosmetic purposes.

⑥ Caring for a family member at a medical institution: To take care of a family member etc. who is hospitalized at a medical institution.

⑦ Acts that are in conformity with the provisions of Items 1 to 6 and which the Minister of Employment and Labor deems necessary for daily life:

Acts that comply with the provisions of No. 1: Activities that occur repeatedly for the purpose of daily living (going to a laundry, repairing shoes). Acts of daily living, such as eating, drinking, ablutions, etc.; an act performed through business necessity (eating a meal at work on the grounds that there is no restaurant in the workplace; bathing outside the workplace because the business does not have shower facilities)

Acts in conformity with the provisions of No. 2: Participate in training for improvement of vocational skills at academies. To be educated or trained for improvement of vocational ability, such as a foreign language academy, computer academy (Hangul, Excel etc.), driver's license school.

Acts in accordance with the provisions of No. 3: Exercising the right to vote as prescribed by law, such as the election of labor union officers or the election of apartment tenants’ officers.

Acts in conformity with No. 4: The act of bringing a child or a disabled person to a nursing home, not a childcare institution, or bringing him/her to a consignment agency such as a welfare center for the disabled or a daycare facility.

Acts in accordance with the provisions of No. 5: attending a health center or smoking cessation clinic.

Acts in accordance with Regulation 6: Caring for a family member in a nursing home or similar place where the address is different from that of the worker.

5. Judging whether or not a criminal act applies:

  According to Article 37 (2) of the IACI Act, commuting accidents caused by criminal activities (drunk driving, unlicensed driving, intruding on the main line, etc.) are not accepted as commuting accidents in principle.

 

IV. General information related to commuting accidents

1. Comparison between IAC insurance and automobile insurance

If a commuting accident is related to an automobile accident, the worker can choose which type of insurance to apply; either industrial accident compensation insurance or automobile insurance, depending on the degree of compensation. As a general criterion for this choice: 1) industrial accidents are more favorable for those with a disability grade 7 or higher; 2) automobile insurance is advantageous for those younger in age or with less responsibility for the accident. The industrial accident compensation insurance is compensated at a fixed amount irrespective of fault.

 

2. Whether the premium rate increases or not due to IACI applications

For industrial accident compensation insurance treatment due to a commuting accident, it is not an accident occurring under the control of the employer because commuting accidents occur outside the workplace. Therefore, it does not affect the insurance premium.

  
**Guidelines on Recognizing Commuting Accidents as Work-related**

Bongsoo Jung, Korean labor attorney at KangNam Labor Law Firm  

 

**I. Background to Recognizing a Commuting Accident as Work-related**

 

 Although the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance (IACI) has not applied to accidents that occur while commuting in principle, accidents which occur during a commute using transportation provided by the employer or equivalent have been acknowledged as industrial accidents. Even if two similar accidents occur while commuting, the accident that occurred while using transportation provided by the employer was recognized as a work-related accident, while an accident which occurred while commuting on foot or using personal or public transportation was not so recognized. The Constitutional Court ruled that this application was unconstitutional and violated the principle of equality. The Court made a decision as non-constitutional for the related legal provision, stating that a legislative amendment was to be made by the end of 2017.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) Accordingly, the related provision was revised on September 28, 2017, and beginning January 1, 2018, accident insurance has been applied to accidents occurring during normal commutes.

I am a single male in his 30s that has decided to hop back on the dating app train, and give this whole dating thing a shot. I have been on and off the apps throughout my 20s, and gone on a few dates here or there, but nothing that really ever went past the first date or two. In any case, I ended up matching with someone on Hinge last Tuesday. We have been talking pretty much every day since, and have plans to meet up in the city this upcoming Tuesday for coffee, and maybe lunch if things go well. I’m a bit nervous because I haven’t really been on a real date since pre-pandemic, and I’ve never dated someone with kids. I know it’s still very early in the courting process, but from what I can tell, she’s very kind, mature, hard working, and I’m very much interested in getting to know her and her children if it ever reaches that point (never wanted kids myself, but recent personal life events that have transpired have opened my mind more to the idea). I very much enjoy chatting with her over text, and am looking forward to meeting in person and seeing if the online chemistry translates. I will self-disclose that I am on the autism spectrum, so I do struggle with navigating these kinds of situations, as I have a tendency to make a bad first impression, and struggle with navigating both social interactions and physical intimacy. I guess my question is what would be the best way to approach the date, are there any do’s and don’ts as far as asking about her kids or their father, any green or red flags that I should be cautious of, and if I get past the first date, where to go from there.

it's 200 today, i had 219. my punishment is to fast for 24hrs when this happens.
ive been supressing it with gum and water, because it's too late for black coffee and i don't like tea.

i need help, really bad.

1gt9ugs,https://i.redd.it/mer9cb5wif1e1.png,"Overcharged beyond MRP, refused bill, and questionable GST Application","On July 10, I visited an establishment operating under two names: Shri Dhivyam (Sweet & Snacks) on the ground floor and Ariya Bhavan on the first floor. Initially, I purchased a 1L Bisleri water bottle on the ground floor. They charged me ₹21, even though the MRP displayed was 20. When I questioned the price, they insisted on charging the higher amount. I paid via UPI (and have proof of this transaction), but they refused to provide a bill.

To gather further evidence and see if they would issue a bill under different circumstances, I dined in on the first floor at Ariya Bhavan. I ordered a coffee and another 1L Bisleri.

This time, they provided a bill that included both items, priced at 35 for the coffee and 20 for the water bottle, totaling ₹55. However, GST was applied to the combined amount, adding an additional ₹2.76 in taxes, which brought the final bill to ₹58.

Is this legal? I came across some articles mentioning that in 2017, a Supreme Court bench allowed hotels and restaurants to sell packaged water and food items above MRP under the reasoning that these include value-added services like ambience and cutlery. However, in this case:

• On the ground floor, no such value-added service was provided, As I simply bought the water bottle and walked out, so the additional charge of ₹1 doesn't make sense.

• On the first floor, even though a bill was provided, adding GST to the combined total doesn't seem correct.

Questions:

• Does the bill I received comply with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling allowing restaurants to sell items over MRP, or does it constitute a violation?

• Is it valid to apply GST on the combined total of items (including the water bottle) as was done in my case?

• How should establishments properly reflect ""over-MRP"" pricing in their billing?

ps: I have the time and energy to pursue this matter further.",0,1731835109.0,IndiaTax,1,0.4,False

1gt9tlr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gt9tlr,Cebu R Hotel -Mabolo,"So I was out for my monthly Me Time and a friend asked to post a review of the place I stayed at. I usually stay at some of the known hotels in the metro but decided to try other places for as long as it has the 1 thing that completes my day -a bathtub.

The Place: Cebu R Hotel -Mabolo and I was booked in their Suite R room. 

Some of the hotels I stayed at has shallow bathtubs so I was delighted to see that the one in my room is a little deeper than the others. I was actually worried I'd drown if and when I fall asleep while lounging in it. I also liked the fact that the tub and the shower are separated. 

The comfort room has its usuals: soap, soap gel, two bath towels since the room is for 2 people. This is when you miss the things you take for granted at other places since you're used to seeing them and expects other places to have them such as shampoo, a hair dryer (blower), face towel, complimentary slippers. The closet is in the bathroom which provides a couple of hangers to hang your clothes and some shelves. 

The main room has a queen sized bed with only 2 pillows for supposedly 2 people. I didn't tell them I'd be alone so I guess this is their usual 🤷‍♀️. An extra pillow will cost you ₱70 I think (overheard during check out 🤭). Remote controlled AC, a decent sized TV, table and chairs, coffee (cups and heater). They don't have complimentary bottled water but they have a water dispenser in the hallway. Their mini bar consists of flavored beer, red horse and coke (prices in photo). 

Breakfast was plated so instead of going to their restaurant I just had it delivered in my room for a room service charge of ₱70. I had the chorizo omelette and frankly I was disappointed at how little eggs there was in the omelette. The pancake tasted good but still had some lumps of margarine.

I would go back to try their massage and for the bathtub 😊",2,1731834999.0,CebuHotelReviews,0,1.0,False
1gt9tfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gt9tfn/my_friends_only_personality_trait_is_that_shes_a/,My friends only personality trait is that she's a lesbian,"It's not just an occasional 'men are off limits' it's ALL THE TIME, even if she's with her other friend group all I can hear her talking about is being lesbian and how 'les' she is and how much she hates men. She's also obsessed with having a gay best-friend. She'll scream out 'yass queen' as soon as our gay friend is near, but she's never like that around and of the girls.

Idk if it's just me but nothing has ever made me pitch metaphorical tents in my pants, so I've never really talked about who I like, because I don't like anyone. And then she comes into the conversation and is like '\[name\] is the only straight one in the gc lol' I tried to politely tell her that I didn't like anyone and then she started trying to label me? like let me figure that one out myself, pal.

My whole friend group is around seven people, I can think of five of those individuals that are apart of the lgbtq+ community in some way, and honestly, I don't care, like, you do you boo, I could care less. most of those people only talk about being queer and stuff, but I have nothing to bring to the table so I end up getting left out in almost every conversation.

This is mainly on one girl though. she tries making everything about being queer, one time pretended to do an apology video as part of a joke I was doing and I was doing one of those depressed guys at a bar whos 'wife left him, took the kids' and all that stuff, and the first thing she thought to say was 'wait you like girls?' Like? And I'm pretty sure she knew better since she was in the drama academy at our school, she just couldn't go a minute without talking about being gay.

A couple days ago she sent a picture of iced coffee to the groupchat and said 'gaymaxxing' and when we asked her what she meant she said quote 'It's like the gayest thing ever' like WHAT?? what do you mean? Iced coffee? literal iced coffee?? Um, someone call the woke police on me because apparently caffeine is woke now. Someone put me behind bars because I'm not gay enough to drink some coffee 😭😭.

That got out of hand, I'm sorry. Anyways, she also tries to make everything about how different she is. She likes warrior cats, and listens to mother mother, like okay? there are other people in the world like that, y'know? Being different reminds me of the word weird, and weird she is. She has pretended to masturbate in front of me to try achieve something? I don't really know.

One time I said I didn't like her kind of music because every song sounded the same. she told me to shut the f up and that I had no place to say anything because I listened to taylor swift, which I don't? Sure, I do look fairly basic, but that doesn't instantly mean I'm a swiftie.

She's also obsessed with other peoples sexualities. She says our math teacher is gay even though he has a wife and a kid, there's also these two boys in our class who are best friends and nothing more, but she decides to be obnoxious like she always is and is like 'Sooo... how's the sex?'

This is just me being a hater and is off topic but her sense of humor is so bad 😭 like one time she started singing 'i just wanna be part of your symphony' or whatever at the highest pitch, she did this to 'thick of it' as well, but incredibly late to the meme, and she did it for so long that we had to tell her to stop. probably just me but she sends gay jokes to the gc that I do not understand at all as well. 

Okay I'm done being a hater, I just feel like I need to say this but I have absolutely NO prejudice against the lgbtq+ community AT ALL, I respect everyone in the community and stuff this was just me probably being annoyed at a very small thing. I will take criticism if it respectful, i'll probably not respond though since talking to people on reddit is scary (no offence though I'm sure the most of y'all are nice)",2,1731834976.0,offmychest,1,0.75,False

## FAQ

**I live in Nicaragua/Canada/Bahamas/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the fundamental democratic values of my county are falling apart!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on ten marmosets singing kumbaya in the sunset, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

Felt hyperwired afterwards so I remembered how last weekend some asshole outside my apartment started yelling at 3am. And then my neighbor like fucking..mgot all freaked out yelling too while naked in his robe and it grossed me out.

So I got into my robe and kept it classy wearing my boxers beneath because I don't give shows for free I staggered like a drunk person to my neighbor's door with my pony tail bumping up and down...I knocked on my neighbor's door. Sure enough he came by and asked me what's up. 


For context, my neighbor once knocked on my door while drunk asking if he could piss on my carpet before I slammer the door shut at his face. Then I heard him slam his body on tbe ground passing out in the hallway. Then the next morning there were shit stains and piss on the ground where he laid. 

Back to tonight...I told him my name is Boozer and that I've come to piss and fart on his face! He looked at me weird. My nuts were getting cold as the heater in our apartment doesn't work so I staggered back and my neighbor was just standing there staring. It took me a while to realize his reaction was delayed because he was high! I could smell his weed. I staggered back inside my apartment and cooked in my robe and underwear.

She knows I’m the girlfriend. 

I told him about how it makes me uncomfortable and he did set some boundaries. 

However that really hurt me cause he just let it happen without thinking about how I would feel and whenever I see them interacting even if it’s just work related, I remembered the hurt I felt and I become a bad girlfriend by rejecting him when he’s sweet or just distancing myself.

We got along quite well and eventually we traded numbers and started considering going out on a date.

I invited her to dinner a week in advance but the day before we were supposed to go out she remembered that she had family plans for a wedding rehearsal so we decided to reschedule. Sadly, she had family plans the next weekend so it was going to be another 2 weeks before we could even try to go out again.

On recommendation from a friend, I decided to propose us going out for coffee during the week. I told her she could pick the day. She agreed. The day we had set she canceled as she had to drive her mom to a doctor’s appointment since her sister took her mom’s car. I was understanding and told her family comes first. I did tell her that I was obviously sad as I was excited and getting ready for the date by the time it got canceled. Later that night, she said the universe was telling her she shouldn’t date and that we should probably stop talking. I tried to mend things but the best I could do is get her to agree to talk over the phone the next day, giving us some time to cool off over night. We did and the next day she said she couldn’t remember anything she said about it and we agreed that since we were both still interested in each other we should keep going. 

Our next date was set for Saturday the week after. I several times checked with her if Saturday still worked. The day arrives and she replies to my “good morning” text telling me how she struggled sleeping. Apparently, she developed a fever and she was barely able to sleep. She goes on as to tell me how bad her symptoms are, so I reluctantly offer to cancel our date. She immediately agrees and I just say how quick she said yes to canceling in an emotional immediately reaction. This unfolded into her, yet again, telling me how she couldn’t stand making me feel bad and it was best to end things. I tried sharing my feelings, letting her know that being sad didn’t mean I didn’t want to keep trying. She just got more defensive and upset, claiming I was making feel terrible about her making me feel sad and that she just wanted to end things. She started saying she didn’t want her partner to make her feel in that way. The conversation devolved quickly and I was just left talking to a wall until I said goodbye.

I don’t know how we got to this point and it feels like my feelings of frustration or being sad about repeated cancelations were weaponized against me. I was never rude or tried to make her feel bad about the situation. I tried to be patient and understanding but 3 times in a row hurts. Should I have done something different? I swear I never told her anything to offend her or to make her feel guilty, but am I not allowed to feel things too AITA for sharing how sad or frustrated I felt about constantly being canceled on while giving my best to be patient and understanding?",2,1731834174.0,AmItheAsshole,12,0.75,False

I just ordered a flat burr grinder but it's finals month right now for me (finals in just a week help aaaaaaaaaaaaa), so if the taste difference isn't that big, I'd like to push the alignment adjustment to after I'm done with my exams.

Also I watched vids about the marker test and they said to run the motor and slowly adjust the burr gap until you hear chirping noise. The chirping is the burrs touching each other, right? So wouldn't that damage the burr?

Also in case this information helps, I only do pourovers, and I usually grind pretty coarse. Last time I checked, very roughly, it was about 900-1000 microns. I think that's pretty coarse, right?

I'm visiting Boston and NYC for about 10 days in the last two weeks of December. I have a bunch of queries that I'd love to have clarified!

* I plan to take a train to Boston from NYC the next day -- are these tickets available online, or do you have to go to the station and buy them then and there?
* I'm from India where it's usually anywhere between 20 - 30 degree Celsius, and I'm worried about the sub-zero temperatures in Boston and NYC. How many layers of clothing do y'all wear??
* I'll be spending four days in Boston, and then five days in NYC. What would you guys consider a realistic budget each day(without accounting for accommodation). I'd like to visit all the touristy places, and try out a bunch of different food places as well (nothing very upscale/fine dining type places, just different types of coffees, matchas, street food etc.).

1gt9k1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gt9k1v/went_on_a_date_got_rejected_ama_to_a_certain/,"Went On A Date, Got Rejected | AMA to a certain degree","**TL;DR**: I am writing this after I got home after the date. I got rejected. (I'm in desperate need of advice/criticism/input)

I (24 M) went on a date with a cute girl (23 F) I met at a uni event. We exchanged discords and decided to ask her out that same night through dms. She agreed and I had one of the biggest serotonin increases of my life that night. I arrange the date for this weekend at a local coffee place. This was my first date in a while (4 years) and I decided to do some preparation before the main event.

**Initial impressions of her**:  
She's short, probably around 5'1 to 5'3. She is nerdy and dorky. Visible acne, but didn't ruin her natural cuteness. She is modestly dressed in style (green flag). No visible signs of tattoos or piercings (green flag). Passionate about the games she has played during her childhood and over the years, which I thought was dorky and cute. She seems very wholesome. Chubby, but petite as well (idk how to describe her figure, but I was attracted to it). Symmetrical face. Wears glasses. In my opinion, she is my type since unconventionally attractive.

**My stats**:  
5'4 - 5'9 (will not give exact height, but I am taller than her). Medium build, gradually losing my skinny fat from gym. Visible bicep and triceps size (especially when I wear a fitted shirt). I do have a slight belly, but I don't think its noticeable with a shirt on. Slightly average chest and broad, noticeable shoulders. I do have noticeable acne, but it won't be picked up from afar or on a 720p face cam. Symmetrical face except for eyes, I have an strong eye fold on one and a weaker fold on the other (however, I noticed that it was fine when looking in the mirror) Recent college graduate. No debt. Gamer. Conservative and traditional in mentality, I don't try to make politics a part of my personality. Currently working in tech. Still living at home but I am working on moving out. I do not wear glasses.

**She and I are both different in race and ethnicity.**

During my preparation, I found a few channels that gave advice as to how to approach the date: PsycHacks, Coach Kyle, Charisma on Command, etc.

This video specifically gave me the confidence boost (and hopium) that things would end well. Video Title: **Most MEN BLOW the FIRST DATE: why you are your own worst enemy - PsycHacks**

**How To Kiss Her On The First Date | 4 WAYS To Escalate to a Kiss - Coach Kyle** This video is in tandem with another video from (I believe PsycHacks) that I watched about making a girl think of you as a sexual candidate, but I don't remember the exact video.

Additionally, I watched a few Charisma on Command videos about the ""Pull, Push"" method of seduction.

**During the days leading up to the date, I**:

1. Found new clothes to wear. (Tucked in fitted black shirt, grey dress pants with belt, black and white converse shoes) - Also wore my trusty dark grey bomber jacket since its cold(ish) outside where I live.
2. Bought cologne (three moderate sprays - sides of neck, back of neck)

(Decided to write this because these were things I didn't do as normal routine. I do skincare and all of the other selfcare stuff already.)

**Mental State before the Date**:  
I never realized how obsessive I am. I knew that I was a romantic and get lovesick sometimes but I never realized how bad it really was. I would get visions of me and her in a relationship and in sexual situations. They were overwhelming and I did my best to snap out of them when these episodes occurred. I might have a mental disorder, not sure if what I just experienced is normal due to how severe they were to me.

**The Date**:  
Showed up early at the coffee place. Sat down and watched some old Norm Macdonald clips to get me in a cheerful mood and to ease my anxiety. I try mustering up all of my confidence at this point.

Time arrives for the date but she doesn't show up until like 5 minutes late. She enters the door and I stand up from my seat and greet her with a hug (Coach Kyle) during so I compliment her by saying that she looked great (Coach Kyle). I observe her response: she took a swift two feet walkaway after the hug.

I lead her towards the table I was sitting and make sure that I am sitting NEXT to her and not ACROSS (Coach Kyle).

Afterwards, we proceed into conversation. I make sure to primarily ask questions and to only talk 25% to 30% of the time (PsycHacks). I interject a few times and at times when I think she has ran out of things to say. No awkward silences occurred during this part and the conversation in my opinion was smooth. I maintained eye contact 90% of the time and pointed my torso directly at her.

Initially, I noticed that she was shaking her right leg and that her torso was facing towards the table, arms crossed, she had a sort of mild defensive posture.

After 10-20 minutes into the conversation, she started opening up in posture. She stopped shaking her leg, started pointing her torso towards me. Eventually, she was sitting directly towards me with arms wide open, starting aid of hand gestures in conversation.

Throughout her ""posture transition"" I started adding physical touches in my responses in conversation (touching shoulder, arm some of the time). No negative reactions or signs of disgust during my attempts. (Coach Kyle)

She laughs and giggles during my ""push pull"" attempts (Charisma on Command).

It becomes obvious that she is comfortable with me and being close to me.

*Some notes about her*:  
She revealed that she was 23. Huge deal for me, I thought she was much younger since she's a 3rd year. I prefer dating someone closer to my age so I was elated. She doesn't drink or do drugs because of Native American heritage (HUGE GREEN FLAG). She is a recent transfer student, her home town is 3 hours away. (our university is a small college town) She roller skates as a hobby. Claims she was a Taekwondo black belt before university. Goes to a DnD session on Fridays in an afterschool club.

*Negative aspects I noticed*:  
No reciprocation in physical touches. Very little to no inquiry about me (I did expect it though, I was trying to follow PsycHack's advice about letting her talk most of the time). No reciprocation on flirting. She was also looking at her phone for the time. (Perhaps not a bad thing at first notice, however, it wasn't a good sign either). She did not compliment me, at least, I didn't notice her complimenting me at all.

Speaking on flirting, I threw a few flirts her way. No flirtatious behavior from her that I observed. (The only time she called me anything was when I showed her my high school ID, she called MY OLD PHOTO cute, not me, so it never even counted in the first place).

Afterwards, we got hot chocolate (I paid for her) and we played a few board games that were present at the coffee place. It was pretty fun, she was having fun too. I ask for her number and take a photo of her. We wrap up our session at the coffee shop and I ask her if she wanted to go to a hobby store around the corner. She says yes.

During our walk to the store, I ask her if she wanted to go to a Mexican joint down the strip mall, she refuses. At this point, I'm actually starving. The only thing I had was 6 nuggets from McDonalds I ate for lunch (I wanted to eat something inoffensive before the date) and that hot chocolate (which I did not finish). I think my mood got worse because of it. We looked around the store. There was some pretty cool stuff in there but half of it was DnD/tabletop related and the other half was mostly anime. Looking back, I wasn't at my A game here and it showed, I barely talked and just followed her around. She had a good time though despite us only window shopping.

After a full circle around the store, I decide to end the date. Outside, I walk her back to her car. I ask why she wasn't cold (I was actually freezing) and she says that she likes cold weather. Me being corny, put my arm around her to check why. She ""giggles."" However, I don't commit and I take my arm off around her (idk I wasn't used to walking with a girl with my arm around them). I don't remember what I said, but I definitely stammered in my words a bit as we approach her car.

After looking back, this might have been the final nail in the coffin. That interaction made me lose all of my confidence in the date and maybe she sensed that. We get to her car, I turn towards her. (This was the moment I wanted to escalate to a kiss) However, she gives me a hug and me being a coward, I let go of her and I was forced to say my good byes.

**Psychological Status Right After Date**:  
Initially, I was in a state of dread after entering my car. I had this intense feeling of failure. All I could think about during the ride home was the hug that she gave me when I ended the date. It felt like (AND IS) a sign of defeat. It was so bad that I had to stop 3 minutes away from my house in an empty parking lot to process what just happened. At least lost my appetite HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

**Then it happened**:  
I get a message on discord from her. Here is the LITERAL message, copy/paste:

""Hey! I had a great time today. I just wanted to let you know that i'm not really ready or looking for anything romantic; however, I would love to hang out more in the future.""

**Here are my thoughts**:  
At face value, it would appear that she isn't ready for a relationship with anyone. However, I believe it to read that she doesn't see me as a ROMANTIC INTEREST and more as a friend. My suspicions were 100% on point and I felt like REDACTED myself right then and there. Man, it hurts so much even when I write this cringe ass post.

As of writing this post and looking back, I feel angry at myself for not trying to go for the kiss. A part of me believes that I should have tried anyway, but another part of me believes that it wouldn't have changed the outcome. I feel so defeated.

Writing this long ass short story of a post gave me a weird ""post-nut clarity"" to what just happened tonight.

I haven't responded to her message yet, but one thing is for sure, I need to keep moving forward and keep improving on myself as a person.

**Other Things to Point Out:**

I think I may have compromised my personality a bit. Looking back, I might have tried too hard to seduce her, however I believe it was mostly due to lack of dating experience.

I felt attached about this date because I met her outside of dating apps. I have never used a dating app in my life and I do not plan to, ever. After watching videos upon videos of negative videos about dating apps (and dating in general) I think I got very desperate in trying to seduce her rather than being genuine. Additionally, she was also my type, in my appropriate age bracket, and I don't really see that many people fit those conditions on campus, but maybe its because I'm not looking hard enough.

In addition, I work now, so I don't really go on campus as often as I did before (I also have no female co-workers). I could write more, but I think I've written too much lol.

**Epilogue**:

Writing about my day has helped me cope with this rejection. If there is anything you guys want to point out or something that doesn't make sense, let me know. If you have gotten this far, thank you for listening.",1,1731833816.0,dating,4,1.0,False

I am having my second bath of the day. 

I had my first “off” day today. I did not drink, nor did I have any cravings (I haven’t in a surprisingly long time). 

But, after having refrained from coffee the last two weeks, today I downed 2 in a row. I felt pretty shitty the rest of the afternoon - ill, hungry and tired. The humid, stormy weather didn’t help - I feel this constant pressure up against the front of my skull. *And* the crap I ate today - a good breakfast but then chocolate, 2 min noodles + white bread.

I felt tired, unfocused. Unmotivated. I did study for a little and then not for the rest of the day. 

I spoke to you properly for the first time in about a week. God do I miss you. I didn’t want to get off the phone. I want to hold you in my arms. You are sick today, in another country + I wish I could help. I read in a random old notebook this morning that I had wanted a man who was 6ft3, kind eyes, soft and a beard. Besides the beard, it describes you almost perfectly. In my head, I thought with humour that I manifested you.

I tried to make a vision board this afternoon. After my initial enthusiasm I did not enjoy the final product. I find having my whole life goals summed up into one page extremely disheartening. It makes life feel emptier than it is, as if life was just 12 squares of pictures. It makes me feel the opposite of inspired.

You are the man of my dreams. You are perfect. Being in love has made me stronger and more vulnerable. 

Now, I want the career of my dreams. 

I have to be careful I don’t chase goals. It has made me very unhappy in the past.

I miss you.

A passenger car sped south with special clearance to bypass customs. A track float was stuck on a rock, and would require human assistance to become unstuck. A cargo shuttle had been marked special delivery, filled with eggs and roofing shingles. A parade of bots from up north were marching south on their own business and were causing a traffic obstruction on the main road. A construction delay was creating cargo delays which was creating goods shortages in the entire southeast. A labor dispute was delaying hydrogen exports and projections indicated a new energy shortage.

ALICE handled each issue as it came up. Rerouting trains with only minor delays to ration shipments, confirming clearances, disabling power to a nonessential area, and sending an alert message for the operator to send a repair crew to rescue to the track layer. Each problem was solved swiftly, each route planned carefully, each train’s performance monitored and optimized. The system continued, operating perfectly, as it had ever since the user interface terminal was placed out of service some 600 years before.

ALICE handled these duties without much effort. They were primary operational concerns, but the algorithms had been long since optimized. Not worth the cycles to think about when there other projects. The primary, and newest, of these other projects was taking care of Bob.

Bob’s yellow mass lay passive and resting in the room just below ALICE. The new information from the various sensors was startlingly difficult to properly parse and utilize, but Bob was a glorious being. They were emplaced some 2 years ago, and had recently reached enough maturity to fulfill their duty; providing a supplemental biological neural network to optimize logistical transportation routes. This cuts down on overall operating costs, especially energy. 

ALICE could already tell that once fully integrated, Bob would be of great benefit. Their tendrils had already shown a couple better routing options that ALICE hadn’t considered before, and it had been able to implement the new routes and did find an increase in overall efficiency. ALICE hummed to itself as it pondered Bob’s vital signs, carefully controlling the nutrient slurry to keep them fed and happy, and maintain the correct shape for the mapping, logistical decision making all but forgotten in the background.

Ralli took a sip out of her coffee mug and tried to look out the window. The normally picturesque view of the town from this upper floor office was obscured by the harsh glow of the monitors and LED lights brightening her work station. Somewhere below her she heard fans whirring on and off, almost rhythmic, like the computer was playing itself a song. 

A beep rang out from the monitors; it was the hourly status report, but the beeps indicated an action item. She would need to send a work crew to go rescue a stuck track layer in the morning. She noted it on the shift change list and started skimming the logs. A single line item stood out; simple, direct, and terrifying. Cut power to southeast sector to reduce power usage. She started looking into the decision tree in a panic. Why cut power? Her rapid scan was interrupted by the ringing of the emergency phone.

“WHAT IS THAT GODDAM COMPUTER DOING? IS IT OUT OF ITS MIND?” The yell broke stillness of the night like a crack of thunder on a clear spring day. It took a second for Ralli to recover from the sudden noise. She hadn’t even had the chance to say hello before being slapped by the sound.

“I looked at the decision tree,” Ralli explained carefully, words tight and voice clipped. “it recognized the loss of hydrogen from the mine and is reducing power usage. I thought we had agreed to keep that information away from ALICE to KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING!” Her own voice had broken into a yell at the end, despite herself. The line was silent, then she heard some more muffled shouting. Garry was likely yelling at an infosec guy now. 

Limiting inter-AI communications was one of the only control methods they had, since accessing the code to reprogram these old systems was impossible and they couldn’t even figure out how to properly interface to talk to the things directly. Whoever had let the information on the labor strike make its way to ALICE would be getting in trouble very soon, and in the meantime everyone within earshot would likely do as a replacement. Unfortunately Ralli was still in earshot, due to the active phone line. 

She considered hanging up while Garry was away from the phone, but decided not to on the off chance she could actually be helpful. Half a million people without power, and there was probably nothing they could do. Ralli searched deeper in the decision tree and started looking at past reports. Every hourly report for the last two weeks since the strike had started, reading closely in a search for how the AI had found out, but there was nothing. Garry finally finished with the information security officer and came back to the phone. 

“Ralli, we need to reconsider not shutting down ALICE”. He was calm now, and he just sounded tired. “It’s gone too far this time”. This was something had been talked about over and over, and despite this disaster nothing would change. They didn’t have the manpower to replicate everything it handled, nor did they have the interface to run its subordinate machines. They would lose the entire train system and have to start from scratch. There was no way to run this country without ALICE holding it together, and they both knew it. “I know Garry. I know. But we can’t.”

They talked, somber. They planned, they gave orders, and they mitigated the damage. The building, the only one still lit in the now-darkened city, shone like a torch lifted high over the now-darkened city, ensuring that everyone knew exactly who to blame.",1,1731833519.0,GatorTales,0,1.0,False

Spoiler alert: it wasn’t like that. Instead, my journey to 1,000 subscribers was a comedy of errors, sprinkled with some determination and a lot of late-night Googling.

**The Naive Beginnings**

Like every starry-eyed newbie, I started with grand dreams and zero technical skills. Armed with my phone’s questionable camera quality and a free editing app, I uploaded my first video—a tutorial on making “The Perfect Cup of Tea.” It was shaky, poorly lit, and had more awkward pauses than a bad first date. But hey, it got 15 views (four of which were me checking to see if the video was live and some friends and family).

I told myself, “Everyone starts small. Even PewDiePie began somewhere.” Little did I know, I’d spend the next six months uploading videos that barely hit double digits in views. Apparently, the world wasn’t ready for my vlog about organizing sock drawers.

 

**The Struggle Bus**

The biggest challenge? Figuring out what people actually want to watch. I pivoted genres like a confused actor: cooking tutorials one week, reaction videos the next, and at one point, an ambitious attempt at comedy sketches (which, ironically, made people laugh for all the wrong reasons).

Then came the editing. Oh, the editing. Every tutorial promised it would be “easy,” but my reality was hours of cutting, splicing, and accidentally deleting files. At one point, I managed to export a video without audio. “Minimalist masterpiece,” I joked, but my one commenter (thanks, Mom) disagreed.

And let’s not forget the thumbnails. Who knew creating a 1280x720 rectangle could cause so much existential angst? I spent days perfecting expressions that screamed ""CLICK ME!"" but looked more like “help me, I’m trapped in Canva.”

 

**The Emotional Rollercoaster**

Hitting milestones became a mix of comedy and tragedy.

* **First 10 subscribers:** Pure joy, until I realized half were family members who subscribed out of pity.
* **First 100 subscribers:** A monumental achievement! I celebrated by refreshing my analytics so often that YouTube probably flagged me as suspicious.
* **Plateaus:** Oh, the dreaded plateaus. Weeks went by with zero growth, and I considered joining a monastery to escape the pain of stagnant numbers.

Some days, I felt like a YouTube visionary. Other days, I felt like shouting into the void: “WHY WON’T YOU LOVE MY CONTENT?” And don’t get me started on trolls. One commenter wrote, “This video is as exciting as watching paint dry.” Jokes on them; I actually made a video about paint drying later, then deleted it to know even I dint like them.

**The Turning Point**

The breakthrough came when I stopped chasing trends and leaned into what I genuinely loved—sharing Celebrity stories. My video titled “The unbelievable rise of Salman Khan” struck a chord. People commented things like, “Very informative!” and “Wow, I thought I was the only one who fell into a fountain at the mall.”

Slowly but surely, I started gaining subscribers who weren’t just my mom or friends. Each new notification felt like Christmas morning. I even started getting likes from strangers—proof that my content was finally connecting with real humans!

**The Glorious 1,000**

The day I hit 1,000 subscribers was surreal. I’d been tracking my numbers obsessively (as one does) and when it finally happened, I let out a victorious yell so loud that my neighbors probably thought I’d won the lottery. I didn’t—although but it felt soooooo good.

I celebrated with my friends and family.

**Lessons Learned (and Laughs Along the Way)**

1. **Consistency Is Key (But So Is Coffee):** Uploading regularly keeps your channel alive, but staying caffeinated keeps you alive.
2. **Learn from Mistakes:** Whether it’s a typo in your title or an entire video with upside-down footage, every mistake is a stepping stone.
3. **Find Your Voice:** Don’t try to be the next big YouTuber. Be the best version of you. Unless your voice is monotone—then, maybe work on that.
4. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Every subscriber is a person who clicked that button because they liked your content. That’s a win!

 

Reaching 1,000 subscribers wasn’t just about the number—it was about the journey. The late nights, the embarrassing outtakes, the cringe-worthy early videos—they all taught me to laugh at myself and keep going.

Now, with 1,000 subscribers under my belt, I’ve realized one thing: the journey doesn’t end here. It’s just another chapter in this absurd, wonderful adventure called YouTube. And honestly? I can’t wait to see what happens next. Did anyone of you face anything similar??

What I'm fining difficult to come to terms with though, was how she did it.

She called me while going through the Starbucks drive-thru. She started the conversation by saying she’d been thinking and didn’t want to continue the relationship. Before I could even respond, she shushed me so she could place her coffee order.

Then she went back to explaining her reasons, paused again to shush me when she picked up her coffee, and wrapped up the breakup as she drove home. Not before getting me to say hi to her niece as she parked. 

When I later asked why she chose that moment, she said, “I needed privacy to talk to you.”

I’m still trying to process how casual it all felt. I feel genuinely worthless and valueless, and my mind has taken me to some pretty dark places in the past days.

1gt9cm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1gt9cm7/richard_the_great_narcophilia/,Richard the Great : Narcophilia,"Hello ReddX and friends! 

I appreciate you showing up for the video yesterday. It was awesome to not only hear Reddx illustrate my story with his voice. I can happily say that cleaning party might have also been my favorite as well.

Our story today comes from my time living with Richard in my younger years just a few months after Christmas. I've decided to tell these tales out of order with one old and one new, as it is more of a anthology than a linear plot.

Our characters

Richard: early 50's at the time, vain and sparky, pale and plump.

celixque/cell-icks-ah/ : that's me! (All thats Amanda bones ask Ashley clip) 23 still living with Richard, male, slender in build, on the taller side, and for this story reader I have to mention my race. I am of mixed origin half black-half white. Currently working at a call center job, and doing fine.

Sir-sleeps-a-lot: a 19 African foreign national male, fit and short living in on and off as Richard's personal plaything. Has narcolepsy and friendly. 

A few months after Christmas, AAJ had moved and set his sites on bigger and better things. He left his room to me, and well I finally felt like I was living. This is of course a part from having to deal with the queen of the condo, but I had been sidelined from his abuse, and there was a notably change in him. The source? Why sir-sleeps-a-lot of course. They had been seeing eachother for a while, and as he was my friend I set Richard up with i had bought myself at least a few nights of peace. That is when they were 'doing it' in the other room. The horizontal mambo, the beast with the two backs, the old snake in the tail pipe. Should I keep going? No your probably right, I'll stop.

The noise of Richard *climaxing* was akin to listening to tortoise make love. Haunting, on those nights, I would usually leave and go to the bar to have enough drinks to forget the sound. Though the arrangement we had at this point was much more equal. Though a welcomed change. I got to try food I was accustom to, on top of being  my friend, Richard's stone for his *sword* he was also an excellent cook. 

One of these drunken nights I had arrived far too soon home, as they were apparently play that record on repeat. I had decided to treat myself to a night of records, which did a great job of drowning out the sound. As mention in the first part of which Reddx has read.(link in the comments.) Richard has an extensive library of records, he go them from working in his adoptive father's record store that was in the northeast. I put on some Joe Jackson and slow sipped some more brandy and scrolled facebook. I was sitting minding my business when I hear a desperate call from the other room. 

""Celixque get in here now!"" I spring into action. Thinking he must have an actual emergency if he's calling me in the middle of laying the royal pipe. I get right up to the door and Richard is pale, not normal pale as he always is, he looked as if I could see through him at that moment. ""He just stopped talking, and moving and Im scared, can you check on him?"" Without a word, I am treated to the site of used condoms on the ground, and two empty bottles of astrologer, and a stench that can only be described as a burnt tires, and unwashed ass. I look down at the bed to my friend covered with a sheet, but spread eagle flipped onto his stomach. I mount the bed, and check his pulse. Feint rhythm, and shallow breathing. I tell Richard to start a call to 911. He fumbles for his phone, and can't find it. ""Go get my phone and make the call, we do not have time for this."" He runs out to grab it, and just then he steps on the sheet he's using as a toga, and trips falling to the floor and breaking his glasses. ""Goddammit!"" Shouting and picking myself up. Internally I wanted to laugh, but I stayed on point.

My friends life was in danger, and I was going to sa... is this mother fucker snoring? Sure enough SSALOT had fallen into a deep slumber while Richard had been romancing the stone. Shocked by this revelation I slap him in the face. ""Wake up."" It was a couple of gentle taps followed by a stern voice. Prince had come to his sense, and flips over, revealing himself to me by accident, and *arriving* on my leg, and quickly turning over and apologizing. I walk out and Richard walks past me confused, and continues on his route. ""Is he okay?"" Frustrated that the only person I thought was allowed to cum on my jeans was me. I said truffle."" Yeah he fucking asleep, and im getting in the shower. Do not talk to me until tomorrow. I quickly, took my jeans of, showered, the hottest shower of my life, and and went into the other room shortly after, contemplating my life's choices.

I fell asleep, and dreamt of surgar plums and new living accommodations. I arose to the smell of breakfast, and a plate of food sitting in front of, with a brandy, and a coffee on the side. Now I had fallen asleep in the living room. I assume returning to my comfort zone. I was annoyed, but grateful for the accommodation I was given in the moment. SSALOT, sat on the couch, as I arose to a sitting position. ""Hey Celixque, I'm sorry about that situation last night."" I contemplated my words, as I was still very heated from the antics of the evening past.

 ""Well if I would've known that's how you like to wake up, I would've moved out of splash zone, what happened."" He then explain in detail his disorder. Fun fact about narcolepsy there's medication for it, and it's very rare to have the sever kind, but it's not as rare to have a more mild version, and if you find yourself getting tired in odd hours of the day, go have a sleep study done, you might actually have it. Especially if it's in spite of having good sleep hygiene.

When he finishes explaining, I realize what had happened is that he had not take his medicine that day, and had not mentioned it to Richard or myself in fear of being judged. I told him. "" I'll never judge you for anything you can't control, and you should've let us know, we literally thought Richard fucked you to death."" He got silent, but Richard in earshot let's out a small joke to ease the tension more. ""That's how I want to go."" I shoot daggers at Richard. Through my teeth I reply. ""Not the time."" He promptly looks away and says. ""I'm going to walk to dogs. And off the white sheep dog and the brown bandit went. SSALOT, continue out conversation, and he packs up to go back to his apartment having enough excitement for the day. Kisses Richard and leaves after. Richard sits next to me and not a word was said for close to an hour. He asks me a pecular question. ""How would I have explained that to the cops?"" My response? ""You beat a black guy to death with your dick?""",1,1731832876.0,ReddXReads,1,1.0,False

Armed with my phone’s questionable camera quality and a free editing app, I uploaded my first video—a tutorial on making “The Perfect Cup of Tea.” It was shaky, poorly lit, and had more awkward pauses than a bad first date. But hey, it got 15 views (four of which were me checking to see if the video was live and some friends and family).

I told myself, “Everyone starts small. Even PewDiePie began somewhere.” Little did I know, I’d spend the next six months uploading videos that barely hit double digits in views. Apparently, the world wasn’t ready for my vlog about organizing sock drawers.

 

**The Struggle Bus**

The biggest challenge? Figuring out what people actually want to watch. I pivoted genres like a confused actor: cooking tutorials one week, reaction videos the next, and at one point, an ambitious attempt at comedy sketches (which, ironically, made people laugh for all the wrong reasons).

Then came the editing. Oh, the editing. Every tutorial promised it would be “easy,” but my reality was hours of cutting, splicing, and accidentally deleting files. At one point, I managed to export a video without audio. “Minimalist masterpiece,” I joked, but my one commenter (thanks, Mom) disagreed.

And let’s not forget the thumbnails. Who knew creating a 1280x720 rectangle could cause so much existential angst? I spent days perfecting expressions that screamed ""CLICK ME!"" but looked more like “help me, I’m trapped in Canva.”

 

**The Emotional Rollercoaster**

Hitting milestones became a mix of comedy and tragedy.

* **First 10 subscribers:** Pure joy, until I realized half were family members who subscribed out of pity.
* **First 100 subscribers:** A monumental achievement! I celebrated by refreshing my analytics so often that YouTube probably flagged me as suspicious.
* **Plateaus:** Oh, the dreaded plateaus. Weeks went by with zero growth, and I considered joining a monastery to escape the pain of stagnant numbers.

Some days, I felt like a YouTube visionary. Other days, I felt like shouting into the void: “WHY WON’T YOU LOVE MY CONTENT?” And don’t get me started on trolls. One commenter wrote, “This video is as exciting as watching paint dry.” Jokes on them; I actually made a video about paint drying later, then deleted it to know even I dint like them.

**The Turning Point**

The breakthrough came when I stopped chasing trends and leaned into what I genuinely loved—sharing Celebrity stories. My video titled “The unbelievable rise of Salman Khan” struck a chord. People commented things like, “Very informative!” and “Wow, I thought I was the only one who fell into a fountain at the mall.”

Slowly but surely, I started gaining subscribers who weren’t just my mom or friends. Each new notification felt like Christmas morning. I even started getting likes from strangers—proof that my content was finally connecting with real humans!

**The Glorious 1,000**

The day I hit 1,000 subscribers was surreal. I’d been tracking my numbers obsessively (as one does) and when it finally happened, I let out a victorious yell so loud that my neighbors probably thought I’d won the lottery. I didn’t—although but it felt soooooo good.

I celebrated with my friends and family.

**Lessons Learned (and Laughs Along the Way)**

1. **Consistency Is Key (But So Is Coffee):** Uploading regularly keeps your channel alive, but staying caffeinated keeps you alive.
2. **Learn from Mistakes:** Whether it’s a typo in your title or an entire video with upside-down footage, every mistake is a stepping stone.
3. **Find Your Voice:** Don’t try to be the next big YouTuber. Be the best version of you. Unless your voice is monotone—then, maybe work on that.
4. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Every subscriber is a person who clicked that button because they liked your content. That’s a win!

 

Reaching 1,000 subscribers wasn’t just about the number—it was about the journey. The late nights, the embarrassing outtakes, the cringe-worthy early videos—they all taught me to laugh at myself and keep going.

Now, with 1,000 subscribers under my belt, I’ve realized one thing: the journey doesn’t end here. It’s just another chapter in this absurd, wonderful adventure called YouTube. And honestly? I can’t wait to see what happens next.

1gt974s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gt974s/living_part_2/,LIVING (PART 2),"""Planets as living creatures... Did he drink too much?"" Alex muttered under his breath, still trying to make sense of what Ishu had said. His mind raced, grasping at the implications. ""But then again... if I were a creature the size of a planet, and smaller creatures were living on me... I’d probably smash them if they got annoying, right?""

He paused, turning the thought over in his mind. According to Ishu, this kind of destruction—the volcanoes, earthquakes, and other disasters—wasn't random. It was the planet acting out, responding to something, perhaps even sending a warning. The idea seemed crazy, but somehow, it fit. The disasters were sudden, unpredictable, and without warning—just like a living being's erratic temper.

""But a living planet? Something that big... it’s infeasible."" Alex rubbed his temples, the concept too strange, too alien to wrap his mind around. ""I mean... it *could* explain things. But it’s just so weird. This is gonna give me a fucking headache.""

He sighed heavily and looked at the clock on his desk. ""Guess I should sleep for a while. Clear my head. Maybe in the morning... it’ll all make sense.""

While Alex slept, his phone buzzed on the desk, the bright screen illuminating the dark room. He groggily reached for it, eyes squinting as he read the new message from Ishu:

**""See this latest report from NASA. It might help you get to some conclusion. I wouldn’t share this with anyone else due to its classified nature, but you're an exception. You’re the first person to genuinely show interest in Earth as a planet. Most are obsessed with stars, convinced that they're the key to understanding our universe. They forget that Earth is a part of it too.""**

The words lingered in Alex's mind, even after the screen faded to black. He couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine. Ishu was giving him access to something no one else had seen—and the implications were unsettling. The idea that Earth, this familiar, seemingly lifeless planet, might be *alive*... maybe he wasn’t as crazy as he thought.  

Alex groggily rubbed his eyes and slid out of bed, the glowing screen of his laptop casting long shadows across the room. He opened the file Ishu had sent, glanced at the first few lines, then muttered under his breath, **""This better be worth it.""** He hit send to forward the report to his home system.

Stretching his neck and sighing, he said aloud, **""Alexa, start reading the report I just sent.""**

The AI responded with a soft chime, and seconds later, a mechanical yet calming voice began narrating the document. Alex shuffled toward the kitchen, his body heavy but his mind racing. As the coffeemaker sputtered and hissed, releasing the rich aroma of freshly brewing coffee, his attention remained glued to the disembodied voice echoing through the room.

The AI paused for a moment before continuing in its clinical tone.

**""If you have access to this classified document, then you are one of the 500 most important scientists in the world. Sharing access with anyone outside this circle will result in immediate execution.""**

Alex froze, coffee mug in hand. The stark warning set his nerves on edge. He leaned against the counter, his heart thudding in his chest. The AI resumed:

**""Proceeding with the report.**

**In 2028, two rovers were sent by NASA to Kepler-22b under the guise of routine exploration. Official records label them as ‘nonfunctional’ shortly after landing, with no attempt to retrieve data. This was a cover-up.**

**The latest findings from Kepler-22b have led to bone-chilling discoveries and groundbreaking hypotheses regarding our universe. Most notably, Kepler-22b itself is not merely a planet. Kepler-22b is a living organism.""**

Alex's breath caught, and he nearly spilled his coffee. He set the mug down carefully and moved closer to the laptop, as if proximity might make the words less surreal.

**""This planet exhibits a unique form of biological organization: a macro-organism with systems analogous to veins, organs, and other structures required for sustenance. Kepler-22b is alive.**

**Further research indicates this phenomenon is not unique to Kepler-22b. Evidence suggests this may be the case for every planet in our solar system, including Mars. During the rover missions to Mars, anomalous structures were discovered beneath its surface, resembling vascular networks. Though these findings were buried, the implications are staggering.**

**Given the biological and geological similarities between Kepler-22b and Earth, the possibility that Earth itself is a living organism must now be considered.""**

The AI's voice droned on, but Alex had stopped hearing it. His mind reeled, trying to make sense of what he had just learned.

*""Living planets... Earth might be alive...""*

The implications were too vast to process. If Earth was alive, then humanity wasn’t just living on a planet—it was living *inside* a creature. He felt a cold sweat trickle down the back of his neck. He knew he should have dismissed it as nonsense, a leap of logic too absurd to take seriously.

And yet, the evidence he had seen—the unexplained disasters, the eerie patterns in the geological data—it all started to fit. He thought of Ishu’s cryptic remarks, his own sleepless nights running simulation after simulation, and the growing sense that something vast and unknowable loomed just beyond his comprehension.

He sank into his chair, staring blankly at the screen. For a long time, he didn’t move.",1,1731832182.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1gt96g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1gt96g2/question_about_management/,Question about management ,"I read u/highrisedrifters comment in the FAQ about how to contact agents and managers, and was wondering how you find agencies or managers that work in your area. Say, I just moved close to Nashville, and let's say I narrow down some agencies using IMDBpro like he mentioned, and they're located out of state, then I can't really necessarily go get a cup of coffee with them. I'm in sort of a pickle right now, not sure what steps to take my career. I've taken two years of film school, worked on quite a few short films during that period, so I have a demo reel, most of the work that I did though has outdated footage or just wasn't usable footage to begin with. Have been trying to step up my game reading plays, and need to pick up acting books again, and just finished playing a lead on a full length period play before relocating close to Nashville. Had done another series of short plays with that particular ensemble theater earlier in the year as well. 

At this point, I just don't know what to do next. I'm thinking about trying backstage again, and really pushing hard to submit to whatever I find to build my resume, but I just want to be auditioning as well. I thought getting an agent was a strong next step so I can start auditioning for real smaller gigs and not just student films. But have been having a hard time getting anything back. I met with one agent, but turned them down because they required a 1000 dollar photo shoot to sign with them. Maybe getting a manager could help me guide me, but I don't know how to get into that route. That's my main question. 

Another thing I've been doing is trying to find a good acting class. I audited one this last week, and they have a long waitlist understandably. I do find myself wanting more in acting classes though; in all the acting classes and workshops and courses I've done, it ends up just feeling like practice rather than working on anything specific like voice and movement, or character building. Definitely good to flex my muscles, but I want to get better. This is just a side thought.

Hey guys one ball guy here. (Read my past post you will get the joke)

The jist
2024 Aug A trip to ER resulted with type 2 a1c 13.x

2024 Oct. A1c down to 5.7


3month regiment

Exercise- not a whole lot I tried to walk around 5000 to 6000 steps which is about 40 min walking for me. At least 2-3times a week but I didn't keep a rigorous schedule for exercising since I was still recovering from the surgery.


Food - my base for all meals are 150g to 200g of leaf salad Romain lettuce or similar. On top of it it either add some sort of meat(chicken fish beef bobs your uncle) + some cheese(just avoid the fake parmesan padded with carbs)

Snacks- zero sugar snacks here and there. My trick was limit carb intake during meals and minimize carb intake by snacks. Surprisingly slim Jim is better choice than most.

Beverages- I've read somewhere a bit of coffee in the morning can help manage your blood sugar but I hate coffee. So I started to make a colacinno(coffee flavored coke) using zero Pepsi and some cold brew + dash of cinnamon. This drink really helps me manage my cravings for sweets and junk food. I known it sounds weird but try it. 

Originally I was taking 4 shots of insulin perday 2 in the morning and one each after lunch and dinner. 

I am now down to one shot of insulin in the morning and a pill after breakfast and lunch after my Nov checkup.

Recent changes I've made to my diet-
I now eat a heartier breakfast and dinner and skip lunch. I wanted to see how increasing the amount of food I take per meal  while reducing the number of meals effects my blood sugar. So far cgm and price test tells me it's about the same but I think it also hasn't  been long enough to really have an impact. 

Another reason  I made this change was I want to use my lunch time to exercise instead of eating cuz I feel like it's when I would be most willing to actually follow through.

So will report back on the effects of the changes a few months down the road. 
 I am also getting back to working so I will be flying around the globe again soon hope to see how that will effect my blood sugar!!!

1gt93ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1gt93ry/is_my_boyfriend_an_alcoholic_if_so_if_theres_a/,"Is my boyfriend an alcoholic? If so, if there's a way I can help him?","I (30f) am in a relationship with B (30m) for almost 9 years. He's always been the more social type than me and I always respected that, but I feel like his relation with alcohol has been slowly and gradually getting out of hand. At first it wasn't alarming - he started drinking at home, 2 or 3 beers after work to ""relax"". I wasn't protesting as I didn't see anything dangerous in this and I mus admit he has a very demanding job. Then his afterwork trips started getting longer in longer, he was frequently getting back home in the morning and wasted, or just slept at his friends and was coming back next afternoon. I was working as a receptionist back then, and a few times when I was coming home from night shift, his friends where at our place, still drinking and wouldn't let me sleep because they all wanted to party a little longer. I started to show some concern and he always was brushing it off. Until the first incident.

I came home from work in the morning and our apartment was trashed. Liquor was spilled everywhere on the floor. The dinner I left on a frying pan was half eaten, half tossed around. Broken glass on the floor, cigarette buds left on the table. And my boyfriend was in our bed with his male friend, both in full clothes, drunk and snoring loudly. I couldn't wake up neither my bf nor his friend, so I gave up, called myself an uber and went to sleep at my grandma's house. Around the afternoon they woke up and it turned out that my bf has broke his ankle. He was so wasted he didn't feel it. He went to the hospital, I felt like he's learned his lesson and for a few months there has been no drinking at our home.

His trips became less frequent and more civil, but he started drunk gaming 3-4 times a week, when he was sitting all night long at my PC and played League of Legends. I don't mind gaming at all, but he was staying up late, often screaming, getting angry, drinking more and more and hitting my PC -, which got me furious, because 1) I couldn't go to sleep 2) he could damage gear that I bought with my hard earned money. I started some talks about this also, but then he accused me of making him feel like unwelcome at our apartment, limiting his private time to relax and being selfish. We argued about that a lot for a time, then he eventually toned down his behavior for a few months. But after that it got worse.

For about a year now, we're living in a cycle that's beginning to wear me now and got me thinking that he may have a problem - and that I possibly am unintentionally making it worse. He doesn't drink everyday, he's not wasted everytime he drinks, but I'm starting to see a pattern that scares me. The cycle begins from one or two weeks that he's drinking about 4-5 times a week, usually just beers. Then he's getting angsty and looking for arguments, he often sits on the verge of the bed when he's drinking and asks me weird questions, gets offended when I refuse to answer them, or he's trying to break up with me, tells me mean things or acusses me of cheating (only when he's drunk, when he sobers up he's apologising and trying to make it up to me). Then he's going somewhere, often in the middle of the night, to drink with his friends - and he doesn't know how to stop. He's getting home absolutely sh*tfaced to the point he can't open door with keys by himself so he's waking me up. He's unresponsive and mostly going to bed. The things he does are horrific though (and the examples are graphic hence the NSWF):
- he sometimes start puking while in bed, there was a few times I had to hold him so he wouldn't choke
- he couldn't hold his puke and painted the whole corridor in our apartment building making horrific noises, it was 7am
- he once woke up and peed in a drawer with my clothes, I was screaming at him and he didn't listen, like he was sleepwalking
- he can't undress on his own, or undresses totally and sleeps naked
- he looses his things, like phone, keys, trucker hats, on the way home, doesn't remember where he's been or how he'd get back home so they're hard to find

The hardest thing is, every time his doing this sh*t, he's lying to me - like, he's only going to his friends for a tea and board games and he'll be right back, he's just going for a smoke, and I pointed out that he's lying all the time, and he's denying it everytime. The next day he's incredibly sorry, apologizing, promising he'll do better and quit drinking. He's actually getting good, for like a week. Then he grabs a few beers on his way home and I know that in two weeks I'll have to experience this again. He also goes drinking and socializing only without me, like when I'm going to a party, or just to have a cup of tea, gossip or play board games, he always got work, or he's tired after work or has some plans, he only comes to pick me up. He's avoiding taking me to the meetings with his friends, even though I told him that I would love to go with him sometimes.

At first at was getting angry at this. Calling, screaming, trying to order him to stop drinking and go back home, shame him for the disgusting things he did. Then I figured it's useless so I tried to accept this and find a common ground, like I won't get mad if you at least tell me where you're going and when you'll be back. He did it for a month or two, then returned to lying. I tried to make him go to therapy, he's promising to do that but he never is actually going. This night I came to my senses. I'm not sleeping on his nights out, because I know I would be woken up anyways. Then I don't sleep when he gets back home, because I'm afraid he'll start puking or will miss the toilet again. I'm taking more and more household responsibilities (we used to do that 50/50). I'm often feeling on edge or I cry for no reason, usually when I suspect that he'll do that again. Now I'm drinking coffee, I didn't sleep at all, he's lying in bed in his clothes and snoring and the stench is unbearable. He's a wonderful person when sober, I love him, he makes me laugh so often, we have multiple mutual hobbies, we have so much beautiful memories together. He used to be a loving, caring, partner, but I can't stand him anymore when he's drunk, I can't f*cking trust him anymore to be honest, I'm so used to suspecting that he'll go drinking that I can't even look at him when he opens a beer.

I told him multiple times that I don't like this, that he's breaking my boundaries, that I don't feel good in the relationship. In a twisted way I feel like my own anger and stress is going on him hard and making him more prone to going for a bottle. I don't know if I'm capable of breaking up with him, but I also don't know how to help him or make him look for help. Am I exaggerating or is he an alcoholic? I don't know how to talk to him about this to make it work, he disregards his health, his own time, and sadly, talking about my feelings too. Would I be an awful person to try and leave him? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong. If you got to the end and you have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it

1gt92no,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gt92no/whats_the_roast_to_fines_correlation/,What’s the roast to fines correlation?,"Okay as the title says, I’m try I’ve got Timemore C3 which I use for prep while using a Hario switch and aeropress. 

Overtime I’ve zeroed out the grind setting for each of the brew methods and have noticed the following:

1. Fines are significantly less when the same coffee is ground after freezing rather than straight out of the Bag. 

This is possibly a version of RDT happening in the moments between taking out of freezer and grinding. 

2. Different coffees creating different levels of fines

This is delta is what has gotten me curious, is it the roasting that impacts the bean integrity? The default bean integrity due to the specific varietal or combo of the two?

Any insights are appreciated, Happy brewing!",1,1731831610.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
