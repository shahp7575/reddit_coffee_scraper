I‚Äôm currently on day 4 of a 10 day fast and I‚Äôm extremely weak. I‚Äôm struggling a lot, I can barely walk a half a mile to my classes (I‚Äôm in college). I‚Äôm doing a dirty fast, with Gatorade 0, Diet Coke, and beef broth (5 cal bouillon cubes). As well as coffee and tea. My question is, would I lose the same amount of weight doing a very low cal omad (maybe 300 cals) and burning off those calories through exercise (long walks)? I‚Äôve done extended fasts before, one 8 day and one 10 day, as well as countless 3-5 days, and I don‚Äôt remember feeling this weak. I always had a good bit of energy in me, but now I just feel absolutely awful. I‚Äôm not underweight, I‚Äôm a few pounds overweight actually at 5‚Äô6 158lbs (72 kg) at 19 years old. I‚Äôm also feeling a bit discouraged because I only lost .4lbs last night :( I‚Äôm previous fasts, when I was actually at a lower weight, I‚Äôd lose more. So I‚Äôm feeling conflicted.

I‚Äôve been a loyal customer of Gold Sprint for quite some time, and it‚Äôs been one of my favorite coffee spots‚Ä¶ until recently. I‚Äôm deeply disturbed by the behavior of one particular barista, and I feel like this issue needs to be addressed, especially considering how it‚Äôs affecting not just me but other people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

This barista (no idea of her name but she has multiple face piercings and long brown hair) has consistently provided poor service to those who don‚Äôt fit into her apparent ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù demographic. Over the last few weeks, I‚Äôve noticed her giving subpar service to marginalized groups, including myself. Some examples include:

-Spitting in drinks (yes, I‚Äôve seen this happen).
-Messing up orders on purpose and serving poor-quality drinks.
-Acting cold and rude, clearly making customers feel unwelcome.

I‚Äôm not the only one who has experienced this, other people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community have shared similar experiences with me. It‚Äôs disheartening to think that a place I used to love feels unsafe and unwelcoming because of one person‚Äôs discriminatory actions.

I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions about Gold Sprint as a whole, but I feel like this behavior needs to be brought to the attention of management, and maybe even the wider community. Has anyone else experienced this, or is it just me? What should I do to make sure this gets resolved, but in a way that holds this person accountable?

Let‚Äôs make sure places like Gold Sprint remain inclusive and welcoming for everyone.",3,1729692208.0,HuntsvilleAlabama,2,0.71,False

1gab9ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrioWorksUSA/comments/1gab9ef/trio_skill_feeding_large_groups_of_people/,TRIO Skill: Feeding Large Groups of People ,"New TRIO directors and event planners face this right out the gate on their first event.

Allowable Costs vary from program to program but:

1. ""Light refreshments"" are baked into events when your proposed budget contains an event as a whole budget line item. A good example for most programs is ""Awards Dinner - 900$"" - you know you have $900 to spend on an awards dinner which includes: space rental, catering, sound system, party supplies, and awards. It is a ""baked in event"" everything is assumed included in that piece of pie.
2. Meals not provided by the conference or event spaces or hotels when attending travel events. Again, most travel events like ""College Tour"" or ""Student Leadership"" conference are featured in your proposed budget as a package event.  (In most travel policies ""snack"" is considered the 4th meal of the day while travelling)
3. Per diem - per policy per program a set amount of funds is reserved for the employee each day of travel/work to cover the costs of travel which includes meals up to X amount. That amount is regulated by your organization, state law, or federal law as they determine which they want to apply to your TRIO program. GSA vs State vs Nonprofit can widely vary so ask the hard questions before you spend.
4. Meal provided at professional development events as part of a packaged event - like ""CPR First Aid Training"" or ""Summer UB Training for Instructors Workshop""

Unallowable to buy food with TRIO funds:

1. For non-trio staff or students at an event or travel event \*check your program rules for recruitment events
2. For groups of trio employees, but not in your program or employees at your college, but not your TRIO grant funded employees
3. Informal business dinners or lunches or donuts or coffee.
4. Just buying snacks or food for students for general use.

General Helpful Tip for All Directors and Planners for Travel Events:

1. Always order ahead - nearly any situation this will help you immensely to utilize your online and phone skills, access open group spaces at restaurants, and faster, easier service.  Use those food aps and online ordering. You can get the whole crew to give you their orders and go!
2. Family and Group Meals can be delivered to your hotel and served at your hotel as a group. Often hotels will have meeting space for this, but you can request a meeting space.
3. Box lunches are exceptionally easy to use and pass out, esp. if your travel events have you all on your feet and taking public transport, walking distances, and sightseeing on foot.  Big cities in general - delis will offer you box lunches - but order weeks ahead! (esp. in D.C.)
4. Pizza isn't the only food you can get in large amounts and delivered. Try Hawaiian, Indian, Chinese, or Halal food.  Just order ahead of time for big orders. Always get the sides, the bread, and desserts.
5. Keep a cooler with cold water, box or bag drinks, and hydration beverages with you. It means you can also order food w/o ordering beverages.
6. Worst case scenario - Buffet time! a good, large buffet can solve most of your issues and often have private rooms.
7. Get a hotel with free breakfast! Most mid-line hotels have hot breakfast now and for an extra 10$ for a room you'll feed all your crew before you even leave the door.  Never underestimate the beauty of free breakfast.
8. Many grocery and big box stores will allow you pick up snacks, water, and supplies or deliver them to your hotel INCLUDING - phone chargers, cables, period supplies, and anything students might freak out about.
9. For the truly gritty - HI Hostels and Vacation Rentals have communal kitchens and you can simply cook together. It's not easy for all three meals, but certainly makes breakfast and packing lunches easier. (HI hostels also offer group rooms that are much less expensive and in interesting places - like right on the beach in Santa Monica, Ca,) 

General Tips for Local Events.

1. Do get 3 competing bids before you use the ""easiest options"" as we've found on-campus food service can be way overpriced, but extremely convenient.  Is it 500$ more for an event convenient though?
2. Food Trucks are often the most mobile of caterers so remember they can be invited to cater. For more informal events, pay them for the meals and round up one-two-three for a private picnic with string lights.
3. Remember with people from first gen or gen pov communities, making sure everyone gets something to eat is a top priority. While it is nice to kick it up a notch with fancy appetizers and wedding style fare, make sure that there is enough for ALL the guests to even take-home boxes if possible.
4. Absolutely buy zip bags or plastic tubs or clamshell take out boxes for end of events. The best caterers will box it up for you and you can just hand it out to volunteers, students, and staff, but often you are going to have to do the boxing.
5. Consider your site - TRIO programs often have less choices for good places for events so ask ahead and ask bravely. You deserve the best! Having a fully operational kitchen site to stage the catering is PRICELESS so think about your caterers. How will they keep the hot food hot and the cold food cold? Where will they store their carts?
6. Don't expect to the cooking yourself without a crew. Don't expect as the event planner you will also drive hundreds of miles to pick up the food. Delegate someone to handle it.  

Mode of Food:

1. Plated Dinners - your standard catered ""wedding"" or ""awards"" dinner is better for etiquette dinners, but the simple fact is without a good caterer your pickiest eaters are going to face a plate of surprise food cooked in new and exciting ways that may intimidate them.  This also generally costs more because it includes service and table set up. It usually includes water, coffee, dessert, and bread/salad sides plus all the condiments. And everything is served by wait staff vs getting up. (note - always get RSVP and hard attendance because it's costly)

2. Buffet Dinners, Dessert Buffets, or Appetizer Buffets- served by caterers or hotels food service or campus food service, but people pick their own foods and often in lush displays. They also traditionally keep the food coming and rotate the food in the buffet, so everyone is fed.  It allows choice, but it also means everyone is getting up and down to get their food, drinks, and desserts.

3. Buffet Restaurants - always great for larger groups when you are on the go. It gets rid of awkward ordering moments and is so easy to pay.  And they often have group seating. 

4. Family Chain Restaurants - great for groups under 10. If you have more than ten you really should call ahead and reserve a table, pre-order if the menu is online, and just make sure you arrive on time. They are RARELY ready to serve a group over 10 people cold.  

5. Fine Dining - always call ahead, always reserve.  Weeks even. Ask for a group space. If anything always do your research. We've ended up in some tight spaces due to not doing our due diligence. 

6. Fast Food - is not fast if you walk in with 10-30 people. (Esp. Subway or any custom food places (Chipotle - ect.) BUT can be great for pre-ordered catering and pick-up. 

Mode of Room Layout:

1. Banquet Rounds are standard to BANQUETS. Never set a classroom or workshop space with rounds.

2. Long tables can make excellent family style dining with a more community hall feel.

3. If you have special guests or speakers or awards, always set up a long table on the stage or at the head of the room.

4. Plan for tables for food set up even if the caterer has it handled.  You always need more tables. 

5. Make sure you have enough chairs and there is at least 10 chairs that are available for disabled people.

6. Never expect to eat in a theater (in theater setting) unless they allow it.  Setting up standing ""cafe"" tables in the lobby or with highchairs can help with light refreshments when food isn't allowed in a presentation area. 

7. Campus or Hotel not cooperating with your space needs? - rent a tent! you know you weather limits usually, but if you can rent a tent, string up some lights, and do something special.  Or rent a gazebo. Or a picnic shelter. Or a rooftop garden. Have the food delivered. Using public spaces is a great skill for students to learn. 

It's a learning process and as we get younger people involved in TRIO direction and event planning we can help them by teaching these skills and simply discussing how much it costs to feed groups of people, how our budgets bake in costs to events, and how to follow the steps within our own sponsoring orgs to perform the vital tasks of event planning.

Previously, my sister was the one who took care of my mom as I was working in a different city, however my sister passed away recently so now I'm the one who's responsible to take care of her, and because I was away from home and my family didn't tell me much about my mom's condition, I am clueless about this disease and I don't really know what's the best way to treat her. 



My mother is 60 years old, and her A1c is very high at 10.3. Her blood sugar level during fasting in the morning is usually around 100-120, however if she doesn't take Metformin during dinner time a day before, her blood sugar level during fasting could spike from 150-180. She usually have one small meal each in the morning and in the afternoon, and one big meal in the evening; when she doesn't take Metformin, her blood sugar after a meal could reach 250-285. Also, since her left leg is paralyzed, she doesn't do much physical activities as she needs a walker to walk so I cannot really push her to have too much exercises but she's not overweight, just a bit chubby.



With this condition, I have some questions that want to ask to you guys:

1. What's the normal blood sugar level that my mother should aim throughout a day? It it true that we have to always keep our blood sugar level below 100? What are the consequences if we have high blood sugar level from time to time over a long period of time?

  
2. My mom usually only takes 1-2 pills of Metformin (500mg) every day because she doesn't like to take too much meds, but her blood sugar level could spike a lot when she doesn't take Metformin after a meal. Is it recommended for her to take Metformin every time she eats a meal? Is there any negative side effects to her body if she keeps taking Metformin? 

  
3. My mom also loves to have snacks outside her main meals. She usually eats cream crackers (non-sugar) with coffee and non-sugar milk twice a day, and sometimes she also eats fish crackers/fish cakes 2-3 times a week. Is this eating habit of hers dangerous for her health? Should she stop having snacks like these?



I'm sorry if my English is a bit weird as it's not my first language, and I hope you guys can help me to understand more about diabetes, thank you!",2,1729691901.0,diabetes_t2,1,1.0,False

1gab75o,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1gab75o/am_i_wrong_for_worrying_about_my_relationship/,Am I wrong for worrying about my relationship being too superficial ?,"I \[24F\] have been dating my boyfriend \[33M\] for a month now and everything has been perfect so far. We met at his workplace, exchanged social media and after 2 days of extensive texting arranged a date. Our conversations on social had been amazing, we have common opinions on crucial topics and he showed me that he's mature enough, as expected from a man of 33 years old. We were both really excited for the date after seeing that apart from physical attraction we had all those stuff in common, so we decided to meet earlier than the date we had arranged and ended up going to the beach for a walk. We both were very enthusiastic and happy and kissed during the first 15 minutes of our encounter (rushed but we had talked a ton on messages as I've said). It was like we decided that we're going to start a relationship after that small encounter and before even our official date. It might sound rushed but again, we both felt the same attraction and enthusiasm.

I often catch myself thinking that our behavior as a couple isn't serious enough for people of our age. What we've been doing all of this time is going out to bars and restaurants, visiting beautiful places and enjoying our lives to the fullest or staying at home, watching movies and playing games. No matter what we do we always end up having intercourse which we both love and enjoy with each other. My concern is if we're too superficial since we haven't really had any serious discussion after basically those texts and our first official date, is that normal for people our age? AITA for wanting to discuss that with him? We clearly have a great time and when I'm with him I forget all these kind of concerns.

Also, there's the fact that he is a guy who has had many experiences, both because of his age + being attractive and a nice guy. I have never had a serious relationship before and have minimal sexual experience because while I've dated quite a few guys (just going out for a coffee or drink to meet) I never ended up in a relationship with them because they weren't people with the same values as me. So meeting him, an attractive guy who knows how to behave, have similar interests and same values and beliefs as me has me hooked! What troubles me is that I'm worried he sees relationships as an adventure and experience, hence why he has had so many, I think that if we wanted to keep a girl he could easily do it but he just let them go for some reason. So far, he shows his affection and feelings about me all the time. He's also very sweet, caring and protective and when I asked him if he's always like that he said ""You mean with girls? I treat every person the way they make me feel about them, you get that sweet side out of me"" and also mentioned that he got more cuddly and overall let's say ""cute"" with me. It's also the first time he has a relationship with someone that much younger than him, he said his largest age gap before me in a relationship (not counting hookups) was 5 years and we have 9 years difference. You guys think I should discuss everything that troubles me with him or should I just let loose and enjoy our beautiful relationship?",0,1729691846.0,amiwrong,6,0.33,False

He has a terrible history with romantic relationships - he‚Äôs divorced three times (45m) and has admitted to cheating which lead to the end of all marriages. 

He came into my life three years ago when I was deeply suicidal and had no one. 

He ‚Äúrescued‚Äù me in a way - introducing me to his friend group, his family and his community. 

I slowly healed emotionally and we kept a friendship up. 

He knew about my violent childhood and sexual and emotional trauma. 

He also knew I never have one night stands etc. 

He had a girlfriend during this time and our interactions were 99% platonic with a slip of a flirty text once every three months or so. 

He broke up with his gf two months ago and arrived at my house and we made love. 

The first time was amazing the second time (a few days later), he flipped me onto my stomach and wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact with me. 

After that he told me he wasn‚Äôt emotionally available and that he‚Äôd been sleeping around and he was thinking of getting back with his ex. 

I kept my own and didn‚Äôt react or cry, just gathered my clothes and said bye and drove home. 

He then did not message me for 6 days after, when he did he asked to meet for coffee. 

I said no and asked for space. 

Finally I was ready to meet for coffee yesterday. It hurt so much. It was like he wanted to hurt me. 

He apologised and kept repeating that he used me the second time we had sex because by then he knew it wasn‚Äôt heading towards a relationship. Then straight after that he said but you‚Äôre so beautiful, you‚Äôre so good in bed and we should be in a relationship. Maybe in a year? 

I just looked in shock. 

He then said but he might get back with his ex and then said but maybe he needs to be alone. 

I held my own again but instead I am broken up. 

I loved this man so much and now he‚Äôs a stranger: 

He messaged after coffee to say sorry and he appreciates me but doesn‚Äôt deserve me in his life. 

I replied kindly and now I haven‚Äôt heard from him. 

I‚Äôm having a major trauma response reaction. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not pretty enough, thin enough, good enough for anyone. 

I was so crazy about him I‚Äôm literally scared I will not meet or fall in love with anyone again. 

I‚Äôm 41 (f) and can‚Äôt believe this has happened - I feel used, lonely and lost. 

Please any kind words or advice welcome. 

Also I moved to a new town three years ago and he was my only support system. 

Now I need to start again. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe.

So I have a crush on someone a year ahead of me. She's taller than me and seems interesting, and her smile is nice. I have only said hi to her whenever I go eat (she's a cashier at the cafeteria), and she always reaches over and points at the card scanner, because I can't tell whenever it's time to scan it. I'm not sure how to explain how I feel whenever I see them.

How do I ask her out though? I barely see her anywhere else, and I don't know how long much longer I can wait to talk with her. Do I ask her over the counter? I don't want to make the other students wait because I want to speak with her. Would it be weird to give her a paper with my number and ask her out for a coffee?

I really wanted to ask her a little before halloween, so maybe we could get to the point where we'd go watch horror movies (if she likes them) and make spider webs out of pretzel sticks and chocolate, but it looks like that won't happen this year.

We met at his workplace, exchanged social media and after 2 days of extensive texting arranged a date. Our conversations on social had been amazing, we have common opinions on crucial topics and he showed me that he's mature enough, as expected from a man of 33 years old. We were both really excited for the date after seeing that apart from physical attraction we had all those stuff in common, so we decided to meet earlier than the date we had arranged and ended up going to the beach for a walk. We both were very enthusiastic and happy and kissed during the first 15 minutes of our encounter (rushed but we had talked a ton on messages as I've said). It was like we decided that we're going to start a relationship after that small encounter and before even our official date. It might sound rushed but again, we both felt the same attraction and enthusiasm.

I often catch myself thinking that our behavior as a couple isn't serious enough for people of our age. What we've been doing all of this time is going out to bars and restaurants, visiting beautiful places and enjoying our lives to the fullest or staying at home, watching movies and playing games. No matter what we do we always end up having intercourse which we both love and enjoy with each other. My concern is if we're too superficial since we haven't really had any serious discussion after basically those texts and our first official date, is that normal for people our age? AITA for wanting to discuss that with him? We clearly have a great time and when I'm with him I forget all these kind of concerns.

Also, there's the fact that he is a guy who has had many experiences, both because of his age + being attractive and a nice guy. I have never had a serious relationship before and have minimal sexual experience because while I've dated quite a few guys (just going out for a coffee or drink to meet) I never ended up in a relationship with them because they weren't people with the same values as me. So meeting him, an attractive guy who knows how to behave, have similar interests and same values and beliefs as me has me hooked! What troubles me is that I'm worried he sees relationships as an adventure and experience, hence why he has had so many, I think that if we wanted to keep a girl he could easily do it but he just let them go for some reason. So far, he shows his affection and feelings about me all the time. He's also very sweet, caring and protective and when I asked him if he's always like that he said ""You mean with girls? I treat every person the way they make me feel about them, you get that sweet side out of me"" and also mentioned that he got more cuddly and overall let's say ""cute"" with me. It's also the first time he has a relationship with someone that much younger than him, he said his largest age gap before me in a relationship (not counting hookups) was 5 years and we have 9 years difference. You guys think I should discuss everything that troubles me with him or should I just let loose and enjoy our beautiful relationship?",4,1729691201.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Hi folks. I‚Äôm very new to all of this and just a bit confused. 

6 weeks ago I was in a lot of pain one night, went to the gastro, got an endoscopy, he found 3 ulcers and mild gastritis that he said was caused by NSAIDs. 
I don‚Äôt really take NSAIDS, but there was a 3 week period I took Naproxen every day for my migraines, so maybe it was that.

Anyway, he gave me a PPI to take every morning and then he gave me an antacid to take as needed, but I don‚Äôt really take that because after about a week on PPI‚Äôs, the pain stopped! 

The pain only came back again slightly if I ate things that caused discomfort. My doctor said I could eat and drink anything (except for alcohol) as long no as it doesn‚Äôt irritate me and that everyone is different, that things like coffee won‚Äôt make my ulcer worse, it‚Äôll just maybe hurt. It didn‚Äôt hurt me! So I ate it just fine.

All I avoided was lemon and tomato based things, and spicy food. 

Everything else I ate, and was fine.

I‚Äôm supposed to only take my PPI‚Äôs for 6 weeks, it‚Äôs been 6 weeks now. So now im off of it. 

I‚Äôm supposed to check if they‚Äôre closed in mid December. They‚Äôre supposed to close within 6 weeks. 

I ate pizza and pasta with meatballs and sauce and soda for my birthday yesterday. No pain.  I didn‚Äôt even need a Pepcid like I assumed I would. 

So, are my ulcers closed? 

I‚Äôm still going to avoid most of these foods til December, with the exception of like holidays or maybe like once a week etc, just to be safe.

My question is alcohol.
I don‚Äôt drink often, maybe once a month at most I‚Äôll have a cocktail or two, but it‚Äôs Halloween week and I have huge plans and would love to have a drink or two.

I know food doesn‚Äôt make my ulcer worse, but does alcohol? 

Realistically, if I still had these ulcers, and I drank 2-3 times for Halloween week, would it make my ulcers worse and I‚Äôd be at risk of like, infection or dying etc? 

Or would it just maybe hurt me and I‚Äôd just have to spend a day in bed and then I can continue the healing process? 

Or would it not hurt me if they‚Äôre closed and I can just move on? 

after Halloween, I won‚Äôt be drinking til maybe the new year. 

Please do not fear monger me. It‚Äôs really unhelpful and unrealistic. I know I shouldn‚Äôt drink with an ulcer. I won‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm just asking if I CAN once or twice and what will happen if I do. 

And how likely it is I still have these ulcers after 6 weeks of PPI and eating irritants that made me feel just fine.

1gaau9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraineforeignlegion/comments/1gaau9p/ukrainian_gear_guide_mk_2/,Ukrainian Gear Guide Mk. 2,"Well I passed all of my exams so now I have some time to actually post the updated guide. Not too much has changed, but I have a few additions that I think people will appreciate.

What you will be issued (every unit will be a bit different, but here's what my last unit issued me back in March 2024):

* Uniform (this will be a field uniform in MM14. It's ok. I recommend bringing or buying your own combats. Multicam is standard but any NATO camo pattern will probably be allowed).
* Boots (decent quality).
* Undershirts, underwear, socks (good quality).
* Sleeping bag and foam bedroll (acceptable quality).
* Duffel bag and gear bag (mediocre MM14 stuff but it gets the job done mostly).
* Ruck (excellent quality. I was issued a Norwegian Bergan. One of my friends got a FILBE).
* Hearing protection (I got Comtac XPI hearing defenders with a set of 3M arc rail mounts, ymmv).
* Helmet (either the Ukrainian ACH-alike or a DSTU-1 rated high cut. Not great, not terrible).
* Plate carrier/armor (MM14 carrier with plates and groin/neck protection. Mediocre at best. I recommend bringing your own).
* Pouches (random garbage in a mix of camo patterns).
* Optics (ACOGs and Aimpoint Comp M5s if you're lucky. Consider bringing your own).
* NODs (Lol. Lmao even. Top kek if you must).

Now lets talk options for buying stuff in country. There are lots of them.

Armor (all of these include DSTU testing and certification paperwork):

* [Balistyka](https://balistyka.ua/): Good source for cost effective soft armor panels. Their rifle plates are not the best though. They sell pouches/plate carriers. Do not buy them.
* [Ukrainian Armor](https://ukrainianarmor.com/): Good source for soft armor as well as rifle plates. They sell pouches/plate carriers. Do not buy them.
* [Safari Defense](https://safaridefense.com/broneplyty/): Reasonably priced titanium-ceramic composite rifle plates. They sell pouches/plate carriers. Do not buy them.
* [U-Win Protect](https://u-win.com.ua/): Lots of options for soft armor add-ons. Their other soft gear offerings are solid as well.

Side note: DO NOT BY STEEL PLATES. Do not trust people that tell you to buy steel plates. Steel plates suck. That is all.

Soft gear and uniforms:

* [M-TAC](https://militarist.ua/ua/): Solid pouches, uniforms, backpacks, and LBE. Make sure you stick to their Elite line, because that's the stuff made from NIR compliant fabrics. I personally love their Sturm Gen II combat uniform and tegris shooter's belt. Their armored warbelt is solid. Offers a fairly generous military discount at their retail locations (Militaryst). They also now offer their own take on the Crye AVS that has an integrally armored harness which looks excellent. I haven't tried it myself, but if it works as well as I think it will this is a solid example of Ukrainian gear now surpassing western stuff in some ways.
* [Kamber Tactical](https://kamber.com.ua): Good pouches, bags, and FCPCv5 knockoff. I'd recommend sourcing a cummerbund elsewhere though.
* [Tur Gear](https://turgear.com.ua): Good source for pouches, and they make a solid cummerbund as well. I don't recommend their shooter's belt though. The M-TAC version is better and costs 2/3 the price.
* [Rhizome Systems](https://rhizomesystems.com.ua): Shaw Concepts at home. The only local manufacturer using First Spear Tubes here. They also make a great groin protector and armored war belt, as well as a bunch of small helmet bits and night vision accessories. Their entire catalogue is gtg.
* [Utactic](https://utactic.com): Good uniforms and medical/drone bags. Ignore their mag pouches and belts. There is a military discount but getting it is akin too pulling teeth.
* [A.T.A.K.A](https://attack.kiev.ua): Decent uniforms. Mediocre pouches.
* creed\_original\_ukraine (IG): Source of near 1:1 repros of Crye products like the AVS. Made with American NIR compliant multicam and correct hardware. I have their AVS-1000 and love it. If you ask nicely they will clone pretty much any nylon gear for you in like 3-5 days at a reasonable price. I love these guys.
* [stargear.ua](http://stargear.ua) (IG for now because their website still isn't set up): I can't speak to their whole catalogue, but I absolutely love their structural shoulder pads. They also are working on a structural cummerbund inspired by the HRT RAC system that is very well thought out. They will make one for you if you ask nicely.
* war\_spirit (IG): They make some Ferro-inspired stuff as welled as a knockoff of the BFG CHLK. Haven't tested it yet but I will be getting that belt as soon as I am not broke. The price is also right. I'd just avoid getting anything with ROC buckles because those are shit.
* [L4 Performance](https://www.l4performance.com/): This is actually a Finnish company, but they ship to Ukraine for free, and a lot of their designs are informed by the experience of people serving in Ukraine. I have their plate carrier and it's fucking excellent. The guy that runs it is also a standup dude and they have great customer service. I can't recommend them enough.

Importers of western gear. These guys will rob you blind and I only recommend buying from them as a last resort:

* [Abrams](https://abrams.com.ua/en): They have a storefront in Kyiv and pretty much double the price of everything they sell. They will offer you coffee with some whiskey in it while you browse though. Their house line of combat pants aren't bad either.
* [Gaydamak](https://gaydamak.com.ua): Also have a storefront in Kyiv. Slightly less of a ripoff but still a ripoff. If you want something made by Warrior Assault Systems immediately, these guys probably have it. No free whiskey coffee though.
* [Punisher](https://punisher.com.ua): Mix of overpriced western gear and slightly less overpriced Chinesium. What makes them useful is that they offer NVG and Comtac repair services. Also a good source for PTTs if you're into that sort of thing.
* [Tapto.pro](http://tapto.pro): Somehow involved with Punisher but they have some stuff on their (horribly designed) website that Punisher does not.

Holsters:

* [ATA Gear](https://ata-gear.com.ua): The make solid Level 2 retention holsters for pretty much every handgun that exists. Including the Stechkin APS.

Optics:

* [OLX](http://olx.ua): Lots of dealers for Holosun and Primary Arms. Order with pay on delivery to avoid getting ripped off. Often substantially cheaper than gun stores and optics websites.

Suppressors:

* mystic\_suppressors (IG): This is the closest you're going to get to a Surefire Socom RC2/3 in Ukraine. For about $500 you can get a flow through full auto rated QD can that sounds good and has surprisingly little flash. Yes, the fact that it's co-owned by my old CO may make me a bit biased, but it's an excellent product and pretty much the only well-made modern QD suppressor you can get here (Steel Suppressors and Tihon pale in comparison).

Additional notes: A few of these sites have English interfaces. Most don't. Use the translate function in your browser. For getting anything delivered you need to use Nova Poshta. Once you have a Ukrainian sim card have a Ukrainian help you set up the nova poshta app on your phone. Almost all of these companies will allow you to pay for your gear at the nova poshta office when it is delivered. It's a good system. If you have any other questions after reading this guide, post em below and I'll answer to the best of my ability.",1,1729690858.0,ukraineforeignlegion,0,1.0,False

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

¬†

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

I needed a job‚Äîsomething to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a caf√© just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

¬†

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

¬†

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

¬†

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

¬†

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?‚Äù

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. ‚ÄúHang on, I‚Äôll get the owner for you.‚Äù

¬†

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

¬†

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre looking for a job?‚Äù His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. ‚ÄúI really need one. I don‚Äôt have much experience, but I‚Äôm a fast learner and willing to do anything.‚Äù

¬†

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. ‚ÄúRelax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.‚Äù

It‚Äôs time to stand up and make a difference. On¬†**October 25-27**, the¬†**most important protest**¬†in this year is happening right outside Scientology's UK headquarters at¬†**Saint Hill**, East Grinstead. This is going to be EPIC ‚Äì we're coming together to¬†**raise awareness about the abuse and control happening within the Church of Scientology**, and we need YOU to be part of it!

**What‚Äôs Going Down:**

* **When**: October 25-27, 2024 (Friday-Sunday)
* **Where**: Saint Hill, East Grinstead (near the IAS event)
* **Who‚Äôs Leading It**: The protest is organized by¬†**Alexander ‚ÄúApostate Alex‚Äù Barnes-Ross**, a former high-ranking Scientologist turned whistleblower, who‚Äôs been exposing the harmful practices of Scientology for years through his YouTube channel and online magazine, '**Scientology Business'**.
* **Why**: We‚Äôre here to peacefully protest against the¬†**human rights abuses, family separation, harassment, and coercive practices**¬†that have been going on behind Scientology‚Äôs closed doors.

Last year‚Äôs protest drew¬†**46 people**, but this year it will be a bit different as we are not looking to creating any havoc or mess, we simply want to educate people on the trust behind the Church. Let‚Äôs send a message loud and clear to those trapped inside the organization:¬†**We are here for you, and help is available.**

# Why You Should Be There:

* **Scientology‚Äôs abuse MUST STOP**. This isn‚Äôt about attacking people‚Äôs beliefs ‚Äì it‚Äôs about exposing the systemic abuse, harassment, and exploitation that happens behind the scenes.
* We‚Äôre protesting peacefully but¬†**making our voices heard**. Public protests have already resulted in many people learning about organizations like the¬†**Aftermath Foundation**, which helps people escape Scientology.
* **David Miscavige**, Scientology‚Äôs elusive leader, is expected to attend ‚Äì this protest will grab his attention like never before.
* **Raise awareness**¬†with us on the¬†**40th anniversary**¬†of the International Association of Scientologists event, which gathers thousands of parishioners from across Europe (Usually all the Sea Organization members and staff are the one that are coming to this event, plus some known figures). We need to¬†**show the world what‚Äôs really going on**¬†in this cult-like organization.

Want to help out even more? Consider donating to help with organizing costs via¬†[Buy Me a Coffee¬†](https://buymeacoffee.com/apostatealex)‚Äì every bit helps to spread the message and make this protest as big as possible!

**Register to Attend**: If you're ready to make a stand, register¬†[here](https://www.iasprotest.com/). Even if you can‚Äôt attend in person, you can tune into the¬†**live stream on YouTube**¬†at youtube.com/@apostatealex.

Let‚Äôs make history and expose the truth about Scientology‚Äôs abuses together. Your voice matters ‚Äì let‚Äôs make this protest EPIC!

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn‚Äôt want to drag you into my mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Isla‚Äôs third birthday today,‚Äù Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Isla,‚Äù I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!‚Äù

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúDrea,‚Äù a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. ‚ÄúI was just coming to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù I blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you left hours ago.‚Äù

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. ‚ÄúI did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.‚Äù

I nodded, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah, we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

Adrian‚Äôs expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúDrea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

1gaan8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gaan8w/roommate_called_the_cops_on_me/,Roommate called the cops on me ,"I will try to make this succinct but roommate tried to call the cops on me because I said I feel unsafe, and because I didn‚Äôt do the dishes. So I‚Äôve actively been trying to do be better about the dishes because I got tired of my roommates speaking to me about them, but my roommates also do a lot that bothers me but they don‚Äôt seem to do anything about that (I can get into  it later). I‚Äôm trying to make this a shorter version. We‚Äôve known said roommate has been unstable for awhile‚Äì we often hear him throw shit in his room and yell to himself. His last relationship was definitely abusive. He knocks on my door and tells me to clean my dishes and to take my shit off of *his* tables (by the way my shit at this point is a thing of tea and my lunchbox. One time my work gave me a bunch of papers and I didn‚Äôt know what to do with it so I did leave it on the table for awhile but brought it back as soon as I got a cubby). I told him I get it ( according to other roommate dishes have been better ) but I‚Äôm not gonna fight with him so I go back to my room. He stands outside my door and keeps yelling at me. I told I‚Äôd call the police because I feel unsafe since he‚Äôs not respecting the door boundary.¬† I told him to leave me alone and he wouldn‚Äôt.¬†

So in panic I called my mom and walked outside to the porch with her on speaker phone. He tried to follow me outside to get the ‚Äúmail.‚Äù He starts yelling at my Mom on the phone that I‚Äôm gonna call the police because I feel unsafe. I get up and walk around the block. He is sitting on the porch and making a call. As my mom and I predicted he called the police to get a ‚Äúwellness check,‚Äù done on me. I managed to get back inside my room and  put a chair against the door. The police arrived and I explained what happened through my POV. I said he wouldn‚Äôt back off when I closed the door so that‚Äôs when I said I‚Äôd call the police and he called them first to ‚Äúone up,‚Äù me. Then they went to talk to him and when they came back they said something‚Äôs off with him and he tried to lie that he didn‚Äôt call the police. They suggested I move. I‚Äôm so annoyed. My roommates act as if the dishes is the worst thing on the planet, but said crazy roommate also is convinced that he owns all of the shared living spaces and rearranges furniture all the time without telling us. He moved all of my tea and coffee off the counter and the table from the living room because he decided he needs more countertop space. He decorates the living room spaces with a bunch of football shit, that I hate because I don‚Äôt give a crap about football. He‚Äôs done this multiple times. He also built some random light shit in the living room he hasn‚Äôt taken outside yet. My roommates also never vacuum or clean the bathtub or wipe down the refrigerator but no my dishes are the worst possible thing on the planet.¬†

I want to move out but also don't want to because the rent is really good for my area. I feel like I can't comfortably exist in my own home because they are gonna get pissed. I've never had any issues with other roommates.

Edit: Yes, I am aware I need to the dishes. Mom said that to me over the phone. Doing the dishes isn't the only household chore that needs to get done. We all pay rent so it's everyone's shared living space.

1gaakdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspynovardsnark/comments/1gaakdn/from_someone_who_grew_up_mormon_and_has_seen_many/,From someone who grew up Mormon and has seen many young marriages crumble‚Ä¶,"I grew up very Mormon and have seen a LOT of young marriages (with varying degrees of involvement with the religion) fall apart, usually for something to do with the church. From couples that went together every week all the way to couples that never went to church together while married, in a place like Utah, that church has a stranglehold on culture and nearly all family dynamics of extended family and in-law relationships. There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve seen happen over and over again that tears couples apart once it comes to light.

So here‚Äôs what I think happened:

I think Parker blamed Aspyn for him no longer being involved with the church.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you going on a mission?‚Äù

‚ÄúAspyn doesn‚Äôt want me to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you getting married in the temple?‚Äù

‚ÄúAspyn doesn‚Äôt want me to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you taking your kids to church?‚Äù

‚ÄúAspyn doesn‚Äôt want me to.‚Äù

Any uncomfortable situations or questions with his friends and family can just be pinned on Aspyn, she can be the bad guy. Aspyn, thinking this is a mutual decision and probably knowing damn well that Parker doesn‚Äôt really want to bother with Mormonism himself, has to deal with increasing animosity from her in-laws and his friends. Parker could just deflect any responsibility or agency at all.

Self-proclaimed mama bear can hate her daughter-in-law for leading her poor, precious baby boy astray and off the path of the one true gospel. She feels justified in leaking things online because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù because anyone who isn‚Äôt a faithful member of the church is a bad and evil person. But mama bear doesn‚Äôt have to actually confront that includes her son too, because it‚Äôs not his fault.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the culture of Mormonism, this might seem absurd. My husband and I left the church together and I would be absolutely unhinged if I learned he‚Äôs secretly been telling family it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm making him. Like, I‚Äôd probably put Aspyn to shame and make it very public just how much of an eager participant he was in the ‚Äúsinful lifestyle‚Äù with me.

I‚Äôve seen this happen a lot in Mormon circles, someone (usually the male half of a couple tbh) just blames their lack of participation in the religion on their partner (usually the wife) so they don‚Äôt have to have an unpleasant conversation with their parents. And it‚Äôs such a misogynistic culture that the parents don‚Äôt hesitate to think it‚Äôs the evil woman who‚Äôs lead their son away from the path, he must be perfectly innocent in all this.

1gaaj66,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1gaaj66/the_more_i_think_about_it_logan_didnt_know_rory/,"The more I think about it, Logan didn't know Rory at all.","I used to be Team Logan and if you check my history, I have a lot of love for the potential of Tristan/Rory. I just see Rory's romantic character arc as someone who slow burn falls for the Logan/Tristan character as she evolves further and further away from the co-dependency of her mother and of Stars Hollow. And we all know that Logan is what Tristan was intended to be.   


(Lorelai and Rory are moving in opposite directions the entire show, further apart and their love interest reflect this. Based off S1, its Luke/Chris and Dean/Tristan. It's assumed Rory's endgame will be the townie like it is for Lorelai, but it's the society, prep-school guy she's known forever and was meant to slowly fall for. Because CMM went to OTH, we got Logan.)  
  
I always loved Logan and Rory and like many, wish they had gotten together and married etc. But actually they should have broken up ages before and everything that came after it just proves that Logan may have loved the idea of Rory but he didn't really love *her.* 

He loved how normal she was, that she was essentially an outsider, that she pushed him in certain directions and he loved the idea of being with her. But there's a lot of areas where he doesn't really get her.  For example, the gifts and displays of wealth. 

* A Birkin bag? For Rory? It's a beautiful bag but his family is in publishing... getting Rory a collection of first editions of her favorite novel would have made a better impact.
* A tennis bracelet and matching jewelry set for Valentines? When do we ever see Rory wear ANY jewelry except Dean's handmade bracelet. She doesn't even wear cheap $10 earrings.
* Proposing at her grad party with horse drawn carriage? Rory is an introvert - she probably would have preferred something more intimate between the two of them, then have the big celebration.
* The coffee cart. Yes she loves coffee and its a fun gag but that's still a weird way to apologise for sleeping with an entire room of women after one fight... and then not telling Rory about it.
* Honorable mention but the $300 dollar bottle of wine and the fanciest restaurant isn't Rory either. HM because ten years later, I think Rory has really lost her self-identity and just accepts whatever comes into her life. 

But then you have Logan's response to rory dropping out and not going back and while he does support her through it, he also doesn't challenge her very much on the topic. He doesn't really encourage her to stop living at her grandparent's, he lets her stay fairly aimless and for the most part he acts like these are all normal things until the big fight. 

When we get to the version of Rory that Jess meets again in S6, she's unrecognizable. And Logan can't seem to tell that she's unrecognizable. He loves the consistency and personality that Rory brings to his life and it's clear that Rory makes HIM better, but is he really seeing Rory for Rory? Is he down to watch Pippi and talk about literature? What music does he love? Does he have any interests outside of partying and playing with his dad's money? He's on the paper with her, sure, but he's not really interested in it. He doesn't have any clear goals other than not working for his dad and that's also an example of Rory making him better but not the other way around.

All that said, I feel like Logan and Rory should have ended things after the Jess fight and then really ended things after the bridesmaids thing. Rory could have tried again with Jess but ultimately choose to be friends.. but I wish Rory had been given a chance in S7 to meet someone who she really, really connected with. Someone with either elements of what she had in each BF or something completely new. Something rooted in friendship and then something more. Something safe but exciting. Someone who knew exactly what to get her and really saw her for herself. But also someone that wanted her to be exactly who she was. 

On rewatches, I don't think Rory ever found that person and it's not Logan. I do think there was potential for Tristan to be that guy over the course of seven seasons but it didn't have to be him. Even in AYITL, the best they could do is have Rory still sleeping with Logan while forgetting she's in a 2-year relationship? Not let her have found a great love in her late 20s-early 30s and show us their love?

ALSO DONT COME FOR MY IMPROPER USE OF COMMAS!

Me and my husband met in highschool and dated on and off. We started dating again at the middle/end of our senior year. He went off to basic training after about 3 months of us being together. His mother we will call her miss B, immediately didnt like me. She claimed I was a lier, because my now husband lied to her about his whereabouts week 3 of our relationship. My husband graduated basic and proposed to me a week or so later. Miss.B was not happy.  She said we were to young but went with it because he is in the military and things move much faster in this lifestyle. My husband and I agreed we‚Äôd like to do a small court house wedding and do the whole big thing later when we could financially handle it. Miss B insisted that her son wouldn‚Äôt be married in a court house, so she told us she‚Äôd pay for a small backyard wedding with intermediate family only. I have a very big family. I didn‚Äôt want to have a small wedding, and especially not in a small backyard. So I politely attempted to decline, to which miss.B refused to accept. So we started planning. At this point my husband had shipped to his duty station over seas, so it was just me and miss.B. I start to make a guest list and my mother and grandma kept making me add people to the list. ( I‚Äôm a people pleaser to this day don‚Äôt come for me ). Miss.B is getting irritated with me and my family, so I talked to my husband and we agreed F her this is our decision and we once again agreed to the original plan. We got married, invited everyone to meet us for dinner and that was that. While my husband was away, miss.B forced me to be on birth control even though my body dosent manage well on it. I have been on 3 different kinds and all of which made me sick, or bleed for months on end. Fast forward, I‚Äôm about 2 months from moving over to my husbands station and my husbands sister passed away. Well call her Amy. Miss.B has 2 biological kids amy and my husband. She also has step kids but they aren‚Äôt important to this story. Miss.B and Amy didn‚Äôt get along what so ever, and Amy and my husband also had a rocky relationship. Amy was living across the country so getting her home for the service was hard. We had the service and everything went about as well as it could have given the circumstances. I‚Äôd like to say that Amy and I didn‚Äôt get along. She was very welcoming to me in the start of my husband and I‚Äôs relationship but over time she would bully me and ask for money frequently. I by no means hated her or anything like that, I just chose to protect my peace and not speak to her outside of holidays and family events. About a month after the service I moved to be with my husband. He has taken Amy‚Äôs passing very hard. He wants to feel something over the situation but is having trouble allowing himself to grieve given their relationship. I have caught him breaking down a few times, each time I try my best to comfort him and be there for him. My husband is 100% a mommas boy. Miss.B calls and asks how he‚Äôs doing one day and he tells her. She then asks if he needs her here, which he says yes. No biggie. Miss.B flys in a few weeks later. My husband couldn‚Äôt take any time off because he used his time to fly back and be with his family during everything.

The first few days were okay. She kept asking to go on super long walks while my husband was at work. I always said yes because we only have one car and I didn‚Äôt want to keep her trapped in the house all day. We come back from a walk one day and she starts talking about planning a trip for the weekend. She says she‚Äôll cover x amount of money for the hotel but whatever is over that we need to pay. She then tells me I need to plan the entire trip myself. I start looking at hotels near the national park miss.b and my husband want to go see. I‚Äôm looking at places that are super cheap. I‚Äôm talking $50-$60 a night. My husband and I cannot afford to drop a bunch of money just because she‚Äôs in town. I pick a trail, everything‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm looking at places that we can bring our puppy along with us, since we can‚Äôt find a dog sitter on such short notice. I show miss.b the plans I made and she immediately started looking up different hotels, ones that were easily $250-$350 a night. Well over the budget. She then says we should stay 2 nights rather than the original 1 night. My husband tells her he doesn‚Äôt care, so two nights it was. Fast forward to the trip we pack up and head to the hotel which is a few hours away. 

We get to the hotel and crash out after the drive. The next morning we get up and head to the trail we‚Äôre going to hike. Miss.b told me to bring my camera so I did. I took easily 50+ pictures of her and my husband. She took maybe 6 of him and I. That was irritating, in almost every picture my face isn‚Äôt even in it. Whatever. We get to the top of our trail (the tallest mountain in the area) I‚Äôm setting up the camera to get group pictures of the 3 of us. I hear a click and look back to see she took the puppy off the leash even though the puppy had proved time and time again that he is a runner. Immediately the puppy runs. My husband and I were in shock that at the top of a mountain she just unhooked our puppy. I had already had enough with her holding the dogs leash because she‚Äôd let him walk in the street while cars passed, let him walk straight into a electric fence, she was just careless with him. My husband made a quick irritated comment to his mother and we all ran after him, leaving my thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment behind. We caught him, and thankfully he didn‚Äôt go off the edge. I‚Äôm on 10 at this point. We take the pictures and walk back down to the car. We‚Äôre now at the second location (that miss.b picked) and we pull in and there‚Äôs signs everywhere saying no dogs. I stay in the car with the puppy for almost 2 hours while they are at this place. I‚Äôm super irritated now because I‚Äôve been the one left in the car with the puppy this entire trip at every stop. My husband asked if I was okay to stay with him and promised he‚Äôd be quick. They come back and I barely speak. We get back to the hotel and I start asking my husband to go swimming with me (it‚Äôs been years since we last went swimming together, and that‚Äôs the only portion of this trip I was excited about) he says he‚Äôs to tired to swim and tells me to just go with miss.b. I begged but he wasn‚Äôt up for it. So I went and swam for a bit with her and all she did was talk about her life and blah blah blah. The entirety of the conversations I‚Äôve had with miss.b the entire time she had been here was about her, her trauma, Amy, how broke she was, and how much she hates her husband. I was tired of having the same conversations where all I could say was yeah,mhmm, ok, and I know. so I called it a night and went back to the room and went to bed. We all get up and pack, then decide check out isn‚Äôt until noon so we should go walk to this park across the street for a little bit to stretch out legs before this long car ride back home. We walk to the park and I set up my camera to get some better pictures of my husband and I. Miss.B walks over and makes me take more pictures of her and my husband. Finally she takes 3 more of me and him. I‚Äôm irritated again so I just pack up my camera and we check out and get on the road. We stop to get food about half way in because she NEEDS coffee.  She went on for like an hour about needing coffee. So we grab her coffee and get food and she takes on smell of the coffee and dumps it out. Normally this wouldn‚Äôt bug me, but she just insisted we stop to get coffee, also this was not the first drink she‚Äôs tossed out in total she dumped 5 drinks out and threw away 2 meals that all of which we payed for in the 5 days she had been here at that point. Again whatever. We get back on the road the rest of the ride she just complains about how broke she is and how she hates her husband. Who by the way (well call him Mr.B) called her multiple times a day excited to see/talk to her. I‚Äôm talking he looked like a golden retriever wagging his tail. The second she‚Äôd hang up everytime she‚Äôd say stuff like; ‚ÄúI never had the strength to leave him back then‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to drain all our money‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôre still together this many years later‚Äù.  Mr.B is not perfect by any means, however he has came a long way and has worked on himself immensely to be a very good person, father, and husband. We get home around dinner time and I offer to cook something since we‚Äôve only eaten out this whole time. Miss.b of course says no, so we order food. Her food isn‚Äôt cooked enough so we throw it on the stove and everything‚Äôs okay. After dinner I hear her call herself mommy  talking to MY PUPPY. This was not the first time I heard her say this, she also kept saying that she was his favorite, and she was going to take him home etc. If you aren‚Äôt a dog mom you won‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs such a big no. I was livid but I bit my tongue because it was only a few more days. I persevered through the last few days and finally it‚Äôs the day she goes. the. flip. home. We drop her off at her hotel for the night since my husband had work in the morning and she had a early flight. On the car ride home just me and my husband, he looks at me and says you know I love my mom but‚Ä¶ ( I was 100% going to keep my opinions to myself but hearing that phrase was music to my ears ) he proceeded to tell me ‚Äúbut she crossed a line‚Äù. I‚Äôm intrigued, because what do you mean. He tells me that when I stayed in the car with the puppy, miss.b asked him if he was happy in his marriage. Because her and Mr.B we‚Äôre worried (which means she is not Mr.B) To which my husband said yes why? She said ‚Äúbecause your wife dosen‚Äôt cook, she doesn‚Äôt clean, dosent work, dosent do laundry, and takes naps‚Äù. I was baffled, speechless, my lips couldn‚Äôt even mermer a word. I‚Äôd like to remind you all that I asked if she‚Äôd like me to cook nearly every night and she said no. I clean once after breakfast, and once before bed. I deep cleaned the day she arrived before she got here so the house was spotless. As far as work and laundry go those are two things me and my husband discussed before I got here. Miss.B had told me I need to contribute and get a job in very rude manners many many times. My husband and i aggreed I was not going to work because the process to get a job on a military base is time consuming , and it would be pointless since we can live comfortably without me working , so this could be my time to relax before going back to school once we move back to the states, especially since I‚Äôve worked since I was 10. laundry is my husbands duty. He washes and I fold. He just has a terrible memory and forgets until he needs more clothes. I am a big mapper I will nap if I can. I took one  nap the entire time she was here. A few other things I forgot to mention were, she bought us a pots and pan set when we first moved into our house on base, as a house warming gift. When she got here she noticed a list of things we needed to get on the fridge and ordered them trying to do a nice thing for her son. She told him it was a house warming gift. She spent probably $400 on items. Then proceeded to ask us to reimburse her. The airport she flew into when she got here was hours away so we offered to pick her up and she said no she wanted to take a train. She bought the ticket, but ended up taking an earlier train so she bought two train tickets. She asked us to reimburse her for those as well. She made us go shopping for her before she got here so she had the foods she liked, and didn‚Äôt eat any of it. Her being here costed us probably around 2.5-3k for less than 2 weeks.

So here's my story so far.  It's long and there's no tl;dr because it's a story and the details might help someone.

I am 50 and hormonally I am in the perimenopause phase but I am technically in menopause because I haven't had a period since I was 35 due to getting an endometrial ablation.

I've always been someone who didn't require a lot of sleep, since I was small.  My dad is the same, though he's the type to go to bed early and then wake up super early and I am a night owl, which I get from my mom.  All the way into my late thirties I was fine with 5 hours of sleep a night and if I had a couple nights of less, not due to insomnia but do to work travel or work projects or a sick child, etc, I was fine.

But, beginning in my very early 40s I started having trouble with both primary and secondary insomnia, with secondary insomnia being the biggest problem.  I started only getting 3 hours of sleep a night.  Once my marriage of 20+ years broke down I turned to alcohol, which ultimately made things worse.  As my mental health improved and I began unlinking from the dependence upon alcohol I realized my brain had totally reconditioned from any good sleep chemistry and I started with the primary insomnia.

For instance, I still drink socially on the weekends.  Of course, it SEEMS like I get a full night's sleep those nights but we all know that's not true due to the impact of alcohol on REM, etc.  So, Monday rolls around and I have primary insomnia.  Often again on Tuesday.  And I mean ZERO sleep those nights. By Wednesday I am tired enough that I fall asleep, but 3 hours later I am wide awake.  Same on Thursday, etc.

The first thing my doctor and I tried was progesterone.  While it helped with OTHER perimenopausal things it did not help with sleep.  Of course, I tried magnesium and melatonin and cava and other sleep supplements.  The Calm drink mix would often help with the primary insomnia but not the secondary.  That being said, I do find it very helpful in my international travel to expediate recovery from jet lag.  We're talking 8-12 hour time differences.  So, I still use it for that.

On my own, without a doctor's supervision, I tried gabapentin and trazadone.  This is where you should roll your eyes HARD and let out a heavy sigh of disapproval - these were medications Rx'd to my DOG for the anxiety she had during storms/fireworks (my beloved Fisher passed away in August, of cancer, at age 7).  Gabapentin did nothing.  Trazadone at full 100mg just about made me into a zombie the next day.  I could NOT get up the next day and had to call in sick the one time I tried it.  50mg seemed to work okay.  But after reading up on it I felt it wasn't going to help me get my brain back to good sleep ""chemistry"", for lack of a better term.  I will reserve it for times when it might be more appropriate, like getting sleep on a long flight, like the 14 hour one to Seoul or the 16 hour one to Johannesburg.

Last month my doctor Rx'd me Belsomra.  I can't take Ambien and the like due to a history of sleep-walking.  I was initially Rx'd 10mg.  I got the manufacturer's coupon to bring the price down to $80 for 30 pills.  10mg did nothing for me.  Talking to my doctor we agree I should try to double it.  20mg in 2 10mg tablets worked!

And it seems to be working the more often I used it.  The first couple of times I tried it I felt myself getting drowsy within 30 minutes, went to bed, and I would fall asleep immediately.  I was still waking up too early but getting in an extra hour.

After a good week on 20mg I found that even when I would come to some wakefulness after 4 hours it was pretty easy to go back to sleep because my mind would not immediately start engaging in buzzing thoughts and other mindful/thought-based activity.  And I would sleep another couple hours.  After a total of 6 hours I would come to a wakefulness where my brain/mind would engage and after about 10-20 minutes or so I would realize that it was just time to get up.

I would feel a little groggy, but a cup of coffee would clear that away.

Now I find myself having 4-5 nights of what I call pretty damn good sleep.

But, I have had a few quirky ""side-effects"" that don't really bother me.  

The first is that I have a few jump-starts as I fall asleep.  Not the type where you feel like you're falling and you jump at the end/bottom.  Just these strong involuntary body jerks.  They're pretty strong, too.  But they don't pull me out of falling asleep.  My boyfriend, who likes to sleep all rooted up against my back, has commented on them.  They happen 1-3 times as I am initially falling asleep but not in the middle of sleep.

The second is some really vivid dreams that I can remember when I wake up. Nothing nuts or scary, just vivid.  Often mundane, to the point I am, like, wait...is that a memory or a dream?

The third is a state of lucid sleeping where I either do hear things going on around me (often get incorporated into the vivid dream) or I fully hallucinate the noise.  

The most prominent and common one is this:  My adult son lives with me.  He's a professional photographer and often does shoots of concert events and other things that keep him out late.  So he will sometimes not come home and just stay at his girlfriend's place or with a friend.  But a few times I absolutely heard him come into the house, tool around in the kitchen putting together a snack, and going into his room.  To get into our place, which is a warehouse loft conversion, you have to come through an iron gate to the patio and then through the front door, both which need to be shut forcefully in order to shut, so they're loud.  The kitchen and his bedroom are essentially below mine so any activity in the kitchen is clear from my room and when he goes into his room he has to open and shut a sliding door, which makes a distinctive moderately loud noise on its own.  I will hear ALL of that!  But the one thing that clues me into it being a hallucination?  My other dog, Norm...no sound from him. He's a 100lb Doberman and whenever my son DOES come home he's absolutely getting up, scratching at the front door as my son crosses the patio, running in excited circles around, etc.  His typical reaction to my son coming home is never part of the hallucination.  So, that's how I've learned to discern it.  And I am guessing since it's a pattern of noises that's part of my daily life that's why it manifests to begin with.

Anyway, my doctor Rx'd me the 20mg.  My insurance denied it initially.  They would only cover 30 pills a YEAR.  But she was able to get that waived and now it's a little over $100 for 30 pills/month.  I don't take it every day since I do still socially drink so 30 pills last me longer than a month.

For the first time in years I feel like I am feeling more like my old self.  If this long-ass story helps anyone, I would be thrilled!  My biggest lesson was to let the medication take a few tries to ""work with my brain"" and help it ""relearn"" the way it's supposed to sleep.  To be patient.

1gaacz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1gaacz4/the_food_rules/,The food rules,"I'm pretty sure my (50/F) covert narc wayward husband (52/M), to whom I have been married for 20 years, has other diagnoses besides covert narcissism, such as potential OCPD, or he may even be on the spectrum. He will not share honestly with his therapist, so he'll never get an accurate diagnosis.

Anyway. Sigh. The food rules. Food issues were the first red flag.

When I visited CN at his apartment for the first time, this is what he had in his fridge: Diet Coke. Bottled water. Ketchup. Parmesan cheese. Nothing else. In his pantry? Boxes and boxes of white pasta, either rotini or macaroni shape. Cans and cans of Hunts tomato sauce. A package of cookies. All organized and stacked in neat rows.

Let me point out that while he wasn't making a ton of money, he certainly earned enough to purchase groceries or, heaven forbid, a vegetable. I said nothing.

As we dated, I would ask him what I could cook for him (because I like to cook), other than pasta with red sauce, and he couldn't articulate anything else that he wanted or liked. He did, however, have a very, very long list of foods he wouldn't eat or didn't like. I have to admit that up until that point, I had never met an adult who has such a restrictive diet, other than people with health issues or food allergies, and even they tended to have a more diverse diet.

Here is a partial list of all the things he absolutely refuses to eat or drink: Coffee, alcohol, nearly all vegetables (extreme aversion to onions, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, most leafy greens, cucumber, eggplant, and many more I am forgetting), tofu, eggs, strawberries, and that's just off the top of my head. Mostly, he's into carbohydrates, cheese, and baked goods. He's fine with burgers.

The thing is, it would be fine if he refused to eat these things and went on with life. But no. He must make fun of the fact that I eat vegetables, and I eat a good number of meatless meals. He makes gagging sounds at my meals, and loudly proclaims, ""Eeeeewwwwwwwwww."" Fortunately, he rarely wants to eat a meal in my presence.

Over the years, as he has become more rigid, and he decided that he will not eat any food that I make. He became angry and said I was ""pressuring"" him to eat my cooking. That is absolutely untrue. I would make meals, put them in the fridge, and let him know they were there. Most of the time, he'd just boil some pasta for dinner because it was ""fresh.""

Also, he now doesn't want to eat in front of me. He will wait and wait until I go to bed before he eats dinner. Often, he'll eat after 11 pm.

Also, we have grocery shopped separately for 20 years. I learned very early on that the food I chose for him, even if it was a duplicate of what he had purchased the previous week, was not good enough. He would literally avoid the box of frozen waffles I purchased for him, only to buy the exact same box himself and eat those. He wants to ""choose his own groceries."" On the annual occasion we're in a grocery store together, he makes faces at the fact that I purchase produce.

Here's the thing. If he would just let me eat and grocery shop what I want without all the mocking, that would be great. I have never made fun of his many rigid rules surrounding food.

\--Disclaimer: I would like to note that I understand not all the behaviors from our narcs that we share here are related to narcissism. However, I find it both interesting and comforting to know that my covert narc wayward husband's behaviors are things others in a similar situation have experienced as well.

\*\*Additional disclaimer:

Before you ask or comment: JUST LEAVE/WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING/WHY HAVEN'T YOU ALREADY LEFT/WHY HAS IT TAKEN YOU SO LONG TO LEAVE?? Yes, I have a plan in place to leave. Unfortunately, due to a significant health issue beyond my control,¬†I am stuck for the time being, yet I do have an escape plan. It will take me longer than I had hoped.

And yes, I have had consultations with divorce lawyers. No, I can't afford to JUST LEAVE right now. Yes, my lawyer approves of my plan. Yes, I know I should have left long ago, but I allowed myself to be gaslit that this was all okay, and if it wasn't okay, it was my fault anyway. No, I do not have people in my life who have the resources to subsidize and house me. Thank you.\*\*

But what if I told you it could keep dropping? What if the deepest IV depth in five years could show its face this Turkey season? It's a definite maybe - but how could it? We'll take a look today as we continue to monitor our options activity and tinfoily hopium tasting in today's discussion. Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

Our price action stuck to the pattern I outlined in yesterday's post, continued mild weakness, followed by some soft recovery. Options flows started out the day bearish and remained that way heading into EOD. However, by about 1:30pm EDT, bullish flows started to pick up and drive us back up toward $21 into the close. With volume still just barely cracking 3mil shares traded on the day, the total trading range on the day was restricted to a $0.50 move with few opportunities for much in the way of intraday setups:

Despite low share volume overall, new OI was not scarce heading into this week's expiry. Sizable positions in Calls and Puts were expanded throughout the day with Put volume around our ATM strikes primarily at the BID and ATM Calls primarily at the ASK:

Trader sentiment yesterday, thus, was decidedly bullish in the face of our price levels and our prospects for a weekly expiry. How about November OPEX, though?

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/dysknf3bzhwd1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b52f97fdd86546384d77e889f978169107e666e

Our MM Gamma Exposure table continues to display (tasteful) thiccness in that our gamma is highly concentrated around just a few strikes - namely $20 up through $22. $20 still offers a highly stable downside support with $21.50 and $22 still highly gamma net positive and volatility suppressant. However, our $20.50 and $21 ATM strikes continue to move further toward the extremes of GEX polarity. $20.50 has become our largest gamma net negative strike, while $21 has become our largest gamma net positive strike. 

Typically, this means that $20.50 acts as a slippery level where all approaching intraday options activity is met with sympathetic market maker hedging. From our current price position, movements downward would be comparatively much faster in contrast with movements toward $21. 

In low volume conditions like we've seen, a path of least resistance would emerge as something like the price being scrubbed up and down the $20.50-$21 range (like what we saw yesterday) essentially ad nauseum, since this type of move would allow the most movement for the least amount of capital risk within our predictable trading range.

As I've written about and as we've seen before, the relationship between these two strikes (and those overhead) is indicative of a gamma ramp dynamic \*under the right volume conditions\*. IV is low enough that we can expect dealers will be minimally share-hedged on their short call positions heading into Friday's expiry. However, 3.2mil in broadly dispersed daily options won't be enough to set off a chain reaction that yoinks us through the $21 ceiling.

I'm not about to be a stonkman who cries wolf here, but this structure continues to present itself as a possibility during our trading week. It was present last Friday and was stopped through interventive shorting (though the news about the PSA deal did give us a $22 taste in the premarket likely in concert with this dynamic). Something like this could happen again. However, if we see the price stay low and stay trapped below $21 like what we saw heading into 9/20 OPEX (the $19.50 trap), we could see an institution attempt to exploit this gamma hedge structure to cause a limited upward volatility event into 10/25 Weekly options expiry.

**Technicals**

Without anything really remarkable to speak of in today's charts, I want to take some time in today's technical section to explore the possibility that we do not get some kind of informational externality around 10/29. I do this not to cast doubt on such an event (I am, in fact, currently betting that something does occur), but rather to map out what an alternative scenario would likely look like if something does not occur. 

The key is once again and still our 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Assuming our daily price averages continue to sit in the upper $20.50+ range and low $21 range, we still have another 9-10 days of resumed slump on the 50-day SMA. This will shed a few pennies per day off its value until 11/4-11/5 where we will see something around $21.50 as its value. This slump will pause for about 3 days as the late August dip is phased out of the average calculation, taking us into 11/08 Weekly expiry. The following week, the week of November OPEX and the week after, again assuming consistent values, will show a continued dip in the 50-day SMA down to about $21.30 as the pre-earnings values are phased out, then up again as the post-earnings values are phased out, until it reaches an average value of around $21 or slightly below by the end of November. At this point the 200-day SMA will head up to about $19.65 from its current position at $19.34.

1) Ew.

2) This would be yet another month of IV murder. In fact, if this type of movement were to occur, we would see the lowest IV values GME has shown in five years. Our options values would structure out the mother of all gamma pins and the Q3 earnings pump would be more than enough of a catalyst to likely break us out of that monthlong $20.50-$21.50 price purgatory.

Personally, it would be way cooler if an Avocado CATalyst occurred and stirred the pot a bit. However, another month of consolidation \*would\* make the Q3 earnings run up a pretty clear slam dunk on a breakout bet. If next Tuesday another date comes and goes, then our technical landscape (without considering other informational externalities) forecasts something like this for the next four weeks of trading.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/pl2qcgb97iwd1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce09aab6e9478f860d217ab38f07027a6c945f2)

As I said above, the price stenosis we see between $20.50 and $21.50 is an absolute IV killer. We still see some intraweek fluctuations, but the 10-day Mean IV curve corrects for these fluctuations and shows the overall continued trend. If we don't get a CATalyst on Tuesday, or any other kind of informational externality in November I have no reason to suspect we get anything other than a continued IV decline to potential 5-year IV lows throughout the course of November as we approach the next two-week earnings run-up thumper.

**Synthesis¬†+ TA;DR**

Our options data forecasts a path of least resistance which could rinse and repeat small price oscillations in the $20.50-$21 range with weekly close somewhere around the $21 Max Pain. A gamma ramp structure is in place up to $22 and the low IV conditions to keep dealers short on share hedges is also in place to enable it to be maximally upwardly volatile. However, as we've seen, this does not mean it \*has\* to be set off. Otherwise, we still await our October 29 trading day to see if some sort of CATalyst will emerge. If not, it is likely we see another month of extremely tight consolidation into the late November pre-earnings IV run-up.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor.

1gaaalh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gaaalh/becoming_a_morning_person_has_helped_me/,Becoming a Morning Person Has Helped Me ,"Hi all! I just wanted to share something that I realized worked for me, on the off chance it could inspire someone else.

Let me start off by saying, **I hated mornings**. I never wanted to wake up. I worked overnight for four years, preferring to sleep in and stay up late. 

Part of my weight loss issue was working a job that never had a steady schedule. I never had the motivation to work out because I was pretty much just sleeping so I could function at work.

But then I landed a 9-5 job. I was like, okay: So I get home by 6 and then I have the evening to do whatever. Theoretically I could work out! But then with my newfound freedom of having a normal person schedule, I found myself neglecting after-shift work outs in favor of catching up with my friends over a drink or going to have dinner with my family. 

So it wasn't working for me. I thought about how I could squeeze my work out in and tried all kinds of different motivators. But I realized I was ultimately too tired by the end of the day to want to dedicate any time at all. So the only other option would be... to wake up early. **Yuck.**

But I gave it a shot. At first I wasn't waking up early enough. I thought waking up at 6 and having 2 hours in the morning would motivate me to work out. It did in the beginning kind of. But then I'd start to get lazy and want to sleep in more. And then by the time I was actually awake I was rushing to get everything done. It was too stressful. 

So I started to set my alarm for 5:30am. By the time I'm ready to roll out of bed, it'll be 6am or even 6:15 or so. But yet, I found it is the perfect amount of time for my morning routine. 

I wake up, start some coffee. I put some eggs in a pot to boil or I cook them over the stove while the coffee is brewing. My breakfast is always just coffee and some eggs because it is usually all I feel like cooking. I'm never hungry for anything else, but I suppose I could have a fruit or some bacon if I really wanted it. It's simple and I don't have to think too hard about it. I relax, I eat. I can lounge a bit. By 7 no later I'm ready to work out! I do it for just 30 minutes right now. I have an elliptical at home so I just hop on and watch some cartoons or something. I'm done by 7:30. I shower, I still have an hour to get ready for work. I feel refreshed, I am full, relaxed, and I am ready to start the day!! And then I usually am lower energy anyway by the end of the day but I have an easier time socializing with lower energy levels than I did with trying to work out! So now Monday thru Friday I am guaranteed at least 30 minutes of exercise. 

And I have been steadily losing weight doing this. It's amazing how simple it became for me just by waking up early. So I would encourage anyone who is open to the idea to try it!",2,1729689336.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.75,False

1gaa6fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1gaa6fn/second_marathon_complete_training_and_targets_for/,Second marathon complete - training and targets for third,"On Sunday I completed my second marathon in Amsterdam and had a fantastic run, completing it with a chip time of 4:00:48 - an 8 minute improvement on my first marathon in Rotterdam in April.

# Background

I've run a little in my mid thirties and early forties but never maintained it for more than a few months at a time. The only race I'd ever trained for and run was a half marathon in 2012 which I ran in 2 hours - I've never been particularly athletic so I was pretty happy with this result.

Last year at the age of 47 and carrying a little more weight than I was happy with after another long break from physical activity and also motivated by the relatively recent arrival of my first child I decided that I needed to make some major changes to my lifestyle to improve my health.

6 months later and 10kg lighter I'd made far better progress than I'd either expected or hoped for and completed my second ever half-marathon, comfortably knocking off 7mins from my 12 year old PR with a 1:53 finish.

During this time I'd also joined up with one of the running groups in the local Athletics club and decided to run my first marathon the following April.

In hindsight it's clear that I was a little to enthusiastic with the training for my first marathon,  with too quickly building mileage that my body just wasn't prepared for and I ended up injuring my ankle in a Half Marathon event in March - 5 weeks before the Rotterdam marathon - though I did get another PR @ 1:48 which I wasn't expecting! I actually signed up for Amsterdam at this point as a fall-back in case I couldn't run in Rotterdam.

However after 3 weeks of rest and some easy runs in the 2 weeks prior to Rotterdam I was confident enough to attempt the marathon, but had dropped any expectations of completing with my original targets (4 - 4:15). It actually went far better than expected, completing in 4:08. The final 10K was unsurprisingly a slog, with the biggest problem being cramping in my hamstrings that forced me to slowdown (I'd run fairly even 5:50 5k splits for the first 30k but then dropped to 6:00 and 6:10 for the final two).

I had much reduced volume in the remainder of April, May and June - in part to give my ankle some more time for recovery, but I also think due to not having any immediate goals to train for.

After some shocking performances in June I realised I needed to get back into a regular training if I was going to run in Amsterdam.

# Training for Amsterdam

My initial intention for Amsterdam was simply to have *something* to keep me focussed in the second half of the year. I didn't go into the block with any particular goals other than completing the training and running the race without injury.

The coach in my group at the club is a fan of 80/20 and I was happy to follow those principles meaning one speedwork session a week, 2 days easy runs and a long run on the weekend, gradually increasing distances over the weeks and adding in some variety in the final month with a tempo replacing one of the easy runs and mixing some MP intervals or Progression into the long runs. In addition to this I do some strength work with 2 days a week in the gym focussing on core and legs.

The training progressed well with no major problems and only a few minor niggles and I feel it really came together in the final month, running my faster paces comfortably with considerably lower heart rates.

I did my longest run of 34km 3 weeks out (74km week) and a final long run of 29km 2 weeks out (60k week) before dropping to a 15km the week before (40km week) and just a couple of 8km runs the week of the marathon.

In the three days prior to the marathon I carb loaded - consuming around 600g of carbs a day through pasta, rice, bread and sugary drinks.

# Amsterdam Marathon

I'd arrived in Amsterdam with my wife the day before and stayed in a hotel 20 minutes walk from the Olympic stadium.

We picked up the bib at the expo on the Saturday afternoon and despite the long queues got that all sorted surprisingly quickly. I also took the opportunity to check out the location of start area 'B' just outside the stadium.

A light dinner (plain pizza) followed by an early evening and I dropped off easily, waking up at 6:30am for my pre-race breakfast consisting of a krentenbol (sweetdough bun with raisins), lots of water and a coffee to help flush the system.

I prepped my gear, a hydration vest carrying 450ML water, 450ML of electrolytes, salt stick tablets along with 4 SIS Beta gels + 1 SIS BETA with caffeine for close to the end (one gel taken prior to the run and then one every 45-50mins).

I made my way to the starting corrals for my first surprise - I'd hoped to run with 4 hour pacer - but they were in the 3:30 - 4:00 corral - not the 4:00 - 4:30 one I was in. Despite being close to the front of our wave I wasn't able to catch up with them prior to the starting line so ended up pacing myself.

The race itself went really well, the bigger challenges being that it was a pretty crowded course with to many sections that were just to narrow for the the numbers running.

I wanted to pace myself just under 5:40/km and managed to hold this fairly well for the first 35km before feeling any significant fatigue and then again in the final 3k when I felt the first signs of cramps in my hamstrings and slowed down in order to avoid them.

Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed the entire race  - it was certainly uncomfortable in those final few kilometres but I still felt good and had plenty left in the tank for a fast finish over the last 800m which leads me to think I could have pushed a little harder without to much risk.

# What's next?

I was lucky enough to secure a spot in Rotterdam next April and plan to start the 18 week block for that in mid December.

The goal is a solid sub 4 (3:50) by increasing my weekly mileage and following the right plan. I intend to step up from 35 to \~50 miles a week and switch from 4 to 5 runs a week, but more gradually and from a better foundation.

As for the plan, I'm thinking Pfitz 18/55 - I seem to respond well to both mileage and speedwork so this seems to be a good fit.

I‚Äôve just released a [small but powerful (at least for me) tool](https://github.com/Stehos/stehos-reddit-markdown-with-fabric) for fellow self-hosters and developers. This script makes it super simple to extract text from Reddit posts and convert it into a neat Markdown file. It even integrates with Fabric to process and append summaries directly to the Markdown output.

Why did I create it?

There are times when you come across insightful or interesting Reddit threads, and it would be useful to save and format that content for future reference. This tool streamlines the process: pulling the Reddit post & comments, formatting it into Markdown, and allowing you to run custom summaries via Fabric.
Key Features:

- Extract text directly from any Reddit post.
- Convert the content (post, author, upvotes, comments, etc.) into structured Markdown files.
- Seamlessly integrate Fabric to add custom patterns and summaries to your files.
- Easy CLI usage, just provide the Reddit post URL and an output directory.

For those who want more automation, there‚Äôs also an iOS Shortcut that lets you run this directly from your iPhone via SSH! üöÄ [Try it here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5c37b952172445238cccb42d7813d00b).

If you find this project helpful, feel free to ‚≠ê the repo on GitHub or Buy me a coffee. Your support means a lot! üôè

Will try not to ramble

I had a colposcopy 2 years ago. It was traumatic to me. I backed out of the next one. I still need to do it. I have explained to the Doctor who ordered it and to the one who does the procedure that I can't handle it. I just can't. It's very specific...I had my wisdom teeth out while awake because I don't like being put under and it wasn't traumatic. But that procedure I just can't handle. I have not been given any alternative to the way it was done the first time. If it's important enough I would opt to be ""under"" in some way or medicated in some way, but no options have been offered, what do I do or say? Are there options?

My blood pressure is crazy high but I've never been on blood pressure meds. My gyn said I needed to be on something but when I asked my new GP she was resistant and blamed my Ritalin. However, I only take a 20mg time-release and my blood pressure is high even when I don't take it. Blood pressure was 134/99 when I woke up this morning. Before coffee or meds. 138/120 before I went to sleep last night. 

Here's the trust issue. When she mentioned the Ritalin I suggested I could ask my Psychiatrist about a non-stimulant ADHD medication and she said there is no such thing... Which isn't True??? My old GP moved and I wasn't thrilled with her but this first visit with the new one just made me feel so defeated...

It will also have to go with a new couch once I get rid of this cheap loveseat, but that probably won't happen until I move as well. But any ideas about rug AND couch colors that work well together would be much appreciated!

I know I want to keep the green side chair, the brown leather stool, side table,, the rattan bookshelf, and the blue lamp, but the trunk I've turned into a coffee table and the green stool could possibly go. I want a new desk in my new apartment as well so that yellow isn't really a factor. 

Any rearranging thoughts would be helpful as well.

It‚Äôs time to stand up and make a difference. On **October 25-27**, the **most important protest** in this year is happening right outside Scientology's UK headquarters at **Saint Hill**, East Grinstead. This is going to be EPIC ‚Äì we're coming together to **raise awareness about the abuse and control happening within the Church of Scientology**, and we need YOU to be part of it!

**What‚Äôs Going Down:**

* **When**: October 25-27, 2024 (Friday-Sunday)
* **Where**: Saint Hill, East Grinstead (near the IAS event)
* **Who‚Äôs Leading It**: The protest is organized by **Alexander ‚ÄúApostate Alex‚Äù Barnes-Ross**, a former high-ranking Scientologist turned whistleblower, who‚Äôs been exposing the harmful practices of Scientology for years through his YouTube channel and online magazine, '**Scientology Business'**.
* **Why**: We‚Äôre here to peacefully protest against the **human rights abuses, family separation, harassment, and coercive practices** that have been going on behind Scientology‚Äôs closed doors.

Last year‚Äôs protest drew **46 people**, but this year it will be a bit different as we are not looking to creating any havoc or mess, we simply want to educate people on the trust behind the Church. Let‚Äôs send a message loud and clear to those trapped inside the organization: **We are here for you, and help is available.**

# Why You Should Be There:

* **Scientology‚Äôs abuse MUST STOP**. This isn‚Äôt about attacking people‚Äôs beliefs ‚Äì it‚Äôs about exposing the systemic abuse, harassment, and exploitation that happens behind the scenes.
* We‚Äôre protesting peacefully but **making our voices heard**. Public protests have already resulted in many people learning about organizations like the **Aftermath Foundation**, which helps people escape Scientology.
* **David Miscavige**, Scientology‚Äôs elusive leader, is expected to attend ‚Äì this protest will grab his attention like never before.
* **Raise awareness** with us on the **40th anniversary** of the International Association of Scientologists event, which gathers thousands of parishioners from across Europe (Usually all the Sea Organization members and staff are the one that are coming to this event, plus some known figures). We need to **show the world what‚Äôs really going on** in this cult-like organization.

Want to help out even more? Consider donating to help with organizing costs via [Buy Me a Coffee ](https://buymeacoffee.com/apostatealex)‚Äì every bit helps to spread the message and make this protest as big as possible!

**Register to Attend**: If you're ready to make a stand, register [here](https://www.iasprotest.com/). Even if you can‚Äôt attend in person, you can tune into the **live stream on YouTube** at [youtube.com/@apostatealex](youtube.com/@apostatealex).

Let‚Äôs make history and expose the truth about Scientology‚Äôs abuses together. Your voice matters ‚Äì let‚Äôs make this protest EPIC!

I am using a level 25 Chrominius pet with Arcane Explosion to pretty much solo all 5 daily quests and have 1 alt parked at each of the trainers at all times. 1 Horde for Dagra the Fierce in Northern Barrens and 4 Alliances for the other 4 trainers- Bill Buckler in The Cape of Stranglethorn near Booty Bay, Old MacDonald in Westfall, Lindsay in Redridge Mountains and Eric Davidson in Duskwood. It takes about 5 minutes to complete each daily quest a day with a total of slightly under 59 days for 70-80 which makes about 24 and a half hours. It's a great way to level some alts which classes you hate leveling for XX reasons or even for leveling a Neutral Pandaren on the Wandering Isle.

If you‚Äôre like me and want to buy American-made, here are the key brands and what they offer:

Whirlpool is the big one here. Based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, they‚Äôre the largest American appliance manufacturer, and they produce a lot of their fridges right here in the U.S. Models like the WRB322DMBM bottom freezer are assembled domestically, and Whirlpool is known for energy efficiency and user-friendly designs. I found that many of their fridges hit the sweet spot of quality and affordability.

Another great option is Maytag, which, like Whirlpool, has a strong history in American manufacturing. Most of their refrigerators are assembled in Amana, Iowa. Models like the MFF2558FEZ are super popular for good reason‚Äîthey have high-quality components and come at competitive prices.

Then there‚Äôs GE (General Electric), one of the oldest names in the game. They‚Äôve been making appliances since 1899, and they still manufacture many of their refrigerators in the U.S., particularly in their Louisville, Kentucky facility. Their top-freezer and French door models are made domestically, and some even come with cool features like built-in coffee makers. Who doesn‚Äôt love that?

For those looking for something more high-end, Sub-Zero is the name to know. Almost all of their refrigerators are made in the U.S., and they focus heavily on food preservation technology. If you‚Äôre willing to invest in a premium fridge that‚Äôs all about keeping your food fresh for longer, Sub-Zero‚Äôs luxury models won‚Äôt disappoint.

On the luxury side, I also found Thermador, which assembles their refrigerators in California. They‚Äôre perfect for anyone who‚Äôs serious about their kitchen and cooking, offering features designed for culinary enthusiasts. Similarly, Viking manufactures all of its professional-grade fridges in the U.S., focusing on high performance.

Lastly, I came across Frigidaire, which isn‚Äôt fully American-made, but some of their models are assembled in South Carolina. Just be sure to double-check the model before buying, as many are still produced overseas.

Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a fridge made in the USA, you‚Äôve got a lot of options‚Äîjust make sure you verify the model‚Äôs origins, as some brands source components globally but assemble them domestically. Supporting American manufacturing is definitely possible, it just takes a bit of research!",1,1729687989.0,itsmadeinusa,0,1.0,False

I even asked it - how do you know I am not leading you to agree with me and it responded why not based on earlier conversations. 

I have had a therapist before and never liked it. They have their biases and prejudices. But some like me who has learned to be hypervigilant and hyper aware of people around me from an early age can see right through.

KO Revenue of $11.9B (-0.8% YY) beats by $290M. Organic Revenues (Non-GAAP) Grew 9%.

Revenue performance included 10% growth in price/mix and a 2% decline in concentrate sales. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments.

**Full Year 2024**

For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include a 1% to 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. ‚Äî No Update

Key Takeaways:

Organic sales shine again Organic revenue rose 11% during the quarter vs a 9.3% consensus estimate, with unit case volume up +2% and Latin America up +12%. The organic sales growth outpaced PepsiCo's 9.3% mark in a recently completed period. Unit case volume was down 1% for Coca-Cola globally during the quarter, with growth led by Brazil, the Philippines and Japan but more than offset by declines in China and T√ºrkiye.

North America outperforms Unit case volume in North America showed flat growth in trademark Coca-Cola products, while water, sports, coffee and other beverages saw mixed results. Price/mix grew 11%, driven by favorable mix and pricing actions in the marketplace. Operating income grew 10%, benefiting from organic revenue growth.

Margins march higher Consolidated comparable operating margin rose 90 basis points to 29.7% in the period. This improvement was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and restructuring bottling operations, partially offset by currency headwinds.

My husband bought the barista touch a couple of months ago and has been learning a lot about making coffee since. However, one issue that has not been resolved for me, is that every time he makes me coffee (I do not know how to use the machine) it tastes really acid/bitter (don‚Äôt know is these can be compared but I am not very well versed). 

He doesn‚Äôt mind the taste, but I think he just became used to it. However I seriously cannot drink anything from that machine because it tastes acid like. He has tried adjusting the temperature, change coffee roast, coffee type, etc. and I still taste it. When I get a coffee from a shop I NEVER experience that flavor. 

Is it me? Is it the machine? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the coffee since he‚Äôs bought 15 different types and tried them all. We‚Äôre at a loss.

The trees outside my office are all without leaves now. I guess this is where I'm expected to say something about how fast and sudden the time goes or so, but if anything, I'm more aware of time.

...*<sits down with you and a coffee>*... I mean, it makes sense, right? ...*<nods with his chin to you>*... Think back to those childhood summers. How long did they last? One lifetime? Two? A really long time, right? And when they were over, you have but a very, very faint notion of that another summer would come by. And if you had that clear notion, you had no clear idea how far away in time that might be.

...*<sips some coffee, looks out of the window>*... Now, I know. I see Summer arrive and I bathe in its never ending length, knowing it will reluctantly pass into Autumn, with Autumn lulling us into a false sense of continuity by providing us some really nice, warm days.

No, time doesn't go faster or more sudden. In some ways, when you're aware of the span of time to pass, the years can feel shorter, but that's just a psychological trick; when we look back, the mind remembers some peaks, some valleys, and not much of the folding of laundry in between. I *know* how long the days can be, both in the richest as well as most annoying sense.

The best thing about growing older is curiosity, I think. Enough things have happened to me that I really didn't want to have happen to me, and somehow consequently enough things have happened to me I didn't know I wanted to have happen to me or didn't expect. One of *the* best things to have happened in my life lead to me making one of *the* best decisions I've made in my life, but both would not have happened but for two of the crappiest things to have happened in my life.

...*<shakes head>*... And I am *definitely* not saying things happen ""for a reason"" or bulls...erm....nonsense like that. Just that sometimes, looking back, you see that the only way you could have gotten to point Z is by going through points A, B, C, etc.

And so I'm curious to see what life brings. I know some of it will suck; good and bad days are as certain as the changing seasons. But I'm curious to see how those things unfold. While remaining human and having worries about all kinds of ""what if's"", there is a more peaceful curiosity. The certainty that things will change, makes change less jarring while providing the comfort of knowing jarring change will, in turn, change as well.

* Love, Dad

My ex partner made me feel insufficient in the multiple times he broke up with me. We lived together for 7 years.

For context, I actually made a list of the good things I did throughout the relationship, to help convince myself I did enough. I always ended up bashing myself thinking I did everything wrong. I obviously am not perfect, made mistakes like every human and most importantly I tried to work on myself to improve the relationship.


Me

* Deep cleaned the house weekly. This included washing our bed sheets and towels.

*Washed, ironed, hung and folded his clothes weekly too. I also organised his drawers which were always a mess. 

*Planning dates. I was the one who always took the time to research a nice place for our date and booked it. For valentines, anniversaries, my birthdays, his birthdays, etc.

*Planned trips. Researching for ticket prices, doing the itinerary, searching for restaurants, hotels and booking everything.

*I was always the one with the ideas of buying his mum or sister flowers or presents for their birthdays or special dates. If there were family events with his family I would be the one to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs bring a cake, or wine, or food or let‚Äôs offer to help‚Äù

*Always wrapping even MY own Christmas presents, every year. 

*This one is a bit funny. I had the idea to start ‚ÄúLadies night‚Äù for him. It meant we both got in our pajamas,  put on a movie and I did his nails ( hands and feet) his eyebrows, facial mask and oftentimes cooked for him.  We did it quite often. But this was not for me, it was for him.

*Always took care of him when he was sick. I would bring him food to bed, made herbal teas, went to buy medicines for him. I became a caretaker.

*Most of the time I would book his doctors appointments.

*He suffered from anxiety so I would remind him to take his medicines as he was inconsistent a lot. I also suggested him to start therapy to manage his panic attacks and anxiety but he never did.

*I would have to sometimes remind him to take a shower if he wanted intimacy. He knew it was a turnoff for me that he didn‚Äôt shower for a couple of days in a row and then ask for sex. Same with brushing his teeth.

*At the beginning of our relationship, I was SO I love that I supported him for a long time when he was made redundant from his job at the time. This was when we weren‚Äôt living together. I helped pay for his rent, his food, coffees/drinks when going out, drove him and picked him up from interviews and when he got a job I still would drive him and pick him up. Mind you, I was working as a delivery driver in a small petrol scooter , I was an immigrant living in his home country.

Him


*Most of the time did the cooking 

*He helped me a lot while I was navigating through depression and I was not medicated. He became my rock and he was basically one of my only companions in this country. It had been quite difficult for me to make friends here and that combined with being far from family and from feeling a bit unhappy in general here. I had to do hard jobs like cleaning and delivering food while my visa situation was restricted. He also didn‚Äôt have friends so we became quite codependent. But it meant that he carried that weight of trying to make me happy a lot and viceversa.

* He was financially generous. Also  VERY generous with presents!
Even when I eventually got better jobs he would support me ( without me asking for anything) in ways like buying me lunches, or helping me pay a bill, or whatever it was. But I NEVER depended on him for anything ‚Äî all that help came from his own heart. Also worth to mention that I was still on a visa with work restrictions, I also didn‚Äôt have a degree and he had a professional job with 2 degrees, so our pay was quite different but I always contributed 50/50, even if he earned much more than me. 

* We would both go to buy groceries, so that was ok because it was a mutual effort.

*He helped me setup my cleaning business and helped with the marketing and admin part. Forever grateful for that.

*He‚Äôd hear me complain a lot because my job was physically demanding and I feel like I was the negative vibe - also while I was  battling with depression at the same time and feeling quite lonely.




I know ‚ÄúHis‚Äù list is  short compared to mine . And that does not mean he didn‚Äôt do enough for me. Just the things I mention are quite significant and big ! I actually appreciated everything he did because he was my rock and my safe place. And I believe I always expressed that to him. But I also believe everything I did was invisible. To this day, I keep thinking I‚Äôm the biggest piece of shit that didn‚Äôt give or do enough and I keep punishing myself for that. Even when I think about everything and read the list I made, it doesn‚Äôt make sense in my head. Am I being too hard on myself?

It was the weekend now, much to Adam's surprise. His first week at Cyrus sped by in the blink of an eye. Whether it was the constant chaos and fighting around the school or the culture shock that made it that way, he didn't know.

Frankly, alien society was eerily similar to human society in some aspects. Same drama, same saturation of media with ads; too many other things to count. But what shocked Adam was how *extreme* some things were.

He recalled when he saw a poster advertising a 'ball sports' club at school‚Äîin which Adam was interested as he didn't have any extracurriculars and the club seemed to have some things he was familiar with.

Adam went to the pitch where they were playing listed in the poster. Only to find smouldering craters and destruction all over the pitch. Apparently, they used their powers while they played, leading to multiple hospitalisations per match. He ran off as fast as he could when a club member covered in bandages approached him a little too enthusiastically.

""Ugh..."" Groaned Adam, bored out of his mind.

Adam slumped his head back on the headrest of the couch; he then turned his head to gaze at the desert outside.

He was hanging out at the Eastern Monolith as he had nothing to do except wait for his 'assistance' as said by his brother Samuel, but in actuality, he hadn't actually done anything to curb his boredome yet, as most of the girls had left to do *something*, leaving him and CiCi behind.

Adam and CiCi sat on a couch adjacent to the dining area with a large screen behind a coffee table facing them.

CiCi wasn't exactly the most proactive about having fun or engaging in conversation, so Adam had no one to talk to and nothing to do.

Said girl was sleeping next to him, curled up into a ball. Seeing her like this really accentuated her feline features. Absently, he reached for her head and began petting the sleeping girl. In the silence, Adam swore that he heard CiCi purr much like how a cat would‚Äîthe petting roused the girl from her slumber, and Adam watched as she slowly opened her deep yellow eyes and let out a yawn.

CiCi looked up towards Adam, a piercing, predatory gaze replacing her usual tired expression. Her two tails stiffening up and pointing up in the air.

That was when Adam remembered that CiCi was an alien, not a house cat.

""Ah!"" Was all Adam got out as he hastily withdrew his hand; he messed up.

""I-I'm so sorry!"" He stammered, waving his hands in front of him frantically. CiCi really looked like a predator, something he only noticed in this moment. Did her lethargic demeanour hide it from him?

*""Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Shit! What the heck! Why did I do that??""* Panicked Adam in a cold sweat, *""What is she going to do!?""*

CiCi opened her mouth, revealing a sharp row of teeth. The action led Adam to descend into more and more panicking, *""NO!""* Adam screamed internally, '*""Is she going to maul me??""*

But contrary to Adam's conclusion, CiCi's gaze softened and relaxed as she asked, ""Why... did you stop?""

""Huh?"" Asked Adam in an incredulous look on his face, her soft voice was not what he expected, ""Stop? Stop what?""

""Rubbing my head."" Said CiCi, ""It feels... nice.""

""You want me to keep petting you...?"" Asked Adam.

CiCi paused, as if the words were unfamiliar to her; it was a painstaking silence before she answered.

""Yes."" Confirmed CiCi, ""Please do.""

""Really?""

""Yes.""

Adam was at a loss for words, so he silently brought his hand back down on the catgirls head and began petting once more. It was strange how CiCi seemed to enjoy it; stranger still, how she seemed to lean into his hand with every stroke.

Looking for other forms of entertainment‚Äîand also hoping to make the situation less awkward for himself‚ÄîAdam sifted through the mess of junk and trinkets scattered across the coffee table, hoping to find the remote for the TV. After a while of searching, he uncovered the remote from the pile. He pressed a few buttons before the TV flashed on. He began to search through the enormous list of shows.

The alien channels were either too bland or too extreme for his taste, and some were just downright weird. Adam shuddered when a particularly bizarre channel came on and quickly flicked to the next one.

Finally, he landed on a channel that piqued his interest; it was called 'StarshipBrawls: Galactic Tournament.'

""That's a good show."" Muttered CiCi, voice barely above a whisper, ""Let's watch it.""

""What's it about?"" Asked Adam.

""Basically, it's an all-out starship brawl..."" Explained CiCi.

""Okay..."" mumbled Adam, he should've known from the title.

The over-the-top intro came and went, transitioning into a backdrop of empty space.

Until it was lit up by hundreds of ships entering the system.

It was a radiant mess, as there were a myriad of FTL methods used. The result was a mess of exotic particles being spewed outward uncontrollably, racking against an invisible barrier that prevented the violent and chaotic streams from reaching the camera. Several ships had already imploded or collided with other, larger vessels. And as soon as the announcer began speaking, all of the remaining ships sped outwards in all directions simultaneously while also firing at each other.

'Huh?"" Blurted Adam, not expecting the sudden start.

""I know, hard to call it a 'tournament.'"" Said CiCi offhandedly, followed by explosions on screen, ""But whatev's, at least it's cool as fuck.""

...

""What are you two watching?"" Asked Lyra, leaning over the couch. She was intrigued by the scene playing on the screen in front of her.

Adam was started by their sudden entrance, quickly pulling a hand away from CiCi's head, hoping no one saw.

""Lyra! You're back!"" Adam half-shouted, twirling around to meet her. The show was about halfway through, and only a handful of dangerous-looking ships remained.

""Oh. Is this that one ship tournament?"" Added Kida, a large cardboard box in hand.

""Yeah,"" confirmed Kaala, ""too bad the same ones win all the time.""

""So what did you guys do while you were gone?"" Asked Adam, curious as they left as soon as he'd arrived at the Eastern Monolith.

Lyra began to answer before pausing, seemingly thinking of the right way to word it: ""We took care of some *business.*""

Adam made no effort to pry any further, opting to return his attention back to the screen.

That is, until Sumamma impulsively shouted, ""We got back at those Crimson Zealots for targeting us last time!""

""Sumamma!"" Groaned Lyra, clearly shocked by her unexpected outburst.

""Huh? Why do we need to hide it? It's true, and plus you seemed to really enjoy it."" Questioned Kaala, adjusting her glasses.

Kida chirped in, ""Yeah. We got the real good this time.""

""You guys! Ugh- well... Never mind that, we also-"" Stuttered Lyra, embarrassed and irritated.

""Ohh! Lookie!"" Interrupted Sumamma, pointing at the screen and drawing the groups attention to what was happening.

The announcer's attention was drawn to something outside the camera's view. Inciting whatever was broadcasting the video to turn towards what shocked them so greatly.

Space warped inwards, and a white glow began to pour out of the holes in space until a sudden flash blinded the screen. After a few painstaking moments, something emerged from the blinding light.

It was a ship.

The greyish vessel was composed of two rectangular blocks, one much longer and larger than the other. It's backside was uneven and had a cubic shape; it was where most of the antennae, comm arrays, and miscellaneous components jutted out seemingly at random. It had irregular, mostly hexagonal and triangular plating with dark gaps in between.

The group expressed their confusion at the sudden appearance, except Adam, who had a look of recognition on his face, which Lyra noticed.

""Adam, do you know what that is?"" Prodded Lyra, raising an eyebrow.

""I have an inkling, I think."" He answered.

""Well?"" Lyra continued.

""Well-"" Adam

Adam was about to answer when a voice cut him off; it came from the TV.

*""Comm link established, Captain.""* Reported a voice to an unseen superior.

*""Hello? Is this thing working right?""* Came another voice carrying a weight of authority, waiting until murmurs of confirmation answered him before they continued, *""Alien tech is so weird... It took hours to set up. Can't we just hail normally?""*

*""Protocol, Sir.""* Came the previous voice.

The captain let out a gruff sigh and complained, *""Really? It'll be a lot easier to at least have video footage... Ah! Where was I? Right, okay.""*

*""It's male by the sounds of it.""* Guessed Lyra, muttering in a low voice, simultaneously intrigued and weirded out by the voice's ramblings.

The captain's tone instantly changed from a relaxed one to one of practiced steadiness and clarity: *""This is Captain Kenne Hayeson of the TNSSS Peter Pan. On routine patrol, we have detected what we assume to be a pitched battle between unknown parties within Terra Firma Systems borders. Cease and withdraw, or we* ***will*** *intervene.""*

""Adam... Is that..."" Asked Lyra.

""Yeah, it's a human ship."" Answered Adam quickly.

A tense moment before a response came, coming from one of the battling ships, the reply was in a threatening accent that made it difficult to understand, *""I don't know who you are or what the hell a Terra Firma is. But I assume you are a new upstart species who know nothing about the galaxy. So I tell you this: Nobody cares! So buzz off back to wherever you came from before I blast your primitive ship into cosmic dust.""*

With that declaration, the Comm channel went dead.

The captain simply replied, *""Thread Carefully.""*

Following that, the alien ship, red and spiky, fired several plasma shots from it's spinal-mounted cannons at the TNSSS Peter Pan in indignation .

The globules of plasma sped towards the Peter Pan and collided with the ship's shields, harmlessly dissipating against them and only causing them to flicker slightly.

As the remnants of the volley disappeared, Captain Kenne replied over Comms with a steady voice and a slightly amused tone, *""Hostility confirmed. Retaliating, ready up, boys.""*

At that, weapon emplacements emerged from the Peter Pan's hull, swivelling around and calibrating before locking onto the offending ship. Crackling energy built up and thrummed within the barrels before launching slugs that crossed the space between the two ships in an instant, leaving a trail of superheated gas behind. The slugs easily penetrated the shield and hull of the enemy ship, causing it to explode violently.

In the aftermath, the remaining ships stopped engaging each other and began to position themselves to attack the human ship; they have found a common enemy, it seems.

Without any coordination, particle beams, missiles, and a dozen other armament's filled the void between the two parties. The TNSSS Peter Pan could be seen returning the volley with an equally large counterattack before the broadcast was abruptly terminated.

""Huh!? Why did it end? I wanted to see who'd win!"" Complained Sumamma, throwing her arms into the air. Her immersion was broken.

""It did seem exciting after all,"" said Kida.

*""This is how I get to see what human ships look like? On a dramatised TV show??""* thought Lyra, tuning out Sumamma's loud shouting.

Lyra let go of the thought with a sigh and turned to Adam.

""By the way, Adam, you said that was a human ship?"" Asked Lyra.

Lyra's question snapped Adam out of whatever thought he was having, causing him to frantically answer, ""Y-yeah!""

""What does TNSSS mean?"" Continued Lyra, noticing the use of the acronym before the ship's name.

""Means 'Terra Firma Systems Space Ship', I think."" Adam answered, unnerved by the confused looks the girls were giving him, ""You mean you guys don't use prefixes?""

""We don't."" Stated Lyra bluntly, ""What ship was that?""

""Well, uh- it *kind of* looked like a cruiser... but I don't know much about ships so I'm not sure-"" Adam answered before he was cut off by another question.

""And who was that just now?"" Interjected Lyra, overly excited, ""Kenne Hey Son? Hay Son?""

""Er, yeah, I think that was his name-""

""What was that white light?""

""I don't kno-""

""What are those guns that popped out of the ship??""

""I don-""

""Adam, why do your naval officers speak like that?"" Asked Lyra, subconsciously taking steps towards Adam.

""Huh? How would I know?"" Adam retorted, getting slightly agitated by the bombardment of questions: ""Why are you asking so many questions? Can we at least calm down a bit?""

Lyra moved closer towards Adam, a little too close for his comfort. She began to open her mouth but was cut off when Adam interrupted her; he retorted with frustrated shout:

""Why the **hell** would you need to know!? Are you obsessed with information or something!??"" Adam shouted, letting go of the pent-up stress from the past week.

Adam and Lyra stared at each other in silence‚ÄîAdam genuinely not wanting to talk.

Lyra looked ready to reply, a look of shock and anger flashing across her face before it quickly changed to one of dejected realisation. She stepped back, her posture slumping slightly as she rubbed her arm.

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, Kida changed the topic by walking around the couch, sweeping the junk off the coffee table, and dropping the box she had been carrying the whole time on it. Causing a loud thunk and bringing the other's attention to her.

Sumamma, energetic as always, sped towards the box and began to run her hands over it and asked with curiosity, ""What's this?""

""Some guy gave it to me on the way back here, saying it was food. But I'm starting to think that's not the case."" She explained, ignoring the confused stares the others were giving her.

""A random person gave you a box, and you just... took it...?"" Said Adam in disbelief, but happy that someone brought the groups attention elsewhere. The girls did some strange things, but this was just...

""Irresponsible!"" Bellowed Lyra, seemingly glad as well for the distraction, ""Don't you remember the last time we accepted an anonymous package!?""

""It was a bomb. Well, yeah. But the person who gave it to me..."" Droned Kida, ""Had the same vibes as you.""

Kida pointed to Adam, who then pointed to himself with a look of bewilderment on his face.

""...What?"" He panned.

""Kida, what do you mean?"" Asked Lyra, ""And what vibes?""

Kida rubbed her chin as she thought of an answer: ""You know how, if someone is a powerful enough Esper, even a non-Esper can 'feel' their power. Like with Mr Stribog or Ms Holt. The guy who gave this to me.""

Kida patted the cardboard box.

""Was like that too; it was like I was drawn to him."" She continued, ""As for vibes, for one, he talked like Adam, and I think he said something about you too.""

""Huh? What did he say?"" Asked Adam, he already had a feeling of who it could be.

Kida cleared her throat and began speaking in a cheery voice that was unexpected.

""Hey! You? Yeah you! Here, have this box! Now, don't look so surprised; I'm just a friendly stranger! Ha ha, also, by the way, can you pass this message on to a certain white-haired boy? Alright? Nice\~ *hphm-ngh*""

Kida even cleared her throat. Supposedly the same way the person she was imitating did.

""Adam, here's the thing I told you about: it has all the stuff you need to live for the time being. Anyways! Good luck! Also, antenna girl, bye bye!"" Recited Kida.

Adam looked amazed, not expecting her to say it word for word, even imitating the cheery voice he knew so well. He sighed as he asked, ""Okay, did you see where he went?""

""No."" said Kida.

With a pause, Adam had an indecisive look on his face before he turned to Lyra and said, ""Alright, it's safe to open.""

With that confirmation, Sumamma tore open the box without waiting for Lyra's say. Adam watched as bits of cardboard flew around.

Prying Sumamma off the box with a little effort, Adam viewed the contents within.

Inside were various essentials, snacks, and assorted trinkets packed loosely. There was also a black case hidden beneath the smaller objects. Brushing aside the cardboard pieces left by Sumamma, Adam reached inside and, after a bit of rummaging, pulled it out.

It was the size of his arm‚Äîa little longer, maybe. Adam inspected it by rotating it around.

""What is that?"" Asked Lyra hesitantly.

There was a silence that felt a little too long before Adam replied, ""...Haven't got a clue, how do you even open this?""

Adam played around with the 8-digit locking mechanism to no avail, until he noticed a yellow sticky note stuck to the back of the case. Adam pulled it off and read the messy letters written in black Sharpie:

*Your birthday.*

*-Sam*

Adam sighed as he input the numbers: 10102884

The case clicked open, revealing a sleek, bronze coloured rifle and multiple cartridges. The body of the rifle was streamlined and also had a precision-engineered barrel with an integrated scope.

There something written on the side of the gun, upon closer inspection, it read 'Peacekeeper'.

Adam let the fact that there was a rifle in front of him sink in.

""But I don't know how to use a gun!"" He cried.

i last night i tried my ceramic hand roaster for the first time and it was a really fun and cool experience full of great aromas. the effort it took and the coffee it produced however, just wont work for me. the lack of consistency and accuracy (without essentially training to use it by feel over a long period) were also massive pain points. 


i was looking at used roasters late last night trying to find a good value and i sawem a used M1 listed in my area for $1,200. i didnt know how much they retail for so i looked it up... they're on sale for $699 with limited availability. it was too late to do any deep research but i didnt want to miss out if they went out of stock and the price goes back up. i decided to just sleep on it and check when i first woke up if they're still in stock and if they were, i would order. so now i've bought it, but i have way less knowledge of the thing than i normally would.

i was hoping yall could offer me some perspective... 

-did i get a good deal?

-are there any known issues with this roaster?

-any owners with advice or info about quirks i should expect from the machine?

-are there any important questions im forgetting to ask?

We lived together for 7 years.

For context, I actually made a list of the good things I did throughout the relationship, to help convince myself I did enough. I always ended up bashing myself thinking I did everything wrong. I obviously am not perfect, made mistakes like every human and most importantly I tried to work on myself to improve the relationship.


Me

* Deep cleaned the house weekly. This included washing our bed sheets and towels.

*Washed, ironed, hung and folded his clothes weekly too. I also organised his drawers which were always a mess. 

*Planning dates. I was the one who always took the time to research a nice place for our date and booked it. For valentines, anniversaries, my birthdays, his birthdays, etc.

*Planned trips. Researching for ticket prices, doing the itinerary, searching for restaurants, hotels and booking everything.

*I was always the one with the ideas of buying his mum or sister flowers or presents for their birthdays or special dates. If there were family events with his family I would be the one to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs bring a cake, or wine, or food or let‚Äôs offer to help‚Äù

*Always wrapping even MY own Christmas presents, every year. 

*This one is a bit funny. I had the idea to start ‚ÄúLadies night‚Äù for him. It meant we both got in our pajamas,  put on a movie and I did his nails ( hands and feet) his eyebrows, facial mask and oftentimes cooked for him.  We did it quite often. But this was not for me, it was for him.

*Always took care of him when he was sick. I would bring him food to bed, made herbal teas, went to buy medicines for him. I became a caretaker.

*Most of the time I would book his doctors appointments.

*He suffered from anxiety so I would remind him to take his medicines as he was inconsistent a lot. I also suggested him to start therapy to manage his panic attacks and anxiety but he never did.

*I would have to sometimes remind him to take a shower if he wanted intimacy. He knew it was a turnoff for me that he didn‚Äôt shower for a couple of days in a row and then ask for sex. Same with brushing his teeth.

*At the beginning of our relationship, I was SO I love that I supported him for a long time when he was made redundant from his job at the time. This was when we weren‚Äôt living together. I helped pay for his rent, his food, coffees/drinks when going out, drove him and picked him up from interviews and when he got a job I still would drive him and pick him up. Mind you, I was working as a delivery driver in a small petrol scooter , I was an immigrant living in his home country.

Him


*Most of the time did the cooking 

*He helped me a lot while I was navigating through depression and I was not medicated. He became my rock and he was basically one of my only companions in this country. It had been quite difficult for me to make friends here and that combined with being far from family and from feeling a bit unhappy in general here. I had to do hard jobs like cleaning and delivering food while my visa situation was restricted. He also didn‚Äôt have friends so we became quite codependent. But it meant that he carried that weight of trying to make me happy a lot and viceversa.

* He was financially generous. Also  VERY generous with presents!
Even when I eventually got better jobs he would support me ( without me asking for anything) in ways like buying me lunches, or helping me pay a bill, or whatever it was. But I NEVER depended on him for anything ‚Äî all that help came from his own heart. Also worth to mention that I was still on a visa with work restrictions, I also didn‚Äôt have a degree and he had a professional job with 2 degrees, so our pay was quite different but I always contributed 50/50, even if he earned much more than me. 

* We would both go to buy groceries, so that was ok because it was a mutual effort.

*He helped me setup my cleaning business and helped with the marketing and admin part. Forever grateful for that.

*He‚Äôd hear me complain a lot because my job was physically demanding and I feel like I was the negative vibe - also while I was  battling with depression at the same time and feeling quite lonely.




I know ‚ÄúHis‚Äù list is  short compared to mine . And that does not mean he didn‚Äôt do enough for me. Just the things I mention are quite significant and big ! I actually appreciated everything he did because he was my rock and my safe place. And I believe I always expressed that to him. But I also believe everything I did was invisible. To this day, I keep thinking I‚Äôm the biggest piece of shit that didn‚Äôt give or do enough and I keep punishing myself for that. Even when I think about everything and read the list I made, it doesn‚Äôt make sense in my head. Am I being too hard on myself? I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore üò¢ This breakup has destroyed me and I‚Äôm not doing well.

Maybe you'll squeeze in a yoga session before heading out for a coffee date with friends. Later, you might browse the new collection at Zara & pick up something you've been eyeing. Once in 2-3 months - a weekend getaway to Goa, a trek in the Himalayas. Weekends are for exploring - a family dinner at that new restaurant everyone's raving about. Oh, and don't forget that annual international trip - Europe this year?

I had a chai latte this morning, and then my coworker invited me to get coffee at this *incredible* little shop this afternoon, and I want to go and get Hong Kong milk tea there, which has sweetened condensed milk in it

1ga91ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ga91ka/pain_description/,Pain Description ,"Hi everyone. I'm a 42.5 year old Canadian female and I think I have gastritis. I cant see my dr until mid-November. I have abdominal pain that started early September, shortly after going back to college. I told my dr about it when I met with her mid-Sept for another issue, and she said she thought stress from going back to school coupled with the change in routine may have triggered IBS/constipation (I was a little backed up at the time which is new to me- which is why I mentioned it. That part has since resolved) and we'd revisit again at our November appointment. 

I am still having the abdominal pain, however, I'm having a very hard time qualifying it. Sometimes it's on my right, lower side, sometimes it goes to my flank and/or back. Sometimes it's just my epigastric area around my stomach. Sometimes it is all over, lower abdomen, hip to hip. It moves but it's mostly always constant. It can be 1/10 pain up to 5/10 and seems to get worse after I eat. While it started as right sided pain (I thought maybe ovarian cyst) it's now 90% settled in the stomach areas. PPIs seem to help a little but don't resolve the pain 100% everyday. Coffee and chocolate make it worse I think. The pain feels sharp and dull at the same time. It feels tense or strained like I've done a very intense ab workout when I haven't. Sometimes I get specific sharp pain directly beside my belly button on the right. The lower abdominal pain feels like my muscles are strained or ripping, sometimes it's short, isolated sharp pains. My stomach feels raw inside- like it's been run over a cheese grater a few times. Maybe that's the burning people talk about? Sometimes movement like twisting or hitting a bump in the car makes it worse.

Like I say, I have a hard time putting my finger on it. It's a very odd set of sensations. My gallbladder was removed over a decade ago so it's not gallstones.

I am getting quite worried that it's something more sinister like cancer as I have two children that still need me at this point. I have had no significant weight loss, fever, night sweats, extreme fatigue, unusual bleeding or bruising, shortness of breath, I'm not pale or anything. It's the persistent pain that's concerning me. 

I am hoping someone can relate and is willing to respond with their experience. How does your pain feel? Is it all over like mine? What helps? Is six weeks uncommon to feel like this? 

I really appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

TLDR- my stomach has been hurting for 6 weeks. Having a hard time describing where, why and what the feeling is. Help!",1,1729685638.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
