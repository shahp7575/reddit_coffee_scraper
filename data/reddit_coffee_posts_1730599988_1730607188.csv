>Trump is in big trouble, y’all.

>I was helping my uncle fix his old tractor out on his farm in the middle of nowhere—real heartland country, the kind of place where everyone’s got a pickup, a rifle, and a deep love for apple pie. After we wrapped up, we swung by the local diner, the kind of joint where the waitresses call you “hon” and the coffee’s always brewing.

>They had the news on, and there was Kamala Harris giving a speech. Suddenly, old Joe, the retired Navy vet who usually grumbles about “big government,” leaned over to his buddy who runs the local bait shop and said, “You know, she’s got some grit. Economy’s picking up, the world’s taking us seriously again. Might just punch the ticket for her this time.”

>You could’ve knocked me over with a feather. Around the room, all I saw were nodding heads and heard a couple of “You got that right” from the usual crowd. Even the grizzled rancher who’s been wearing the same John Deere hat since ’85 gave a slow, thoughtful nod as he sipped his coffee.

I don't know of many influence campaigns in the U.S. that are pro-Kamala. Their comment history has a couple of comments suggesting they like to troll liberals.  Possibly this is a campaign intended to encourage leaning-Kamala voters to become complacent, and not to vote at all, but I also wouldn't be surprised also if it's just a troll with no morecoherent a motivation than to get a rise out of people.",1,1730607081.0,ActiveMeasures,0,1.0,False

1giequw,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1giequw/looking_for_recommendations_as_if_you_were/,Looking for recommendations as  if you were starting from scratch,"Looks like the guy who handles the networking and infrastructure for our small business shared office may be moving out and its on me to come up with a new system. I'm looking for recommendations on what you all would do if you had the opportunity to start from scratch today. Our current system is a hodgepodge of things that have been pieced together throughout the years and as I've started my own homelab journey, the in office system network and infrastructure has started to bother me more and more. The general idea is that i can either leave it like it is because it ""works"" or i can roll something from scratch and actually solve some of the issues we have that we just found workarounds for.



so to start this is our current rack config. as pieced together by years of someone with a credit card and half an idea of what they were doing going to Ubiquiti's website and hitting purchase.

**current system(**rough estimates as I'm not in front of it and i cant remember all of it off the top of my head.

Ubiquiti dream machine acting as router, Nas for cameras and security stuff

Ubiquiti enterprise hi-capacity aggregation switch for 10G out to workstations, NAS, and render farm nodes.

Ubiquiti 48-way something or other for all other hard wire networking in the space. not entirely populated but not far off

Ubiquiti circle shaped wifi antennae spread throughout the office. not sure on models but they're up there in the ceiling.

A handful of security cameras all Ubiquiti flavored in some way or another.

Synology Nas systems : 2 for us, 1 for another business. connected via 10G. I believe they fall more into the backup systems category from Synology than actual high availability network storage, but we use it like its high availability network attached storage. Not sure exactly what our config is at the moment, they were already here when i joined the company. But knowing my business partner and the fact that he's been buying refurbished HD's off of amazon to populate them, I'm positive its probably not setup for our best use case.

Single compute server running a few VM's for various services related to video production and render farm management. This one is my baby and runs all the things that make my life so much easier on a daily basis. Its currently a truenas system running on an old Ubiquiti nvr that someone was going to ewaste. Its not much but it has enough to run a handful of Linux VM's to host the software we need to manage our render farm delegation software. I wouldn't mind upgrading this dude to an actual compute machine and not just a repurposed video recorder.

GPU Render farm nodes: 4 heavy compute servers with GPU. currently one is in an actual server chassis while the rest are in old mac G5 tower cases laying on there side supported by a rack shelf. i know you either love it or hate it. i gave up on trying to get rid of them years ago.

battery backup of some kind that does manage to keep the important things on.

  
current file access from out of network is: Google drive :( i hate it so much and i wish i could just install tailscale and be done with it. But my business partner set up the Nas's and loves the google drive integration so its here to stay.





okay now for what the daily requirements are:

  
max users at any one time: 10ish

10GB networking for backup storage, high availability storage, 4x render farm GPU machines, and at least 3 workstation editing bays for video content creation. So in total i think we need like minimum 10 10GB users at all times. Love for more as we grow.

max devices on the system at any one time: 150-200 (Im estimating but once you take into consideration cameras, Office TV's, entertainment and office media stuff, the dang coffee machine, its starts to add up.

Price and power draw are definitely in consideration when making choices for what we should get, I don't mind getting my hands dirty with terminal and ipmi control of switches and such if i dont have to pay a premium just to get a ubiquiti user interface. Its nice, and ive enjoyed being able to look up whos plugged into what based on IP's because nothing is labeled, but if theres cheaper 10G options than the UI Enterprise stuff Im all for it.

  
My Thoughts:

So i know enough to be dangerous but not enough to feel like im confident that i can make all the right choices and then end up in the exact same spot im in now with a lot of workarounds and pulling the rack out to swap cables around.

  
Storage: 

we have the two synology NAS's but as i said. I know they are more ""backup"" systems than they are high availability network storage. I'd love to have a smaller capacity cache server that handles current projects while both Synology boxes handle older and colder storage. I run an Unraid server in my actual homelab and I love being able to write and read from a cache that then gets moved and pulled from the array on a schedule. Unsure if Synology has this feature or if it would make more sense to use a third machine to act as this high availability cache.

  
Networking: Im familiar with Ubiquiti and thats about it. mainly from having to trouble shoot it non stop in the office. The guy who set it up loved the idea of having a bunch of VLans to segregate our traffic between companies sharing the space(which im not opposed to in any way btw) but when you have to spend 30 extra minutes pulling out the rack and checking which wire goes where because the port in our edit suite was moved to another VLan without anyone being notified gets real old real fast. Open to any and all options and ready to do my homework!

  
Compute and RenderFarm: This is a part of our business that im pretty happy with. I currently dont have a way to remote power on the farm but this is ""intentional"" due to us removing the networked power strip that was in there. I dont know why it was removed, but now the only way to access anything in that rack is to be standing in front of it. I'd love to flesh out a jump server and or add a VM that i can access remotely to my compute machine that i can send magic packets from. 

  
Security: This is the big one that noone seems to care about until its too late in our office. Both system and network security as well as physical cameras and all of that. The option that got brought up was nest cameras, so im also fighting the, we should have full control of all our data at all times, fight.

  
Any and all suggestions are very appreciated! Like I said, im happy to do my homework and am not looking for a ""do-it-for-me"" solution. just some pointers in the non-ubiquiti direction to get me started.

  
thanks!

1gieoee,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gieoee,How bad are my black triangles and gum recession? Is there anything I can do to fill in the space with gum tissue?,"I'm 22 years old and don't drink alcohol or smoke. I do drink coffee and soda regularly though. I do know I have gum recession but to what degree I’m not sure.

So I only really started to notice this recently but my black triangles are massive imo. I didn’t use to have them like a year or 2 ago but all of the sudden they’re here now. Is there anything I could do to like fill them in with gum tissue? I’ve looked into Bioclear but it looks so unnatural to me cuz the teeth look so long and square. I see mixed things bout papilla reconstruction. Some say papilla loss irreversible while others say a graft can help a bit. There’s a dental surgeon named W. Peter Nordland who says he can do surgery to add some tissue back but idk if it’s sketchy or not.

 Here’s a link to the page with his results: [https://www.oralplasticsurgery.com/papilla-reconstruction-case-studies.html](https://www.oralplasticsurgery.com/papilla-reconstruction-case-studies.html)

Please let me know if you can tell whether the surgery is legit and what options I have to fix this as this has become a pretty big insecurity of mine. The photo honestly doesn’t show just how big the gap is imo due to the blurriness but I think I shows how far the gum recession is. It sucks cuz my teeth had almost no gap 2 years ago and this guy not now do I realize this gap.

1gienhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1gienhl/i_am_too_immature_and_naive_to_pursue_relationship/,I am too immature and naive to pursue relationship,"I’m a 26-year-old man who feels childish socially and emotionally.

I’m often withdrawn, but even when I’m not, my conversations with others feel like teenagers’. I make dark jokes, use sarcasm, or just say whatever comes to mind. There’s no seriousness in my talk, no negativity, hate, or critique, except when I’m jokingly critiquing. I can’t talk about serious topics; it’s always a positive vibe, like YouTube videos.

I’m not someone you can trust. I look like an 18-year-old, but my personality is even worse. I’m like a child, and I don’t know how to grow up.

I’ve never been in a relationship or had sex, and I’m not mad about it, but I’m worried I may never. I have the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old.

I had a great high-paying job and now I’m going for further education, but I still feel like a child. I don’t feel proud of myself or stand up for myself. I can only see the positive side of people, but I recognize their negative actions. For example, I know a coworker can use information against me, so I set boundaries and be mindful of them, but I never talk about it with anyone, even my family or friends. I can’t say negative things about people. I see life in a simpler sense like a baby would. How would I handle this if I have kids and teach them life lessons if I can’t even digest it myself?

When I look at myself, I see that I can be entertaining at the coffee table, but that’s all. I can’t imagine a relationship with a girl because I don’t think I can commit or be responsible like an adult. I feel too naive for that, and as I age, I feel even more so because others have more experience. I don’t even try to date because I can’t handle it.

At this point, I feel depressed. I can provide emotional validation to others and talk about how they feel, but I stop doing it or don’t want to do it anymore because consciously or unconsciously I want to stay withdrawn and isolated, but cannot handle being lonely.

What should I do? I’ll go to therapy, but I want advice on how to behave maturely since therapist will also tell me how immature I am.",0,1730606634.0,TalkTherapy,2,0.5,False

1gieltg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gieltg/aitah_for_kicking_out_my_roommate_due_to_the/,AITAH for kicking out my roommate due to the state of her en-suite? ,"I (20 F) moved in with a roommate that was a good friend of mine, well call her Brit for the sake of the story (22 F) in march earlier this year. We signed a lease for 12 months but she was going to move out earlier to move in with her boyfriend so they can fight for custody of his 5 year old.

Brit ended up needing to move out long before she planned for that reason but she took herself off the lease and bond about 2 weeks before the move date. On the following Tuesday we had an inspection. I spent the entire weekend cleaning the house but at the end of Sunday there was still some rubbish of Brits big bags on our back porch, the garden needed to be weeded and the floors hadn’t been cleaned yet. She comes in at about 10pm and tells me point blank they’d change the inspection date. They hadn’t. 

Now I’m still not entirely sure what happened, if there was a miscommunication or if she lied to be spiteful because in that moment we hadn’t been getting along. She’s made some judgmental comments about everything from my clothes not being “appropriate” enough to the fact that I had my cats litter in the laundry and she “hadn’t done laundry in two weeks because of the smell” (I clean that litter DAILY and her two weeks of washing was two pairs of pants and four pairs of socks) so I had been flat out ignoring her but at 9am on Tuesday morning I got a message from our agents that they’ll be at the house at 10:45. I had to race home from work 20 minutes away and speed run the rest of the cleaning. 

I got it done in time and the agent was happy with most of the house but Brits room was messy and her en-suite was DISGUSTING. I’m talking breeding eco-systems disgusting. So much hair everywhere, the shower drawn looked like a drowned gremlin, mould in the grout, period products everywhere and writing on the mirror, I repeat SHE WROTE ON THE MIRROR OF A RENTAL. Since she was already off the lease after a long conversation the real estate agents allowed me to stay as long as the room was clean for the extra inspection they booked a week after she moves. 

In the name of being completely honest immediately after still high on anger I sent her a very nasty text message. It included things like “how fucking dare you” and “I wouldn’t come home I am so fucking mad at you” but that day I had therapy and I talked over what to do with my therapist and she encouraged me to ask her to leave so I did. I told her that she had access to the home from 9am-2pm on Saturday and that the keys needed to be in my hand by that time. 

Now I don’t think that that is unreasonable considering she put me and my home in danger and she already had somewhere to go but it’s resulted in a massive fight between her, her mother and me. We fought about a cleaning fee I told them I was taking out of her bond if the room wasn’t free saying that Brit did “all the cleaning in the home” which isn’t true. They threatened to call the police on me for “threatening her” and made up a story that she was “terrified of me”. Again, I admit in my original message I was nasty that’s entirely on me but Brit and I had been best friends before this they KNOW I would never hurt her it was genuinely all bullshit but I did yell at her so I walked into that one, and even accused me of ruining her mental health. I truly don’t know where any of that came from considering again WE WERE BEST FRIENDS A WEEK BEFORE THIS. It’s important to note the Brit blocked me so all correspondence of her moving had to go through her mother who just kept threatening me with lawyers and law enforcement when all I wanted was for Brit to pack her shit and go. 

Saturday came and I left the house so they could move in peace because at this point I wanted it to be over. And they proceeded to steal SO MUCH SHIT from me, canvases and art supplies, chargers, cleaning products, paper towel, all the toilet paper save for what was in my en-suite, glassware etc. her mother insisted it was an accident but I don’t believe you can accidentally take so much stuff that you know doesn’t belong to you? And then she started fighting me over cat scratches on her pleather couch and stains on the already filthy coffee table and missing items from a tea set I have never touched that belonged to Brit again threatening me with legal action. As a 40 year old woman. Talking to a 20 year old girl. When all I wanted was for her to move out quickly.  I ended up telling her that if she had receipts for the items I’d be happy to reimburse knowing that the pieces were so old there was no way and she backed off about that one. 

So AITA in this situation? I know I am for yelling at her originally I was just panicked because I almost lost my home but for everything else am I at fault? ",3,1730606473.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1giekjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1giekjb/job_hired_me_for_a_position_they_didnt_put_me_in/,"Job hired me for a position they didn’t put me in, and is denying any request for accommodations ","

I started a new job about two weeks ago, and originally applied and interviewed for a sous chef position.  i was told that position had been filled, but they had a “very similar” position they could offer me instead. I assumed by similar they meant a lower-level back of house management position in the kitchen. After signing, I was shown the actual place I would be managing, and it’s a convenience store with a small grill in the back. I have PTSD as well as an anxiety disorder, which i don’t disclose in the hiring process due to worries of discrimination, and it has never been an issue in the past as I only apply for and work jobs with minimal to no customer interaction, so it rarely causes issues that can’t fit within a later reasonable accommodation.

This is where I’m likely in the wrong- because the lag is very good, I didn’t complain and decided I would just give it a shot. A week and several flare ups that nearly resulted in a suicide attempt later, I asked if I could meet with HR to see about filing an ADA accommodation request and being moved to a position similar to the one I was hired for.  I do not have this in writing, but have text messages to my boss of right before I asked in person.  I went in for the meeting a few days ago, and it was so bad I almost quit on the spot- I was told that I knew exactly the job I was getting into (I didn’t, I was only told what my actual position was for the first time in the meeting), and that they could move me if i wanted, but my pay will have to be docked down to minimum wage, almost $10 below what I am being paid now.  I was told my request to file a request was denied because if I have issues being around customers, I would have the same issues with my coworkers. This assumption completely negates that my coworkers are people I’ll get to know, can set boundaries with, and, if they violate these boundaries, have actual recourse against.  I did not have the foresight to record the meeting.

In addition to the other issues, I’m not provided with parking, causing me to have to park about a mile away in not a great area. I get off after 1 am, and having to walk a mile in the middle of night absolutely doesn’t help my symptoms at all. It also turns my commute from a 15 minute drive to a whole ordeal that takes about an hour.

I’m back at work, and things have not gotten better. I am close to quitting, but need the income.  From talking to other coworkers, this is a very common practice here- one person I talked to was hired to work at a coffee shop on campus, and instead was put at the same place I work.

I’m not wanting to sue, I just want to know if there’s anything I can do to get them to actually file my accommodation request until I can get a new job.",4,1730606357.0,legaladvice,0,0.83,False

I work in a plot of land that has many buildings. I (then 22F) started as an intern 1.5 years ago and back then I shared an office room with several interns. We each have our own specific projects and mentors. Sometimes mentors would drop in to personally check in on work. The first time my friend Anna's mentor, Jack (33M), came in my jaw dropped because he was easily the most beautiful man I'd ever seen. Full head of silky hair, chiseled jaw, tall, jacked. When he left the room, I turned to Anna and said ""THAT'S your mentor? He's so handsome!"" The other female interns agreed. I was more surprised to learn that he's single. It wasn't a crush back then because it never occurred to me that I had a shot.

At the end of summer all the interns left except for me. This was when I first spoke to Jack. He came to collect Anna's things and we made introductions. He told me about a 'wine wednesdays' work email group that he'd add me to, but that he never goes to it. When I asked why not, he said he'd go if I went. That's when it hit me that I indeed had a shot with this absolute stud. It was only a small crush because I was newly dating my bf, Mike (26M), and this was the first relationship in my life that I decided to take seriously. So life went on.

Work was going well. After the internship I became an apprentice. Because of this I was relocated out of the intern room to a different building. I now had my own cubicle space. First walking to the bathroom and kitchen of the building I caught a familiar name. Of course it was Jack's office! Through the next months I'd see him in the halls and said hi. We began texting, with him initiating and me responding. Determined to be a proper gf to Mike, I made sure to keep convos light-hearted and platonic and also to never start them. Sometime later, Jack asked me out to lunch and I obliged. I casually mentioned over lunch that I had a bf and insisted to pay for myself. If he paid for me that would make this a date, which was a no-no. Even so, I got to know Jack a little more. A pretty face meant that I made a lot of assumptions about him (shallow, f*ckboy, not deep, etc) that turned out to be wrong. 

We went out to lunch a couple of times after that, as friends, about once every three weeks. Each time he asked, I suggested that we eat at the company's Cafe where there'd be colleagues around and I could bring my own lunch, but every time he insisted we try a new restaurant outside work and that he could pay for me. I obliged with the restaurants but I never let him pay for me. At this point, I knew I had a crush.

Going to wine Wednesday was something I was open to because it was supposed to be a group of ppl from work going, so one time Jack and I decided to try it. After work on a Wednesday we turned up separately to a winery and realized we were the only ppl from the email group who showed up. So we drank wine together and talked. Nothing happened and we each left.

I continued to see him around the office and we chatted and texted infrequently, but I was mostly preoccupied with my relationship and life outside work. I often spent time with Mike's circle of ppl including his two roommates, Ivan (33M) and Valerie (31F). Valerie was model-gorgeous and I had my initial reservations about her, but we became good friends and I really warmed to her. Writing this, I think maybe I'm just fascinated by beautiful tall fit ppl lol. Anyways, she asked me if there were eligible bachelors for her where I worked. My thoughts went to Jack and I told her about him straightaway. Because obviously two gorgeous tall ppl of similar age should be together and obviously I'm content in my own relationship.

Then God thrusts an opportunity at me to set it all up. Jack told me about line dancing at a country bar he likes. Later, Mike's friend planned a birthday at this bar and Mike, his roommates, and I were invited. I also invited Jack, asking him ""Do you want a hot date?"" when he came to My cubicle. I showed him Valerie's picture and he agreed she was pretty.

Fast forward to the country bar. The dance floor was for line dancing for both singles and couples. I introduced Jack to Valerie before heading out to dance. Things seemed friendly between them. Then came the couples dancing and Mike and I were at a loss. Normally, the man leads and the lady follows, but Mike didn't know how to lead. Luckily Jack appeared at our side to teach Mike by DANCING WITH ME. Right in front of him. While he made mental notes, I was smiling from ear to ear as Jack spun me around and dipped me. I felt like a princess. In fact Jack spent most of the night with Mike and I. It was a good night.

Nothing became of Jack and Valerie and secretly I was glad. Although it always confused me how or why Jack was still single. More months passed and I was a good gf for a total of 10 months. The longest I've ever done. Really proud of myself, I broke it off on a random day, citing multiple inconveniences to Mike, who was baffled and sad. But the real reason that I didn't mention was in the back of my mind: I knew I had more passionate feelings for someone else. It was the right thing to do, even though it meant that I lost access to a vibrant social life and nearly all of my friends I had at the time.

Then Jack and I started going out for drinks together. We continued to text. I was elated. I let my mind wander and from that point on he occupied most of my thoughts. Each time we went out I'd hoped he'd make the first move but he never did. He usually offered me his place to sober up but I always declined.

Then one time I got a flat tire and texted him about it so he drove 30min to where I was. We couldn't unlock the tires because I didn't have the key, so we shopped around in vain first for a generic key and then for a tire repair kit, which he insisted on 'buying for himself to use on my car.' Then he spent another hour trying to fix the tire while I stood and watched. When that didn't work he followed me as I carefully drove my car to drop it off at a repair shop before he drove me home. The whole ordeal took hours. You'd think he liked me or something.

I thought things escalated when he invited me to hang out at his place. We drank beer and ate food while we watched TV. I ended up lying down on his chest -- his warm, rock-hard chest that was also soft. The next time we hung out at his place was more awkward than the first time for some reason. Still no moves, so I reckoned he was shy. Then he walked me to my car and as I said goodnight, I went for it -- I kissed him. And he kissed me back! His lips were warm and tender and it lasted at least a whole minute. Saying nothing else, I hopped into my car and drove off because aren't girls supposed to be mysterious?

We never talked about the kiss or our feelings. That's a common theme here. I never wanted to bring it up because I didn't want to scare him away with the subject of a relationship. He's fine to be single for long periods of time and he's also picky, he once told me. I wanted us to formally date, so I thought I needed to appear as cool as a cucumber and wait more for him to initiate something, if not a candid conversation.

Then the two of us went to a bar (I invited him). No moves from him and at the end of the night he walked me to my car to say goodnight and I put my arms around his neck and kissed him again. He didn't just kiss me back; he wrapped his arms around my waist and lifted me up off the ground! When he put me down I said, ""you know I like you right?"" Jack said yes. Then once again, I said goodnight and drove off.

After that, I noticed a shift. He didn't reach out via text nearly as much as he used to. Before my breakup, mostly he reached out. After the breakup, we reached out to each other an equal amount. After the second time I kissed him (two months post breakup) it was mostly me reaching out. I was in denial about it but always waiting for his texts made me a little crazy, so I made an excel spreadsheet documenting our exchanges that validated my suspicion that he was indeed reaching out much less than he used to.

I was depressed to think he was losing interest but all wasn't lost if he didn't explicitly reject me -- that's another common thought that propelled me forward.

So I reasoned again that Jack was just shy and I needed to initiate. I invited him to nights out with my friends a few times and he declined each time, saying it's too late to go out. One of those times was at the country bar; he said no, but offered me his place to crash if I was too drunk. So I seized the opportunity. Within an hour of arriving at the bar I had six shots of tequila on an empty stomach. Then I messaged Jack, who ordered me an Uber because he drank at home. When I arrived I laid down on his couch and outstretched my arms to him. He accepted and we laid together for some time. Then he prepared a change of clothes for me. I changed and got into his bed with him. We we made out and talked about suggestive subjects. I said, ""you know I like you, right?"" He said yes. I told him I wanted to sleep with him, but I wouldn't because ""sorry, I don't f*ck around."" We didn't have s*x but we slept in each other's arms. He drove me to my car the next morning and we didn't really talk about that convo after that.

That was two months ago. In fact after that, we didn't go out except for a few more times and he doesn't text me anymore. I don't reach out to him anymore because I'm afraid to bother him. About one month ago I tried to attempt that frank conversation and here was the exchange via text:

Me: ""Do you get annoyed when I tell you to pull up""

Him: ""I don't think you've ever annoyed me ever.""

Me: ""Awwww. Yeah I ask because I know you're a shy boy""

Him: ""I am not shy. I'm very much holding back around you.""

I asked why, he didn't answer until the next day when I brought it up again:

Me: ""Hey you didn't answer why do you hold back around me? I gotta know if I should hold back around you""

Him: ""I'm just trying to make sure I'm not overly overly flirty 😂 I can be a flirt, but... trying to dial that in""

To be honest I didn't know what any of that meant. So I assumed he's probably not interested, that I should go cry and move on, right? So I just let it go... until a week later I passed by him in the office and he asked me out for drinks again! WTF because I'm thoroughly confused! When the day came Jack asked to reschedule because he forgot that he already plans to meet an old friend that same day. How do you forget something like that? Also, since that was the last day I was free to meet before I left for vacation, we never ended up meeting.

I returned three weeks ago. We don't text. He doesn't come to my cubicle. We only talk when we pass by each other in the office. So I make coffee and stand by the office Keurig machine once a day and I use the bathroom multiple times a day. Once a week I see him and we make small talk about our weekends. That's all I get. One of those times I choked up and didn't even say hi out of nervousness, like an idiot. At the end of each work day I drive home, praying to God in tears like a hormonal teenager for something good to happen. Once I'm home, I'm alone again and I lose myself in Youtube and Instagram while I eat junk food. It's not a good time. I don't look forward to the weekends even if I have plans. My mind just zooms to Monday morning when I can get pretty and stand at the coffee machine again. I haven't been able to stop thinking about him for months now. I've since lost interest in dating apps and thinking about any other man is just silly to me. I've never latched onto a person like this before. I can't even put him ""out of sight, out of mind"" because we share an office!

Now before you say, ""OP, sounds like you need to talk to a professional."" Let me first tell you how offensive that is! But also I'm way ahead of you. I've been speaking to a therapist once a week since before I broke up with Mike. I ask her if I'm crazy to think Jack likes me. She says ""You're not crazy, he definitely likes you but he's got his own issues. You should move onto something else.""

But I can't move on..everything else in this crappy life seems so dull and insignificant. Call me neurotic but so long as there's no resolution to our ordeal since he hasn't specifically rejected me, my brain can't let go. I want to build a life and future with this man who's the whole package. Unless he SPECIFICALLY doesn't want to.

Dam, it's dead late again. Whoops. I was catching up watching some of my listed TV programs to watch. 😅
I find myself wondering, would you be sitting here next to me my old lost friend? Then I remember, you're not fan of Superheroes/Comic related stuff. All I know is that you loved cooking, a bit of anine here and there but your real passion was and is WarHammer 40,000(?) Sees. I remembered that one time on our shared shift. That you showed me this huge mega book explaining about Warhammer and all its set up.

I used to walk into work and yell out, "" Peekaboo!"" And I would hear chuckle to yourself, somewhere hiding and more like reorganising the stock, and your OCD would kick in if things were left too messy for too long in your brown eyes!! Then you'll go full stream ahead to get the stock room tidy and more practical until that place. Was all OK their cages/back stock shelves etc.' 😅 All those little moments, like when you used drop mee back home from work. So that we could have an extra few moments to end up on the convosation topic before getting out of your car.

On my days off or on, when walking my dog. I used to play a little game with myself and try and see if I could spot your car, park up the road, or down a side road. When I did see your car, I felt like a giddy school girl for spotting your car as I walked past either near or on the other side of the road. 😅

Dunno, what caught me first, was that you were deadly shy at first, and your brown eyes and that you wear glasses too. When we became friends and whenever we had worked together, it felt like we were dancing around each other - when  we were passing each other down the Isles!! 😅 Over the years, you became my emotional support with  meaning to become one. But untimely, you and your family had tough times ahead and pressing other matters. We've kept our friendship at work of respect of each of our homes and our family members. By then, you were becoming more enticed to be more social and attend small social gatherings that weren't family based.

Covid19 and lockdown arrived and left. Lockdown reminded you what it is like being isolated and reaching out to friends either online or over phone group settings, becoming more beneficial for you, comparednto face to face interactions. While there, you had re-visited your old self - life to limited friends and family circles. How much easier it was to not really bother to socialise with other friends outside your family circle. We had talkedd about many topics over the years and knowing that one  of them was discussing being an Intervet/Extervert. All before we had reshuffled and rebranded at our shared workplace.
Couple more years go by and then sadly, one day ""snapped"" with over pressure and other stress related issues and perhaps that was when none of us at work knew you too could also he suffering with some level of depression. In the end, you e managed to hold onto your job for another year. Then a new situation arises, and hell broke loose on you, and you ended up ""snapping"" for the second time.
This time you left the workplace environment completed 100% done. Walked out on  your ex-workmates and ghosted us all, and broke away until mid summer. Where you somewhat civilised spoken to a couple of us at that social gathering but afterwards, did try to reconnect back to your ex workmates. In the end there was 3 out 13 ex staff members tried to reach out to you. We all failed because at that time you didn't want to be reminded.

I won't recap how I was dealing with your decision in shutting us all out. You can res my other posts.
Only after I had written out other ways for you to reconnect with me. I realised that appeared to misspelt my u/name on here for Reddit.
It's spelt with one C's. Perhaps maybe this is why you can't find me. 😅

If you do happen to come across this, would be my 3rd post off which I have posted here on Reddit Forums. You're welcome to drop me DM. 😊 Understanding my own grief in losing you for now still stings me time to time inwhich catches  me out. Over course of us walking down our one-way street type of No Contac from being of March. Until whenever you've decided to end your hibernation period from once chapter of life time friends/ex workmates etc'.
I'm ready to rebuild our friendship and willingness to move forward into a better understanding of each other and supporting each other, as any good willed friendship stands in for all the highs and lows of life.
For the time being, as Wonderwall re-plays out, in the background of my mind!! 😅

Maybe in the near future we could go on shared dog walking or coffee, even if it takes half an hour or an hour. Which ever makes you feel comfortable.
I would dearly love to reconcile and reconnect and rebuild friendship. I'm terribly sorry if I had caused you unwittingly pains in the past, and I had misunderstood you and for who you are then and for who are now these days.

WWYD? ,"Partner leaves smears of poop on the toilet seat and in the bowl. Never wipes it down or flushes properly so that the bowl is clean.  After YEARS of nagging it's gone down from a few times A DAY to a few times a week. 

Partner leaves door open while pooping so that I HEAR the feces squeezing out of their butt. Doesn't use a fan or window. Will often run the heat regardless of season so the bathroom is one hot swampy stinkhole. Everyone poops. I get it. But close the door and crack the window.  

Partner somehow *for some reason I cannot conceive of* leaves chunks of poop IN THE SHOWER. Along the walls. On the floor. Does not rinse the shower down or clean it. 

I gave up and started using our guest bathroom which helped a lot. But now we're back to one bathroom and I dont know what to do. 

I have repeatedly pointed it out and  communicated and it does not get much better.

I think there's zero excuse for this. Poop should not be getting all over and if it does, an adult human should just clean up after themselves. 

Partner is messy in other ways. Leaves coffee rings EVERYWHERE. When I pointed them out and asked them to clean it up, partner said ""they are evidence the person you love lives with you"". So I end up cleaning them up.

Am I unreasonable to say this is UNACCEPTABLE behavior and not just the minutiae of living with someone?

Although he was far from ideal in appearance, we had great chemistry and could talk about almost anything.

We've been dating for some time. We grew close, and he even helped me move to my new apartment. However, we haven't kissed yet.

Everything was great until today. Today was... weird. We agreed to go to a pretty popular festival that happens once every year in the city. I was really interested in going and visiting each one of the activities since it was my first time there (he has been there several times before). He promised to spend the day together, but that didn't happen. For context, he's chronically late—all the time, every time.

Today was no exception. He said early morning but didn't respond until 10 am, saying he would arrive after midday due to work. 12 pm, and he said he was eating (in our country, we don't eat breakfast or lunch at 12 pm -too late for breakfast and too early for lunch, but I didn't think too deeply about it since he was busy). Then, he didn't respond until 2 pm, saying he would be late.

By this moment, I already missed most of the activities, leaving just the parade that would happen at 2 pm and some expositions at 4 pm. So, I understood he was just too busy to meet and hang out and told him that ""it's alright if we don't meet, you could focus on your work"". After that message, I rushed to the parade to catch something.

Then, he started bombarding me with messages saying he was on the way to meet me (he lives 1 hour from the city). At this moment, I started feeling odd. I ignored the messages in the parade because I didn't want to miss more stuff. Btw, it was beautiful! I wish I had the chance to see it completely. He asked my location and appeared at the end of the parade. He didn't apologize until later and approached me as if nothing had happened. Then, we went to the other activities and expositions, and everything was as normal: lots of witty banter and laughter.

However, there is a neighborhood next to the expositions that people say is quite sketchy (it is!). I have no interest in going there even though some say there are some tourist spots there worth seeing (I'm new in the city). He's a local and was guiding me through some of the expositions and things nearby. However, he ended up guiding me through this sketchy place even though I had said several times before that I didn't want to go there (he told me where we were after walking several blocks).

By then, I was super nervous since the environment started to feel heavy (lots of homeless and junkies). I made it pretty clear that I didn't like how he had blatantly crossed this boundary, and he just gave a really quick sorry as if to brush it off.

Everything felt even odder after that. He was quiet for most of the journey to more secure neighborhoods, but at the same time, he started sending and receiving many messages. 

Then, when we reached a nice area, I invited him for a tea/coffee (to fulfill a bet I lost with him on the last date); he received a call that he answered outside the coffee shop. After about 10 minutes, he returned, saying he had to go back to work (it was past 7 pm) and couldn't accompany me home. Although I said I understood that, hugged him, and said goodbye before walking home alone, he was just there looking at me with a weird expression.

Now, I'm in my place, feeling odd about all of this, and I don't know how to proceed. I want to send a message, but I don't even know what to say. Maybe this is just an anxiety episode, or maybe this is my gut telling me something is off. In any case, I don't know what to do or what to think now.

I find myself wondering, would you be sitting here next to me my old lost friend? Then I remember, you're not fan of Superheroes/Comic related stuff. All I know is lnow is that you loved cooking, a bit of anine here and there but your real passion was and is WarHammer 40,000(?) Series. I do remembered that one time on our shared shift. That you showed me this huge mega book explaing about Warhammer and all it's set up.

I used to walk into work and yell out "" Peekaboo!"" And I would hear chuckle to yourself, somewhere hiding and more like reorganising the stock and your OCD would kick in if things were left too messy for too long in your brown eyes!! Then you'll go full stream ahead to get the stock room tidy and more practical until that place. Was all OK their cages/back stock shelves etc' 😅 All thoes little moments, like when you used drop mee back home from work. So that we could have extra few moments to end up of convosation topic, before getting out of yoru car.

On my days off or on, when walking my dog. I used to play a little game with myself and try and see if I could spot your car, parked up the road or down a side road. When I did see your car, I felt like a giddy school girl, for spotting your car as I walked pass either near or on the other side of the road. 😅

Dunno what caught me first, was that you were deadly shy at first, quite tall and medium built. Your brown eyes and that you wear glasses too. When we become friends and whenever we had worked together, it felt like we were dancing around each other - when  we were passing each other down the Isles!! 😅 Over the years, you became my emotional support with  meaning to become one. But untimely, you and yoru family had tough times ahead and pressing other matters. We've kept our friendship at work of resepect of each of our homes and our family memebers. By then you were becoming more enticed to be more social and attend small social gatherings that weren't family based.

Covid19 and lockdown arrievd and left. Lockdown reminded you what it like being isolated and reaching out to friends either online or over phone group settings, became more beneficial for you, comparednto face to face interactions. While there you had re-visited your old self - life to limited friends and families circles. How much easier it was to not really bother to socialise with others friends outside your family circle. We had talked about many topics ove the years and knowing that one  fo them was discussing about being an Intervet/Extervert. All before we had reshuffle and rebranded at our shared work place.
Couple more years go by and then sadly, one day ""snapped"" with over pressure and other stress related issues and perhaps that was when none of us at work knew you too could also he suffering with some level of depression. In the end you'e managed to hold onto your job for another year. Then a new situation arises and hell broke lose on you and you ended up ""snapping"" for the second time.
This time you left work place environment completed 100% done. Walked out on  your ex-workmates and ghosted us all and broke away until mid summer. Where you somewhat civilised spoken to a couple off us at that social gathering but afterwards, did try to reconnect back to yoru ex workmates. In the end there was 3 out 13 ex staff memebers tried to reach out to you. We all failed becuase at that time you didn't want to be reminded.

I won't recap how I was dealing with your decision in shutting us all out. You can res my other posts.
Only after I had written out other ways for you to reconnect with me. I realised that appeared to misspelt my u/name on here for Reddit.
It's spelt with two C's, when in fact it needed to be one C!! Perhaps maybe this is why you can't find me. 😅

If you do happen to come across this would he my 3rd post off which I yave posted, here on Reddit Forums. You're welcome to drop me DM. 😊 Understanding my own grief in losing you for now, still stings me time to time inwhich catches  me out. Over course of us walking down our one way street type of No Contac from being of March. Until whenever you've decided to end your hibernation period from once chapter of life time friends/ex workmates etc'.
I'm ready to rebuild our friendship and willingness to move forward into better understanding of each other and supporting each other, as any good willed friendship stands in for all the highs and lows of life.
For the time being, as Wonderwall re-plays out, in the background of my mind!! 😅

Maybe in the near future we could go on shared dog walking or coffee, even if take half an hour or an hour. Which ever makes you feel comfortable.
I would dearly love to reconcile and reconnect and rebuild friendship. I'm terribly sorry if I had caused you unwittingly pains in the past and I had misunderstood you and for who you are then and for who are now these days. This is m risking it and throwing this letter into the winds of forums threads.

I do wish this letter finds you well and that your new self is happier then you were back in March.
Here's æ little bear hug 🐼 🫂 from me to you, no stranger to me 😊

1gie4tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamoryR4R/comments/1gie4tv/33_m4f_california_in_search_of_you/,33 [M4F] #California - in search of you,"
Hello to you, whomever happens to come across this post! In search of a genuine connection, so let me share a little bit about myself! I’m 33 years of age, an Aries, from the wonderful Southern California. I work in banking for one of America’s top banks, and have been in the industry for close to 9 years. I’m 5’9”, divorced with zero kids, Hispanic, with a pierced nose and one arm and one leg full of tattoos. In my free time I enjoy resting; nap anyone? I like trying new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, bars, you name it, I love to try it! I enjoy traveling, mostly to city centers or countrysides, not so much beaches. I don’t play many video games or watch anime at all, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to it. I like trivia nights, sporting events, farmers markets, plant stores and antiques.

I guess what I’m looking for is a partner. Someone I can connect with, someone I can have fun with, someone to be lazy with, someone to travel with. Looking for some to make laugh and to make me laugh. I guess someone to do anything and everything with. Not really sold on one relationship type, so I am open for discussion!

Maybe you’re out there in the world, and maybe I’m the one you’re looking for, or maybe I’m not but let’s chat like we’ve been friends for ten years and see where it goes. No pressure, no expectations, just two people connecting. Or maybe you want to be flirty and make out! I’m down for anything.

I promise I don’t normally blab this much, but I’m an open book and you can ask anything!

1gie3yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1gie3yd/santa_pics/,Santa Pics,"As we get closer to the holidays, many of you will start getting into the Christmas spirit by going to see your local mall Santa Claus for pictures. This is simply a PSA for those who do decide to go. I have no idea if I’m allowed to do this here but on the off chance it stands I hope this will help someone out there. I’ve worked in my local Santa set for 6 seasons and have seen a lot. These are the easiest ways to avoid Karens, to avoid being a Karen yourself and to make the trip a good experience for you, your kids, and the employees helping you. This is based on a culmination of all my experiences with different types of customers, both good and bad.

Also for those that have also done these types of things, worked it, go get pics every year, etc., feel free to also share your experiences. I’m sure that there are places that do it differently than my mall set. Mine has been consistently top 3-4 in my state for profit so I think we do a good job despite all the issues we encounter yearly, but your experiences are still valid.

- Go Earlier in the Year

If you don’t want to wait in line or feel that your time is more important than others, go earlier in the seasons. Mine opens November 14th, others most likely will open around the same time. The closer you get to Christmas the busier it will become and longer you will wait. If it’s popular you could be waiting in line for hours, and they will be irritable hours.

- Check for Available Prepay Options

Check before you wait in line. Some Santa Sets will allow you to pay in advance like a fast pass and you’ll be able to wait in a much shorter line on the busier days. If you absolutely cannot get a day off before December hits, this will always be the best option, it can cut down the wait time by several hours depending on the day.

- Keep Kids Occupied While in Line

If you have kids of any age, make sure they are occupied. We all have seen kids acting out in public and have resented those parents for “allowing that type of behavior.” Just because your child is normally an “angel” does not mean they can bear to be unstimulated for hours in a slow moving line. Teenagers get away with having technology and an internal map of the mall to be left alone, but kids under that age range should not be expected to sit still on their own. They get curious, they get excited to see Santa, they get hungry, they get bored, and they get upset. The worse they feel, the worse you’ll be, and when you’re upset, your kids will absorb and reflect that, creating a negative feedback loop that may put you in the crosshairs of the hourly waged workers.

- Have More Than One Adult in the Group

Preferably don’t be the only adult in your group. BATHROOM BREAKS ARE THE WORST WHEN YOU ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. None of the employees are obligated to save your spot in line, some may be nicer than others, sometimes you’ll get lucky and you’ll come back and the line is really short. You should have everyone in your group go before getting in line. But for those that have an emergency, babies, elderly people, weak bladders, kids who “didn’t have to go before,” or discovering the difference a coffee does after three hours of standing around, you should have someone else responsible with you to save your spot in line. Single parents should have a friend with them at least, or somehow make friends in line. You will regret having to leave a line after two hours, being five spots away from the front, because your child can’t hold it.

- Be a Responsible Pet Owner

Please check beforehand your Santa set’s rule on Pets. Most will allow you to bring them, but pet nights are better. I cannot speak for other malls but my Santa has a different suit that is worn on Pet Night. This is for the safety of other people who may have allergies to pets. We know that your animals may be like your children and you want to get that special moment with them and I don’t blame you, I have two beautiful dogs myself and have made sure to get them pictures whenever I can, but understand that we have to account for those that are unlucky enough to have pet allergies. This also goes for cats, reptiles, farm animals, birds, and fish as well. Yes, people have brought fish and paid real money for their pictures. Also, while waiting in line, all of the above should applies to your animals as well. Be responsible pet owners and treat them like they are children, they should behave in line, keep them mildly stimulated if you have to, and on pet nights understand that there are other animals as well, if they don’t do well with other animals, they probably won’t do well in line. Check if you can prepay and have someone who’s not standing in line hold the animals off to the side to avoid conflict with others in line.

- Understand How the Lines Work

If there is a way to prepay, both lines have things to understand. While the rules may be hard to understand, they are essentially Fast Passes like ones you would see at Disney. They do not guarantee you get in at the exact time you pay for, because others have paid for the same time. These are not appointments. If you prepay for 5:30, there might 3-5 other families who paid the same time, 3-5 other families who paid for the next 15 minute time slot. You are paying early to be in a faster line, not to get to skip the line. Please keep in mind that while your line moves faster, the standby line will still have some families go before yours based on how many were taken in a row, May be three Fastpass families to one, May be five to one. Don’t be that guy to complain about one family going before yours despite your line move five times as fast.

If you are in the standby line, understand that you forfeit the right to complain about the long waits no matter when you decide to go, especially closer to Christmas. People that paid will have priority. Your line will be slow. That’s just the nature of this business.

- Your Child Will Cry. Expect and Accept it

Rule of thumb: if you can’t get your own child to smile, don’t expect us to do it. We will try our best, but understand that Santa is still a strange old man that’s not mommy or daddy. Around the ages of 18 months to 4 years old, they are prime age to understand that the lap they are sitting on is foreign. You as the parent should be a part of trying to get them to smile if that is what you want, otherwise don’t expect us to do any better. This is a pop up store with mostly teenagers, none of us are trained professionals, and not every method we have will work, and if it does, it’s a blessing. Even with your help they may still cry and scream. Accept it and come back another time or just take the photos as is. It is very funny when you can show these embarrassing pictures to your teenagers later on. This is also another reason you should come earlier in the season, if you don’t like how they come out the first time you can come back and redo them later, while trying on Christmas Eve is a one and done endeavor.

- Choose Your People, Not Your Poses

The photographer has likely been doing it long enough to know how position everyone effectively to get the most out of your session and still conform to the time crunch. If you have multiple people, come to the set already knowing who is going in which pictures, whether that be mom, dad, baby, then just baby, or having a group of 10 and separating it into the three individual families, the large one, then the kids. Know who’s getting in the pictures, then let the photographer decide how everyone is placed, they will know better than you. You could come in with your own pose if you know what you want to do, notify them before you start, not during the session, they will have a rhythm they will want to stick to for efficiency sake.

- Don’t Worry About the Print Outs

The photographer is most likely the one sending the photos to be printed. 95% of the time they have already chosen the best photo. You may be able to ask to look at the rest of the file but most of the time you’ll just choose the same picture the photographer choose UNLESS you wanted a different pose printed out, for example wanting the one of the baby by themselves instead of all the kids, or taking the screaming baby photo over the one of the baby and Santa looking at each other. To save time and not be in the way, trust that the photographer has done this before.

- Warn the Workers of Special Needs

If you have a child with special needs, please tell the workers that beforehand so they can prepare as you work your way up. Most sets are flexible when it comes to anyone with a light or sound sensitivity or if you need more room for Wheelchair accessibility. 

- Merry Christmas vs Happy Holidays

Some employees are going to say Merry Christmas, some are going to say Happy Holidays. Both are fine. Accept that. I personally have had issues with a Jewish family who got upset with me, on a Santa set, saying Merry Christmas. I have also had people get mad at me for saying Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. If you have a problem with either, in a setting like that, you are a terrible person. Just because it is a Santa set does not mean we can’t acknowledge and let others celebrate their own holiday during the season for these special and magical holidays. On that same note, Santa is more famous as an icon of Christmas, even if celebrated by other cultures, it is not an insult to say Merry Christmas in a Christmas setting. Just say Thanks, you too, and move on if you really have a problem.

- Put Personal Cameras Away

Parents we see you sneaking pictures and videos on your phone. You aren’t sly about it, nor are you unique for thinking about it. While we hate it, remember that outside of the set is not property of the set, it’s the property of the mall and we cannot dictate what you do outside of the set. Inside the set, unless told so, assume that you will be told to put away any recording devices away or be forced off the set. I cannot stress enough that the same rules apply to Video as they do for Pictures. You cannot be charged for any pictures or video you take outside the set. Do what you will with that information.

- Treat Workers with Respect 

This is a seasonal job, which means hourly workers. Basically minimum wage workers. Please treat them with the same respect you would want shown to you. Without them you don’t get the memories of your kids first Christmas with Santa or the massive group photo with your extended family. Kicking out one customer does not change how much they get paid, don’t be that one customer we all get to talk about for the rest of the season.

Truly, if there's any part of my business that I would like to delegate or streamline it would be sales and networking. Don't get me wrong, I love people and building relationships with them, and people do seem to like me back, but I have found frequent networking to be far too large of a time expense. I've just not been able to make the networking events and my deadlines at the same time.

1gie0lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1gie0lx/coming_to_the_end_of_the_journey/,Coming to the end of the journey...,"  I didn't barely get to nurse my son (now 9y) for 3 or so months, so nursing was always my goal when I found out I was pregnant again. I'm nursing my daughter and she's coming up on 13 months now, but she's been dropping her feedings to 2 a day. We're down to what I call ""morning coffee and nighttime tea"", or 1 wake up and 1 put-to-bed feeding a day. She's taking solid foods, snacks, cow's milk, and other fluids amazingly... but I don't know if I'M personally ready to stop nursing.

  She's going to be starting daycare soon and with that I'll be leaving my time as a SAHM to rejoin the workforce. I've been the one to get up in the night, since my hubby works a early shift, and I'm wondering how I could get my little one to sleep through the night when she's not nursing since that's been part of her bedtime routine since birth and she sleeps wonderfully after nursing.

  Once I drop the morning feed ( working on that now) and move on to stopping nursing completely,  what can I do to help her sleep through the night? I feel like when she drinks anything else close to bedtime she has multiple wet diapers throughout the night and is up and down which will be a hard transition for me starting back at work. 

  Obviously it's been done before and I know I should be thankful for the time I was blessed with being able to stay home and am so overjoyed with being able to nurse as long as I have. I can't help but mourn the end of nursing while wondering what could help her feel as satisfied through the night without causing her to wake up so frequently.

We have a regular customer he used to come here regularly every morning for his regular coffee. He’s very kind and nice and also always seemed to be very anxious and shy guy but always looked deeply in my eyes and always turned his head my way whenever he was leaving. He always acted a bit stressed like he actually tried to say something. One time, actually the last time he came in he unexpectedly said something like ‚have a great day’ and added my name to it which wasn’t very his style to do it since he doesnt say anything.  LI thought that was kinda obvious he liked me but is extremely shy. I liked him too but well I’m shy too and I never found the courage to take actions and approach him. Lately he just stopped coming to my workplace and It’s been already 3 weeks since he came in. 

He literally lives in front of the coffee shop so I was really surprise he doesn’t stop by for his coffee anymore. But I still get to see him quite often through our cafe windows. Few days ago I also noticed that there’s a renovation going on in his apartment and my friend who lives nearby told me he moved out and probably lives now with middle aged woman (he saw them walking in to her house). And she actually came yesterday morning to the shop and grabbed two take away coffees and one was exactly like his usual coffee order. I quickly figured out this is her. And she is definitely very hot and attractive woman. I felt quite disappointed that I actually didn’t shoot my shot when I had a chance. I really liked this guy and somehow felt like there was chemistry between us. Anyway I was just finishing my Sunday shift today and I randomly saw him passing by the cafe and he saw me, looked at me and gave me little smile (he never ever smiled before to me). And I’m completely confused. 

I kinda get the feeling that he will eventually pop in for coffee one day and I’m not sure if I should try and actually try to have a small talk  with him and see how it goes or I should actually stop looking in his eyes and just move on.

I know I have a lot of thoughts, I booked the last few days off work to play through this and not being a completionist person or particularly good at games in the first place so was playing on easy mode I've now finished.

Firstly the really, really disappointing thing out of the way - not porting over my worldstate, man it sucked. It really hurt the experience in a way that I dreaded it would, when I met Morrigan, Varric, Dorian, Isabella, hell even the Inquisitor and Solas to a degree, though Solas was the least of that - I could just spot the absence of my own worldstate. They didn't feel like the characters that I knew and had influenced like returning characters in DA2 and DAI had - its a real shame but it is what it is, if they do another game I hope they course correct this choice (BRING BACK THE KEEP). 

Positively, as I don't wanna be all doom and gloom, I really think the game is beautiful - I did the turning off bloom trick and it really did help the game feel better, but even when it was on the game was just gorgeous - sometimes the characters models felt a bit rubbish, especially my one true love Dorian - I honestly am knocking this game down a whole number out of ten for what they did to Dorian - but yeah for the most part the game was breathtaking as I've come to expect from this series. 

Another major positive, the ""woke"" stuff haha, god its so great and refreshing to see this kind of representation. Its a simple fact that the last couple of days if you go online and ask someone who is raging and hates this entry into the series why it was so bad the ""woke"" elements, choices you can make for your character and also what happens with Taash, have been the most commonly states criticisms and I'm sorry but those are just not valid criticisms. Trans people exist, non binary people exist, representation is good - the existence of these character and choices in a roleplaying game allows for greater roleplaying experiences, you do not have to play a trans character if you don't want to. I also loved the inclusion of disabled and POC characters, for me especially on that last point we are in a very different part of the world of Thedas, to me it makes sense to not have everyone just be white like in DAO and DA2.

Combat wise, I don't really care - it's not why I play these games, I really enjoyed DAO's combat and felt its been a downgrade since - though DAI's was fun as well. I played a mage as I always have and I found it very fun. I found the leveling up mechanic to be very daunting, but I picked it up. I'm a big fan of passives in these kinds of games as I'm really bad at button mashing, get really tunnel visions, and have awful perception for when the game is trying to tell me things. Sometimes on the really big boss fights it would really start to feel like a slog, even on the low difficulty I was playing on, but worked through it and had a fun time.

In terms of the really good stuff, that's about it sadly. The annoying thing for me is that as much as I love this series and these games, this really was not an amazing game in my opinion - much less even a good Dragon Age game. When it came to returning characters I was really let down, the game feels like it has such a small cast of returning characters and half of them just feel like cameos, especially Morrigan and the Inquisitor who despite appearing a lot just felt very boring. There were so many characters missing from this game who would have been amazing to see, Fenris being chief among them for me - but these characters can't appear because of the worldstate issue. Would have been great to see Leliana, Zevran, Alistair, Sten, Merrill, Cassandra, Iron Bull, and Blackwall in particular as I think all of these characters would have very interesting interactions with the story of this game and the faction focus. 

On the point of factions, I kind of hate most of them...Easy ones first, Antivan Crows can gtfo, they take child slaves and turn them into assassins through torture etc, every game they have been in before now they have been villains - everytime I ran into the Crows in the game I wanted to tell them to fuck off, it felt like such a whitewash. Lords of Fortune was another one I didn't really care for, sadly I really didn't like Taash as a companion, I just found them really boring (More on that later) also Isabela was my least favorite companion in Dragon Age 2 so they were already off to a bad start. The Grey Wardens felt so plain and boring in this game like omg, I feel like in previous games Grey Wardens always have this ""greater good"" thing going, as well as all the secrets and mystery - in this game they just felt like generic monster hunter faction, and don't get me started on how contrived all the stuff with the First Warden was. It would have been so much better to have a character we know be the First Warden (There are tons to choose from throughout the series), also all the stuff with the Griffins was really annoying, . Veil Jumpers really annoyed me because it was all ""we hate the dalish gods"" ect, ect, but like that's not at all what you would expect from the Dalish faction, the Dalish don't like the Dread Wolf, they love their Gods - but here its the exact opposite, felt very out of character. Shadow Dragons were legit kinda cool, I can gel with the Shadow Dragons (Though would have loved to have seen Fenris be one of them), lastly Mourn Watch was probably the only faction that I wholly liked, this probably stems from the fact that Emmrich was my fav companion and I love liches and such, but I just found their whole aesthetic to be really cool. 

Speaking of companions, I've already mentioned I found Taash to be really boring, and this brings me to something I've seen mentioned a lot, and that is the voice acting in this game. For me by far and large Taash was the worst one for this, but loads and loads of characters - even Morrigan at times! - just felt so monotone and boring in their delivery. Taash as I say was the worst of the lot for this, and this made it really hard for me to like their character. Bellara was cute and fun for the most part, but I found myself cringing at the writing every single damn time she said ""these are not my Gods"". Harding was a character who really grew on me over the course of the game, with her getting injured because I brought her with me and then dying actually made me feel really bad because of my choices. Davrin was a character I really wanted to like but just found a bit boring - and I think the main reason for that is because as someone who loves the Gray Wardens, I hated the way they were done in this game, I think I'll probably enjoy him more on a second playthrough though. Neve was someone I was sure I was gonna dislike, however I was pleasantly surprised to found I actually really, really liked her (And by extension the Shadow Dragons) Lucanis was a character I really struggled with, because on one had I really liked him, his story, his whole deal with Spite, on the other hand everytime he opened his mouth I just kept thinking of Puss In Boots - also I wish he'd shut up about coffee, I romanced Lucanis in the end but I'm not particular attached to him and tbh...I kind wish I romanced Emmrich instead, Emmrich ended up being far and beyond my favorite companion, and maybe character, from this game. I'm a sucker for that kind of character archetype though...

I've missed off discussing one major character to really save for last, and for me this really sums up what the worst part of this game was for me, and that is Varric. I full on hated what happened with Varric in this game, its so fucking cheap. Everything about these scene in the fade prison pissed me off. I actually had to stop playing and take a break after that whole scene because I was so annoyed at the game. I do not mind that Varric was killed, what I do mind is that Varric was killed and then we were tricked that he was still alive so they could have a late game twist. Not only that but because they weren't bringing back Hawke or the Inquisitor in a major way they needed to get Rook to have a relationship with Varric to give the death weight. Really, really pissed me off, coupled with how easily we escaped from the prison and its just dogshit writing. 

And for me that really brings me to my last point, the writing in this was such a let down. I know I've probably missed a lot of the game, I tend to be a lot more analytical and through on a second playthrough when I play these kinds of games, but in terms of the story it just felt like nothing really happened. All the stuff with the dragons felt really ham fisted to me, like the Evanuris had two blighted dragons and also had their two archdemons? The Venatori joining with the Evanuris makes no sense, it just doesn't - should have been written better so they were being tricked with the old gods, but even then it doesn't work. The Antaam abandoning the Qun and joining the Evanuris was something I really didn't like either, everything interesting about the Qun just gone in a single game. The Gloom Howler was something that really grabbed my interest at first, despite the goofy name, as I was hoping it would be another of the Magisters Sidereal, but that was not to be the case. Just missed opportunity, after missed opportunity in my opinion. A real shame to see as I was so excited for this game, but imo its definitely the weakest in the series.

I want to be seen, by someone. Anyone I guess. I want to be human, & not undervalued or under appreciated. I want to be cared for, and loved. I want people to put in the same amount of effort into me as I do to them. I want to be the friend people want to hang out with, reach out too, the one they think about, & invite to things.

But I’m not. 

I don’t know why I’m not. I’ve tried so many times to push myself out of my own comfort zone. I’ve done dating apps, meet ups, gotten multiple hobbies, etc.. but nothing real stemmed from that.

It’s like everyone already has their own life and stuff going on & they don’t have room for someone new. 

I’ve tried to work on myself within too. Like my self concept, confidence, having more awareness, better emotional regulation, self validation, etc.. 

But, I still want friends. I can’t get past the desire for community. I’m not even desiring a partner, just friendships which should be easier right?

I guess not. No one thinks of me. I have even invited people out to coffee. I’ve tried to get past any blocks I had. And it didn’t get me anywhere.

I think it just hurt my confidence more. What’s wrong with me? I like myself, I think I’m a great friend. And I self reflect a lot & I know I put effort u to things and value connection… is it because people can sense I’m lonely, or that I I’m too available, too willing to take the time, or something else? Do I need to play games to have friends? Sometimes it feels that way. But, I just want to be real. I want to be me. I want depth. Authenticity. 

I feel a pit in my chest, it hurts. My birthday and the holidays are coming up and I know it won’t be easy for me. 

Why can’t I be loved even if I’m imperfect? Am I truly unworthy? What is it, so I can fix the issue with myself that makes me seemingly unable to have the community I desire? 

I wish I knew. I’ve internalized it tbh. I just… I want to be seen as human. I wish I could be so self sufficient, I don’t need anybody type of person. God knows I’ve tried. But, I still want friends, deep true friends. 

I’m so lonely, I’m so sad. I’ve tried so hard to fight against this but I feel like it’s only consuming me & idk what to do. 

What is the solution? How do I fix what makes me like this? 

If you read this, thanks. I really needed to vent. ",2,1730603888.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

From the videos it look like the town is pretty dirty and nothing much to offer. A lake yes, but lots of trash and polluted. Food is typical dal chaval subji roti. Just one bar and that too super poorly rated.

Anyone been there recently? How are the vibes? I like nature (planning for Naina Peak trek and Tiffin Top Trek over two days), coffee, and serene time in the evenings. Not much a foodie but love to have nutritious food, it need not be 'authentic local'. for instance, chicken salad. Not sure will I get in this town.

I’m doing all the unlearning, bad habits, food as a coping mechanism and reward, all that.

One of the things that always kills me when I stop trying is the hunger headaches. I have deep and chronic sinus issues and chronic pain from a car accident I was in. My hunger headaches get stored in my neck and shoulders and it makes it hard to focus, hard to sleep, hard to do anything. I’m not under-eating by any means - my meals for today came to probably something approximating 1700-1800 today, and that included three meals approximating 350-400 calories each (included at least 30g of protein each), a 180 calorie snack, and coffee (100 calories). I’m definitely not *starving*. I’m trying to learn to tolerate the hunger. Today I’ve had relatively low movement, but some days I’ll go for lap swim classes and burn about 400 calories per 45 minutes of swim. But today wasn’t that day).

But realistically, how long until my body adjusts? I feel like this is what gets me every time. I’m trying to fight food cravings in every way. But when the headaches come they seem to affect my entire skull, and I give up because I can’t take it.

Unless my one cat is pooping 3 times a day… I haven’t really seen him touch his dry food but is still begging for his wet food as per usual. I’ve tried giving him laxatone just in case he has some sort of blockage. Everything was pretty much normal until about an hour ago he vomited up his wet food. No blood or anything in the vomit, but he never gets sick. So I’m worried he’s definitely has blockage. I would take him to the vet but I can’t drive right now because I don’t have a vehicle atm. I also only have $800 in my bank account so I’m worried I wouldn’t be able to afford a vet. He doesn’t seem to be in pain, I can pick him up and rub his tummy and everything.

It was just the two of us at our side of the light when it turned green and he didn't go. We sat there for a good 30-40 seconds before he realized the light was green, not on his phone, just looking around.

I'm a patient person in general and moreso today because it's my day off, so I didn't honk at him. I really don't like honking at people unless they're about to hit me or cause an accident. And I didn't go around him because I needed to turn on the next road and the stretch before that is short. He gave me a little wave of appreciation before I turned.

I didn't mind it, but apparently the cop that passed us and made a(n illegal) u-turn did. This asshole tailed me and flashed his lights. He asked if I was on my phone and why I wasn't paying attention. I told him I don't touch my phone while I'm driving, and that I was paying attention and chose not to fuckin honk at the dude. 

He gave me a ""verbal warning"" and told me to pay attention, but I had just told him that me not acting like an impatient dipshit on the road was a conscious choice. I was singing along to my music and having a good time, I didn't care about him not immediately going on green.

I also feel like there was a hint of misogyny in his assumptions about me not paying and being on my phone. My phone stays in my center consol while I'm driving, that's why Bluetooth exists. My hands were on the steering wheel. I was looking forward. He had no reason to assume shit.

I hate that a lot of cops choose to be asswipes for no reason, even in small ways. Like just admit you were suspicious for no reason, apologize, and maybe focus on stopping actual fuckin crimes? Not pull over some girl and accuse her of being ditsy and distracted because she didn't honk at the only other person on her side of the road??

**CW: self-harm, cult abuse**

**\*\*\*\*\***

I woke up warm.  Two thoughts popped into my mind at the same time: w*here am I*?  And, *I need to pee right now.*  

Luckily the resolution to one of the two was right in front of me - a small bathroom across a carpeted floor.  I threw a blanket off myself, climbed out of my bed du jour (a green couch), and stumbled into a much more inviting commode than the one I’d encountered the night before.  My eyes were bloodshot and my hair stuck out at odd angles, but I hadn’t sustained any obvious injuries from my adventure in a drug den.

After peeing and cleaning myself up a bit, I wandered back into the room where I’d slept.  It was, in one word, witchy.  Purple sponge-painted walls with stencils of stars and moons.  Herbs, crystals, an altar in one corner, and a bookcase filled with Tarot guides and Goddess Magic and Healing Plants.  A doorway lead to a railway-style bedroom with an empty wall-mounted bed, then through a second doorway into a small kitchen.

A woman stood there, pouring freshly-made coffee into a mug.  She saw me and smiled.

“Coffee?”

\*\*\*\*\*

The woman - my rescuer, the night before - introduced herself as Alita.  She looked a bit older than me, thirty-something; curvy and brown-skinned, with corkscrew hair and a wide, dimpled smile.  In contrast to her otherworldly, earth-mama decor, Alita wore yoga pants and a blue SUNY sweater.  

“It was stupid,” I said, sipping my coffee.  “I took something last night… normally, I don’t pass out in strange bathrooms.”

Alita shrugged.  “I believe you.  It’s good I got you out of there, though.  Lemme guess: you found a totem in that bathroom.”

“A totem?” I asked, confused.  

She smiled.  “Words.  Glowing.  Disembodied hands…”

I blinked.  My brain couldn’t quite soak up her corroboration.

“Stinky girls, occasionally a guy?”  Alita continued.  “Call you sister?  Have you had the blackouts yet?”

I shook my head.  It was too much to process.  “They… they didn’t talk…”

Alita frowned knowingly.  “Ah.  They’re in their cutesy ‘follow me’ phase.”

“You… too?” I stuttered. 

Alita shook her head.  “No.  I just know stuff.”

My head began to throb.  I was hazy and confused and I’d passed out on a sticky bathroom floor in *Williamsburg*.  My reserve of patience had evaporated.

“You know stuff?”  I repeated.  “Great.  Start talking.  Because I want it to *stop*.”

Alita looked hard at me.  She stood, picked up her coffee pot, and poured us both a refill.  

“Cream or sugar?”

“Just talk.”

“Fine.”  Alita sat, leaned back and crossed her arms.  “Sixty-odd years ago, an Evangelical minister started gathering followers.  His name was Thomas Elliott.  The man was an ugly little troll, but he had charisma.  He led a popular congregation in the Hudson Valley - brilliant, but a complete psychopath.  And like most psychopaths, he started to believe he knew better than everyone else.  Including his superiors at the church.  He got into some scandal Upstate… he may have impregnated another pastor’s wife, or teenaged daughter… point is, he needed to get out of town, fast.  

“So he came down here with a coterie of female followers.  In the city, he picked up more.  Different races, different backgrounds, all young and beautiful.  Soon, Elliott had everything a small-dicked little megalomaniac could ever want.  Endless sex from labile young women who worshipped him, cooked and cleaned for him, and dutifully brought him money.  But, like the psychopath he was, he wanted more.  Survivors - women who left - said he got off on causing pain.  He pressured his followers into degrading, masochistic sex.  A few escaped, but most stayed.  They believed he was the Messiah.”

My dream.  W*omen in loose brown dresses, dirty, sobbing and terrified.*  

“He preached that eternal life didn’t come from worshipping God or living a Christian life,” Alita continued.  “It came from pain - pain, like Jesus experienced on the cross.  He made the girls believe that, if they went through enough pain and suffering, they would become immortal.”

*The stench of urine and rot.  The animalistic screams.*

“Well, eventually Elliott’s bullshit caught up with him.  He and his girls had been tossed out of even the floppiest of flop houses in Brooklyn.  So he took, maybe, twenty of his most devoted acolytes and disappeared.”

“Disappeared.”  I repeated.  

*The cold.  The aching bones.  The fear.* 

Alita shrugged.  “Disappeared.  Gone.  Never seen or heard from again.”

“Didn’t anyone look for them?” I asked.  

*The writhing.  The tiny teeth.  The blindness.  The gurgling sobs.*

“I’m sure the girls’ families did,” Alita said, “if they had families.  But there wasn’t much the authorities could do.  All of Elliot’s followers were adults - young adults, but adults nonetheless.  Sex workers, addicts, rootless seekers.  The sort of people who slip through the cracks all the time.”

I shuddered.  I thought about the blonde, eyeless wraith - not with fear, but pity.  She’d been one of them.  I’d experienced what she experienced.  The abuse, the control, the agony. 

“I… I see a girl,” I stammered weakly.  

Alita’s eyes widened.  She stood and rifled through a filing folder on her counter, extracting a thin photo album, which she handed to me.

“There’s not a lot of pictures of the Elliott cult,” she said.  “This is all we’ve managed to compile.”

*We*, I thought, as I paged through photographs of a balding, frog-mouthed man with defined jowls, then beautiful young women in flowing dresses with long, straight hair.  Then, I saw her.

“The… the blonde!” I exclaimed, pointing.  “Her!""

The young woman in the photo had clear skin, a delicate nose, and beautiful blue eyes - the polar opposite of the scarred, filthy zombie that kept appearing around New York.  But her waist-length, ice-blonde waves were unmistakeable.  Alita took the picture from my hand and read off the back.

“Nancy Strauss,” she told me.  “She was a poet and a folk singer.  She used to perform in small venues around the city.  She may have actually made something of herself if she hadn’t…”

“How do I make her go away?”

Alita fixed me with an odd stare.  I got the uncomfortable impression there was a whole lot more she’d purposefully kept from me.

“Ignore her,” she said.

\*\*\*\*\*

I tried ignoring Nancy.  I tried to forget the smelly, glowing people.  Then, the blackouts started.

They were never significant - a few minutes, here and there.  I’d be sitting at my desk at work, then zone out and come to in the soda room, drinking a diet coke.  It always felt longer, though; time passing as it does in a dream.  

In my blacked-out reveries, I was her.  I was Nancy Strauss.  And I remembered.

*Our bus, an old Metro Father saved from the junkyard, broke down along the side of a tree-lined highway.  So we’d walked, bags in hand, along cracked roads and boggy grassland.  Our legs ached.  Some of us had broken arms still in slings.  Our bruises throbbed, and the lashes down our backs stung, yet still, we sang.  Soon, we’d reach Revelation.  Revelation would be the promised land - the place our Father’s promise for us came to fruition.  We sang -* 

*I stand, blind and naked, at the world’s bloody end*

*All is dead, sadness is your only friend.*

*Then, the whistle of a train.  A steeple rising into the cloudless sky, bright sunlight catching a stained glass window, drenching our procession in color like God’s rainbow after the flood.  We’d arrived.  We were home.*  

The details blurred and disintegrated as soon as I was pulled back to reality.  I’d find myself twirling my finger impotently, surprised and disappointed to find I wasn’t playing with my long, blonde hair.  But one word remained scarred in my memory: Revelation.  

Revelation, the word scrawled on the note I’d found in the library.  It was the name of a place.  I Google’d around, looking for cities called Revelation, and had little luck - all I found was speculation about the seven towns mentioned in the Bible’s Book of Revelations.  There’s a couple Revelation Streets and Revelation Boulevards scattered around the country; I scrolled through images on Google Earth.  None felt right.  None felt familiar.  

On Monday, I didn’t have much to do at work.  We didn’t have any events scheduled until the weekend, so I distracted myself organizing the beer fridge, then marrying the liquor, then taking inventory of the walk-in freezer.  When I’d run out of my own tedious tasks, I found a stack of paper invoices on Adrienne’s desk.

Management was still in the process of interviewing potential sales managers, which meant Adrienne’s non-urgent job duties hadn’t been fulfilled.  I decided to scan the invoices and organize them into our digital file system.  It needed to be done, and I didn’t have anything better to do but obsess over a vanished cult and their mysterious settlement.

I’d ran two invoices through our ancient printer/fax/scanner when I found them, scrawled on the back of a duplicate.  

Words.  Phrases in green pen, Adrienne’s curly handwriting.  

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

*Black flowers smell like rot.  Train cars attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow, speeding is forever.*

Over and over.  And then: a string of numbers and letters.  Map coordinates.

*4X.X N, 7X.X W*

My pulse quickened.  I felt my feet sink into the ground.  My palms grew moist; icy-hot adrenaline crackled through me like electricity.  I was terrified.  But I knew - I knew, in the depths of the body no longer completely mine - that wherever those coordinates led, was where I was supposed to be.

\*\*\*\*\*

I offered my manager some excuse: headache, projectile vomiting, family emergency.  I routed myself to the nearest car rental place, threw down my credit card, pulled out of the lot in a 2019 Civic, and typed Adrienne’s coordinates into the GPS.  

*Our promised land had a name, once, but that name didn’t matter.  We were to call it Revelation.  It was where Father was born, where he’d lived with his family before the paper mill burned down and the whole town had been forced to abandon their homes and seek their fortunes elsewhere.  He called it Revelation because, there, God had revealed to him his holy purpose: bring Heaven’s immortality to an imperfect earth.*  

Pennsylvania.  Middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania.  

I looked for a town name.  I found nothing - as far as Google Maps was concerned, Adrienne’s coordinates pointed to an unincorporated grove of trees somewhere between Pittsburgh and Interstate 80, approximately six hours away.  

*Revelation felt lonely, especially in contrast to the constant bustle of Brooklyn.  I’d never experienced such emptiness.  But we accustomed ourselves to it.  We learned to take comfort in our sisterhood, in the nights Father called us to his bed, in the warm ache of sore muscles after a long day working the land.*  

I drove.  I cruised along the 80 for what felt like forever, then pulled onto a highway, which lead to a smaller highway, off which sprung a shabby two-lane road through a vast grassy plain and then a thick grove of oak trees.  Above the trees, I saw what had once been an elevated train track.  I was close.  

*The whistle of the Eastbound train - twice a day, at dawn and dusk - became a familiar friend.  We made other friends, unlikely friends.  Hunger, the constant colicky burn in our empty stomachs, as the beautiful country summer faded into an atypically cold fall.  The biting kiss of a whip as it struck our flesh over and over.  Father hurt us.  He made us hurt each other.*  

The woods broke; I approached a clearing.  My GPS chirped: I’d arrived.  The late-afternoon sun, warm and butter-yellow, broke into multicolored prisms.  A church appeared in front of me.  It had faux columns, a tall steeple, and a circular stained-glass window, depicting a haloed child and a lamb.  I’d seen that church before.  I’d seen it in the old architecture book dropped in front of me at the Brooklyn library: First Methodist Church.  But also, *I’d seen that church before*.  

*We weren’t worthy.  Our crops wouldn’t grow.  We had no food.  We had no blankets to warm us, so we nestled together on the splintering wooden floor, shivering in the icy air that transgressed the thin walls and seeped up, like a burrowing creature, from the maw of the pit.*  

On a small hill behind the church, the old paper factory loomed like the castle of a fantastical monster, burned out and left to the elements for generations.  I drove along narrow streets decimated by weeds, past rows of square houses with quaint porches and overgrown lawns.  Through a ghost town.  I kept on moving, up and down crumbling blocks reclaimed by nature, past a boarded-up Main Street where even the graffiti had faded to nothingness.  I loosened my grip on the wheel.  I loosened my grip on myself, on my own consciousness.  I let Nancy take control.

My foot, involuntarily, stomped on the break.  The car skidded to a stop, and I stared out the window.  The house in front of me had faded red paneling.  A collapsed porch.

It was the house from the video.  

\*\*\*\*\*

If the black door had once been locked, the lock had rusted to bronze dust years before.  I pushed through - and immediately froze, neurons paralyzed, desperately grasping at the reality on which I’d staked my entire earthly existence. 

I was standing in a charred-black, grime- and cobweb-covered living room.  *I’d sat cross-legged on the floor, once, hands raised to the sky, scent of urine on my nostrils and lips.*  Writing instruments - chalk and paint and spray cans and sharpies - littered the floor.  The walls were covered in words.

I gasped. 

*Killed your daughter.*

*Never loved wife.*

*Drug addicted loser.*

*Dirty red hair.*

*Three broken bottles.*

*Black car speeding.*  Green paint.  Curly cursive letters.  

**Black** *flowers smell like rot.  Train* **cars** *attract barnacles in the bay.  Youth dies slow,* **speeding** *is forever.*

Adrienne. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Adrienne and I bonded over grief, and guilt.  She and her sister had been on the way to their cousin’s birthday party; Adrienne was driving.  Something - she couldn’t remember what - distracted her, commanded her attention for a fraction of a second.  That fraction was all that was necessary for her to miss the speeding black car that ran the stop sign, slammed into Adrienne’s passenger side, and killed her twin on impact.  Adrienne never forgave herself.   

Like I could never forgive myself for ignoring Cyrus.  

Cyrus and I met in math class our first semester and became immediately inseparable.  We rented an apartment together the next year, transferred from junior college to the same university, graduated with matching hospitality management degrees.  We tried to maintain our friendship as we pursued our careers - me, as the assistant manager of a university cafeteria; him, running his own catering company.  But work was a lot, and I was distracted.  I knew he’d recently gotten into and out of an emotionally abusive relationship.  I’d been aware since we met he was estranged from his homophobic parents.  

I didn’t know just how dark things had become inside his head.

On a Tuesday, he called me.  I let it ring.  I was at work, between meetings; school started and my life became a blur of trainings and angry suppliers and confused new cashiers.  I told myself I’d call Cyrus back during my lunch break.  But I didn’t get a lunch break.  And after work, I forgot.

Cyrus’s roommate found him in the bathtub the next morning.  Cold, blue, and stiff.  An empty bottle of sleeping pills discarded by his side.  

I left Pasadena.  I left California.  I packed up everything and moved across the country, to a new place, where every street and every coffee shop and every dive bar didn’t remind me of Cyrus.  Where I wasn’t reminded, every day, that he was gone and it was all my fault.

I found a sharpie and uncapped it, then an untouched patch of wall.  

**Abandoned** *tunnels are best seen with dead, bloodshot eyes.*

*Sadness will become your only* **friend**\*.\*

*Open your mouth and eat your* **calling** *whole.* 

I wrote: ABANDONED FRIEND CALLING.  My best friend, dead because of me.  If I’d only picked up, if I hadn’t been a self-centered narcissist, if I’d come through for him like he’d come through for me, so many times… I stepped back.  The words sank into the wall and began to glow.  Sickly, green-yellow light.  I smelled rotting flesh, curdling blood, festering vomit and feces.  Then came the screams.  Screams, then gurgling, ragged breathing, lifeless sobs.  

I ran towards the screams.  Through a maze of wooden halls, past creeping cockroaches and patches of mold, until I found myself in a back room as large as the first.  The center of this room had fallen away, collapsed into a huge, open pit over what had once been the basement - at least twenty feet down.  I didn’t want to look.  I had to look.  

I peered over the edge of the pit, and I saw the girls.

Torn, bloody skin under blood- and piss-stained brown dresses.  Matted, filthy hair.  Whitish goo coagulating around festering sores.  Faces beaten black and blue, bare backs whipped raw.  Arms and legs bent the wrong way, bone jutting from mincemeat flesh.  Fearless rats chewing on open wounds.  Beautiful, ruined young women writhing and convulsing, mouths wide open, begging for mercy from an aloof God.  

\*\*\*\*\*

*It was the day, he told us.  The day we’d leave our weak, starving bodies behind and embrace the immortality that was our destiny.  He instructed us to meditate.  One by one, he took us from our sisters.*  

*He flung us into the pit.*  

*The lucky ones died on impact; the rest lingered.  We cried and screamed for days, while infections ravaged our skin and rats bit into us with their tiny, sharp teeth.  We became delirious.  We muttered nonsense words and phrases, the final disjointed processes of our failing minds.  Our Father watched, rapt.  Then, when the last of us became too weak to make any sound at all, he set his rotting childhood home aflame.*  

*He died by his own hand, instantly, with one bullet from his father’s gun.  We suffocated slowly, our lungs filling with black soot.*  

I woke up, on my back, in the living room with the writing on the walls.  It was night, hours later.  The coppery rot scent still hung in the air.  I turned on my phone’s flashlight and, with a daring that would’ve made me proud of myself under any other circumstances, made my way back through the collapsing house and to the edge of the pit.  

The bodies had long since decomposed.  Instead, I saw a lawn of dark green ivy, sickly pale saplings, and rotting planks colonized by mushrooms and crusty green mold.  The effect was eerie.  A terrarium for things that grow with no light.  Cautiously, very aware of where I was stepping, I walked the circumference of the crater-like depression.  At the far end, across from a bashed-in back door, I stumbled over something hard.  

I looked down.  I yelped.

A skeleton.  A hole through the side of the skull.  The rusting metal body of a revolver.  

Dust clouded my vision like smoke.  Anemic, yellow-green light, from the full moon outside, seeped in through the windows and the cracks in the collapsing ceiling and door and walls.  *Smoke and piss-yellow glow*, I thought.  *The last thing the girls saw as they lay dying.*

*\*\*\*\*\**

I’m not writing this down as a diary.  No.  This is my warning to the next innocent who, wandering the streets of New York City, finds themselves drawn to nonsensical words on an abandoned store front wall.

I don’t know who Alita is.  I have no idea how she found me on that bathroom floor, or why she’d come to the Butler Outfit in the first place, or what she wanted from me.  I don’t know how she knew so much about the Elliott Cult, or what I’d experienced at the hands of the glowing trio, or the blonde wraith.  Nancy.  I don’t know from where she got those pictures.  And I’m still wondering who, when she said *we*, was implied.  I don’t even think Alita is her real name.  I’ve tried to dig her up on social media.  She might as well be a ghost.

But I think I know what she kept from me, that day.

She didn’t tell me it was already too late.

I see more smelly, glowing, smoke-emitting strangers.  They’ve gotten braver, like wildlife in the park, used to being fed.  One walked right up to me outside a bagel shop.  “You’ve come back, sister!” she cried joyously.  My face must’ve hidden none of what I was thinking, because the girl - cute, Latina, with thick eyeliner and gentle curves - took an immediate, cowed step back.  

“Oh,” she said, frowning.  “I… I thought you were someone else.”

Right.  Someone else.

Everywhere I go, I see the words.  

*Laugh alone or cry until you’re dead*.  A sticker stuck to a trash can on 42nd Street.

*Ugly girls make better muppets*, scrawled across a bathroom stall.

*Never like you*.  Multicolored spray paint on the side of an abandoned truck, parked at a curb in Flatbush.

The words smoke and glow yellow-green.  If I get too close, I see inky black fingers reaching out for me.  Disembodied hands, blindly groping, searching for prey.

I think Thomas Elliott succeeded.  

I think the essence of his followers, the souls of the girls dead at the bottom of the pit, became immortal through their desperate, delirious last words: the orphaned monster-children of their endless pain.  I think those words embedded themselves all over the city.  Waiting, patiently, for a young man or woman to find them.  A special kind of young person - one suffering, guilty, and broken.  Like Adrienne, or like me.  One who’d bring the words home.  

One who’d give the dead girls’ disembodied spirits a new, warm, fleshy home.  

Adrienne knew what was coming.  She chose to die, rather than lose her body and mind to an invading parasite.  Me, I’m not so sure.  I see Nancy Strauss in my dreams.  When I allow my thoughts to wander, I’m inspired to hum a tune, or sing a rhyme to myself.  I feel her inside of me, burrowing into the folds of my brain, trying out my arms and legs, tasting delicious things with my tongue.  She doesn’t mind the unfamiliar genitalia - it feels natural, the body she was always meant to have.  My body.  Her body.  I think that piss-colored smoke wafts off me, and I might smell like blood and mold and rotting flesh.  But it’s okay.  No one will notice; no one except the chosen ones, the boy or girl imprinted upon by the words - the vessel for my next sister’s glorious resurrection.

*Down in a rotting, putrid hole, I see black flowers grow.*

*A weighted-down, dying soul - like filthy 4th Street snow.*

*I hold the flowers to the sun, they wither into dust.*

*Then they’re reborn, God has won!  All ripe and filled with lust.*  ",3,1730603013.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Jordan is so good and how she got the depth and character from our design is beyond my dreams. I love The National and a song “Conversation 16” has a line about Coffee and Flowers. And what has better hands to love coffee like a mischievous raccoon. From that face to the coffee mug and grasping paws to the peony flowers. I’m very happy.

Over 1000 comments in 12 hours. I was very surprised at how the THT community received my musings. Thank you for all of your words of wisdom and encouragement, and for overwhelmingly backing me in.

This situation happened a little over a month ago. I wrote the post pretty much straight away but had it sitting in Notes on my phone. Firstly, because I didn’t want to post it while I was in a state of emotional flux and secondly, because I know how you all like updates. So on the off chance it did gain traction, I didn’t intend to make you wait too long for a conclusion.

First thing is first, yes, I did post earlier in the year on the marathon issue (using a different account). That was a post I wrote angry! Then promptly forgot about. No, I didn’t end up skipping Father’s Day or going on a spa day. It’s not in my personality to be vengeful. I tend to get angry and then get over it. Ultimately, I like to treat people the way I hope they would treat me. For the most part, it’s an effective strategy.

Secondly, my husband is not cheating and despite his very poor choice of wording on that occasion, he’s generally a really good guy. That’s why it cuts so deep when occasionally, he messes up and does or says something hurtful. Divorce isn’t even remotely in my thoughts. This for us, was a great opportunity to re-evaluate what is important to each of us (because believe it or not, late forties ‘us’ are not the same people we were when we met in our late teens and we’re not even the same people we were 10 years ago or when we were first married with babies. People change over time and we are no exception). We are learning who we are separately and together, during this period of our lives. We are approaching empty-nester age. Although, both our sons still live at home, they work full time and we all pretty much do our own thing.

I was hoping in my last post that my husband’s core personality shone through, despite his dismal choice of words the morning of our cats passing. The fact he is a non-confrontational person. He has always been our family diplomat. Helping our boys, and myself through how to manage conflict in and outside our home on many occasions. He is very loving, evidenced by his acknowledgement on the tarmac that our cat was going to be euthanized in the next couple of days, by the warm hug when he got home and the verbal appreciation for a nice home cooked meal. He is also very fair. We both work full-time. We both contribute to the care of our home and our children and pets. He cooks, he shops, he cleans just as much as I do. He remembers birthdays and special occasions. He is a wonderful life partner… But that doesn’t mean he’s perfect. None of us are.

He loves good food and his love language is acts of service. He had been living off of take away and restaurant dining in his 8 days overseas. I knew a home cooked meal was a way I could provide him with love and support (knowing how his trip ended) which is ultimately why I chose that route instead of running the gauntlet, trying to get to the airport to meet him after the news of our cats imminent passing.

The marathon had been a sore spot for months (as evidenced by my very first post several months back), and he knew it. As I mentioned in my previous posts, he signed up at the finish line of a half-marathon he ran with friends 6 months prior. Although I do miss some of his events, I was  at that particular half-marathon, but not with him when he signed up, as he was in the competitors area and I was standing with the spectators.

 When he signed up, the marathon had already sold out. He was on the waiting list. He knew his mates would be disappointed if he didn’t sign up. He thought I would be upset if he did (because it was running on our anniversary). So, trying to be diplomatic and avoiding conflict, he figured if he signed up to a sold-out event, he could please everyone. Of course, it took less than a fortnight for the confirmation to come through that he was elevated from the waiting list to official entrant... Yep. I was pissed!

Please also understand, the lunacy of this situation is that if he had just asked me ‘How do you feel about me running a marathon on our wedding anniversary?’, I would have been absolutely fine with it! I very much subscribe to the belief that we should support each other to live our best lives. What annoyed me was the complete disregard of consultation in the lead up. You can bet he and his running friends had been discussing this marathon for weeks leading up to formally signing up. All he needed to do was mention it to me and we would have made plans to celebrate our anniversary around it. So it wasn’t his decision to run a marathon that annoyed me, it was the fact he did it without bringing me into the plan until decisions had been made and money had been spent.

So, you can bet in the 6 months between him signing up and the discussion over breakfast, he well and truly understood that he had messed up by not including me in the decision-making process. Thus we arrive at the breakfast (he made), the day of our cats passing. Knowing how upset I was that he had made the decision to run without first checking our plans for our anniversary, and knowing how I was grieving and anticipating having to put our cat down later that day, he just word vomited the comment about failing the supportive wife test. There was no test. He was genuinely worried that I was so unforgiving of his choice to run that I wouldn’t be at the sidelines supporting him in his biggest challenge to date, so he tried to apply some pressure in the form of a good old fashioned guilt trip. For this, he has apologized.

After breakfast on Tuesday, he went to work and I rang the vet to book our beautiful girls appointment with Rainbow Bridge. I informed the family of the time if they wished to attend to see her on her way. My husband was at the clinic waiting for me when I pulled up. He held my hand and rubbed my back while I poured buckets of tears as she peacefully slipped away.

That Friday (2 days before the marathon), hubby booked us a lunch at a very high end restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. On our anniversary proper (Sunday), hubby wished me a happy anniversary, made me coffee and delivered to me in bed and then headed out to collect his friends and start his run. I met him at the halfway point with cow bells and a Hawaiian shirt which I had custom ordered the same weekend he told me about his marathon. It was adorned with bright pink hibiscus flowers… and his face. All of his running friends and supporters had a good laugh at the shirt. I then raced home to grab our eldest son and we ubered back to meet him at the end. Both of us in the printed Hawaiian shirts for the finish. He was so grateful we had made the effort that it was his turn to be teary. And I was able to drive him and his friends who had also competed home. This gave them all some recovery and debrief time on the way home.

No cheaters, no divorces. No animosity, no vengefulness or counselling required. We talked it through over several months, we expressed our own feelings and positions, identified ours priorities and we are heading into our 24th year of marriage (29th year together) with a greater understanding and commitment to each other and our lives together.",4,1730602515.0,u_raggedyange77,0,1.0,False

However, now he screams each time i wake up, go to the bathroom, making my coffee, eating. Even when i do let him out he still screams out of the cage.
I checked his body for maybe broken bones or wounds, checked his breath for maybe sickness.
Nothing, he's all good.

Only thing i found different was that the weather is rainy and stormy the past week but is mostly cloudy the past two days however, naturally the rain brought the humidity level up.

And I've read that it might be mating season?

I had him for almost 5 years, the only time he done this was when i was stressed around finals.

1gidcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gidcvv/disappointed_by_the_lack_of_care_in_the_kenway/,Disappointed by the Lack of Care in the Kenway Mansion Memory in AC Syndicate,"Let me start by saying I’m an old-school Assassin’s Creed fan. I’m finally on my first run of the newer games, starting with Syndicate. To say I’m disappointed in the way they handled the Kenway mansion in this game is an understatement.

The main purpose of this memory sequence is nostalgia—right? A callback to the Kenway trilogy and Black Flag, a game we AC veterans hold particularly close to our hearts. I was really hoping this memory would be a fitting tribute, something to make us old-timers shed a tear or two for the Kenways.

Honestly, Syndicate surprised me up to this point—I was enjoying it. But when I got to the Kenway mansion memory, I couldn’t believe how shallow and careless it felt. THE SAME GENERIC PAINTING appears at least twenty times, random portraits of nobodies are plastered everywhere, and the level design feels like any other building in the game. But this *isn’t* any other building. This is the Kenway mansion.

Would it really have been so hard to add portraits of Edward, Tessa, Haytham, or Jenny? Just a few details to honor the legacy and help us feel the weight of this place in AC lore? And before anyone says, “Well, the building changed ownership”—sure, maybe, but that’s no excuse here. And even if you are going to argue that point, seriously Templars wtf? This memory is about the nostalgia trip. If they’d invested a bit of thought, it would’ve made such an emotional impact. Instead, it’s just… frustrating.

And don’t even get me started on the “memorabilia” we’re supposed to find. Edward’s hat casually lying on a coffee table? It feels careless and cheap. It could have been so easy to hit all the right notes here, but they chose the quick route instead, and the result is an experience that’s hollow, almost disrespectful to the Kenways, the manor in particular, and their importance to AC lore.

Syndicate had a real chance to bring the past alive here, but instead, I’m left more angry than nostalgic. Anyone else feel this way?",0,1730602180.0,assassinscreed,3,0.43,False

* New build or upgrade?

I want a whole new computer anyway, this one is kinda old and ive already had to replace the motherboard because someone spilled coffee on it and upgrade the hard drive to solid state because it was too slow, but even those are a while back.

* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

My wireless rechargeable mouse, it works via bluetooth, USB-c port, or USB-A port, so as long as i have at least one of those i should be okay. And My headphones, currently I am working on finding some decent affordable bluetooth headphones because i like to walk around with headphones in and the chords tend to catch on everything, because I'm a klutz, but for now all i have is ones with the standard size headphone jack.

* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)

Sims 4, Toontown Rewritten, Big Fish Games, and streaming Netflix, Hulu, etc.

* Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

Northern California, on a mountain just north of San Francisco.

* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

need a laptop, I don't have room for a desktop, (idk what you mean by number, 15""-17"" would be good, HD or UHD prefered, again hu? i understand what that is, but idk whats considered slow or fast, but i want faster). i tend to walk in the room and things just start working, i never had to make an effort to figure out what the vocab and specs. were. is that cuz im a millennial?

* Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

I'm mainly trying to figure out how much i should save, but hoping i can keep it under $400, but idk if that's even possible, so I'm just trying to find out.

* WiFi or wired connection?

WiFi, idk if our router does wired, but i do know i don't want to be chained to my moms dresser if it does.

* Size/noise constraints?

quieter the better, I'm not the only one without my own room and i can keep some pretty weird hours when I have a hard time sleeping. Outside of it needing to be a laptop for space reasons, no restriction on size.

* Color/lighting preferences?

i prefer to have a standard (not backlit) keyboard unless someone knows how to make it easier to read what keys are there with the light off, it helps read them at night with it on, but i need to use a book light anyway, cuz i do a lot of notes for games on flash cards. as for color, not pink, i hate pink, im a girl, im just fine with being a girl, but i hate pink.

* Any other specific needs?

Win 11, lots of USB ports, and high RAM and SSD. i know im trying to get filet mignon on a round steak budget, but apparently if you cut the middle of a tenderloin out, the middle is your filet. Soooo, maybe a little creativity could make this work too? ",2,1730602128.0,buildapcforme,1,1.0,False

I had a table of two, asked what they would like to drink, came back with their coffees and then asked if they’d like a couple of minutes to decide. Routine stuff. I thought it was a middle aged man and his elderly mom.

I started taking their order and she ordered blueberry pancakes, then paused for a second while looking at the menu. She then ordered two pieces of French toast. I take a lot of breakfast orders and this was strange, I looked up from my notepad and noticed that half of her face was sagging down. I looked to the man that was with her and he was looking at his menu so I got his attention, he asked if they could have a minute.

I knew something was wrong and kind of lingered outside of where they were (we have ONE table in separate room that luckily they were at) and eventually the man poked his head out and said we needed an ambulance.

My manager was right there so I told her, she ran to the phone and was talking to dispatch. I kept an eye on her tables while this was happening but felt awful about it, I just wanted to be there for this older lady. 

Turns out she was not his mom but his wife, she was only 67 but looked much older. She has cancer and has been going through treatment for years. 

I held the doors open for the EMTs and they got there very quickly. Being in the separate room they at least had some privacy. 

They emailed the restaurant today and she is doing okay, next time they come in breakfast is on us. 

I’m so happy that she is doing okay but it was a really rough day for me. I spent most of the day crying out back between helping other guests. 

I guess I’m just hoping that I’m not selfish for being affected by this. I think that I was calm in the moment and handled it as best that I could, but I was just so scared. ",52,1730601974.0,TrueOffMyChest,12,0.97,False

Throwing this out there to see if there’s anyone who might be interested in building something from the ground up. I’ve been working on an idea that I think has real potential, and I’m looking to connect with someone who’s not only skilled technically but genuinely excited by big-picture thinking and the startup journey.

So here’s the deal: I’m in the early stages of a project that could use a strong technical backbone. The concept involves [mobile applications coupled with AI technologies, e.g., AI, machine learning, blockchain, etc.], and it’s aimed at tackling a huge society problem. The scale is really massive. I don’t want to dive into every detail here. Happy to chat live. If you are located in USA, that would be superb.

What I’m really looking for is someone who feels driven by tech problems worth solving. Are there any fields you’re super excited about right now? Do you love the idea of building a product from scratch? Or maybe you’ve got a side project that aligns with some of this – either way, I’m all ears.

If you’re wondering about the kind of partnership I’m after, here’s the gist: a team where each co-founder is empowered and can lean into their strengths. I’d love to know what you value in a co-founder and what kind of work culture you thrive in. Whether you’re into autonomy or like a more collaborative flow, I’m flexible but also value open communication and a strong vision.

For my part, I’m all about transparency and keeping things real. I’m committed to contributing my own expertise in [Strategy, Building products, scale, Customer Centricity and mass scale adoption], but I really want to build this vision collaboratively, especially with the tech direction you’d bring in. If you’re the type who loves a good challenge, or if you get excited about projects that could actually make a difference, let’s talk!

I press buttons.

White means ready.

Red: Finished.

Yellow: Eject.

When the machine is ready, I press:

Forward.

Forward.

Left.

Forward.

Wait three minutes, then hit eject.

It's good pay for what I do, which is sit and press buttons. I have a screen showing me a bird's-eye view of the machines, but I don't see the process. 

The screen displaying it is locked. 

Unless there's an emergency, I don't see anything. 

The music drives me mad.

It's so *loud*, especially during processing.

It's always that same tune, *When you wish upon a star*, on repeat. 

I had a headache, so after pressing the usual buttons (forward, forward, forward, left, forward), I reached for my coffee, taking a scorching sip—

Spilling it all over myself, and the control panel.

“Fuck!”

I grabbed a napkin; my gaze glued to the panel which was toast. Right in the middle of processing product#127890. 

I was about to stab the emergency button under my desk when the music… stopped. That constant tune bleeding into my brain came to an abrupt halt, and something else cut through the uneasy silence. Initially, I thought it was a machine acting up—but no. 

Something ice-cold wriggled down my spine. 

*Screams.* 

I could hear agonizing screams. When the locked screen flashed up, I found myself staring inside Unit 56. 

All I could see was red dripping from the walls, the ceiling, spinning blades slowly descending from every angle, needles and saws inches from a guy. 

Early twenties. I could see where the work had begun on his face, peeling a chunk of flesh from his cheekbones. 

He stood with his arms by his sides, swaying, and after I stabbed a button with an eye symbol, he jerked suddenly, blinking rapidly, waking up.

His face was *inches* from a frozen saw. 

The boy's lips parted, a guttural cry rattling my skull. 

“Help me,” he whispered, straining against metal arms restraining him.

“I'm… I’m going to,” I choked. “Calm down. What's your name?”

The boy broke down, and I noticed, my gut twisting, I could see his skull. 

“Sam.” he whispered. “I want to go… home.”

I couldn't respond. 

“Why can't I feel anything?” Sam sobbed. 

“Eleanor?” My manager's voice crackled through my talkie. “If there's a problem, press the overload button.”

I couldn't move.

Couldn't breathe.

“Eleanor?” My manager repeated. “All right, I'll do it from my end.”

No. 

I dived forward. 

I don't remember shrieking or moving.

I moved to the city from Chicago about 4 months ago, and I’ve really struggled to just get out and meet people. The people I’ve encountered have been friendly, but I haven’t made any sustained connections.

A bit about me:
I’m Black, queer, and nonbinary. Just turned 30 (yes, I am a Libra!) I’m into music (anything but country, lol), movies (love psychological thrillers and horror), sports (I play flag football), and anything artsy/creative. I’m pretty shy at first but I am the biggest goofball once I warm up to you. 

Anyway. Feel free to comment or DM if you’d wanna hang out. I love coffee. Maybe we can meet at a coffee shop or something? I’m open!",44,1730601316.0,baltimore,19,0.81,False

1gid2o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gid2o6/aio_bf_texting_another_girl_didnt_tell_me/,AIO: bf texting another girl & didn’t tell me,"My (34f) bf (40m) and I have been together for 8 years. Our relationship has been somewhat solid for the most part. He is a loving, supportive person and is big on acts of service as a love language (he makes me coffee, will massage me, etc). I feel loved by him constantly.

However, one of the biggest issues in our relationship is his lack of communication. Little things and big things. It’s hard to get details out of him when I ask how his day was, he doesn’t really express his feelings when I’ve done something that upsets him, etc. I’ve brought this up and explained that it makes me feel disconnected from him because I feel like he’s never really open to me. He says it’s because there’s nothing really big that happened or if I do something wrong, it’s not worth making a big deal out of him. We’ve talked about this plenty of times and he explains that because of the way he was raised, he’s not used to speaking up and would rather just go with the flow. We’ve talked about how the way he was raised wasn’t healthy and we tried to work on it together on our own but it wasn’t working. He began developing anxiety as he was forced to face things he has always ignored and  because of this, he decided to begin therapy and I’m honestly very proud of him for it. 

For the most part, the therapy helped much more than us trying on our own. His anxiety lessened over time and it seemed we were making progress. The issue is that I feel like we keep going in the same circle where it’ll be great and then I’m shut out or he won’t communicate and it feels like we are back at square one. 

I know he is working hard in therapy and I know he loves me and that’s ultimately why he’s doing this. But I think he forgets that I’m putting in almost as much work as he is. It takes a lot of mental strength to be supportive 24/7 and be the cheerleader when he can’t be. Especially when we hit another bump and I feel hurt and trying to push past it to keep going. 

A few days ago on Halloween, my phone was dying while at his family’s home,  so he went to go charge it for me and gave me his phone to use in the meantime. I 100% trust him and cheating has never been something I was scared of. His Instagram is really boring and full of sports things, so I went into his messages because I am a chismosa. I didn’t really think I’d see anything because it’s usually him texting me or his siblings or work things. I found a text thread with “Maybe: Sofia (fake name)” (the way iPhones do it when it’s guessing who the contact is). I didn’t read much, because I was in shock, but scrolled up enough to realize it wasn’t a few texts messages. They had shared music and shared jokes and stuff like that. I really was in shock because I didn’t know what to make of it. He came into the room and I told him that I was trying to remain calm and asked him who Sofia was. He said it was an old coworker friend from years ago and said it wasn’t anything untoward. I asked him why I didn’t know about her since it wasn’t anything bad and he said he didn’t know why he didn’t tell me, he just didn’t. But that it something from therapy his therapist suggested when they were discussing his problems with non-romantic interpersonal relationships. He has told me about it briefly and said his therapist had suggested working on it by reaching out to a friend he hadn’t spoken with in a long time and had let the friendship die. He never mentioned anything about it after that so I didn’t know he had started on it by doing this. 

I do believe him when he says that it wasn’t anything inappropriate because in the brief texts I saw I didn’t see anything weird like heart emojis or anything. But I am still hurt that he didn’t say anything. I had seen some texts where they were talking about me, but not too many details as I didn’t really read through anything for too long as I scrolled up. 

What really hurts is that there was this whole person he is speaking to that I know nothing about, even when they spoke about me and he didn’t think to mention it to me at all. I’d ask him for updates on whatever he wanted to share with me from his therapy sessions and he didn’t have anything like this to say. I feel like I am putting in work and I’m not getting the same work put in from him. I’m hurt that this person is getting music recommendations and whole ass conversations while I’m trying to beg for any details sometimes. 

If he had mentioned that he was going to do this, I’d like to think that I would have supported and encouraged this and would not have a problem with it. But now I’m just confused and hurt and can’t help but see it as a betrayal even while I can acknowledge that he is working on something I told him I had a problem with (his communication).

TLDR: I'm wondering how people get quality rest during the daytime when they're ""wired but tired.""

Longer Version:

During a crash, I'm utterly exhausted, but I have trouble falling asleep (at night and during the daytime) because my body cranks out adrenaline. I seem to be stuck in that ""tired but wired"" state. 

I have tried meditation, calming music, reading, aromatherapy, Holy Basil, chamomile, audiobooks, therapy, cuddling with my dog, and other things... but it's really hard to get rid of the tension and hyper-arousal. 

Anxiety may be partly to blame (I'm worried about my illness getting worse). And I'm also guilty of having an ""overactive mind."" I seem to crave stimulation (even when I'm exhausted).

ADHD medications can calm down my mind, but they also make it harder to sleep at night (just like coffee).  I would like to spend less time looking at screens, but it's hard when you're stuck in bed and bored. 

Either way, this cycle of ""exertion->crash->adrenaline->inability to sleep"" is driving me crazy. How do you calm down your body so you can fall asleep during crashes? ",7,1730600469.0,cfs,6,1.0,False

Had unprotected sex 6 months ago. The only symptom that i have right after that was urge to pee. Just in case, i made a hiv/syphilis test that went negative and went to an urologist. He told me that since there was no discharge of any type i did not have to worry about it and it was too soon to check for any STD. That most likely was stress. It disappeared 1 week after, so kind that i forgot about it.

Now, this urge to pee came back like 2 weeks ago. The weird thing is that it came back right after i shave my anus which i dont know if its a coincidence or has to do with it.

I felt really stressed this couple of weeks bc of it. Read online that the urge to pee could be prostate inflamation so i quit cigarettes , coffee, and masturbation (im addicted to porn so i beat my meat very often) This last 3 days the urge to pee went way better but a new symptom appeared. I feel incredibly tired from all my body. Like if im about to get sick or something. Is this bc of stress or has to do with STD symptoms?

Oh and i made the Vih/sifilis test again and went negative.

I of course said Yes I’d be happy to. Days later I meet up with her to grab coffee whenever I walk in I’m wearing casual clothes and she seems to be wearing a Sunday School/Church type of dress (already a bad start) we sat down and the first thing she asked me about was my faith (Both of us are Christian) I was kinda shocked by the answer cause I’ve never been with a girl before who’s ever asked that question until way later on so I skim through my religious views real fast and she tells me hers. Looking back I think that was a trick question to see if she wanted to pursue me and I failed (even though we have the same viewpoints, I just didn’t know what to exactly say at the time) After that though it went great and I got her to laugh and we talked about a bunch of different hobbies/interests.

The trip started everything was going so well till i started having nausea and diarrhea then everything went nuts i was nuts felt like i was in a loop in that washroom trying to do my stuff, then i went back in bed with my friends and his gf and we started talking even tho before i was alone on the bed in the living room and listening to pink floyd it was so good but when i went there and she said like (the gf of my friend) im ur mother or some love stuff like you should love everyone. 
Then i started talking abt my ex situationship who i really had bad time to move on from then everything went even worst and went to the washroom again then barely remember anything, i was jumping off apparently trying to go outside pee everywhere and throwing up in washroom till both of my friends saw me naked and i didn’t know that was actually all real.
Till i actually managed to go outside then the gf of my friend came to me and when she holded my hand to come back i literally grabbed her after i thought she was my ex situationship (i already deeply apologize to her and she understood it as the trip sitter) then the worst part my mom called to get some coffee since the store i work in has a coffee shop and i answered her saying everything (she forgot that i told her im not gonna be home).
Then it even got worst where when she heard my voice she started screaming and asking me where i am till my friends gf took the phone and told her everything then it even got worst where my mom is really a religious person and she doesn’t even know that mushrooms can be psychedelics she thought i was on some drugs or idk and she is really strict abt it like would kick me out so i got even more stressed out and when she came she brought my old coworker with her cz he finished his shift and i was in a such miserable state that i barely recognized him and i thought everything was a dream so i could just do wtv i want but i was in a dream where i will stay there for ever and thought abt death multiple time and just giving up on my body in my friends house.
When i came home my sister helped me and then i started talking abt my situationship and how she left me this and that… and started apologizing to her if i did something bad to her and then my mom came and started talking and i was confessing to her that i did that multiple times and im so sorry and asking her to don’t kick me out and that im always doing my best at school for her…
But i couldn’t sleep bcz they took my phone since i was calling random people but i even got even more worried where i wanted to check to my friend and if everything what happened is real or no. Anyway my mom concluded that i need some therapy help since i told her that psychedelics help with post traumatic events and help you feel better which helped me before but that one idk why it was so different. Now i feel so bad for everyone i tried my best to apologize but i dont think i will ever trip with anyone else since that was my first time doing it with people.
 I just wanted to share this story hope i get some honest opinions thanks.
