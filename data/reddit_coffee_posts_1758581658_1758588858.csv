I can't actually remember what they were advertising for, but it was a guy starting a terrible day where he wakes up late, cuts himself shaving, spills coffee on himself in the car, then gets a flat tire, goes to change it and it starts raining, then he trips and steps on the hubcap where he stowed his keys which catapult into a nearby storm drain, and then he breaks his glasses while trying to fish them out.

1no3je6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1no3je6/i_live_alone_in_a_houseboat_on_the_bayou/,I live alone in a houseboat on the bayou. Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

Friendly smile, gym rat, nothing more. She’d grab her coffee, sometimes a protein bar, and chat with the cashier about the Yankees. No one could have predicted what would happen when that asteroid hit the Hudson last month.The news called it just another meteorite. But Liz? She went down to the crash site before anyone else. Witnesses say she reached out and touched the glowing rock before the authorities could rope it off. That’s when things got… weird.Another draft Her body didn’t just change—it expanded. Bones hardened like steel, muscles swelled beyond human limits, her skin shimmered with a faint cosmic glow. Within hours, she was towering over skyscrapers, her voice echoing through Manhattan like thunder. She didn’t crumble under the weight—she owned it. The people of New York started calling her Goddess Liz, and honestly, the name stuck.When she first stepped into downtown, her foot flattened half a city block. But it wasn’t malice—she looked shocked, even apologetic. Still, each move caused destruction. Streets split, rivers rippled like someone dropped a stone into them. Yet, strangely, she seemed almost calm, like the power belonged to her all along.

Now there’s debate everywhere:

Is she protector or destroyer?

Did the asteroid choose her?

And most terrifying of all—if one rock made Liz into this… what happens if there are more?

1no3i8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1no3i8k/i_live_alone_in_a_houseboat_on_the_bayou/,I live alone in a houseboat on the bayou. Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp.

Idk if anyone here has heard of cupsleeves, but they’re a thing that Kpop fans do, essentially celebrating either a birthday, an album anniversary/release, etc. You all meet up at a coffee or boba shop, there’s cute decorations to take pictures with, there’s people selling their art or other handmade items, and when you buy a drink, you get a cupsleeve for the drink, hence the event being called a cupsleeve. I’ve noticed that a good portion of mcr fans also tend to be Kpop fans, so I thought this would kind of be a fun crossover! I kind of wanted to plan one for the Danger Days album anniversary, November 22nd! This post is just to gauge interest for a Chicago one, maybe if it goes well I could host events elsewhere too!!

Anyway for context: he complained that I ask him to hold things for long periods of time. This is a very skewed perspective in my eyes. Today when I asked him to hold my coffee because I had my phone in one hand, bag on my shoulder, and pastry in another hand. He nudged me to finish the pastry, which I did and resumed holding it. Then about two minutes later he said that I viewed him as a cup holder. I said that he was bitching over practically nothing. 

Then in his car he said that because he’s sassy I have to stop complaining about him bitching ( in this instance) before he clocks my shit. To which I said I’ll clock him right back. 

After we depart from each other he sent this. 

I feel like im the asshole for giving my two cents about the situation instead of fawning to what he said about feeling disrespected numerous times. 

Idk man.

1no3e6e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1no3e6e,Rolife Event - Silent Corner,"Here is my version of Silent Corner. I’m not a mom, but I am an auntie, and this is pretty much what I envision my ideal study to look like - bright, airy, able to be turned into a pillow fort at a moment’s notice, but still a relaxing place for me when the kids all go home. I completed the realism by leaving a forgotten cup of coffee on the highest shelf because that is absolutely something I would do.

I started out by spray painting everything with a white primer while still in the boards because I absolutely loathe the color brown, and if I was going to do this, I was committing, dammit! 

The blue paint is the same paint I painted my irl office. I didn’t like the flat, paper books (c parts) so I traded most of those out for books purchased on Amazon and used a mix of children's books and classic novels. I colored the floor squares white and used nail stickers to give it the tile look. I probably made that window seat five times from different types of materials before I was like, “Look, it’s fine. Be done already” 😂

I made the cushions and curtain from scrap fabric glued over foam - the yellow cushion is actually fabric from an old umbrella from H&M. The toys are from…somewhere? I’ve had them in my “maybe I’ll use these someday” pile, and I was excited to find a use for them finally. 

This was a lot of fun, and I'm pretty proud of it, especially that floor, but RIP the four white acrylic markers and the can of white spray paint I went through, lol. ",6,1758587752.0,booknooks,2,1.0,False

I just got Earfun Air 2 NC, and I’ve found that I’m not a fan. I am looking for something to replace them in the sub $50 range (bought these with the autumn / school start sale).

Case: Got a new lobe piercing and want something noise cancelling for the next several weeks until the piercing has healed and I can wear my headphones comfortably again (Bose QuietComfort). For earbuds, I typically wear Apple 2nd gen airpods, which I love for the fit (and will probably ruin soon from wearing them to the gym too often…)

Reasons I didn’t like the EF2NC:

* size! bigger than I expected, the back part of the earbud hits my ear (antihelix area), causing discomfort
* noise cancelling. Sometimes it \*amplifies\* sounds rather than dulling them. I initially thought that they were significantly worse that the Bose QC, but in an otherwise quiet environment, neither of them were able to completely block out the sound of a nearby leaf blower. (The Bose QC might have been able to if I’d taken off my glasses). However, in a somewhat quiet café, the EF2NC made some of the intermittent sounds louder (coffee machine, variations in air vents, bell when door opens, shouting out names for orders)
* Seal does not hold in ear. I tried different size silicone tips (at least they don’t completely fall out like the the OnePlus Z/Z2 that I’ve tried)
* not a full enough sound to block out the noise even when the NC doesn’t really work. trust me, i tried all the EQ options i could



Other solutions I’ve considered:

* keep these but buy foam tips (not ideal because the back of the earbud will still hit my ear)
* give up on noise cancelling earbuds and just suck it up for a few weeks (not ideal for current work situation)



Last question: how can I tell from online reviews whether the back of the earbud is going to hit my ear? Is there something specific in reviews I should be paying attention to?

* ✅ Home services like fencing, plumbing, roofing, and landscaping
* ✅ Community favorites – from unique shops to cultural spots

I’m adding new businesses daily, but the site is already live and ready to use. If you own a business in Knoxville, you can even **claim your listing** and boost visibility for local customers searching online.

We met when I was 19 and he was 20 in college. I come from a strict Muslim Arab background and he comes from a strict Indian background. My parents were very abusive and caused a lot of problems (mostly for me) when throughout our engagement. My husband first told his sister about us when we were just dating and her reaction was absurd, she called him stupid and said that he is making a big mistake. Keep in mind she knew nothing about me at this point as he went to college out of his hometown and his sister is younger than him. Before and during and after our engagement she has always been really mean to me, saying extremely mean comments and being condescending for example she would tell me that my husband (fiancé at the time) and I must have a lot of problems because we’re different, constantly makes comments about my job, comments about my appearance, my family, my friends, and whenever I would visit she would give me a dirty look and go back to her room. His mom throughout our engagement was somewhat nice, didn’t really have a lot of problems with her. Before we got married, they threw me a dholki (an Indian pre wedding party) which I didn’t ask for and at the dholki it felt more like my sil was the one getting married. I was left in a corner with no one talking or dancing with me and all the guests were her friends and they were throwing her up and dancing with her and I remember going back to my apartment and crying. My sil didn’t like me to the point that she had me blocked on instagram and I messaged her about it to ask why she did that and she gaslit me and said that wasn’t the case and called his mom crying and said that I yelled at her and his mom called my husband and screamed at him about me. After we got married, my husband got laid off and everyone was really mean to us and gave us a lot of unsolicited advice even though it was during the worst job market and I was doing my best to keep us afloat, I even started babysitting on the weekends next to my full time job. My husband made me promise that we would have to be nice to them so if we needed them, we would have someone to fall back on. We hid the fact that he got unemployed as long as possible and when my mother in law found out, she called me and yelled at me on the phone saying she thought I would be her open book to her son. I told her that this was something between me and my husband and it’s inappropriate for her to yell at me. Fast forward since my husband and I kept ass kissing everyone in his family, they somewhat started being nice to us. His sister gotten close to me, she would tell me about the things she is going through and never asking me about anything I was going through. My husband got a job and we decided to take on a trip with my brother in law. My bil accidentally told my sil about the trip and she invited herself. During the trip I was put on all the responsibilities for booking every. Single. Thing. And I missed up on the time of booking a train and she went off on me and called me condescending and I went to the bathroom and cried. The same week, we were supposed to go see something and I’d gotten us tickets to see it, I didn’t account for traffic and we missed it, same thing happened and I got treated with the silent treatment for the rest of the trip and it was an hour and a half away and my husband drove the way there and was extremely tired and we assumed that she couldn’t drive (she had an accident w a rental and said she had ptsd) so I drove at night for an hour and a half in the rain and no one thanked me. The next day, she took the car and went to get coffee which was let’s say the final straw. I sent her a message when we got back home saying that I’m no longer going to be ok w being steamrolled and she was being an ahole to me since she met me. My husband felt hurt and told his mom which I talked to as well then she called him today and told him that I’m a horrible person and not civil for sending her the message and we were lying and she cried to her about me and to keep me away from their family because I’m not a part of it.

You know that moment of truth with a new jar of pickles? You get a good hold, brace yourself, and nothing happens. Your fingertips go white, your knuckles ache, and this little tremor starts in your hand. It’s such a weird feeling, like your own body is politely refusing to cooperate. I used to just pass it to someone else, feeling a bit defeated.



I never really thought about my grip until I tried helping my dad move a bookshelf. My arms felt okay, but my hands just gave out. It was a strange kind of weakness, separate from overall strength. It made me realize how much we take for granted that our hands will just… work, until they don’t with a satisfying \*pop\*.



It’s funny the things you notice. I remember my grandfather, a carpenter, could pinch a heavy hammer between his thumb and forefinger and just hold it there, steady as a rock. I wondered if that was just something people used to have, a kind of latent strength from different daily habits.



Then a friend who plays guitar had one of those spring-loaded handgrips on his coffee table. He said it was for building finger endurance for chords. Out of curiosity, I started using it for a few minutes each night while watching TV. At first, I could barely squeeze it a dozen times.



But after a few weeks, I reached for a jar of salsa and it opened on the first try, no drama, no shaky fingers. It wasn’t about getting hugely muscular; it was just about those specific little muscles in my hand finally having enough stamina to finish the job. It felt less like a workout victory and more like I’d just fixed a glitch I’d always assumed was normal.

My friend Josie and I, both 19 F, had a sleepover at my house yesterday and now my mom is genuinely distraught. 

   Josie and I met sophomore year of highschool. We got along pretty well within the little friend group we had at the time, but we started to hang out a lot more around a year ago when I started college. She loves making art and so do I, so we often hang out at coffee shops and draw together, or we’d go over to one another’s house and do little crafts. I’m neurodivergent and very socially awkward so it’s often difficult for me to make and keep friendships. I love her so much as a friend though, conversations with her are always so fun and we have a lot of things in common. My social battery runs out pretty quickly with most people, but I’m never tired when her and I hang out, and she seems to enjoy my company as well which makes me really happy.

   Now, for context. I am queer, but I have never been in a relationship or been necessarily interested in anyone. Josie is a lesbian, our highschool was based in an arts program, so 80% of the people there were also queer including our friend group. Unfortunately, I’m terrible at hiding things from my mom,, mostly due to the way I was raised as well as her being somewhat of a helicopter parent with me throughout majority of my life. I have had to fight for my privacy and independence many times. In summary, she is very aware my friends are queer, including Josie.

   Within the past year, Josie and I got into a routine of hanging out 1-2 times per week. Typically 2-9 pm on sundays where we either go to a cafe or go over to one another’s house. My mom thinks this is very strange and points it out often. I have talked to her about this many times in the past and insisted that there is nothing romantic going on between us, but keeps giving me the silent treatment every time she ‘thinks’ we’re doing something we’re not supposed to. I can tell she doesn’t like having Josie over.

   Yesterday, in a spur of the moment descision,  I invited Josie to spend the night at my house and have a sleepover. We were having a lot of fun and I had gotten a notification that there would be thunderstorms till 1am, so I brought up the idea. We’d been planning on having a sleepover for months now, but scheduling was always a challenge, so we were really excited to hopefully be able to that night. I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal to have her stay over since my mom was already so familiar with her, so I didn’t think too much of it. 

   I went downstairs a few moments later to bring up the idea with my mom, and she was very adamant on sending Josie home. Looking back, I feel pretty guilty that I ended up convincing her to let Josie stay over since I know it made her uncomfortable. I was feeling very frustrated, I still felt like a child at almost 20 years old. I’d only been allowed a sleepover maybe once or twice as a kid, and I was really looking forward to staying up and watching dumb movies with my friend. 

   In the end, she let her stay, but made sure to place conditions. The lightbulb in the upstairs hallway was out so I had to replace it, I would also have to keep my door open, and when we’d turn in for the night I’d have to go downstairs and share the bed with my mom while Josie slept in my bed. I have a twin bed and no blow up mattress. Josie and I were genuinely fine with sharing my bed, I know to some people that might sound weird, and my mom did scrutinize me when i told her the same thing, but I also felt embarrased saying that I’d have to ‘go downstairs to sleep in my moms bed’, which i did end up having to agree to. 

   In the end, we ended up having a lot of fun watching movies and staying up late, mostly talking about whatever. We made breakfast together in the morning and hung out a bit before I had to go to my classes. Coincidentally, one of my classes were cancelled for today so I ended up going home before my mom had come back from work. When she got home, I overheard her on the phone with my older brother, who i also live with, as they were talking about me. She was genuinely sobbing, ranting to my brother about last night, and insinuating that what i did was something dirty or disrespectful. They kept talking about how ‘they need to guide me in the right direction’ and about how ‘i don’t look lesbian but i keep showing signs’. I went downstairs to greet her after she finished, and she looked pretty embarrased when she realized I had overheard. Now she won’t look at me and is giving me the silent treatment again.

   This whole thing has made me really upset, and I’ve been thinking of hopefully moving out soon when I’m able. I love my mom, but I don’t think I can exist the way i want while i’m still living under her roof. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but a part of my brain keeps telling me i’m behaving like a brat for being upset. I would really like some other perspectives on this, I’m struggling to juggle my emotions with this situation at the moment.

Originally she wanted a Rocket (probably the Appartamento) but has since seen the Quick Mill Rubino at a home show and she really likes it. I've read the rocket might not be the best value for the money, but there isn't as much info/reviews on the QM Rubino. So I thought I'd ask for a few recommendations for different espresso machines for her to look at that are good value for the money within that same price range/level ($2,000-3,000 AUD). otherwise would the Rubino be a good choice?   
  
Located in Australia (Brisbane). We're both Complete coffee newbies. She says she likes the manual nature of the Rubino. She doesn't want a fully automatic machine as she likes the ritual of making coffee with some of the steps, but for example, doesn't like how the Appartamento TCA has the temperature control with the different temperature choices. She wants a balance between the manual steps of preparing the coffee (grind, putting coffee into the group handle, tamping etc), but doesn't want to fluff about with any settings on the machine and wants a fairly straight forward machine that takes care of everything that just pours consistent coffee. She likes the lever operation of the Rubino as opposed to a button that times the shot for you.

We drink mainly milk based drinks (Latte, flat white) but I will have the occasional espresso or water based drink (Americano etc.) as well.

1no2rww,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyersNotes/comments/1no2rww/what_should_a_truck_driver_do_to_ease_the_ache_in/,What should a truck driver do to ease the ache in their neck and shoulders during a long haul without stopping?,"https://i.redd.it/vwjamoi03tqf1.gif

You know how my uncle was a long-haul trucker for years? I remember him getting home after a week on the road, and the first thing he’d do was lean his head against the doorframe, just trying to unkink his neck. He’d always say the worst part wasn't the miles, but that deep, stubborn ache that settled in right between his shoulders, with no real way to get at it while driving.



I used to think about that a lot, especially during my own long commutes. There's this particular kind of stiffness that builds up when you're just stuck in one position, staring straight ahead. It’s not like a sore muscle from working out; it’s a heavy, static tension that feels like it’s slowly turning you to stone. You try stretching your neck at a red light, but it’s a hopeless feeling.



It’s funny how you stumble onto solutions. I was complaining about this exact thing to a friend who’s a physical therapist, not even looking for an answer, just venting. She nodded and mentioned how targeted pressure is the real key to loosening those specific muscles. She said people often try stretches, but what those knots really need is a consistent, firm touch in the right spots to actually release.



That conversation led me to this little device I keep in my car now. It’s not much to look at, but it has these two prongs that cradle the base of my skull perfectly. The first time I tried it, parked in my driveway after a grueling day, I finally understood what my uncle was missing. It was like finding the exact key for a lock I’d been jiggling the wrong one in for years. The relief was so specific and immediate, it felt less like a luxury and more like a basic tool for survival on the road.



It makes me wish I could go back and tell my uncle about it. He’d probably have kept one right on the passenger seat, next to his logbook and coffee thermos. It’s one of those small things that just makes a hard job a little more bearable.

1no2r14,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1no2r14/the_bayou_baptist/,The Bayou Baptist,"Part 1 		Help, my best friend Beau has been missing for over three weeks now. Local law enforcement has not been able to locate him… or his body. Three weeks ago Pastor Beau was giving a fill-in sermon at a church here in Louisiana; only an hour and a half outside of New Orleans where we live. Terrebonne Parish Officers first arrived on scene Tuesday morning a couple of days after Beau didn’t return home; his truck was still parked at the church. The only belongings of Beau’s were found in and outside his blue Ford; his Bible bag, now broken cross necklace, left shoe, shattered phone and, his Bible. When officers arrived on scene that humid morning, Beau’s driver side door was left fully open. His Bible lay open on the driver seat, torn to shreds; pages torn out and circled scripture. The chapters and verses that were circled were as follows. Genesis 22, Judges 11-12, Exodus 24, Matthew 8: 28-34. Parish police were not able to make a clear image or connection of the scripture to figure out where he went nor a motive for anyone to harm the good pastor. Personally as a skeptic myself, I have no idea what these passages have to do with Beau. According to Beau’s mom, Nancy, the police have told her that unfortunately the case has gone cold. I plan on taking a drive down there this week to see what I can piece together.

Part 2		I finally made it to the city Beau went missing in.  I first stopped at the church to speak with the main pastor and deacons of the congregation. Pastor Fred was out with a family emergency that week; so Joel, a deacon of the church, had reached out to Beau to see if he’d fill in. Pastor Fred so graciously gave me Joel’s cell number so I was able to call and talk with him; we had an agreement on a meeting spot. Joel suggested a small restaurant on the outskirts of town next to Dr. Weller's Blood Bank. According to Joel, “Beau and I were doing a public outreach; we would spend time praying and loving on the drug dealers, criminals, prostitutes and strippers in the area. Joel and Beau were supposed to meet at Shelly’s Men's Club in Houma Tuesday night to speak with a stripper named Sierra; they'd already spoken and prayed for her a few times before”. I asked Joel if Sierra could have a possible connection on Beau’s disappearance; he assured me that she couldn't hurt a fly. She definitely could be a person I need to seek out for more information, I asked Joel if he knew of the connections for the scripture. Joel was taken aback by what had happened to Beau’s Bible; however, he informed me that “ Genesis 22 and Judges 11-12 both contain human sacrifices”. He got noticeably nervous when he brought up what Exodus 24 talks about; “blood rituals, normally centered around the concept of atonement and covenant in the old testament”. Given the circumstances of the disappearance, the people Beau and now Joel both reached out to, his once cool and collected demeanor completely evaporated as Joel went on to speak about Matthew 8: 28-34. “Now, in those verses Jesus encountered two demon-possed men. The demons begged Jesus if you can cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs. Jesus commanded the Demons to flee the men and the demons entered the swine before the entire herd plunged down a hillside into a lake”. Joel’s hand shook ever so slightly as he placed his coffee mug back down onto the table top, I looked into his eyes searching for more information before asking him. “What possible connections do you think these have to do with Beau’s disappearance”? Joel replied rather quietly “Other than being verses and stories from the Bible, I have no clue Eric”. With that, he got up and left the restaurant. I left shortly after him, with a new destination in mind: Shelly’s Men's Club in Houma. Given that it is a Friday night, usually the busier nights for clubs like this, I hope Sierra is working. My GPS had me turn onto Meadowland Dr and park my car after the thirty minute drive there; luckily an hour after opening. I walk into this small, podunk club with one thing in mind; tracking down Sierra. This club was nothing like I was used to seeing after spending years in NOLA. The small stage and small private booths can be seen from the bar. The barkeep, a woman who looked to be around her 40s with black hair and a skimpy outfit named Tiffany, asked me in a somewhat sultry voice, “What can I get you to drink, sweetie?” I smiled politely back at her, simply telling her “I would like a Busch Light.  I am actually looking for Sierra, is she in tonight?” Tiffany said that “Sierra is working tonight and in the back changing, do you want a private session with her?” I nod my head and hand her a $5 bill for the beer I ordered before taking the beverage and informing Tiffany where I am sitting for Sierra to find me. As I sit in the back half of the room, nursing my beer, watching the girls do their dances up and down the poles waiting for Sierra, I notice a woman walk out of the changing rooms. Her blonde hair was flowing back in the breeze of her strides; some strands tangling on her pink lingerie as her voluptuous breasts jiggle with each step she takes in her bright pink heels to the bar. Tiffany hastily points Sierra in my direction, sharing some silent words before Sierra closes the distance quickly and she sits on my lap. The aroma of roses caressed my nose like a gentle breeze. “Hello handsome”, she says in a sultry voice; her back to me. She then swings her legs around to the right, putting her legs over mine; resting half of her exposed cheeks on a part of my thighs. “If you are wanting a private session honey, it is $15 clothed and $20 naked, unless you want a little something more”. Her eyes finally made contact with mine. Her eyes looked hopelessly black, soulless, like all of the love, hope and joy was violently sucked out of them. It wasn’t until she caressed my cheek that I realized she was speaking to me, “Did you want to do the $20 dance honey?”. I cleared my throat and firmly let her know I was actually here looking for Beau. She shot daggers at me from her side eye, before slowly sitting in the chair to my left. “I already told the Parrish police everything I know about his disappearance. What more information do you people need?” I took a big drink of my beer, before gently putting the bottle back down onto the table. “Sierra, I am not law enforcement. I am simply looking for my childhood best friend, we grew up together. Nothing about this case has added up for me since it happened. Do you have any possible clue where he could have gone?” I take another swig from the cold bottle, “Joel and Beau were supposed to meet you here the Tuesday night after he went missing. Are you aware of any other people he was having these meetings with?” I refrained from any further eye contact with her, as I finished my bottle. Sierra smiled as she watched me drink every last drop, before saying. “I do not know who Beau was meeting with next, but, he had a circle of people he was currently praying over and listening to.” I smile softly, “that’s great! Do you happen to remember some of the names or places he would meet them?” She looked at me, watching me intently before saying, “I don’t know all of the places but the last time I had seen Beau, Joel was mentioning their plans to meet a man named Micah, a known heroin and cocaine dealer behind the Dollar General here in town on Thursday night. Other than Micah, they had mentioned a Henry. I believe he is a cult member of some type”. Henry and Micah, Micah sounds like an easier target to track down than Hank. “Thank you! Do you have a number for either one of those guys?” She quickly says “Yes I do have some other contacts connected to these guys. If you follow me into the back, private room, I can give you some other personal information on these men.” With a firm grasp on my left hand, she guided me into the employees only entrance off the stage floor. I got up and started to follow her guidance, my knees feeling weaker and weaker by the minute. My vision began to blur, the lights in the club dancing across my dilated corneas. The once upbeat, overly loud music, sounded like I was underwater. Before I knew it, she was gently pushing me from the back into the employee entrance; slamming the door shut behind her as she walked in. The room was spinning as everything began to fade to black;  getting one last look at her, as she snears before hushly saying “you’ll never find him.”

Part 3 		As I am unzipping my Bible bag to gently put my Bible neatly inside, Joel claps my shoulder to get my attention. “Great service tonight Beau, thank you again for doing this for our congregation! Pastor Fred and I are very blessed to have you. Are you still available for dinner tomorrow night?” I turn and look at Joel before smiling, “Thank you, it’s no problem at all, we are called to serve God. I cannot deny my calling, of course I am still open for dinner tomorrow. Where was it again?” “Tumabo! Just off of LA-56, across the Bayou Petit Gaillou.” We shake hands, as I say “Sounds good, I will see you tomorrow night at 7pm for dinner with Pastor Fred!” slinging my Bible bag around my left shoulder. I followed Joel to the front door of the church. I saw from the reflection in the glass doors, as his tail lights turned onto the main road as I tried to open the doors, making sure to lock up for the night. As I begin my slowly walk to my truck, my nose is violently assaulted by the smell of death and decay; almost as if I were down wind from the local slaughter house, except that's impossible. There isn’t a slaughter house in this city, so I quickly unlocked my truck. The head light beams piercing into the dark curtain of the night, as I climb into the driver's seat. Placing my Bible bag onto the passenger seat, I look up after cranking the engine to life. There was a man, standing in between the beams; he had a severed goat’s head over his head. The blood of the goat was free-bleeding down his shirt and pants. The eye sockets had been gouged out, revealing the piercing blue eyes of the man behind the mask. I quickly cut off the engine, opened my door and stepped out of the truck; remaining behind the door. I shout with everything I muster, voice trembling “What do you want!?”. The man cocks his head to the left, staring at me with what seems like childlike wonder, I bark again. “Leave now in the name of Jesu-” my sentence being cut off as my mouth and nose were covered by a rag, as two more men wearing goat heads scoop me up from behind. I instantly tried to thrash around like a gator who caught prey. Kicking, elbowing, punching as they wrestled me to the ground. My left foot getting caught in my running boards as I thrashed. Completely ripping off my loafer and dislocating my ankle in the process. Feeling the loud pop and agony shortly thereafter. The sound of their voices muffled and got quieter as I began to lose consciousness.

Part 4		As I attempt to sit up, gasping for air, finally coming to, my drug-fueled dream is still fresh in the forefront of my mind. I slowly begin to look around the silent rundown motel room where I awoke, noticing the cobwebs that formed on the lampshade, connecting to the stained nightstand next to the bed. The cross above the door had been turned upside down, the mirror broken and the least of these. There was a giant hole surrounded by mold where the ceiling fan used to hang.  As if being in this decrepit room wasn’t bad enough, my hands and feet are tied down to the sides of the bed.  I slowly glanced around the room for something or anything to get me out of my restraints. The silence was loudly interrupted by the sounds of someone running full speed in the direction of the door, before the loud groan the old doors hinges let out as it slowly opened. Sierra was slowly crawling on all fours into the room, before crawling up the walls and onto the ceiling; her empty hungry eyes never leaving me. “Wh… what the hell is this!? What do you want from me!?” I pleaded while being frozen in terror, Sierra gleefully smiles while slowly and gracefully getting herself off the ceiling. “What do I want?? Oh sweetie, it's not what I want. It’s what I need, your blood. Every last savory drop, can’t possibly finish the ritual without it. Especially knowing what kind of man you are. Glutton, lustful, prideful, rageful. Going off half cocked with no plan, no friends and nobody to save you is exactly what brought you to me.” I began to silently sob and cry out realizing there was no way out, before a still small voice reminded me what Beau was attempting to say before he was cut off. “Leave now in the name of Jesus Christ” as those words came to me, my arm hair started to stand up on end. I began to cry out to Jesus, “Jesus please help me lord, I am a weak and feeble man; without you, your amor and protection I am nothing. With you Lord, I can do all things; please Lord I need your help and guidance! God please save me, I need you now!” The room slowly began to tremble, the already broken mirror fell off the wall shattering into many pieces. Sierra grimaced while barking “You really think he is going to save you!? He couldn’t even save Beau!” As I looked back at her, into her eyes I realized, nothing but darkness in them. No color, no life, just an empty black pit. I shouted with every ounce in me “Leave now in the name of the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, Yahweh!” As the ceiling began to crack and crumble, I felt this strange calm peace set over me. Sierra's head started to violently and rapidly shake, side to side at a fast rate of speed. Her face and body slowly shifted into a gray, decaying mess; her once blue painted nails became long sharp talons. Her lips tightly shrunken against her maw of razor sharp blood covered teeth “I said leave now in the name of Jesus Christ!” Parts of the ceiling gave way, crashing to the floor as the once upside down cross, fixed itself right side up; my shackles breaking off my appendages freeing me. Sierra immediately turned, and sprinted out of the room; her hollering and hooting slowly growing fainter before leaving me in the silence once more.

Part 5			While I am slowly but surely making my way back to the club to get my car. Walking down these empty yet brightly lit streets, the crackle of thunder and flashes of lighting began to fill the night sky. The sounds of this biblical deluge muffling the sounds of crickets, mosquitoes and  cicadas buzzing. Throwing my hood over my head, I pulled out my phone to call Joel, hoping he could point me in the direction of Henry. The line rang three times before Joel answered with a gruff but yet angry tone. “Do not call me again, Boy.” before he ended the call. Struggling to quickly shove my phone back into my pockets to keep it dry, I accidently shoulder checked a man walking past. “I am so sorry” I began to start apologizing before he cut me off. “Eric, right? You’re Pastor Beau’s friend.” I looked at him quizzically while slowly nodding. “ Great, I have a message for you. You need to keep away from Joel and that congregation, do not under any circumstances go back and look for Sierra. Her real name is Eve, Sierra is her stage name. Micah is currently in Terrebonne Parish Jail, Henry’s here in Houma further north past the club here on 316. Look for Canal Lane and take it all the way down to the trailer on the left. He will know what to do. Before he departs, he smiles and clasps my shoulder “Don’t give up hope, have faith in the Lord.” As he briskly walks away, I realized I never got his name. “Wait, who are you?” He turns back and looks at me saying “Gabriel, they call me Gabriel” before he turns behind a building out of view. I ran after him, having more pressing questions, when I got to where he turned into. There was nothing there, just a brick wall. He faded away as fast as he showed up.

Part 6				Finally getting back to my car, I saw the havoc they left for me. It was in bad enough shape spending most of its life in the rust belt of the country. They decided slicing a tire and cracking my front windshield wasn't enough.  The lambs head which was still bleeding had been placed on my drivers seat. Bloody hand prints smeared up and down the both sides of my car; covering every door. Leading to the truck lid, where most of the blood was coming from. I hesitantly slid my key into the keyhole before turning and lifting the lid. My stomach instantly began to get queasy feeling; the bile rushed up from my stomach, I gagged as my eyes met the body of the lamb. My name was carved into the side of the disfigured and disemboweled animal. While digging  around the cadaver in an attempt to find my bag, laptop and chargers, I realized just how fresh this carcass was.  The still warm blood covered my hands while I felt around for my belongings. After locating and removing my items from the trunk,I looked up at the club’s front entrance. The door was shaking violently with what sounded like Latin coming from it. I slowly approached the door, feeling the indescribable unholy heat radiating from the door.  I realized I had no time to waste. Quickly putting my stuff on the passenger floor board and throwing the lambs head out of the car, I peeled out of the parking lot heading straight to Henry’s Pulling into Henry’s gravel driveway, I could see his porch light was on. Hundreds of swarming bugs attacking the light source, I lightly knocked on the door. A middle aged native American man slowly opened the door. His black hair was tightly pulled back away from his eyes, revealing a long scar over his right eye. “Hi, I am Eric. I am looking for Henry. Is he home?” The burly man nodded his head slowly while saying “I am Henry, you may come in.” Walking into Henry’s home, I noticed the old wooden paneling that ruled the living room walls. Gator heads and skulls hung on the walls and sat on dusty bookshelves.  I spun around to look at the man as I sat gently on his couch. He started to ask me about my business being here before hearing the high pitched whistle from his tea kettle. “Can I interest you in some tea before we get into business?”  I politely decline, learning from my past mistakes. Henry sat across from me at his coffee table in his rocking chair, “ So, what brings you to me?” He pondered sipping his steaming hot cup of tea. “I am Pastor Beau’s good friend. He’s been missing for four weeks now, Joel led me to Sierra which in turn led me to you. I am simply wanting him back, he's my only true friend.” Making eye contact with Henry as he slowly blows on his tea, he nods and sets it down slowly. “Ah, I see, so it is the preacher man you are here for. Beau is a good man, I do not know of anyone who would want to cause him harm. Do you happen to know where he went missing?” He questioned as he leaned back into his chair, “Yeah, I do. It was at the Baptist church in Chauvin. After his final fill-in sermon, he was supposed to head back to New Orleans afterwards but he never came back.” “Were there any messages or indicators of who did this?” Hank immediately asked. I told him all about the damaged bible, his shoe and of course the situation with Eve. Henry’s once stoic face turned into one of worry hearing about the demon encounter.  “You mentioned a dream after she drugged you, can you remember anything about the dream? Like smells, imagery, faces?” I responded cautiously “Yeah, in the dream I could see three or four men. They had decapitated goats heads on, horns and all. The eyes had been melon-balled out so they could see out of them, the blood refalling down their clothes. The smells of rot and decay wafted from them.” Henry leaned forward putting his hands together,” can you show me where this occurred?” I nodded my head while responding “Yes, I can. It is roughly thirty to forty minutes south in Chauvin. If you’d like, we can go now.” Henry quickly stood up, while saying “let me go get my coat.” Standing up and walking out back to my car, I remembered the lamb’s carcass decomposing in the trunk of it. I could smell the rot as I got closer to the car, by the time Henry came out. He watched me as I tried my best to fight this cadaver out of my trunk, “Let me guess, a gift from the Occult?” I stopped tugging at what I believed to be bottom half of the lamb, letting its hooves hang over the lip of my tailgate. “Occult?!” I exclaimed with confusion in my words. “Yes the Occult, ever heard of em?” as he walked up next to me helping me remove the body. “Yes, who hasn’t? I just didn’t know we had members of the occult in this area of Louisiana."" Henry, while walking away with the carcass proclaims “My mother was a medicine woman, she sold members items for rituals, spells and potions often” before throwing the lamb into the pond on his property. Once the initial splash on the water subsided, more loud splashing occurred. Around ten gators began to tear the remains to pieces.

Part 7 				The squeaking of my worn down windshield wipers took over the silent droning of the road noises heading back to Chauvin. The beams from my headlights cut through the dark of night, like the word of God cuts through darkness. Rapidly approaching the town, as the final rain drops hit the windshield, Chauvin was in complete and utter darkness.  No lights were on in the city. Every stoplight and lightpost had no power, as we closed in on the church. Off in the distance, we saw a giant pillar of light coming from around the church, the light dancing off the trees reminded me of the Mardi Gras parades at night. Half a mile away from the church, we finally saw what was causing the light, the church was on fire and rapidly burning down. Pulling into the drive of the old Baptist church slowly, we could hear the sound of the old bell ring out. My headlights revealed what appeared to be the entire town. They were dancing and running around this massive fire, wearing black cloaks with decapitated animal heads on each person. Real goats, lambs, pigs and sheep heads were used as face masks. The second Henry and I pulled into the parking lot, and stopped at the scene; the townspeople all stopped, turning their attention to us, standing silently staring at us. Henry stuttered while saying “Get us the hell out of here, NOW!” Quickly throwing my car into reverse, I put my full force down on the pedal. Cutting the wheel rapidly to the right, my tires screamed in protest as the vehicle lurched fast and hard to the left. Pointing the nose of our car to the edge of town, quickly throwing the gears from reverse to drive, I gunned it out of there. Howling and hooting could be heard from the crowd as they ran to their vehicles. “What in the ever loving hell was that!?” I screamed to Henry.  Running  his hands through his hair he answered, “You won’t like the answer but the final ritual has started. I roughly know where they’ll be.” Wiping the cold sweat off my forehead, I glance over at him. “Where will they be?” Henry looked back at me, as calmly as he could before answering, “An old cemetery out in the swamp, we may need an airboat or possibly walk there with flashlights. Did you happen to bring a spare?” I shook my head no while informing him “I only have one in my bag, there might be an extra in the glovebox in case I broke down at night.” Plopping open the old glovebox, my spare rusty blue flashlight revealed itself. “Good news, we’ve got two flashlights.” Checking the mirrors, I can see the headlights of tailing vehicles following us. Glancing back at the street signs, I see the dead end sign quickly go past my drivers side window, “We are running out of road here Henry, what do we do?” “Take this bend and floor it, the cemetery is off Bayou Terrebonne anyways. The water reclaimed the land around the cemetery some years back.” The sound of my engine was louder than ever as it rapidly approached thirty eight hundred revs per minute, topping out at seventy miles per hour. Every bump tossed my car and us around the road, “We only have one mile left of road, after that its on foot” Henry shouts out over the sounds of my car. “Then what?!” I shouted back, slamming on my breaks as we got closer to the bayou. “Follow me, keep close” He answered back over the sounds of my breaks protesting the amount of pressure I am putting them under; in an attempt to stop us before we drive straight into the bayou. Immediately after the car stopped, Henry grabbed the flashlight, clicking it on before taking off into the brush. I ripped my keys from the ignition, reaching into the back for my bag and successfully grabbing my flashlight before jumping out and dead sprinting after him into the dark. The convoy of lights rapidly approached behind us.

Part 8 			I am going to try my hardest to describe what happened to Henry and I over three weeks ago. Yes, I got out of that city and I am currently safe. I checked myself into Beacon Behavioral Hospital, it's a psychiatric hospital here in New Orleans. After successfully making it across the bayou, I followed Henry through the swamp. Our flashlight beams kept reflecting off the eyes of multiple alligators. Luckily Henry kept marshmallows on hand, as a lure to keep the gators away from us. I had never seen the night sky that full of stars before, the full moon's reflection bouncing off the water, allowing us to see more. Getting deeper into this swamp, the sound of hundreds of crickets, cicadas, frogs and the obnoxious onslaught of mosquitoes kept us company on this hike. Henry and I were on constant alert for snakes, continually doing three sixties with our lights to make sure the coast was clear. One of those times, Henry’s flashlight landed on a creature with the head of a wolf, its eyes glowing red, with the body of a large man. Henry yelled something in cajun french at it before it promptly sprinted away on all fours. Encroaching on the old cemetery, we could see torches lighting up the area. Skulls of all forms of mammals were on the iron fence posts. Some were  decayed and some still decaying, maggots eating away at the heads. The sounds that had accompanied us and kept us some level of comfort had long since subsided and  all we had then was the hanging dread. The only sound was coming from the men and women in cloaks,  all chanting in Latin holding lit candle sticks.  The hot wax was running down their bare hands.  In front of this crowd, standing on a stone stage behind an altar, was Joel. Beau was tied down on this stone altar, two makeshift drains leading to a massive summoning circle embedded in the ground. As Joel finished speaking in Latin to the crowd, Eve came up from behind Joel handing him an engraved knife. Joel plunged the knife into Beau’s stomach, cutting from his stomach, tossing his intestine to the side like an unwanted toy, continuing through his ribs finishing at his collarbone. His chanting in Latin continued as he pulled out Beau’s heart, giving it to Eve as she began to eat it. Henry began to vomit as I lost it, tears flowing down my face. I couldn't help but wail at that horrific sight, forever burned in my brain. Henry and I were quickly surrounded.  They zip-tied our hands behind our backs. Now placed on our knees a few feet in front of the altar, we could see Beau’s blood draining into the circle; rapidly flowing, filling the perfectly engraved channel.  Eve began to chant, her face smeared with blood.  As she continued to chant, the blood started boiling, the ground shaking harder and harder with each word she yelled out. Some of the members began to flee in panic, others stayed to see their plan successfully unfold. The ground cracked and faltered, caving in on itself. The unholy heat blasted us immediately.  The moans and wailing could be heard coming deep from within the pit. Unfortunately for those remaining members, several long-clawed, grey and weathered decaying demons began to crawl out of the pit opening, moving lightning fast. They snuffed out the candles as they tore the members to shreds, like starving, decrepit beasts,  dragging the remains back down to the pit with them. Joel came down the steps of the stage, looking down the pit with child-like wonder, smiling at his success.  His cheerful delight was cut off when Eve grabbed him from behind. Lifting the man up in one swoop like he was made of styrofoam. He cried out in fear, “Why are you doing this!?! This isn’t a part of the p-” He was cut off as she bent him in two. The cracking and crunching of his bones often echo in my head. Some of his ribs punched through his chest, the vertebrae completely visible. WIth a gleeful smile on her face, she tossed him like a chewed up chew toy into the pit. After vomiting at the scene, I felt Henry sneak up from behind me, cutting off my bounds.  “It’s time for us to leave” He whispered while grabbing me by the arm. Eve hissed “Just where exactly do you think you are going? Both of you belong to me now, and I will drain you slowly.” Henry took a brave step forward, his broad shoulders flexing as he did so. Holding his knife in his right hand, all his weight on his left foot. “Get out of here now, I will handle her.” Henry barked at me. Before I could even start backing away, she was on him like a lion on a wildebeest. In one fell swoop, her fist collided with his chest. I was stuck watching as his chest caved under the extreme force and pressure, he dropped like a sack of potatoes. She quickly discarded him into the pit, before turning all of her attention on me. She pounced on me with lighting speed, landing on top of me. My back and a part of my head in the water, my legs and hands were the only thing keeping her completely off me. Using my left forearm to keep her pushed back, her jaw started to unhinge. Her sharp teeth were all I could see, her ice cold breath on my face. I frantically started to search my back pocket to find anything to help me. That’s when I felt Beau’s cross necklace pressed against my hand. I began to pray, screaming out so the Lord almighty could hear me.”Your God cannot hear you now Boy!” She hissed right as I ripped the necklace out from my pocket. I shoved it in her mouth. She instantly started to scream, black smoke flowing out of her mouth. She cowered away from me, hacking and coughing while ripping at her own mouth trying to dislodge the cross. I prayed louder at the sight of this, feeling my hairs stand on end again with a calm peace washing over me like a tidal wave. As the fresh sunlight began to cover us like the hand of God she successfully pulled the necklace out, her hands now smoldering from where she touched it. Her ragged breath was all I could hear before she charged again. Feeling God's presence all around me, I began speaking in tongues. I calmly used her momentum to kick her off me, flinging her back down into the pit. I could hear her howling all the way down. After that, I ran back to my car full-tilt. Feeling my body begin to tremble with the overbearing anxiety running through my body like a hoard of fire ants crawling on me. My exhausted body fought the current back to the edge of the Bayou, my only way out just feet away. Dragging myself ashore, I had to collect myself on the bank. My ragged breathing was all I could hear as I wiped my snot and tears off my face. All the feelings crashed into me like a semi truck. I wallowed in my sorrow, soaked head to toe.  I could feel someone watching me from off in the distance.  Wasting no more time, I ran to my car. I forcefully shoved the key into the keyhole on the driver's side door, ripping the door open and threw myself into the car.  I cranked the engine over, threw the gear in drive and left that city in the rear view mirror. Roughly two hours after I left, I finally returned home to New Orleans. I felt somewhat at peace pulling into my parking spot outside of my apartment. That feeling didn’t last long.  That night after going to bed, I awoke to the sound of a child laughing coming from somewhere in my home. The feeling of unwanted dread covered me from head to toe; I could feel someone watching me. I immediately left home and checked myself into this hospital. The only thing I have with me besides this laptop, is my Bible. I  never stopped praying after the ritual, I feel like God is the only thing keeping me sane. I never leave this room, only taking my eyes off God’s word long enough to use the bathroom and eat. I spend all my free time talking with God, his grace covers me like a blanket. As I am writing this out, I can hear what sounds like great trumpets coming from Heaven. I look forward to seeing my Father in Heaven and Beau again.",0,1758585937.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

On the second morning, I walked into the kitchen around 9 AM and found him cracking open a **can of beer**. Not with breakfast. Not after a rough night. Just… casually drinking beer in the morning like it was coffee.

I kind of jokingly said, “Dude, it’s 9 AM. You good?” And he got defensive. Said he’s on vacation (he took a few days off work) and that I was being judgmental. I told him it just felt *off* and that it’s not something I’m really comfortable with in my home, especially first thing in the morning.

He ended up leaving for the day and was kind of cold the rest of his stay. Now I’m wondering if I came across as too harsh. I wasn’t trying to shame him, I just didn’t expect to host someone who starts drinking before breakfast.

I’m relatively young (21F) and am extremely privileged in my upbringing so I have a blind spot here. I’m from the US. I’ve had several jobs so far - some being in food service mostly reliant on tips. Mainly one chain fast food place and one coffee shop/cafe. I was taught the importance of hard work and told that you give your all to a job and you’ll be rewarded. That has also been my personal experience thus far. I made some great connections at these jobs. Many of the workers were adults that were in food service for years. Some were slackers, but many if not most were extremely hard workers with an excellent work ethic and wonderful personality. They worked there full time and sometimes a second place part time (both minimum wage). I left to go to college but still visit sometimes and they’re still there. Idk it’s kind of sad to me that these wonderful people holding the place up are working for a wage that is not really suitable for a household. If it were me I would start there and either try to rise up or job hop with pay bumps until I made a decent wage. I would also look for work that doesn’t require a degree but that pays more.

1no2k4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/1no2k4z/advice_on_moving_out_in_nashville_davidson_county/,Advice on moving out in Nashville (Davidson County) + cutting ties with toxic family,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a point where I need to move out of my family’s home here in Nashville (Davidson County). The main issue is my brother, over the years, he’s turned into a very toxic, hate filled person with violent outbursts. He’s become openly misogynistic, racist, and homophobic. Whenever he walks into a room, the energy immediately shifts, and everyone feels like they have to walk on eggshells around him. Living with that day in and day out has become extremely unbearable.

It’s gotten to the point where I can be completely drained at work, but I’d still rather be there than at home tolerating his behavior. That’s when I realized I really need to make this move happen, not just for my peace of mind but for my health overall.

I’d love advice in two areas:

1. Moving out process in Nashville/Davidson County
	•	What are some realistic options for affordable housing here? (Neighborhood suggestions, ways to find roommates, hidden gems, etc.)
	•	Are there local programs, nonprofits, or resources that help people trying to get out of difficult home situations?
	•	Any general “first-time moving out” tips that would’ve made your transition easier?

2. Distancing from family
For those of you who’ve had to pull back or cut ties with toxic family members:
	•	How did you handle the emotional side of it (guilt, loneliness, or second guessing yourself)?
	•	Did you go straight to no-contact, or did you set boundaries gradually?
	•	What helped you stay firm when family tried to minimize the problem or pressure you back into tolerating it?

I know moving out and creating distance won’t solve everything overnight, but it feels like the step I need to take to protect my own peace. Hearing from people who’ve gone through similar experiences both in Nashville and in general . would mean so much.


Right now, I’m working full-time at a coffee shop as a barista, making $16/hr. After taxes (usually 14–20%), my paychecks shrink quite a bit, but I do get paid weekly on Fridays. I don’t have the option of moving in with other relatives since most of my family lives out of state. On top of that, I have vision issues that prevent me from driving or getting a license, so that’s another factor that makes moving out and being independent more challenging.

As for my family situation: my brother has gotten into physical fights with my dad before, pulled a knife on our younger brother twice, and even threatened to harm everyone in the house. Despite all of this, the rest of my family continues to enable him. They refuse to push him toward treatment because they’re scared he’ll think they’re calling him “crazy.” Instead, they make excuses for his behavior. That leaves me stuck in an environment where I feel unsafe, drained, and constantly on edge.

Another thing I’m struggling with is whether I should keep pitching in for rent and expenses here or stop putting money toward the house altogether and just save everything for leaving. Part of me feels guilty about not contributing, but another part of me feels like my money would be better used to secure my way out.

That’s why I’m so determined to move out. even if it means taking things one paycheck at a time.

Priority boarding worked as expected, and the meal was good (orzo salad appetizer + wellness fiesta bowl). Service felt premium overall. Only letdown was no cocktails available, which surprised me, so I stuck with coffee.

The return YOW -> YVR was a different story. My flight was delayed due to lack of crew, but the app never updated and no ETA was provided. Gate 13/13B at YOW is small, under construction, and was being shared with another delayed Porter flight that should have departed before ours, making the area overcrowded. Because of that, I sat at the next gate but checked back every few minutes. At the time my plane should have taken off, I suddenly saw boarding was already happening. No PA announcement was made, and when I asked why, the gate agent blamed the intercom system even though other airlines at YOW were making announcements, so that excuse wasn’t cool. The lack of communication was the most frustrating part. To add, a friend flying YOW -> YYC with Porter Reserve that same day didn’t get priority boarding either. The gate agents when from pre-boarding people with young children and mobility issues, and then jumped to general boarding. On our way to Ottawa, they made an announcement for Reserve boarding after the pre-boarding folks. 

For fairness, catering on the way home was solid again: green goddess lentil salad as the appetizer and a Riviera deli sandwich for the main. I also finally got to try their margarita, which was smooth.

Overall, my outbound flight felt premium, but the return left me frustrated. Honestly, I’ve flown Flair before (with the bundle for a carry-on) and had a better experience than Porter Reserve on the way home. For cross-country trips, I think I’ll stick with Air Canada.

I have 0 energy; my fatigue is ruining my ability to be a person. I struggle to move at all, I'm no longer physically fit, and despite eating probably 1000 calories or less a day, I only gain weight or remain stagnant because I dont move enough. 

I had horrible ddx medical issues to begin with (lupus, MCAS, hypermobility and all the joint issues that come with it GERD, etc) but have given myself new medical issues (mainly vertigo, horrible migraines, weakness, likely iron deficiency, etc) as a result of what I can only guess is malnutrition. It's 7:30 PM and all I had today was 4 bites of tuna salad and some coffee. I only ever crave coffee, sugar, or sometimes foods I cant even have due to my MCAS/allergies. 

But for the most part I only ever really want liquids and beverages. I truly hate solid food and cannot stand having to eat. I get 0 hunger cues and never want to eat anything. Everything is gross and/or I get completely full after 1 or 2 bites. When I go grocery shopping I dont even know what to get, because I cant find the energy to cook or eat anything. Its a vicious cycle where I dont have the energy to prepare or eat anything, so I dont eat, then the malnutrition makes me extremely fatigued, so I dont eat even more. 

The horrific migraines and fatigue are seriously risking my livelihood, and unless I can find a WFH job I'll end up being screwed professionally as well (I'm already taking off 2 days this week because I barely have the energy to go to the bathroom - also bc I had a horrible asthma attack yesterday but thats beside the point lol). I'm also convinced the lack of food is making my brain fog 100x worse and to a larger extent just making me stupid. As time passes I find myself becoming less and less articulate, my attention span shortening, etc. Sometimes it feels as though I just dont have the energy to think at all, which is scary. 

I'm hoping things improve once I can meet with my psych to consider stimulants (my non-stimulant ADHD meds aren't cutting it) and start xolair injections to control my food allergies, but for right now its unbearable.

hi i'm 20f and i have a problem with my 28f older sister. we had a huge blowup a month ago over me refusing to do work with her at a coffee shop, despite me telling her on numerous occasions i wouldn't want to go. after i stood my ground and refused to go, she got angry and started giving me the cold shoulder and intentionally stopped speaking to me. we live together, so it was awkward with her walking straight past me and not even saying a word. i explained to my mom (she doesn't live with us) what happened, and my mom said she'll talk to her. 

so she does, and basically my sister's mad because she does everything for me and i ""can't sacrifice my time to do the same thing in return"". 

for extra context, my sister for some reason doesn't want to do things on her own, it's always been like this since i was younger. each time she went to the store i HAD to go with her or else she was going to be upset with me. I had hoped this would all dissolve, but it didn't. there was this time where she wanted to go to a fashion show, i declined as i'm not into that. she keeps insisting and she says ""i already bought us tickets"". the day of the event, i'm clearly unhappy to be there and she says, ""well you could've just said no, i would've went by myself."" 

this has been an ongoing issue, and i've always feared of upsetting her or giving pushback because it 100% always results in her getting angry and pulling away. it's literally just us two and we have nobody else to depend on.

so when i confronted her about all the things she's done for me, she brings up the times where she had to drive me places (all places in which she volunteered on driving to). there was this time where she suggested for us to go painting at the library, and i asked her multiple times, ""are you sure you want to?"" to which she responded ""yeah i like painting!""

we even had to reschedule the painting event and i insisted we really didn't need to go, but she wanted to. even after the painting event she suggested for us to buy some to continue it.

now today, she apparently didn't even want to go painting and only did it for me.

she held the fact over my head that she pays for the bills, my subscription, and my wisdom tooth surgery, which are all things i have asked on multiple occassions to pay for, and called me selfish for not bothering to go out with her, despite us being around each other 24/7.

and when i brought up how she gives the cold shoulder when she's mad at me? denied it completely. said it was me who does it, despite me having to say ""hi"" to her every time i see her, despite me letting her know when i'm leaving the house, despite me literally going to her room every single night to say goodnight and that i love her.

but i guess that was all me giving the cold shoulder and making her soo uncomfortable to speak to me.

also, she was supposed to have a surgery, as she has a fibroid (although it isn't cancerous, she wanted to get it removed) for the past 3 months she's been extremely worried and pushing to have it. she finally got it scheduled for this week, and decided to just cancel it altogether because ""she doesn't have a support system."" what that means i have literally no clue. i don't know why she's risking her own health over something like this.

post argument, she decides to call me incompentent and essentially saying how i'm holding her down and that she can't wait for my mom to get her immigration papers situation fixed so she can get her own place.

i really just want advice for this whole thing, i really hate how she's acting and i want to do everything in my power to just leave. i don't want to be around her at this point. i'm more than happy to apologize and move on from this but i think this whole situation is completely awful.

I’ll scroll through reviews, Reddit posts, and socials before I commit. When I came across Midnight Addiction, I wasn’t sure I’d like it—the notes listed didn’t sound like my style, and most of the reviews were mixed (honestly, leaning more negative).

Still, I decided to take the chance since I could always exchange it at the mall if it didn’t work out. Oh. My. God. I’m SO glad I did because this scent is incredible! It’s mature, sexy, and seductive—definitely not floral, powdery, or overly sweet (all of which I usually avoid). The coffee note comes through strong, but not in a “Starbucks lobby” gourmand way—more like a deep, rich roast that feels bold and refined.

I don’t really pick up the plum or almond BBW lists in the profile. To me, it leans more patchouli-based—but not in that heavy 70’s hippie way. It’s subtle, grounding, and makes me feel like that girl.

This is perfect for fall, but honestly? I’m stocking up and wearing it year-round. I know it won’t be for everyone, but it’s become my signature scent and I’m absolutely obsessed. Just wanted to share for anyone still on the fence about Midnight Addiction.

1no2f0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1no2f0l/almost_ed_didnt_realize_it_until_adulthood/,almost ED? Didn't realize it until adulthood.,"So, I'm in my early 30s and only recently started realizing that I might have been on the edge of having an ED for most of my life. The only criteria I really meet are that I stopped gaining weight at a certain age and have never continued to gain weight, and I accidentally lost weight as an adult due to consuming caffeinated drinks to reduce hunger during preferred activities. 

I basically grew up with intuitive eating, even though we didn't call it that. My family always let us have unrestricted access to food. They never made comments about weight or about foods being good/bad. They would prompt us to sit at the dinner table and try all the foods, but never forced us to clean our plate or anything like that. I think that they gave me a great start to my relationship with food, and if I grew up in a different family I would definitely have a full-blown ED. Most of my problems with food started after moving out.

>!My entire life, people have made comments about whether I have an ED because of how skinny I am. I always thought that I can't have an ED because I never go more than 24 hours without eating, and I don't count calories or weigh myself, and I have never wanted to lose weight. I did recently have the thought that I probably can't count ""never wanted to lose weight"" because I have never had someone make a negative comment about my weight, and I have liked being called skinny.!<

>!After moving out of my parents' home, I had to deal with organizing, choosing, and paying for my own food and cleaning up without being prompted. That led to me eating less, but I never counted calories or weighed myself. I didn't even think I was losing weight for like 10 years. I just thought my clothes were loose because they were getting old and stretched out from washing them regularly. After the pandemic happened I was at a friend's house and saw a scale in their bathroom so I decided to weigh myself for the first time in over 10 years, and I was shocked to see that I was at a lower weight than I thought possible. I decided that I need to eat more, but I still didn't want to count calories or weigh myself regularly.!<

Since then, I have been struggling to actually eat more because I just find it to be expensive and annoying.

I think the closest thing to my experience would be ARFID, because I mostly just dislike eating because I find it inconvenient, have a sensory dislike of being full, and don't enjoy food enough to overcome things I dislike about it. I'm not that picky and I don't really get anxiety about food, health, or my appearance. My main things are that I don't like feeling stuffed, so when I get hungry I will eat just enough to feel comfortable again even if it means not finishing a meal. I also just find eating to be annoying because it means I have to take a break from things I would rather do, and it means I have to clean. I have dealt with this by eating a lot of packaged snacks and protein drinks so I don't have to clean. I also just really love coffee, so sometimes when I'm hungry I find it more enjoyable to have coffee than food, especially because it's also faster than eating and easier to clean up and get back to my activity.

Anyway, I have been trying to eat more without counting for a couple years now and I have stopped the weight loss so that's good. But then recently I started noticing people older than me who are extremely skinny and realized that I don't want to look like that. I suddenly realized that it's normal to gradually gain weight as an adult and I haven't been doing that so I'm starting to look like an unhealthy adult instead of a skinny young person. I never thought about how I look until seeing these people and thinking that's what I'm going to look like to other people when I retire if I don't start gaining weight now. My goal is to gain enough to fill out my clothes again, but I really don't want to count calories or weigh myself. I've basically been trying to come to the terms with the fact that if I want to actually gain weight I will have to eat until I'm uncomfortably full almost every day, or I will have to interrupt my day to have snacks multiple times a day.",4,1758585008.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

But I am so happy to have seen the light. I am still very imperfect in my abstinence, and only 24, but something has... changed. For the past few months the thought of dragging him out to the bars has made me very sad. I think about how much better I need to be for him. How beautiful he is in the morning light drinking coffee. How cooking dinner for him when he works late and being romantic and intimate is like UNIVERSES ahead of being bloated, incoherent, and offering up a half eaten cold pizza and pathetic attempts at seduction. How I want to be beautiful, confident and healthy alongside him. How I want our kids to have a far different relationship with us than we did our own parents. How I want to get old with him and be good to each other.

I just love him. I hope you all have love like this. I hope you all find love like this and refuse to let it be taken over by demons. I have been a wreck, various addictions, eating disorders, depression. We do get better and we are worthy. But we are responsible for those first steps.

Thank you all for being the reason I won't drink tonight. I come back to this community so often.

Looking for someone to build a genuine connection with someone from Iowa or not too far away. Looking for someone that has at least some common interest but different enough to it's not like dating yourself. I prefer to build a friendship first and see where things go, I'm very old school when it comes to this.

Appearance wise I'm about 1/2 an inch over 6ft. About average build, stay very active through out the year. Brown hair, blue eyes, glasses, never been considered ugly by my friends but definitely not a 10.

Interest and hobby wise, I'm and avid lover of anything outdoors, stuff like camping, fishing, backpacking, golf, hiking, etc As much as I love being out and about love just relaxing on the couch binging another tv show or movie. Also don't mind a good book every now and then, but that's more a winter hobby. Love taking time to appreciate the small things in like a rainy day, a good cup of coffee, a good craft beer. I work in tech so that can be stressful from time to time but brings in enough and their is plenty of time to enjoy the little things which is nice. I might work in a ""geeky"" career but I break quite a few of the normal stereotypes for someone that works in tech.

1no2d21,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1no2d21/debating_if_i_should_quit_the_pill/,Debating if I should quit the pill,"I have never really posted on reddit asking for advice before, but here it goes. For context, I am a 26-year-old female. I have been on a variety of different oral contraceptives pills before, but just last year I had to switch over to a progesterone-only pill (Jencycla) due to my aura migraines. As of today, I have been taking Jencycla for about a year, and I fear that the pill has been making my anxiety way worse than what it actually is. I have struggled with anxiety since I was about 19, mostly centred around health anxiety, but it has never been this hard to manage. I was actually able to get to a point a few years ago where I could completely regulate myself and prevent panic attacks from happening, but they seem to be so far out of my control over this past year. Over this past week, I have had a panic attack almost daily, whether it be about my health, or bodily symptoms that I do not even think really exist; and it is quickly turning into my own personal hell. Not only this, but as someone who is (unwillingly) very in tune with her own body, I have noticed that ever since I started this pill, I seem to experience vertigo head-rush-like symptoms from time to time -- enough so that it sends me into a panic sometimes. I have never been one to faint or get dizzy, but ever since I started this pill I have noticed this symptom GREATLY. I know what you are probably thinking, ""oh its been a year and you have never let your doctor know?"" I have a few reasons as to why I haven't switched pills or quit all together. 

1. I have struggled with anxiety for so long that it is almost a part of my every day life. In some way, it has been more comfortable to deal with it, but I am slowly realizing that I need some sort of relief, and I need to make a change ASAP. 

2. I had to have an abortion back in 2023 after accidentally getting pregnant, and it was singlehandedly one of the most traumatizing things I have ever gone through, and I never want to do it again. So a huge part of me is almost forcing myself to suffer through these symptoms so I never have to do it again. 

3. I am pretty much at the point where I would not like to switch birth controls because I think I would rather quit all together. Especially after reading how it affects women. 

I am not really open to anxiety medication because I would rather make some lifestyle changes first, so this week I think I am going to try quitting coffee to see how that affects me. Next would be to probably quit the pill, but I am curious to hear some thoughts and opinions about it. Have you ever had this reaction on a progesterone-only pill? Do you think it would be worth it to quit? Is cycle tracking an effective contraceptive method? 

I would really love to hear from you guys, and it would comfort be greatly to know that I am not the only one going through this.

Im a man of ritual, and till the day I die I will keep this ritual of eat sleep and defalcate. I lay down Sunday morning on my bed waiting for my daily trumpet. Never shall it come, again and I rejoice but shall it I will break to dust I’m broken but not shattered because I know I won’t get into heaven after what I done. 

Journey entry no 3.  Monday morning I put on my clothing I’m only in my late adulting life. “Wait no could’ve it been 30’s” time flies when your working a job a former employee said but he was bitterly true I wish I could’ve spoken to him. having dementia it broke me “ this journal will do nothing but I rather write then forget” its already 8:00 pm so I must go . 

“Wake up John the trumpet it ringing.” 

I wake up to the sound of the morning bird and head down to my normal diner and start drinking a americano and I see someone coming out from there car holding a sign he stepped into the road. “What would you like to eat ” my waitress beckons my attention and I ask “ for as long as I been here who is that man he is about to be ran over.” “SHE not he, but she’s a scientist who’s been testing instinct of humans she isn’t what you call irrational and she’s not dumb although she is risking her life so it’s debatable. Any way what are you going to eat” “hold ms I’m gunna stop her from dying out there and if you must ask give me wine” I stand and walk toward the door to open.When I see her she was like like a forget me not short and beautiful. And we lock eyes and she steps even more outside of the road forgetting that just beyond me we’re cars and one of the cars hits the brakes yet it was just to late
 
They said to stay indoors not to disturb what they’re doing. “So what did they say”  a boy looking more built for the beach  than a diner said to me I tried to hold it in but I couldn’t, “I’m sorry” that’s all I could say but I felt like running. “John” I shot up the only by person who knew my name in this diner was myself but I too a glance and saw the dead eye of one such person he looks to be in his 30s or late 20’s  but I knew who he was he was him the person I thought died  except he did die I saw it myself “who are you just a ghost or something or someone that died” in a hysteria the boy called me stupid but I never failed and stayed on to the man in the black shirt camo pants. 

“John you scammed me out of all my money for years I and my brother trusted you but you took and took where is your humanity for others” the man said “ y-you should have died back when I killed you during the war with the army. He lifted his shirt to show a scare but no one reacted I realized he staged everything. I run for the door but my years have caught up with me and failed to open the door I shack these aren’t people as they turn from concerned to bored I realized there demon “your all demons leave me alone” 

“John if that is your name then stop running from your own life” 

Journey no 1 it’s my first time but I scammed someone he had black shirt and camo on he was a friend of mine during the journey of war but now he just a pawn in my pyramid and I will make him a queen and escape this scene but for now I’ll make him a leader. I’m sorry journey I have committed the worst sin a man could do. I went to the brothers house and “ it wasn’t my fault” I escalated it and spat on him as I did he grabbed me by the neck to I had to shoot him I had to shoot my own brother from another mother and I regret this but then I hear the daughter playing trumpet most likely immune  from hearing the noise. 

Journey no 4 they let me write my last journey and I would like to say I am sorry because it was I who was the monster all along goodness me.

I inquire   if instead the boy does it if he shall want to remain with such a guilt that will only grow with time. A void with no emotion perked upon his face soul less no light was getting in and I couldn’t breathe. 

I launch myself toward the chair and sat down the server came with wine,
Yet as I look out the window I glance on the lady outside Angel and the devil destined to fight but never to touch without death and dying together as they put tarp over her body I raise my glass of wine I sit with stab wounds all because of me and I’m proud.

I'm here to chat in comments, in all sorts of topics that I enjoy, some kink related, some not. I am open to conversations, provided they are respectful and not overly sexual from the start. 

**My Experience**
I've been into Femdom for around 4 years now. I discovered the BDSM lifestyle via friends, and slowly started attending munches, and then some kink events and clubs. I am very fond of the confidence and freedom that Femdom has brought to me on a personal level, and I have had some enchanting dalliances and great fun over the years

For context about why this matters for Addision, Addison was the one who in a manic episode fueled by Asari honey mead brought up the idea of sending shuttles to various Golden worlds in the hopes that they'll find food, water, air and help. Helping being possible friendly alien life. 

This all went off without a hitch, Tann was on board because his proposal to put colonist back in cryo was met with ridicule, and Addison did the math. All of this seems reasonable, the Pathfinders weren't around and rations were running low. The issue arises when Addison and Tann decide not to include Sloane in the decision. 

This is something I wish came up in game, book Sloane and game Sloane feel like different characters. That said, this is about Addison. 

While Addison and Tann began planning, Kandros just so happened to hear about it and offered his services. Addison never told him that Sloane didn't know about the shuttle excursions, nor did she tell Sloane that Kandros was interested. 

Yes, Sloane was out of comms range, but she was apart of leadership and the decision to not include her ultimately led her to finding out that Kandros was gone through a letter in her omni tool. To make matters worse is that Kandros was gone for weeks, so long that when a shuttle came back the survivors all but confirmed to her that Kandros was lost to her. 

Why is Kandros so important to Sloane? He was her right hand man in security, and taking him from under her took away one of her best officers. With Kandros gone and her trust betrayed a rift between her and the rest of leadership turned into a chasm. 

I can only imagine if Addison waited to include Sloane maybe Sloane trusts her and Tann alittle more or at least Kandros is still around and back her up when she goes to talk to Calix. 

The formatting for this is all over the place but this is one of the things I think about when I listen to the books. I'm really surprised that we can't tell Sloane that Kandros is alive, while she may not join back up, It would certainly help relations between the Nexus and the Exiles.

EDIT 2: the ""Best"" VPN may vary by country and needs, this list is just for the top 3 globally in terms of general factors, for specific uses / needs you might want to check more on our subreddit or other VPN related subreddits

EDIT 3: the discounts, coupons provided on this post are updated regularly to get the latest deals, if you find a better coupon for new users, leave it in the replies

Alright folks, it’s 2025 and VPNs are still a hot mess of marketing, “limited time” deals, and random sketchy providers claiming they’re “the fastest in the world.” So I put together a breakdown that cuts through the BS.

# Why bother with a VPN in 2025?

* **Cyber crap is worse than ever**: malware, ransomware, phishing, you name it. Some VPNs now throw in built-in blockers.
* **Geo-blocks are still dumb**: want US Netflix or BBC iPlayer? Still need a VPN.
* **Privacy erosion**: governments and Big Tech haven’t stopped spying. Audited no-logs = non-negotiable.
* **AI tracking ads**: it’s spooky how well they profile you. VPN adds a speed bump.
* **Public Wi-Fi is still sketchy**: coffee shop hackers still exist.
* **ISP throttling**: still a thing, VPN helps.

# How I judged the “best” VPNs

* **Privacy & security**: strict audited no-logs, good jurisdiction, RAM-only servers, kill switch, obfuscation, multi-hop, etc.
* **Speed**: WireGuard-based protocols are king, 10Gbps servers should be the new normal.
* **Streaming/torrenting**: actually works with Netflix etc. and supports P2P.
* **Ease of use**: works on all platforms, has split tunneling, decent apps.
* **Value**: doesn’t bleed your wallet dry, ideally bundles extra security tools.

# The Big 3 in 2025

**🔹 Proton VPN – the privacy purist’s choice**

* Current discount: 64% off ([https://protonvpn.com/vpn-deals](https://www.bestfree.nl/go/protonvpn))
* **Blocked in:** 🇨🇳 China, 🇷🇺 Russia, 🇲🇲 Myanmar / **Partially Blocked in:** 🇹🇷 Turkey, 🇮🇳 India, 🇮🇷 Iran, 🇦🇪 UAE
* Swiss HQ, strict no-logs, open-source apps.
* Secure Core servers route traffic through ultra-safe locations.
* NetShield now blocks phishing too.
* VPN Accelerator = great speeds.
* Has a legit free plan (limited but solid). ([https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn](https://www.bestfree.nl/go/protonvpn))
* Downsides: only 10 devices max, free tier won’t cut it for heavy use.

**🔹 NordVPN – the feature overload option**

* Current discount: 73% off ([https://nordvpn.com/special](https://www.bestfree.nl/go/nordvpn))
* **Blocked in:** 🇨🇳 China, 🇷🇺 Russia, 🇹🇲 Turkmenistan, 🇰🇵 North Korea / **Partially Blocked in:** 🇮🇷 Iran, 🇹🇷 Turkey, 🇮🇳 India, 🇪🇬 Egypt, 🇦🇪 UAE, 🇧🇾 Belarus
* Panama HQ, audited no-logs.
* NordLynx protocol = fast.
* Meshnet (share networks with friends/devices), dark web monitoring, post-quantum encryption (marketing flex, but cool).
* Strong threat protection (even blocks malware when VPN is off).
* Downsides: only 10 devices at once, renewal prices sting.

**🔹 Surfshark – the unlimited devices/value champ**

* Current discount: ([https://surfshark.com/deal/](https://www.bestfree.nl/go/surfshark))
* **Blocked in:** 🇨🇳 China, 🇷🇺 Russia, 🇹🇲 Turkmenistan / **Partially Blocked in:** 🇦🇪 UAE, 🇴🇲 Oman, 🇮🇷 Iran, 🇪🇬 Egypt, 🇵🇰 Pakistan, 🇹🇷 Turkey, 🇧🇾 Belarus
* Netherlands HQ, but audited no-logs.
* Unlimited devices.
* Rotating IP + “Alternative ID” = extra anonymity.
* Works on literally everything, even iOS/macOS split tunneling (rare).
* Bundle includes antivirus & breach alerts.
* Downsides: speed can dip on far servers, jurisdiction isn’t ideal.

# Quick Comparison (2025 snapshot)

|Feature|NordVPN|Surfshark|Proton|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Devices|10|Unlimited|10|
|Jurisdiction|Panama|Netherlands|Switzerland|
|Servers|5,500+ / 60 countries|3,200+ / 100 countries|13,600+ / 122 countries|
|Streaming|Excellent|Very good|Excellent|
|Torrenting|Optimized servers|All servers|Optimized + port forwarding|
|Free plan|No|No|Yes|
|Unique perks|Meshnet, post-quantum, dark web monitoring|Rotating IP, alt ID, iOS/macOS split tunneling|Secure Core, open-source, VPN Accelerator|

# Where VPNs are heading (beyond 2025)

* Post-quantum encryption will become a selling point.
* AI-based routing and threat blocking.
* Decentralized/blockchain VPNs (still niche and slow).
* Bundles (VPN + antivirus + password manager) are becoming the norm.
* Even faster servers (40Gbps+ hype incoming).

# TL;DR recommendations

* **Want all the bells & whistles?** Go NordVPN.
* **Big family or lots of devices?** Go Surfshark.
* **Privacy absolutist?** Proton VPN.

Pro tip: avoid sketchy “free” VPNs unless it’s Proton’s free tier. Always check if “no-logs” has been *audited*, and don’t forget you can abuse the 30-day money-back guarantees to test before locking in a 2-year deal.

Networking is crucial when you're in a new country - it's how you make friends, find opportunities, and build a support system. Here's my quick guide on how to network effectively:

1. Join student orgs: Sign up for clubs related to your interests or major. honestly, It's an easy way to meet people with similar passions.

2. Attend campus events: Go to orientation week activities, guest lectures, and social gatherings. These are goldmines for meeting new people.

3. Use social media: Follow your uni's accounts and join student Facebook groups. Engage in discussions and DM people who seem intresting.

4. Volunteer: Find local organizations or campus initiatives that need help. It's a great way to meet locals and other internationals while doing good.

5. Leverage your classes: Don't just sit silently - participate in discussions and chat with classmates before/after class. Study groups are perfect for networking too.

6. Attend career fairs: Even if you're not job hunting yet, these events are great for practicing your networking skills and learning about different industries.

7. Don't forget your cultural community: Look for groups or events for people from your home country. It's comforting and can lead to unexpected connections.

Pro tip: Always follow up! After meeting someone new, send a quick message to stay in touch. Something like ""Great chatting about X, let's grab coffee sometime!"" works wonders.

Common mistake: Don't stick only with other international students. It's comfortable, but you'll miss out on local connections and cultural immersion.

And when I spend a lot of time and invest emotion in any one person early, the feeling of that ghost is really damaging emotionally. ""What did I do wrong? Was I not funny?

Ginkgo gets pushed as if it’s a memory booster that will make you sharper and more focused but will probably take it from a scale 1-10 7.4 to 7.25.

From what I can tell, the actual effects are so tiny you’d never feel them in real life. People talk about them like they’ll change your health, but the reality is you wouldn’t notice a difference compared to just sleeping better, exercising, or even drinking a cup of coffee. If these really worked on a decent level then doctors would be prescribing them.

What I think is really happening is: 
People want an easy pill instead of making bigger lifestyle changes.

Supplement companies cherry-pick studies that show the smallest benefits and blow them up as if they’re life-changing. And there is likely a 20 studies that showed negligible effects for every study that shows big improvement

The ritual of “taking something” makes people feel like they’re doing something for their health, which is basically placebo. To me, these herbs aren’t completely fake, but they’re functionally useless. They don’t move the needle in a way you’d actually feel.",25,1758583981.0,changemyview,15,0.9,False

1no1zua,https://www.reddit.com/r/perchance/comments/1no1zua/i_made_advanced_prompt_for_perchance_image/,I made advanced prompt for perchance image generators. Give it a try!,"Hello everyone,

I created prompt with ability to generate (more) random images. Sometimes I am just lazy and don't want to rewrite prompt each time for different results. I am quite pleased with its results. I thought it might be useful to others as well. If only to let less advanced users know they can formulate their prompts this way.

**How it works?**

* pick one of perchance image generators (I usually choose https://perchance.org/ufsykzlant), pick ""No style"", default guidance (7), ofc blank form for seed, pick number of images (30 or whatever), no need to write anything in negative prompt field, paste my prompt and it is all you have to do;
* it was made mainly for generation of nsfw images, anyway it can works as a template for your own ideas;
* engine tends to create similar pictures, for example if you pick number of images 30 and your prompt is 'slim young girl in casual clothes' many images and faces will be similar, on the other hand if you are more specific, e.g. 'slim and tall 25 years old female in red dress, she has big smile' again you ll get 30 similar pictures with many variations of red dress and her smile;
* prompt is designed to generete relistic photo-like images (ofc if one has luck with random seeds), if you want to change its style - it is quite easy and totally possible.

Using my prompt fixes issues with tendency ai to generate similar images with similar faces, clothes etc. and adds a big dose of randomness.

Below is shorten version of this prompt for just generating images of women (link to full version including few nsfw scenarios like a.s./bj/futa/poses in the end of post).

""

Place beetween paragraphs 'her face expression(...)' and 'negativePrompt' leave blank or write something about what she is doing (and anything else - angle view, background etc) like: 'she stands with open arms, /she crouches and touches ground, / she is dancing, ' etc. Her poses or actions ofc you can form in random way like other fields in this prompt so in above example: {she stands with open arms, |she crouches and touches ground, |she is dancing, }

**How it works 2**

* first paragraph picks one of photo style descriptions in random way, they all cooperate with negative prompt. If you want for example anime style not photo you have few ways to do it. Most simple is delete first paragraph and last (negativePrompt), then instead of 'No style' pick desired style in form of image generator. Longer way is making your own description(s) of style and negative\_prompt like in my prompt.
* elements in braces separeted by | sign are shuffled (randomly picked) for every single image generation. Anyone can edit them (add own, delete existing etc.) for own needs. As you see later in generated image (icon 'i"" on image) prompt there is quite short in comparison to my full prompt.
* as you see there are many signs like \^ with numbers - \^1,\^0.5,\^100 etc. They are weights and inluence on randomness of picked elements. To make it more clear all elements have default \^1 (even if it is not written next to element). Number like \^0.1 makes element 10 times less likely to be picked and \^100 make it 100 times more likely to be picked. I hope it is clear. Wait. It can be clear in simple paragraphs like her skin tone or age. Most complicated paragraph is with her clothes, it has nested weights... Honestly I don't know If I can explain it enough (english isn't my native btw), but I ll try on short example.

she wears {{{white|black} {dress\^2|tunic}\^5|{uniform|pyjamas}}\^1|{{white|black} {tshirt\^2|jumper}|{blazer with shirt|jacket with shirt}\^0.1} and {{white|black} {trousers\^2|leggings}|{distressed jeans\^0.1|jeans}\^0.3}\^1},

First part call it A we have white/black dress/tunic or uniform/pyjamas. Sign \^5 (AFTER brace) means we prefer dress/tunic over uniform/pyjamas. Second part (B) white/black tshirt/jumper or blazer/jacket AND white/black trosuers/leggings or distressed jeans/jeans. In part B firstly we prefer tshirt/jumper over blazer/jacket (\^0.1) and secondly trousers/leggings over jeans (jeans \^0.3). Finally we prefer both parts A and B the same way ('(...)pyjamas}}\^1', '(...)jeans}\^0.3}\^1'). Warning for the end, if you have nested weights and one list is long and second list has just few elements somehow ""randomness"" often strongly prefers short list so you can influence it by smaller weights on shorter list.

1no1zea,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1no1zea/my_postcaregiver_update_8_months_later/,"My Post-Caregiver Update, 8 months later","Hello my fellow angels and saints.. not sure if i deserve that title but you all sure do!  first off, you all are amazing humans and doing things most humans couldn't, let alone for how long as some have and the difficulties it brings.  caregivers; i see you. i hear you. i am sending all my love to you.

Well.. its now been just over 8 months since my mom with dementia passed. just a quick recap/summary: in 2020, dad passed from sudden heart attack and mom was already in early-mid stages of dementia. sis and i talked, i left job and became mom's caregiver and sis my backup/break-giver.  

Mom passed in early Jan 2025 but now looking back at it i realized the prior 3 months had all really been going downhill.  its hard to see those changes when one is dealing with them on a 24/7 state.  the last month was prob the hardest; mom fell twice in the house (only three total times while i was caregiving) and those two falls emotionally and physically nearly broke me.  and the nights in the last two months were prob some of the hardest; up and down, confusion, anger but eventually would calm down and then would sleep the next 10 hours.

those are the things i do not miss. but the rest.. i miss it..  coffee and cards each day.. mom helping me w/the dishes... her snuggling her kitty and looking at the picture books i made her... just thinking about it now just makes me well up in tears... i had a great mom and she loved me so much and i her...  it just seems so much harder when there is so much love... most days, i am back to my 'old' self (not really the same cuz caregiving changes everyone that does it.. good or bad.. depends but i feel we never see the world in the same light or people or relationships..).   but there are times when i just catch a pic of mom or am doing something we did and it just hits me like a freight train..  tears everywhere...   but.. i am not afraid to cry or have ever been.. i embrace my humanity, my emotions, my love and losses.. real men can cry in front of their friends.

as each week passes.. the distinct day to day memories and routines from caregiving slowly fade.. theres a relief with it but also a yearning.. not wanting to let go of something that hurts but connected us.. mom and i..  my routines don't exist atm.. haven't gotten a job or even really looked (IT job market sucks, heck the whole job market sucks) but will start in early 2026 (saved up enough to make it to 2027 if i have to).

so... how is my life after caregiving?  its different... i no longer have the want to be SUPER successful or rich..  could care less about most expensive things, esp if i have something that already works... no, i just want to now live a life that makes me happy. a life where i can hopefully help others in need. a life of my own but lived in memory of mom and dad. 

i am so sorry the world doesn't recognize you caregivers like it should.  you all are so FUCKING AMAZING... i love you all and i wish i could give you all the world and years of vacation. i wish you a day of less poop and pee, hopefully no arguments and easy dr appts w/knowledgeable/courteous staff..

i think i'm ready to finally start living my life again... but in a much more humbler compacity and how i want to live it..   

thank you to everyone here thoughout this journey... you are amazing humans... 😘💕❤️😍

1no1trs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1no1trs,"Post Trip Itinerary - Sept 6-14, 2025","Hi all! I got a lot of recommendations from this subreddit so thought I’d post our itinerary. Posting on mobile so excuse any formatting/grammar.

We’re a couple in our early 30’s, big foodies, love beaches/local villages, don’t party but love drinking wine. 

To Bring: Definitely recommend bringing water shoes with grip (got ours off Amazon) and snorkels.

Car rental: rented through Motor Plan - they were great. It’s fully insured so you don’t have to deal with feeling like you’re getting scammed. Super quick and easy and nice supporting a local company. Wasn’t a new fancy car but did the job. 

Day 1: arrived in Heraklion, drove to Chania. Got excited and stopped at a road side taverna for lunch. Gorgeous views but probably the only “bad” meal we had (and wasn’t even that bad). Checked in to the town of Vamos, chill dinner. Highly recommend this area for restaurants and great coffee.

Day 2: morning at Omprogialos, so gorgeous but a bit too choppy to swim. Highly recommend still. Then beached hopped a bit and got food. Drove to the Lake Kournas which didn’t blow me away BUT the highlight was this little roadside stand called Fresh Fruits on Google. Husband and wife only speak Greek, so we used translate and she shows you everything she made that day. The portions are absolutely massive - had a fruit salad with fresh yogurt and honey. I wish I was hungry enough for her food. No menu she just shows you what she has.

Day 3: went to Chania old town in the morning. Stay on the side streets they’re much cuter and less touristy. Most restaurants don’t open until 5pm and it seems like it would be a cute vibe at night so next time I’d go in the evening! Then went swimming at kouloura chalepa, a swimming spot on the ocean with mainly locals. Saw posters for a local concert a few towns over and went to that was fun.

Day 4: wanted to wake up early and go to Seitan Limania but had a terrible sleep and didn’t think the tons of driving was worth it. Next time! We instead had a chill morning then drove over the the south. We just found a small town on maps and went in and had the best food of the entire trip. It’s called Maza Cafeneion. The owner is the nicest human ever and the lamb was 100/10. Stopped off the side of the road for a cool ocean dip spot. Got to our Airbnb in Mariou in the south.

Day 5: went to Prevelli beach early. Tip: park at the Dionyssos side the hike is way shorter. Gorgeous spot! Once the ferries start it gets quite busy. If you go to anything before 10am you usually only share with a few more people. Then went to Paralia Skinaria beach and snorkelled again- beautiful but not as nice as prevelli for that. Then drove up to the church on the mountain. So beautiful. Highly recommend. Then went to Klisidi Beach. Got dinner by our airbnb at Taverna Mariou (delicious).

Day 6: rented a boat from Notos Mare (you don’t need a license) - if you have the $$ highly recommend it! We went to Loutro early (loved it there), then just made our way along the coast stopping everywhere. They make it super easy with zones and an app. We got engaged here in a little cove so it’ll be my favourite day ever haha

Day 7: Kalypso beach. Ahh I loved this place - totally recommend. Go early and you’ll be on your own. The snorkelling is amazing! Then we went to Paralia Plakias. Got a freddo cappuccino at Paligremnos beach bar and relaxed and went swimming. Gorgeous sand and water. Went for celebratory dinner at Merastri Taverna - calamari and salad was excellent. Lamb was good but didn’t compare to Maza restaurant.

Day 8: had the best morning at our airbnb, relaxing and swimming and not wanting to leave. Took the longer (15 mins) drive back to Heraklion on the other side of the island but didn’t need to cause the scenery really wasn’t really any different and it was quite windy. Stayed at a Chapter 02 Gallery Suites close by as our flight was at 4:30am. Was a good hotel, nice and clean. Went for Thai food (bit of a tradition on our last night of trips but was disappointed - should have had just one last meal)

Day 9: got to airport at 2:30am, had to wait in line cause our online check in didn’t work. Security was a breeze. I didn’t use the washroom but the terrible reviews that worried me seemed a bit dramatic. Yes it’s old with limited seating but it functions like an airport. Perhaps that’s because it was super early and in Sept but was all smooth.

A little about me: I’ve got an MBA and work in project management/consulting, but outside of work I try not to take life too seriously. I’m into sports (Pens/Steelers/Pirates), breweries (especially outdoor ones when the weather’s good), fitness, and just getting outside to explore new spots. I also run a small entrepreneurial venture on the side, so I click well with growth-minded people — though I’m just as happy to keep things light over a beer, food or a game.

I’d like to find a couple people who are up for a monthly hangout — catching a game, grabbing a coffee, hitting an outdoor brewery, or just good conversation.

You know how I used to have that little basket by the back door for my gardening shoes? For the longest time, I had a similar setup by the cats' corner, but instead of shoes, it was a dedicated dustpan and brush. It felt like a permanent fixture, something I’d just have to accept as part of life with indoor cats. The ritual of sweeping up those tiny, scattered granules felt as daily as making my morning coffee.



I’d be padding around in my socks and inevitably step on that one gritty patch. It’s such a small thing, but it has a way of making the whole room feel just a little bit untidy, no matter how recently I’d cleaned. I remember thinking there had to be a better way than this constant cycle of sweep, vacuum, repeat. It wasn't a huge chore, just a persistent, low-level nuisance.



Then, I was at a friend’s place, and I noticed this textured mat tucked under her cat's food and water bowls. It wasn't for food spills, though; she had another one by the litter area. I didn’t say anything at first, but I kept glancing at it. Her floors were all dark wood, and there wasn't a single stray piece in sight. I was genuinely curious about how she managed it.



I finally asked her about it later, and she just laughed and said it was her best-kept secret for sanity. She described it as a sort of trap for all that litter—the texture catches what’s on their paws as they step out. It sounded so simple, almost obvious. I got one myself, a plain grey one that blends into the floor, and the difference was immediate. It’s not magic, but it’s close.



Now, the dustpan and brush have migrated back to the garden door where they belong. That faint crunch underfoot is a thing of the past, and the whole corner just feels… calmer. It’s funny how such a small change can remove a little bit of background noise from your day. It just works, quietly doing its job while I forget it’s even there.

My 18th birthday is precisely 178 days from today (March 19th, 2026, for calendar counter nerds), and I've been thinking loads about what I'd like to create before entering the world of official adulthood. Something is as obvious as day: T0g3pi needs fresh faces and assisting hands. If you're a coding enthusiast, an AI fanatic, or someone who enjoys a good open-source romp, listen up—it may be the project that re-ignites your passion, too.

A Short History (and a Modest Brag about the Lows)

To the uninitiated, T0g3pi is my offspring: a light-weight AI-assisted coding companion that vows to make brainstorming, debugging, and prototyping less than a root canal but more like jamming with an über-genius sidekick. It's your coding pocket, Gemini—speedy tips, bug hunting, and even code generation on the fly, without the bloat of more heavyweight tools. I started it as a side project, thinking of an iOS app that would be stable on standard devices.

The horrible mistake I made conning people: the .ipa release? Total epic failure. Crashes on half of the test devices, compatibility nightmare, and me staring at my desk at 3 AM, wondering how I ever thought I could whip Swift and AI models into shape single-handedly without a village. It shattered me. I did contemplate tossing my keyboard and never looking back at AI code completion. The high of nailing a tidy prompt or seeing code ""just work"" is devilishly addictive—like that burst of dopamine from the perfect espresso shot—but the crashes? They make you wonder about life choices.

The Pivot: From Solo Struggle to Community Powerhouse

Rather than quit, I'm turning the script around. T0g3pi is becoming community-facing, and code is welcomed (when this is finished, I'll document how the project works). No gatekept repo or heroics now—I'm throwing open the gates for y'all to come in, add code, squash bugs, and help shape the roadmap. It's not a plea for help; it's an invitation to co-own something neat. Think of a tool that's yours, iterated by a community of smart people everywhere.

The great news: We're fleeing iOS catastrophes. T0g3pi now devours macOS and Linux out of the box, fueled by the amazing Turdus Merula backend (hats off to that gem—it's a tough, cross-platform platform for doing AI inference without the customary hassle). Turdus Merula's already proven in battle on Linux—proof right here in this shiny new v1.0.1 release: Turdus Merula Linux Tarball. Unpack it, boot it up on Ubuntu or whatever distro you're running, and ta-da—AI magic without all the apt install histrionics.

[https://sep.lol/files/releases/test/v1.0.1-linux/turdus\_merula\_v1.0.1-1\_linux.tar](https://sep.lol/files/releases/test/v1.0.1-linux/turdus_merula_v1.0.1-1_linux.tar) (if you have Linux like me!)

Where You Come In: Let's Tame the Apple A8 Frontier

But this is the actual moonshot I'm looking for: Porting an Apple A8-capable version of T0g3pi. That is, porting it for those dinosaurs like the iPad Air 2 and mini 4 (iPhone 6, 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, iPad mini 2/3, iPad Air 1 coming soon)—hardware still lumbering around in the pockets of millions of people everywhere but abandoned in the cold by newer apps. Why? Accessibility, baby. Not everyone has the money to spend on the newest hardware, and I'd like to make T0g3pi the underdog's best buddy.

If you've got experience in:

Objective-C or vintage Swift hacks (A8's ARMv7/8 quirks ain't no joke),

AI model optimizations (whipping LLMs into shape to run lean on 1GB RAM without burning the CPU),

Cross-compilation magic (transplanting Turdus Merula's Linux heritage to iOS without losing it), or even

Touch UI/UX (making it feel native on those little screens),

.then you're my folk. Begin small—fork the repo \[link it here when it goes public\], make changes to an independent module like the inference pipeline, or simply jam in the issues. I'll do the up-front setup, docs, and merges to get all that going. What do you get? Bragging rights, your name in the credits, and first crack at wacky features like voice-coded code gen.

Why Join the T0g3pi Crew?

Real impact: We're not pursuing VC hype; this is grassroots, by hackers for hackers.

Flexibility: Donate when it suits you—no stress, all positive vibes.

Learning goldmine: Unearth AI portability, legacy hardware hacks, and community collab skills that'll make your portfolio shine.

And hey, my birthday goal: By March 29th, let's get something working everywhere. Cake and commits for everyone!

DM me, comment below, or hit the Discord I'll set this week (link in bio soon). Redditors who code, you're my hero—let's make this failure our win. What do you bring to the table?

Cheers (and coffee),

Then an emergency occurred in my family, and I'm having to move back to my hometown to help out. I am wondering if anyone would be interested in subletting the fully furnished 495 sq. ft. apartment from me. It is such a wonderful community in Woodland Hills. Neighbors are so nice. It is located 5 min from the 101. And across the street from Westfields Topanga. Property has 3 different pool/BBQ areas, tennis courts, basketball courts, private playground, laundry (just down the hall from unit), trash nearby unit, central air in unit, weekly food trucks and community events, large gym, private workspace rooms, a movie viewing room in our clubhouse, amazon lockers, a parking space assigned to the unit, and the whole community is controlled access. 

About the unit: It has a lovely little patio for outdoor space. The bathroom has a removable shower head and a bidet for the toilet. Central heating and cooling that works AMAZINGLY! Appliances: fridge/freezer, electric oven/stove, microwave, blender, coffee/spice grinder, printer, industrial shredder, Kitchen aid stand mixer, hand mixer, vacuum, and potential for a dishwasher hookup to the kitchen sink. Furniture: Bar cart/table, console table, bed with storage trundle, fresh sheets, and mattress cover, small desk, 7 shelving units with empty cubbies for storage. Additionally, my cat's climbing shelves will still be on the walls, and pets are welcome to the space. The community overall is super pet-friendly. I will also be leaving my cleaning products, mop, broom, dry goods such as paper towels and tissues, office supplies that can be used, Guard Dog door jammer, hangers for the closet,  a shelf divider for the closet, a hanging cubby organizer for the closet, and a toolbox with all my tools and accessories in it.

Unit will be available Nov 1st. (Maybe sooner.) I'm asking $1,900 - $2,000 per month. This will cover the rent, utilities, and internet. 

I've included pictures of the space. However, I'm still living in it. So, pardon the mess. Everything that is circled is coming with me and won't be there when you are renting. I will also be getting the space deep-cleaned before move-in.

I say it changed massively, for all the purposes relevant, it ended.  Yes it ended and yet im still here.  Confused, join the club ha ha. 
I'll start from the beginning.  I was just your average guy, moving from job to job, living from paycheck to paycheck, somewhat nerdy although you would never guess looking at me.  Just average, nothing special.  So, when I walked into a new job delivering packages for a large company that will remain nameless, there was no need for me to worry or think twice.  I had been at the job for about two weeks and everything was normal.  I had a package delivery for a office block just outside the city, in one of those ""shopping/business areas"" that most companies use for nothing but warehouses and offices.  I walked up to the desk, stated who it was for and was told to head upstairs, 3rd office on the right.  This did kinda set off the warning bells, since i drop off and walk out for offices, but it was the last package of the day before I headed out on holiday so I just sighed and headed to the lift.
As the bell ringing, the door opened and I was hit by the bright lights of office bulbs, I headed out the lift and started my search.  3rd on the right, exactly where the lady down stairs said, the plaque read ""Dr. F.N. Stein"", I knocked and waited.
""What is it!? Come in!"" A voice blared from inside, ""wow, most people say hello"" I thought, I opened the door and saw a older man sat at a desk, working between papers that were scattered all over the desk and a laptop that looked custom made.  ""Got a parcel for you here, the lady told me to bring it straight up"" I flourished the package in front of me as proof of the situation ""uh yeah put it over there"" he waved his hand over towards a table that had a well used coffee machine on it.  Apparently manners don't follow you up the education ladder, must be to heavy I chuckled as I put the parcel down next to the coffee stained machine. As I placed it there was a bit of a click but never thought anything of it, must have been a crunch of old coffee ""there you go, hope its all correct, can I take a picture to prove its been delivered?"" I asked, not that I need permission but I wanted to demonstrate manners to hopefully remind the man what they sounded like ""yeah, sure, just don't get anything else in the picture"" he responded without looking up from his work, I smiled and took my phone out and snapped the picture, tagging the time and sending it to the company, I turned round and headed towards the door ""hope to see you ag..."" and that is when there was a massive bang, like a display firework going off right beside your head, I was thrown through the open door, through the glass panel window, where the world slowed down as I thought ""well, thats that then, at least I can say I left the world with a bang"" i closed my eyes and readied myself for the thud.
My eyes shot open and I sat up patting myself down everywhere, making sure everything was there and where I expected them to be, after a minute of panicked patting I realised I was technically whole, I say technically because, my limbs were there, just, a bit, longer and thinner, not exactly as I remember them ""the actual hell is going on... THAT IS NOT MY VOICE!!"" my exclamation came out in a deep, raspy voice.  I had a deep voice anyway but this, THIS was different.  I reached up to touch my face, expecting to feel the beard, now smooth, too smooth, there wasnt a mouth, my hands slid over my face, there was nothing there, but I could still see, my 'eyes' were where I expected them, just couldn't feel them ""what happened to my face? What happened to me? What..."" a sudden pain shot through my body, like an electric firestorm flew through my nerves causing me to stop my thoughts and stiffen like a board.  My skin started to burn and flex, I rolled on the table and rolled off hitting the stone floor.  With so much pain running through my body I could have landed on a pillow and wouldn't know the difference. 
After what felt like an eternity, the pain subsided and I let out a breath I didn't realise I was holding, but no breath passed my NOT lips, I looked down at my body as I crawled onto my hands and knees, when did I put a suit on? Was i always wearing one? I started patting it, rubbing my sleeves, noticing that I could feel my suit, it wasnt a suit it was my skin!
I sat on the floor and for the first time started looking at my surroundings, now that my body has decided to stop hurting and growing Armani suits, it was a plain room, solid wooden table in the middle, couple of chairs next to it, a cute cuckoo clock on the baige walls that felt slightly out of place.
I crossed my legs under me, with surprising ease, I folded my arms and place my chin on my chest.  What happened? The last thing I remember was flying through windows after a rude man in a office exploded, I was looking at grass before closing my eyes and waiting to give the earth the last fist bump I ever would and... and... this room? Im sure I missed part of the conversation somewhere. So, I looked round seeing a door and started to get to my feet, I got a bit of a wobble when I realised I wasnt 6 foot 4, but now closer to 8 foot on very spindly legs. I'm suddenly glad that I can grow my clothes because it was already tough and expensive getting clothes for my God shaped body, bhudda is a god and he is smiley so dont judge, im now a jack skeleton wannabe with no face holes and dressed like the mortician to the stars, give me a break. 
I reached out to the door and pushed, it slowly opened with a creak as I ducked under the frame to enter the next room.  I was outside, in the woods, not in another part of the house, this is starting to annoy me, has the world taken some sort of drug and making the rules up as it went along? I looked back to the door and saw it was only a door, there was no room, well there was a room just only inside the doorway, have I become the Doctor? The door slowly closed behind me and as soon as it did, it fell backwards onto the forest floor and disappeared.
I was left, in a forest, in a body that I'm pretty sure wasn't mine this morning, no face or face attributes, im well dressed for a business meeting, not so much for a hike and I'm taller than a globetrotter.  This is not covered in my job description and certainly more than my wage is worth.  I started walking in a random direction, my thought being a forest eventually stops being a forest and turns into people places where phones and Internet are a thing.  It was quite, no noises, not even birds shouting at each other, I hadn't seen an animal, person or anything but trees for the whole time I walked, I wasn't getting tired but continued to eat the miles.  Where was I? This forest is huge, doesn't feel like England anymore, although I didnt spend alot of time in the great outdoors beyond LARP events and family camping trips, just feels too big.
After what seemed like hours I eventually saw a break in the trees, could I have reached the end thank all the gods! As I reached the end I could see the sun getting brighter as I moved closer to the edge, I slowly peered out the forest, a park, wide open areas with benches and water fountains.  I slowly walked out, almost blinded by the change in brightness, I walked towards the fountain, switching it on and splashing my not face with water, I turned and sat at a table looking round me. I don't recognise any of this, the forest seemed to surround the area, I sat with my head in my hands when suddenly I heard a noise, my head whipped round to the sound and nothing was there.  I got up and slowly made my way to the origin, I'm sure something had to be there, as I got closer to the area a shape began to materialise, a blurry group of people, is my lack of eyes not working? Are there glasses i can get? Where would I even hang them i dont have ears!  As I got closer they suddenly became 4k I jumped back out of suprise and felt a pain in my back. The group of people suddenly looked in my direction and let out a scream, or at least they looked like they did there was no noise and suddenly they evaporated.  I leaned forward waving my hands over where they were, suddenly black tendrils swept the area I just did with my hands and I jumped to the side almost falling over but another set of tendril kept me up ""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUUU"" I began to scream before suddenly the whole park came to life, families, pets, old couples all turned to where I was and began screaming and running away, I reached out trying to show I'm not dangerous when a tendril shot out and wrapped round a man as he ran away, he struggled then poof, gone. What is going on? The tendrils shot out in all directions grabbing random people, families and everything in-between, each person disappeared after a small struggle as I walked forward as if on automatic, trying to ask for help to no avail.  I managed to reach the edge of the park, a road heading down to a carpark suddenly flooded by people as I began to run towards them thinking I just want help and they might have a phone.  With a whoosh of air and suddenly the world dropped into darkness, the carpark was gone and replaced by more forest, I spun round trying to figure out what happened when I heard crying coming from behind me.
I slowly made my way towards the noise. Hiding behind trees and foliage as I got closer.  As I almost made it near the noise I started hearing people clearer, I fought the urge to charge out, since it didnt work out last time.  ""It's ok baby, we will get out of here, daddy has gone to look round to see if he can find the car. Shhhhhhh"" a mother hugging her son close to her trying to soothing him as he cried into her.  I looked round trying to see if I could see anyone else, I heard twigs cracking in the distance so I moved round the crying mother and son, brushing past a tree, knocking off a piece of paper, confused I looked at it. There was a number 1 in the corner and a picture of a forest with people sat in it, a dark tall figure stood behind them, apparently hidden to them.  I dismissed the page and walked towards the cracking noise.",2,1758582361.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

For a first date, I always do drinks or coffee for around 2 hours. This is always fine because I can talk 2 hours for no problem. Just long enough for us to get comfortable enough together to have some laughs 

For the second date I always do dinner then sit in a park (usually like 4-5 hours total)

Consistently, conversation always dies down on that second date in the last couple hours.
As a result, I always interpret that as ""oh I guess she's not the one, I don't really click with her""

Until I realized I don't hold my close friends, who I genuinely connect with, to the same standard.

I never sit and talk with them, doing nothing for hours on end. If I did, I am certain the convo would die off.

I get bored just talking - independent of my connection with someone.

But all along, I've been conflating this boredom with a lack of a connection.

Moving forward I'm thinking at the very least, I do dinner and some sort of activity, if not just some activity during the day.

I'm curious to hear what people who have had success have done for their dates.

I will add, as further evidence, the one time I did an activity on a second date, we saw a comedy show. That was coincidentally the one time I had success, and we saw each other for a couple months",7,1758582154.0,dating,13,0.89,False

Pumunta sila dahil yung iba kong friends, nakikipag-usap pa rin sa mga ex-friends namin. Basta out of five, dalawa sa kanila yung may connections pa sa ex-friends na yun. Anyways, kahit wala ako doon, alam ko na if majority of my friend group is fine with the ex-friend, fine na rin naman ako kasi namimiss ko rin naman sila. So we have two more ex-friends to make connections again to go. Isa na busy sa internship niya kaya palagi siya busy and minsan lang daw yun nagchecheck ng messages. We wronged her before because we felt betrayed that she chose her bf over us, which was very immature on our part since we were high schoolers (but they broke up now so no big deal of it now.) She left the group kahit na siya yung reason na bakit nagawa group namin in the first place. So we still missed her and felt truly sorry for our hurtfum words. Pero siya daw feeling ng friends ko yung madaling kausapin and she might easily forgive us.. How can we talk to her if she is always busy tho? The next gril is the hardest to apologize to kasi she is always so ""tough to handle."" Can't describe her without being offensive but basta madali siya magtampo. But we still miss her ofc. The thing is, we never did anything wrong to her kaya wala kaming reason na makipagaway. We were just annoyed that she always prioritize college activities more than us but we were never mad-mad at her. So she just cuts us off out of nowhere and creates separate with our friends and the other ex-friends. Kaya kahit wala kaming ginawa, siya ata yung pinakamahirap magsorry. She is always online pa naman compared sa last girl.

We— rather— I don't know what to do. What if yung friends namin na may connection pa rin sa kanila magkakamilestone sa buhay atneed kami magsalo salo for it, paano na awkwardness namin noon? We are already in our mid 20s and we don't want to keep holding on to this relationship in where we don't talk to each other anymore na parang mga batang matampuhin.

I thought it was possibly food poisoning 1 week ago but then it happened again last night, this time with me throwing up multiple times as well. I then have a really uneasy stomach the whole next day.

I’m wondering if this is from caffeine with Qelbree???? It’s odd, tho, because when I drink a regular soda or black iced tea — this doesn’t happen. I drink black iced tea almost daily too. But I’m wondering if caffeine as coffee or green tea is the culprit here? 

I can’t think of what else it’d be as the 2nd time was very unlikely food poisoning. I ate what I had eaten for a couple of days already. ",1,1758581973.0,qelbree,3,1.0,False

Bill brought me some fresh clean underpants, overpants, and t-shirt from his own supply of clean laundry. I also got some socks from him, but his extra shoes were way too big. Bill's a big guy and and I'm more medium sized. All his clothes were too big, but it only really mattered with shoes. Baggy pants and shirt are no problem... 'baggy' shoes give blisters. 

Molly, the purple eyed Krethellic clyman had one of their males weave me some slippers out of his natural silk. They were great, extremely comfortable shoes and I said so... I knew all about the Krethellic. I just... forgot, I guess, in the moment. My mind was unfocused and struggling after my hyperspace suit had sizzled away. 

Before we get to my coming embarrassment in the dining facility - where I publicly received the slippers and openly praised them - I'd like to stall a while by explaining some things about the Krethellic. A fascinating species with three sexes, a rare evolutionary adaptation only found in a handful of sapient species. 

The males, which have sperm, the females, which have eggs, and the clymale, which have a catalyst material required for the the sperms and eggs to actually get together and make a new Krethellic grub. Clymale 'sauce' does also have some of the necessary genetic information, though biologically, their sauce was least costly to make of the three sexes, by a wide margin. This left more resources for them to put into their big ol' brains.

Unlike humans - where men and women are equally intelligent - Krethellic clymen are by ***far*** the most intelligent of their sexes, and all clymen are highly intelligent. All Krethellic understand language and most are smart enough to hold a conversation about the weather, but only the clymen are actually capable of understanding the most complex mathematics, warp engineering principles, regular engineering principles, complicated logistics, physics, and so on. 

Think of the most empty headed suburbanite you know, now stereotype them harder... make them little dumber than that. Maybe give them a quick concussion with a brick. That's it, perfect! You've reached the pinnacle of intellectual possibility for Krethellic males. And most are much, much dumber. To many terrans, the males seem less intelligent than smart dogs. But they can speak and they clean things well enough. They have their functions in Krethellic society, and just like humans, unbonded males tend to form packs and cause trouble.

Males are not allowed to vote, ever. The females are though, for certain things, mostly of domestic concerns. Only clymen have the full franchise, or hold high offices; it seems to work for them.

The average Krethellic female's intelligence lies well on the higher end of in between male and clymale. Sometimes smarter females choose a gender expression closer to clymale and are found working as lab assistants and in the sciences. They also fill many early educational roles in Krethellic civilization. Female teachers in the first few years of schooling are not uncommon. Unbonded females sometimes fill the typically clymale roles of later educations, what is essentially highschool. Krethellic women often leave those roles and change gender expressions entirely when they find a clymale's family to bond with. Sometimes they don't though. Plenty of old lady bugs teaching the kids what's what well into their 80s and 90s. Krethellic don't retire. It is a foreign concept to them.

The males, being dumb as hell, are generally only educated for the first five years after metamorphosis. After that they are adult in body form and mind, and can go off into their adult lives. Women take more like twenty years for a full education and maturation, though technically, they can start laying at about fifteen if they need to for some reason. Clymen generally aren't 'finished' until they are nearly thirty years post-metamorphosis. Typically they don't start trying to form a family unit until they've completed a PhD level education.

Aside from intellectual differences, and maturation rate difference there are size differences too. The males are smallest, standing between knee and waist high on a human adult. Their primary function for the species has historically been, sperm haver, egg minder, and cocoon maker and tender for the pupae that are ready for metamorphosis. 

The females are middle sized, average not as tall as humans, but there is significant overlap in the tallest Krethellic females and the shortest humans. Clymales cap out around 2.2 meters, but on average only a handful of centimeters over the average human male in height.

Once they grow beyond the grub phase, if they survive metamorphosis, the female parent tends to take over the child minding. Even now, less than a third of grubs succeed in their metamorphosis. The Krethellic don't find this fact as horrifying as the terrans do, 'that is just how it is' they say. The Krethellic don't spend research time or money on things like that, they don't get emotionally attached to them until after they successfully hatch from a metamorphosis.

Speaking of emotional attachments, their family units are typically structured with a Clymale at the top, three to eight females (normally at least a few different genders expressed in this group), and a smattering of males that sorta get... handed around the community as needed. What the terrans had once done in a desperation to make sure their populations didn't become too inbred, the Krethellic had done as a matter of course for thousands of years. 

A male tends a brood from egg to grub until he's put them all in cocoons for their metamorphosis, and when they all emerge, or don't, he cleans up what remains. If the other parents want, they can keep him around for another round, but usually that only happens if there's no other place for him to go find to be, or he's proven himself exceptionally useful to the family unit. 

Unlike humans, sexual reproduction activities aren't recreational for the Krethellic. Sucks to be there. It also means that their mating and family units are far more based on utility than emotion. That said... they are complicated beings with a whole range of emotions. 

So I tell you all this because there is one last thing you need to know about them... culturally. Like it always does, biology effects culture. 

So there's this... *thing*... in Krethellic culture, the gifting of silks. It is how a clymales indicate to females that they'd like to add them to their harem. If the female responds with vociferous praise that means yes, I'd very much like to join your family. Its kind of a, 'Look at the quality of the silk I get from the males in my household' kind of deal. Smoother, bouncier, silks are said to have better chances helping a grub survive metamorphosis. 

I knew all this, I swear it I did, but I was... not thinking. I was only thinking of food and trying to be polite, and those slippers were *mad comfortable*. Looking back, I should not have said they were the 'most comfortable thing' I'd ever worn, and going on to say 'I'd love to have a whole robe made of silk so fine' was likely a mistake as well. 

There's another, recent *thing* in Krethellic culture too... the claiming of humans. Clymen who convince humans to join their family units. Often the clymen also try to acquire multiple humans when they do this, men and women.  

I don't rightly know if Molly blushed, but I know they did not - initially - intend those slippers as such a gift. That said, we had just walked into the dining facility as I was extolling the virtues of the slippers their males made me.

The sound of general conversation stopped abruptly as we entered, and my ""I swear these silk slippers are amazing, Molly. It's like walking on a cloud!"" echoed through the room. At first I thought they had all stopped to look at me because I am Dilt Bifferent... but it turns out it was because, I had loudly, publicly, turned a friendly inter species gift into a marriage proposal. All I had to do was say, 'thanks for the shoes' and nothing more, but no, I am Dilt Bifferent, I couldn't possibly do things the easy way.

""I accept!"" Molly hadn't previously considered taking a human into their household, it was a status symbol they had assumed above their station as a mid level scientist, but given the opportunity, and the general cultural peer pressure from the clymen and women, how could they refuse? How could they skip on this chance.

""Great, me too."" I said, not certain of what I was accepting exactly. My mind was a bit scattered at this point still. 

""Witnesses! You saw it, we both agreed! He's mine! Mine!"" Molly grabbed my hand in theirs and dragged me to a table nearby, where they sat me down. ""I'll get you some food darling.""

They'd watched enough human TV to know some pet names humans like, but in the moment, the darling REALLY threw me. I was just happy to be getting fed.

Molly brought me things from the human food line, and also the Krethellic food line. Only some things in the Krethellic diet are bad for terrans, and likewise the other way around. No coffee for Krethellic, but everyone enjoys tequila. And a human should never drink zurctzurt, unless they want to hallucinate non-stop until they either receive medical attention or die.

I ate, and ate... and ate. I was ravenous. It was like there was a year of design work I'd done and needed to recoup all the missing calories from that hypertime stint I did. Simultaneously, it was like I'd never eaten a thing before in my entire life... which, from a certain point of view, I think was true. 

I ate pizza, a hotdog, a piece of cheesecake, and an order of fries. Then I destroyed some cheese burgers, after which I started on the Krethellic food.

I ate various puffs and balls of flavor I didn't know what were or care. Then I had a steak of some kind, and finally I destroyed some beeschurgers. 

The Krethellic keep a sort of... insect cow, that humans call Beeffalo. They also make a fermented 'milk' into a kind of 'cheese' from these beeffalo. A beeschurger is just what humans call a beeffalo meat burger, with beeffalo cheese on it. 

The other humans looked at me like I was insane for devouring and *enjoying* Krethellic cuisine, or maybe it was what I did on my way in, but meat is meat, and beeffalo is like... beefy flavored shrimp. It's delicious.

Bill's shirt was less baggy when I finally finished, and his pants barely fit anymore after I'd eaten what felt like fifty thousand calories.

Speaking of Bill, he'd come back to tell me they'd transmitted the data from the probes I'd sent to get eaten by the Scourge, and the Krethellic high executor and the human prime citizen were both getting together to speak with me on comms, soon.

Hopefully they'd be willing to listen, because this empire was technologically a long way behind the other two children of Sol. They hadn't even envisioned some of the materials that would be needed to build the enfuckulator... I'd need them to spin up whole new industries from scratch. I'm pretty sure I'd drawn up designs in my furious design spree for not just the enfuckulator itself, but some devices to help my hosts make the parts needed for it. I just hope their government heads are happy with the fact I don't know how it works or exactly what it does or if its safe to be around. I just knew from before coming here, that we were really gonna need one, sooner than later.
