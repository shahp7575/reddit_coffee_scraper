1pzzfke,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pzzfke/something_told_me_not_to_leave_my_apartment_i/,Something Told Me Not to Leave My Apartment.  I Should Have Listened.,"I didn't go to work that day.  Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else.  Even if I wanted to, I *couldn't.*  My doom sense was tingling.  It might sound silly, but let me explain.  



Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house.  If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail.  That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls.  As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; *Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass.* It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms.  Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up.  So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all.  But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again. 



But, I don't like to dwell on that.  Life goes on, and it's easy to write of the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized.  When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending.  It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate.  As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy.  The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; *sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance.* I think I always knew that was bullshit.  I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I *knew* that something terrible was waiting for me.  Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.  



My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30.  I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower.  No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me.  Only *hit* isn't the right word.  Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water.  A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps?  Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else.  The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.



*DON'T.*  



I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway



*STOP.*



My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.



*WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.*



Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.



“*What the fuck are you doing?  You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”*



Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure.  I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker.  I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road.  As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking.  The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed.  I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand.  I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.  



Those drops are still there as I write this.  After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble.  I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30.  I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.  



*“What are you waiting for now?  Time to get going, idiot.”*



It was right again.  I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks.  My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time.  Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me.  The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.  



*“Stop thinking about it, and go!”*



I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button.  The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow.  So far, so good.  A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator.  I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.



*TURN AROUND.  GO HOME NOW.*



*“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”*



Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance.  It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this *was* stupid.  So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut.  When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.



The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by.  Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal.  I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand.  *Man,* I thought, *I really worked myself up for nothing.*



*“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving.""*



“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk.  I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow.  I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby.  “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.



I shook my head and let out another chuckle.  I liked Paul.  For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive.  I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.



“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”



Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair.  “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly.  “Not much excitement here to keep me awake.  Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”



We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It *was* good.  We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack.  My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision.  No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears.  I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be.  I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.

  
  


I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow.  I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came.  Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.



*DOOM.*



A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail.  The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.



*“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”*



The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk.  A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building.  The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line.  The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal.  The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact.  I was lying.



I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.



“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath.  In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside.  At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane.  The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck.  The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away.  The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.



There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling.  As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant.  I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music.  To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head.  I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home.  The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.



“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.



“Jason, it’s Mark.  It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk.  Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either.  Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand.  Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception.  I don’t want to write you up, but…” 



Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture.  I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said.  I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me. 



*“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”*



Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.  



“There…there was a terrible accident.  Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark.  Channel 2.”



“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”



I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marveling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of.  The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horror show before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.  



“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars.  Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”



I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.  



“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”



I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly.  I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle.  In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave.  I fell into my bed, and started crying.  I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down.  All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…



*YOUR FAULT.*



No. That wasn’t right.  There’s no way it could have been *my* fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that.  It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance.  There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to…

‘

*YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE.*

*‘*

*“Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit.  Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”*



That may have been true, but…



*“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”*



My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure.  Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions.  Grief, anger, fear, and guilt.  The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same.  It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines.  By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word.  I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings.  My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers.  I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children.  My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.



*“Tomorrow will be better.  Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”*



If only.



My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.

It was the most fun we’ve all had together in so long. We were basically going over memories of what each sample scent smelled like to us, how different ones dried dow, ones we just absolutely loved and ones we THOUGHT we loved but hated on us.

It saved me hundreds $$ also. The scents I thought I’d loved JUST didn’t do it for me and I lost the itch to buy. It was also nice getting out of our comfort zone and bonding in a different way.

1pzz5yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pzz5yo/its_overno_more_contact/,It’s over/no more contact,"So my ex and I broke up back in July (I’m the dumper) due to constant arguing, passive aggressive comments, little to no sex and everything became like a job. I was also always walking on eggshells for about a year prior and I just couldn’t do it anymore. So after the breakup, we didn’t talk much (she was heartbroken) so a couple of weeks after the breakup, she reached out to me saying her dog was sick and needed to go to the vet and if I would go with her to show support (which I did) and it turned out that her dog was fine… anyway, shortly after that we started doing FWB (bad move on my part) and that ended about a month later but she insisted that she still wants to be close friends with me so we stayed in contact. Now 5 months later, she asks me to meet her for coffee and tells me that she’s seeing someone now and that we can no longer talk out of respect to her new man. I felt relieved because I felt obligated to be her friend because I broke her heart. In these 5 months I haven’t had proper time to heal from the relationship because we were still talking and now I feel so stupid. She told me that we can’t talk anymore but also went on to say that if things don’t work with her and this new guy that she’ll be phoning me to vent about it. WTH! Am I going nuts over here? I should have put my foot down and went no contact with her but I was thinking of her and how she felt and not about myself and my healing. For anyone going through a breakup, do yourselves a favour and avoid all contact with your ex. Healing is the most important tool to move forward. Has anyone else here kept in contact with their ex after the break up out of obligation? Or have any of you broke the no-contact rule and later regretted it?",1,1767142329.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

You spend your salary caking yourself in factory-produced expensive makeup and buying outfits online that fit like a sock on an aubergine with dreamy visions of meeting your soulmate in it. You seek out the busiest happy hours and spend $10 a pop on cocktails and coffee in bars or cafes hoping the perfect guy will somehow walk up to you and open conversation instead of someone younger and prettier. Eventually you humble yourself and talk to any guy you're not fully invested in but still after more than 15 minutes of conversation even he begins to see the red flags and realise that your political views are a risky endeavour to get attached to for more than a single night, so he secretly starts plotting a beat and delete, adding one more to your tally, increasing your disdain for men just that little bit more so you can do your civic feminist duty of posting Reddit comments to ""serve"" men on subs like BasedCampPod 💯",3,1767142242.0,BasedCampPod,1,0.8,False
1pzz4st,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pzz4st/three_stood_one_fell/,"Three Stood, One Fell.","The Man was a memory as they ran, wet and sweaty, rushing through the swamp, the vague aura of enemy territory clinging to the muck as they carried themselves forward in a single file. 



That amphitheater was immense, built on the scale of the gods, large in a way that parents are to young children, filled with the noises of their kith and kin, anxious as the stage became illuminated in the dull, muted grey-red light. The Man had strides like a giant, was a giant, impressive in memory and stature, and his voice was absent. He did not speak, because no words would ever convey his truths. He used his hands.



He held up three fingers and the amphitheater was silenced immediately.



Wobbly jaws, curled hands, anxious feet, they were frozen. The message was unmistakable. 



Three were asked to volunteer. A sacred number. A number of immense power. 



Three would face the very real risk of never seeing home and hearth, of not knowing the tastes of familiar waters, of becoming a flash of fire and a gust of ash. 



None stood until They did.



The first was taller than those near her, broad of shoulder, a mother twice over, head angled up to meet The Man's eyes, immobile to the spot and simply a beacon against the dark shapes. 



The second, a runt, broad of tooth only, struggled to stand, weighed down by a field pack, then slid it to the padded floor before staying upright, nodding with clarity: they were committed, his nod said. 



The third was average in many ways, scarred and experienced, somehow an expected figure to be on his feet. Those around him broke with the way and nodded at him reverently, and he shook his head, bringing them back to the stony, inert mode, looking up to The Man with pride.



As one, they moved, cutting through the crowd, parting them with the grace that only a volunteer could. When they stood at The Man's side, they looked out in the sea of their fellows, and as one, performed the Old Way salute: three fingers raised on the right hand, unfurling them upward, then rotating the hand to the left, putting the three fingers parallel to the ground. The Sacred Number, the Old Way salute.



The crowd bowed their heads, and the world was gone for the three volunteers.



A meeting. A few diagrams, a map memorized. The return of their old kit, the issuance of the minimal equipment for the mission. 



The Long Ride to the Great Machine.



Sleep.



Then the awakening en route, their bodies rejuvenated by the electric rest, minds alert, their social needs immediate and immense. Finding each other was curing a disease which had no name, and they were whole again. 



They climbed into the torpedo tubes, fastened their gear, then against all protocols, knocked three times. The echoes of the other two breaking the same rule was a comfort in the dark confines, and then they were pushed out at immense speeds, accelerating in the dark world.



They arose on the beach, their tubes crumpled, flooded, useless, tiny green and blue stars dying as they closed the hatches behind themselves. 



They didn't speak as they moved, each carrying their gear in the rueful manner of all soldiers: they were trained, effective killers of killers, born to the world to bring about the end of it for others. 



The tunnel gate was torn off of its mounts as the three worked in tandem, peeling it away first, then cutting through the wire and the bars, leaving it a gaping wound in the concrete slab, artfully pulling it back into position once they were inside of it. 



Within the confines of the reinforced tunnel they ran, only emerging into the swamp which was being drained, albeit ineffectively, by the grand edifice ahead of them: a waterworks operated by the enemy itself.



The swamp was a second home for them, their single file progress deeply familiar; training, and in most cases, life itself, began in swamps, and some never really left it in their minds. Forever trudging through the horrors and the beauties, always mindful of others and threats. 



The fastest human in the days of old could swim at a top speed of ten kilometers per hour and maintain it for sporting purposes. They progressed at fifteen kilometers per hour and maintained it for nearly three straight hours before arriving at their destination: the dry hillock in front of a large air vent.



The Three stood slowly, unfurling from the waterline with reluctance, shedding water as they examined the issue. The diagram was accurate, although in the tradition of military intelligence, missing a useful fact. The hatch needed to be accessed was located eleven meters from the ground, which was wet and spongy, and the nearest ladder was in enemy hands.



The smallest, his name plate removed, gave a short and gruff burp of irritation; he was the most inexperienced, although not to mistakes. He'd made his fair share and in living memory. The elder, her chuckle muffled by their uniform mask, gave a subtle twitch as a rebuke, chuffing her own reply in acknowledgement. The middleton looked up, sighed, then rubbed his jaw before he tilted his head to each side, drawing a crunching sound as the vertebrae crackled from stress.



Stepping back, he gestured to the smallest, curling his hand, then pointing down, then pointed to the taller female, grunting and elevating his palm, to which she nodded her assent. He drew his sharpest blades and readied himself.



Three quick strides in reverse later and he ran full-tilt to the wall, dropping his head in the posture of a planned impact, then stepped onto the back of the smallest member of their trinity, lifted up as the youth rose to his full height, and was further accelerated skyward as the taller female shoved her hand up in a straight leap, providing him with a single foothold on her palm, using it to gain additional height.



He landed against the wall, a wet, flat slapping sound echoing over the marshlands for the edification of birds, bugs, and bubbling gases, unheard by the living enemy. Stuck to the wall, his body unfurled, the blades stuck into the stony face of it, then drew himself to sit on the small ledge created by the two pointed weapons. 



Attaching a set of ropes to each, he dropped them to the ground, standing on the left blade, wobbling for a moment, then regained his balance, listening to the sounds of the other two as they climbed up the ropes; the pair were already preparing for the next stage: entry into the duct-works. The smallest was first to arrive.



Standing on the left-most blade, he worked the bolts loose from the vent, extracting each one rapidly, handing them to the smallest of the trio, who dutifully collected the eighteen centimeter dagger-pointed bolts in his vest's spare pockets. When the job was completed, the taller female held the frame from the wall, having peeled it free with almost no effort; it weighed a paltry sixty kilos, which she could free-curl with her off-hand for endless hours. 



They moved into the dark tunnel rapidly, pulling the vent in behind them, securing it with no more than its own weight, and progressed inward down the innermost workings of the facility. A long, arduous trip would follow, a maze only known to those who had been born to work the facility, or had studied a spoiler's map, memorizing it.



Even in darkness, they moved in single file, adroitly avoiding a set of sensors in one series of tunnels; the easiest way to do so was clinging to the walls, limbs splayed, bodies parallel to the surface, edging through in a perfect rhythm; their way of life was one of community, sharing burdens and pains, joys celebrated as a whole. All enemies equally dispersed evenly. A tunnel, even one navigated in the dark, moving off of the ground for seventy-five meters, was nothing by comparison.



At the end of the tunnels lay a final concern: the vertical shaft that connected to the command center above them, almost a hundred meters straight up, a three-meter wide monster which had no ladders nor handholds.



The true test was how to overcome the issue and seize the day.



No plan existed for it, no backups, no strategy; the intention was to surmount it through wisdom acquired within the field itself, and somehow, to do so within the next nineteen minutes, or the schedule set by The Man would be ruined.



In silence, they stood, examining the issue.



The tallest female sighed, grunting her displeasure first. The eldest grumbled, then farted, a universal sign of displeasure, to be sure. The youngest stepped away, although only for a moment. 



He then looked to the two, eyes alert and shining, an idea hiding behind his youthful features. Without speaking, he explained, using his hands and several motions, nodding his head, an expectant gaze beaming to the pair.



The tallest female nodded her assent, then rolled her shoulders, exhaling sharply. The eldest gave an affectionate rub of his hand on the youth's head, then nodded. 



Moving to the center of the shaft, they lay on the ground, shoulders overlapping each other, a triangle of heads facing away, and began to walk in place. By moving sinuously, as one, they pressed their shoulders into each other, feet bracing as much as moving forward, a locking of their bodies as they began to exert force enough to rise slowly from the ground. As they rose, all three were slowly spinning, a rising drill bit on the ascent, their soft, brutal exhalations masked by the noises of the great machinery's exhaust around them.



Up, up, up, they moved, and after twenty-five meters, chanced a look down, reminded of the stakes: success or death, and even success had the flavor of death to it. At fifty meters, they paused for the first time, almost losing traction enough to plummet, regaining their breath and speed, that steady, painful reckoning like no other experience thus far: all three minds shared a thought on how bad of an idea it was on the surface, although the admission of it working didn't reduce the sting of their progress one iota. All three shared the misery.



At the final meter, the eldest fashioned a knot onto his last section of rope, then linked all three of them together, and when he attached it to the handle on the hatch, they finally released their strides and dangled in the dark, exhaustion settling in rudely. 



She gave a tug on the rope and the other two roused action, stirred by ancient memories and the way of things: the war was not over and tasks were incomplete. 



The youngest was given the honors of the breach, his excitement as palpable as his eyes focused to the task; a sublime thing, that experience, to be the one who delivered the good news.



Armed with knives, he braced himself inverted on the hatch's frame, and the other two pulled it free, letting it slide into the dark to collide with the floor some hundred meters beneath it. In the dark, he was whisper-quick, and gone.



In the dark control room, what they saw emerge from the floor was a rush of cold air, then a flash of light - a pair of knives thrown, and then something painful and hard, a curved sphere of reinforced rubber, slapping a head, then bounding into the midsection of another, their first noises of impacts on the floor as they fell in agony and surprise. The other two were on the move, slitting throats as they passed the bodies, ignoring the shock and fear on the faces of their foes; death was guaranteed when they made those well-practiced passes of blade to trachea, carving them bone-deep in silence.



Four dead in under a breath, and the night had just begun.



Collecting their equipment, they staged for the next assault; a lengthy corridor, at the end of which was a central office, the command and control officers within it - the real prize and target. 



Opening the door, they saw the next and final failure of the mission's so-called intelligence package: the corridor, expected to be emptied at that time of night, had eleven people in it, eight of them armed with high-end weapons and the rest holding coffee cups and startled expressions.



The Three swore in the dark and moved as one.



A well-trained jai-alai player can accelerate a ball at speeds of up to 302 kilometers per hour; the specialized glove used to do so is handled with care. The three could routinely pitch a ball twice that weight at half that speed, although to those who were struck by them, the equation simply felt like someone snapped every bone in their skull at once, followed by collapsing parts of it hard enough to give them both strokes and heart attacks at the same time. Three corpses hit the ground as the hardened rubber-like balls bounded off of their initial targets and claimed a limb or torso, a secondary target crumpling just as fast.





In less than a breath, six were on the ground, three to never rise on their own, the other three - not in time to save themselves. The Three ran at their top speeds, heads lowered, and bounded into the mass, reducing their target profiles instantly, zig-zagging in a series of well-planned reactions.



By the time that the first shooters took aim, they felt the bodies of the invaders against their own, and saw the flash of teeth in the dark, lost in the madness of close-quarters combat. 



They had trained to fight all manner of men and women, hailing from a great many nations, states, and worlds, and they'd seen nothing like these three. 



A hardened gunner of the defenders held up his assault rifle, struggling to aim it, and felt long, painful wounds opening up on his forearm as he saw the smallest of the trio clamping his teeth over the gap behind his wrist; a savage kick from the tallest female dislodged the teeth, although it also tore his arm open, the ragged bones of it exposed as he saw the same rifle in the hands of the pair. Both held it aloft, bringing their elbows across the middle of it, her gripping the barrel as he gripped the trigger assembly, the satisfying snap of reinforced steel echoing in the corridor.



Two more defenders faced the elder male, finding him to be a blur of angry limbs in motion, stomping a hand, rising from the gritting of heel to fingers, then running up the wall two steps, bounding against a new target as a body slam, riding him to the ground again, returning to kick the original target in the face with both feet, knocking them out instantly. 



The stunned and terrified remainder tried to escape, then found a whistling noise chasing them in the hallway.



The youth advanced, moving the with the precise and angry madness of newfound combat, firing off three eighteen centimeter-long dagger-pointed bolts at a time, pinning them into retreating flesh, at each step, another set found meat to fly into, dragging their targets down, their cries of panic and pain lost, an echo dying as fast as they could.



When the smoke cleared there were shell casings, corpses, and a scattering of blood sprays, all three of them intact, standing, and breathing with the joy and contempt of war.



As one, they moved, shoulders diving in alternating turns, then moving forward, a unified motion, single-file once more. The Old Way emerged, as it often did, when the world needed to make sense again.



The steel door was reinforced and meaningless. After so many barriers, exhausting expanses of territory, labyrinths, and faceless souls, one metal door meant nothing to them.



The Three did not try to break it. Instead, they unfurled lengths of an orange-red cable, almost a hundred meters of it, placing it against the frame, highlighting the dull, muted color with the angry-bright coils, a wide and meter-tall bundle placed in the center of it in an expert's position. 



The eldest held up his hand, then curled his fingers, one by one, and the countdown was done in silence.



That well-made, professionally-installed door was guaranteed to withstand a cutting torch for almost a full day before being breached; it could stand up to a five-hundred kilogram battering ram for almost twice that time; the same was never promised by the designers of the wall.



Instead, it turned the wall into a vapor cloud, and due to the primary charge's placement, it turned the door into a projectile, shoving it into the room nine meters at almost the speed of sound, flattening the last defenders behind it, turning them into a thin, runny red mixture on the marble flooring.



Their dark alchemy accomplished, the three walked into the room, the stunned spectators as horrified as they were incapable of reacting, as they did not expect their well-made, professionally-placed door to become a weapon, to say nothing of failing to function as an actual barrier.



It was a guard, his ears ringing, who dropped his rifle and pointed to the man in the corner, huddled in fear, that turned the tables. Gesturing to the three, the guard held his hands up in the universal sign of surrender, and received the nod of dismissal from the tallest female, who then glanced wordlessly to the youngest member.



Without speaking, the youth fired a single thrown rubber ball down the corridor, connecting it with the skull of the fleeing guard, his corpse sliding to a halt only ten meters from the door's ragged former home.



The old man was like a great many other old men; frightened of the end of things, a bitter soul who'd done a great many crimes, wizened by the pain that they'd inflicted, another name on a list, and no more a criminal to the three than a lamp or a cardboard box. 



Just something that had to go away, and that's what they did. They made it go away, and did so with the Old Way.



They chewed his arm, leg, and head off of his body, peeling away his flesh, ignoring the shrieks of terror from the witnesses, gnawing into bone and gristle. When they were finished, they dropped the corpse, the old man's screams of defiance and begging already memories, letting the blood drip from their muzzles.



The eldest made a few adjustments to an access panel, bringing online a terminal, and soon they began their newest tasks: activating a series of pumps. Deep within the machine edifice, the pumps went from inert to functional, and outside the swamp became a small lake, slowly and steadily. 



The witnesses were dragged, bound and gagged, to the windows overlooking the newly-made lake, and the tallest gestured to the far horizon.



Thousands of green-blue lights blinked, vanished, and were no more, a sign of things to come. A new, dark tide on the rise, what approached would look very much like what stood in front of them.



Tall, muscular, fuzzy, their oily sheen was from their naturally-waterproof hair. Muzzles carried long, sharp teeth, still stained with fresh blood, their ears atop their well-formed heads, eyes located in the halfway space between forward and the sides of their skulls.



The scarred warrior of the three spoke, albeit without words.



He gestured to himself, the tall female, the youth, then held up three fingers, each of them joining in the Old Way salute, turning their hands to form the parallel motion of the three extended fingers. 



If three could unmake the capital, what would three thousand do in a day.



There were more than three thousand lights on the horizon, though.



There more than there were stars in the sky.



The three walked, moving into the darkness, soon to return to the water outside, choosing to take the elevator shaft instead of the air vents. 



Once outside, they greeted the world with a sigh, then dropped into the water as one, vanishing to join the great herd on the move, their journey just begun.



An army of their friends was heading inland, chasing the flood waters, a marine unit in every possible definition.



The Man, unseen, was felt by them, and they continued, and saw their ancient fore-bearers in huddled groups, stopping to stare at them.



A dead jaguar, torn apart and bloodied, lay in a heap, a chattering mass of aquatic rodents still struggling to deal with the post-battle havoc of nerves. The leader of the pack saw the trio on the mound of elevated earth, and chattered at them, as much in warning as it was in curiosity - friend-shaped, yet not?



The three smiled, chattering back, and returned to their tasks, and the Old Ways still meant something.",1,1767142241.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

So things have gotten worse.

It’s been a few days since I made a post on here and some new stuff has occurred.

I’ll start with the diary, as this has had its own developments since I last posted. I texted Robbie to let him know that it had reappeared and that it had more to say.

As I found out previously, the diary decided to write itself some more entries. It had written two.

The first was written as I was finishing my first post. As you may remember, this entry was for the 5th December 1966, one day after the collapse of the Shear mineshaft.

It filled two pages, and the handwriting was almost ineligible. I had to squint at some words because of how poorly they were scrawled.

Without further delay, here is the entry:

*5th December 1966.*

*Firstly, I apologise for the poor writing. I am writing this under dim lamplight, as the light from outside is now unavailable for the foreseeable future.*

*The shaft has collapsed. Unfortunately, Lewisham was correct. The ceiling has fell through about 2 miles down and has trapped twenty of us. Well, half that. Ten men are dead. They were either killed on impact or suffered slow deaths, whether their rib cages were crushed or their heads were popped clean open by the weight of the boulders. I can see their blood, and I can see limbs. But I can smell them the most. It’s strong and pungent.*

*Many of them slowed their screams to whimpers and then ceased to make sound. I saw friends of mine squashed and some most of them I didn't get to say goodbye to. They were dead as soon as the first rocks fell. I hid in an upturned trolley, thankfully no boulders landed on my metal shelter.*

*It is difficult see anything now. The only thing I can see from the entrance is the tiniest hole, half the size of a fist. We are still quite far down, and the lamps which light our prison are not enough. I even struggle to see my hand if I place it out in front of me, so I must stay close to the lamp. At least we don't have to see our fallen companions.*

*I can only truly recognise three men here:*

*There is Michael Stevens, whose wife is close with my own and they often trade their recipes at church. Nice man, quite pious.*

*There is John Dunn, who had started working here over a week ago. I believe his father owns part of the Tingrass mines. He’s a quiet boy, usually keeps his head down and is lazy unlike the rest of us. He looks at us from under his eyebrows and with a scowl.*

*Finally, there is Tim O’Connell, my dearest friend. I am overjoyed he lives, as he nearly met his fate when the ceiling fell. If it wasn’t for Stevens, I would have the unfortunate job of delivering the news to Marge and his little ones.*

*I have ordered the men to ration their food and water, and to steal from the dead. I am making them commit sins for their own survival. One of the men, I believe his name is Clark, has been praying for our safety. Dunn tells him not to, those outside shall come for us in a few days. He also says we should not ration either. If he is worried, he doesn't show it.*

*I struggle to believe him. It will be a few more days than that.*

*I am not one to pray, but I feel that if this situation does not improve I will be forced to. It is the only thing I have to connect myself to my family.*

*If the Lord above is as good as who we proclaim him to be, I hope he hears us and saves us.*

*Peggy, if you read this, I am so sorry that you must do so under these circumstances. I will be with you, always.*

That was the end of that passage.

I waited, scrunched up in the corner of my sofa. I thought another incident would happen like Saturday night; screams and crashes would fill my ears at any second.

Nothing happened. After about two minutes, nothing happened. I was relieved, I mean, I didn’t want my eardrums to actually rupture this time. However, I also felt like an idiot. For just a moment I felt like I was a fool for feeling scared of that book.

As I thought about my self-thought stupidity, the book slammed shut with a deafening bang. I almost shat myself.

It just sat there on my coffee table like it hadn’t been touched. I ogled at it before I threw that thing in the trash. This diary was haunted or some shit. Oddly, the book was lighter after I read that entry, but I still couldn’t hold it with two hands, so I had to swing my arms to launch it into the trash can like hauling a sand bag. I spun around and tried to clear my mind, continuously chanting in my head that this was just some sort of hallucination. Maybe I was spiked with LSD or salvia or something along those lines. Hell, maybe both.

However, I stepped one foot past the living room door and immediately took two steps back into the hallway.

There, laid on the coffee table, was the diary. It was placed on top of my laptop and remained closed. “Fuck this” I thought, and I opened my front door. I then threw the book outside, straight into my trash can.

I walked back into my house and into my living room. It was the same result as before.

I just lost control. I ended up setting the bastard on fire. I know, I should had more sense, but I thought it deserved it for nearly making me go deaf. I covered the diary in gasoline from basement and chucked a lit match at it. It was definitely in the burning barrel. I saw the smoke arise from my yard and twirl back towards the front of the house.

Turns out fire is useless against phantom books. I watched the thing burn to a crisp, then I turned around to come back into my house and there it was on my kitchen countertop, good as new.

To save my blood pressure from flying through the roof, I just walked away and left it there. I hoped that if I ignored it, it would go away.

How laughably stupid.

Like I mentioned, there were two diary entries that day.

The second one came before bed.

Robbie had read the message and promised to stay the night the day after, which was last night. He couldn’t come by that day because he was on patrol duty, but he let me know that I could ring him if anything happened and he’d be with me as soon as he could.

I texted him “thanks” and switched off for the night. I was going through every room downstairs and flicking off the lights when I reached the kitchen.

The diary was still there, except it had changed position. It was now open and had writing which covered the open page spread like before.

I actually felt torn whether I should've left the diary downstairs or brought it up to bed with me. I don’t know how but eventually I found myself in bed with the damn thing in my lap. I can’t even remember leaving the kitchen, let alone sitting in bed.

There was a pressure was felt in my head, almost as if someone pushed the back of my skull downwards and towards the book. Horrified, I obliged and read the new entry.

This is the last entry I have had since.

*17th December 1966.*

*I haven’t written much in the past week and I apologise for being so absent. I have had to limit my writing to little pages so the lamps have fuel to burn and the fire can keep us warm.*

*Our provisions are starting to go dry, however, I have made it my mission to keep us fed and watered for as long as possible, until they get us out.*

*The men are starting to go hungry. There were thirty packets of crackers, a few sandwiches and thirty packets of nuts. As well as this, we had twenty-four water canteens to share. We are now down to seventeen packs of crackers, ten nuts and no sandwiches. Water resources are now down to sixteen canteens.*

*Dunn becomes more agitated by the day. He berates us for rationing supplies and argues constantly with Clark for his prayers. He says they’ll be here soon, but I know that cannot be true. And I think he sees that too.*

*The smell from some of the bodies has became worse. They are rank and make me gag. We have since moved further down the mine to avoid the smell, much to little success. I can still hear some people outside talking, it is very quiet though.*

*The men often face away from the entrance and look into the abyss. There were lights down there up until a few days ago. They are no longer visible now and I think that scares them. We know there is nothing lurking there, yet our minds conjure fantasies of the unknown. I am ashamed it spooks me, but I try to remain stoic.*

*Stevens tells me of something quite alarming.*

*He wishes to go further into the cave.*

*I forbade him to go any deeper, and he started at me. His eyes were wrong. They were sharp and angry. There was a darkness in there that I simply didn’t like. He raised his shoulders like a cat and flared his nose.*

*He realised this odd display of intimidation had no effect on my judgement and so he told me “I will understand soon”, before shuffling off to the rest of the company.*

*I have spoken with Tim and he agrees to watch him closely. I attribute it to lack of sunlight and the pangs of hunger.*

*I just hope they come for us soon. I beg and I pray.*

That was what I remembered before I blacked out. I was up one second, and then I was down the next. When I woke up it was day and the diary had set itself on my nightstand.

This sends me onto the other stuff which has happened to me.

I have now started to have disturbing dreams.

For the past two nights, I have had nightmares. They start the same, but always finish differently. It’s just one dream, but it lasts a lifetime.

I’m always standing in front of the Shear mine. There’s no one else around and the only thing that lights the sky is the abundance of stars overhead. I stare deep into the mine. I’m trying to find something, I don’t know what. Even though I'm blanketed by the shining lights of above, I struggle to see anything in the gaping mouth of the cave. Tingrass is behind me, with Mount Wuthers' overarching presence always felt. I was being watched from behind and ahead. I felt the animalistic fear echo from deep within my evolved mind.

On the first night, I took three steps towards the mine before a hand reached out, impossibly long, black and twisted, touched my forehead and called my name. It was barely over a whisper, and I could feel each individual letter wrap around my mind before I woke up. That was the night I read the diary.

On the second night, whilst I was with Robbie, the dream was the same until the end. I took six steps that time, nearly crossing the threshold between the outside of the mine and the inside, towards the pitch-black. My toes scraped the boundary and the hand came. Long, bony fingers reached me and gently touched my temple. It called my name, clearer than last time. I heard a gravelly tone behind it when it croaked, “Matthew.”

I woke up and choked on a breath.

In the darkness of my bedroom, there was a black blob of a figure perched at my feet. Robbie was sat on the end of the bed. I quickly flicked the bedside lamp on and he had his eyes fixed on me. His lips were pursed and he was scratching the sheets nervously. His eyes were hesitant and wide, watching me sweat.

“You were talking in your sleep.” He whispered.

That leads me onto my final revelation.

I have also started to speak in my sleep again.

I say again, because I used to do it as a child, up until I was thirteen. I just stopped one day. No mumbles or blabbering. Dad used to come check on me when I did, and always used to wake me up if I got distressed.

It’s weird because I apparently used to be a serious chatterbox in bed before thirteen. According to him, I used to have full conversations with him.

Here’s what made the recent case different from then though.

As a child I was never able to say any names properly. If I was talking to my dad or my mom it would come out as, “dah” and, “mah”. If I was Tommy it would be, “Tohhhm”.

When I was asleep this time, I groaned, “Matthew.”

My own name.

Not only that, but I had been saying, “Home, I need home.” The name came at the end before I awoke.

Robbie tried to wake me up, but failed. It was like I had gone into a coma.

He filmed some of it for me to watch, which is certainly more horrible to see when you’re the one doing the strange shit without knowing. The video is a bit shaky and you couldn't hear much. It was just a mix of heavy breathing and me gritting out each word. I pushed my tongue against my two top front teeth, stretched my jaw almost as if it was tight and needed loosening, and bared my teeth after every circulation of the phrase. Every time in that order.

I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that it unnerved me. Made me feel ill actually.

“Holy shit,” I mumbled, “You heard that from the other room?”

He nodded. “You sounded weird, man, like you’re weird as hell already, but this was something else,”

I squinted at him and bit back, “You’ve just seen me do some freaky shit and you’re joking about it?”

He shrugged, “Just saying what I saw and heard, dude.”

He joked, not just for mine, but for his sake too. It’s like a defence mechanism for when stuff gets under his skin. He was skittish for the rest of the night and threatened to put duct tape over my mouth if I spoke again. Dick.

Robbie’s staying over again tonight. He’s actually seen the diary now and avoiding it like the plague. Which I don’t blame him for. He hasn’t even touched it since he’s seen it. I’ve had to put on top of the cupboard in the kitchen. Out of sight, out of mind.

I haven’t actually seen any new entries from the diary and it remains closed. I couldn’t even open it if I wanted to; the thing’s glued shut.

I have a funny feeling it'll write something new for me soon. Robbie's just left to go home and pack another overnight bag. I think he's staying for longer, especially in case that happens again. His girlfriend, Diane, won't be back for another week. She's a cultural anthropology student and Robbie's texted her for any knowledge on this situation. She's just as confused as we are, which I suppose is understandable. She says she can facetime us later on this week and we should record everything we do.

Being on my own unsettles me. It shouldn't but it does. I can see Tingrass outside my living room window so I keep my curtains shut. I feel like the only thing I have to keep my company is that diary. I'm tempted to go grab it.

I will see what happens with the diary. I appreciate Robbie and Diane's help. They’re the only ones who need to get involved. Tommy asks me how I am after I told him that I had a bad reaction to some plant in the woods. I tell him I'm fine. He doesn't need to know about this.

I just hope we can figure this out before it gets any worse.

1pzz0lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1pzz0lu/how_to_completely_transform_your_life_in_6_months/,How to COMPLETELY Transform Your Life in 6 Months Using DEEP WORK: The Psychology That Actually Works,"okay so I've been obsessively studying this whole deep work thing for months now. read Cal Newport's book like three times, binged every podcast with productivity experts, even tried those ridiculous 4am morning routines that fitness bros swear by. 

here's what nobody tells you: most people are living on autopilot. we're constantly distracted, jumping between tasks, refreshing social media every 5 minutes. our brains have literally been rewired for shallow work. and the scary part? we don't even realize how much potential we're wasting. the average person gets maybe 2 hours of actual focused work done per day. the rest is just... noise.

but here's the thing. this isn't entirely your fault. we live in an attention economy where every app, notification, and platform is literally designed by PhDs in behavioral psychology to keep you hooked. your biology is working against you too, our brains crave that dopamine hit from notifications. it's the same neural pathway as slot machines. but the good news is you can retrain your brain. neuroplasticity is real and it's insanely powerful.

Deep Work by Cal Newport is genuinely the best book on productivity I've ever read. Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's published like 6 books and dozens of peer reviewed papers, all without working past 5pm or using social media. the book basically argues that the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks is becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. he breaks down exactly why shallow work is killing your potential and gives you the framework to build a deep work practice. this book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity. I'm not exaggerating when I say it completely changed how I approach my work.

the core concept is building what Newport calls deep work blocks. these are periods of 90 to 120 minutes where you work on ONE thing with zero distractions. no phone, no email, no Spotify with lyrics, nothing. just you and the task. sounds simple but it's genuinely hard at first. your brain will literally fight you. you'll feel this intense urge to check your phone or quickly google something. that's your brain seeking easy dopamine. push through it.

start small though. if you've been living in distraction mode for years, trying to do 4 hours of deep work immediately will fail. begin with 25 minute sessions using the Pomodoro technique. there's this app called Forest that's perfect for this. you plant a virtual tree and it grows while you stay focused. if you leave the app, the tree dies. sounds stupid but it actually works because you've got this visual representation of your focus. plus they plant real trees when you hit certain milestones which is pretty cool. 

Another app worth checking out is BeFreed, which is an AIpowered learning platform built by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from highquality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and book summaries to create personalized audio podcasts tailored to your goals. You can customize the length from 10minute summaries to 40minute deep dives and adjust the depth based on your energy level. What makes it useful for deep work is the adaptive learning plan feature, it learns from your interactions and builds a structured roadmap for skill development. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges. The voice customization is actually pretty addictive, there are options like a deep voice similar to Samantha from Her or more energetic tones depending on your mood. Perfect for turning commute time or gym sessions into productive learning without the brain fog from doomscrolling.

gradually increase your sessions to 45 minutes, then 90, then 120. timing matters too. research shows most people's cognitive peak is 2 to 4 hours after waking up. that's when your prefrontal cortex is firing on all cylinders. so your hardest, most important work should happen then. not emails, not meetings, not admin stuff. your most cognitively demanding task. I block out 8am to 11am every single day for deep work and it's genuinely transformed my output.

you also need to eliminate decision fatigue. Barack Obama and Steve Jobs wore the same thing every day for this exact reason. every decision you make depletes your willpower. so automate everything you can. meal prep on sundays. lay out your clothes the night before. have a set morning routine you don't think about. the Atomic Habits approach by James Clear is killer for this. he talks about habit stacking, where you attach new habits to existing ones. like after I pour my morning coffee, I will sit down for deep work. your brain loves these automatic sequences.

another game changer is the shutdown ritual. this is straight from Newport's book. at the end of your work day, you review what you accomplished, make a plan for tomorrow, and then literally say shutdown complete out loud. sounds weird but it signals to your brain that work is done. no more checking emails at 9pm or thinking about projects while trying to sleep. your brain needs genuine rest to consolidate learning and maintain focus capacity.

the podcast Deep Questions with Cal Newport is also insanely good. he does deep dives into listener questions about focus, productivity, and living a deeper life. one episode that stuck with me was about attention residue. basically when you switch tasks, part of your attention stays on the previous thing. so constantly switching between emails, slack, documents means you're never fully present on anything. your cognitive capacity drops by like 40%. that's why batching similar tasks together is so effective.

environmental design is massively underrated too. your space shapes your behavior. if your phone is within arm's reach, you'll check it. guaranteed. so during deep work, put it in another room. use website blockers like Freedom to lock yourself out of social media. tell people you're unavailable during certain hours. create friction for bad habits and remove friction for good ones.

sleep is non negotiable btw. Matthew Walker's book Why We Sleep breaks down the science and it's honestly terrifying how much sleep deprivation destroys cognitive function. if you're getting less than 7 hours, your deep work capacity is shot. you literally cannot focus properly when sleep deprived. your brain needs that time to clear metabolic waste and consolidate memories. prioritize it like your life depends on it, because kinda does.

here's the brutal truth though. nobody is coming to save you. you can read every productivity book, listen to every podcast, buy every app. but none of it matters if you don't actually do the work. and the work is uncomfortable. sitting with difficulty without reaching for distraction feels physically painful at first. your brain will scream at you. but that discomfort is literally your brain rewiring itself. you're building new neural pathways. it gets easier but only if you're consistent.

one last thing. track your deep work hours. get a simple habit tracker or use the Streaks app. seeing your progress visually is incredibly motivating. aim for 20 hours of deep work per week to start. that might sound like a lot but it's less than 3 hours per day. and honestly, 20 hours of focused deep work will produce more results than 60 hours of distracted shallow work. quality over quantity always.

the transformation isn't overnight. but in 6 months of consistent deep work practice, you'll genuinely be unrecognizable. your output will skyrocket. your skills will compound. opportunities will start appearing because you're producing work that actually stands out. most people won't do this because it requires genuine effort and discomfort. which is exactly why it works so well for those who commit.

1pzyzhd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzyzhd,My Honest Review of my recent Royal Caribbean cruise trip with Symphony of the Seas,"My goal for this post is to spread awareness and help others avoid experiencing what we did. For us, the bad parts ultimately outweighed the good ones.

My husband and I booked this cruise to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, and it was also our first time ever going on a cruise, so we were genuinely excited and had high expectations.

We booked our trip through Harr Travel, and I want to start by saying they were great. They were helpful, responsive, and patient with all of our questions, and they helped us find a really nice stateroom. We chose a large ocean-view balcony, which ended up being one of the best parts of the trip.

Our cruise ran from December 14–21, 2025, and the main reason we chose this specific sailing was because of the four destinations that were advertised:

1. Nassau

2. Perfect Day at Coco Cay

3. Jamaica

4. Labadee

A few months before the trip, Jamaica was cancelled due to a recent typhoon. That was understandable.

Then Labadee was cancelled due to safety concerns and a travel advisory. Again, understandable.

But this is where things started to feel off.

This cruise was marketed and sold as a four-destination trip, and suddenly it was down to two. Eventually, Royal Caribbean added Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic as a replacement, making it three destinations.

Then, on the first day of embarkation, they cancelled Nassau due to severe weather.

So after paying over $6,000 for a 7-day cruise, we ended up with only two actual destinations.

I understand that we signed an agreement stating ports can be cancelled for passenger safety, and I fully support safety coming first. What I don’t understand is the lack of planning and accountability. Royal Caribbean is a massive cruise line, and there should be backup destination plans in place when multiple ports are cancelled. At this price point, turning everything into extra sea days without meaningful replacements doesn’t feel acceptable.

What really made me question the value of this trip was the refund.

For three cancelled ports, we received just over $60 back in port fees and taxes.

Over $60 refunded on a trip that cost over $5,000, while failing to deliver what was originally advertised. That simply doesn’t feel fair or worth the money.

Another major downside is how everything on the ship feels designed to cost extra, beyond the basics included in your fare.

For example:

You can’t use Netflix or Prime Video on the stateroom TV

The TV isn’t even a smart TV, which forces you to rent their movies

Power outlets are conveniently not placed near the TV, making it very obvious they don’t want guests plugging in devices like Roku

We actually brought a Roku and had to do a ridiculous setup just to make it work.

Drinks are another issue.

Only during breakfast are coffee, hot chocolate, and juice included for free. For the rest of the day and during other meals, drinks come at an extra cost unless you purchase a drink package. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage packages are charged separately, which adds up quickly.

In our case, we don’t drink alcohol, so we pre-ordered bottled water and sparkling water. On a cruise that costs over $5,000, basic drinks like soda and juice should already be included. Charging extra for those feels excessive.

Communication between departments also needs serious improvement.

We called guest services about a broken lounge chair on our balcony. It took a long time for anyone to address it, and there was no follow-up. I had to call multiple times.

Another example:

We called guest services to ask if there was availability for ice skating, and we were told there were no spots left. When we walked over to Studio B, the staff there immediately accommodated us without any issue.

Clearly, internal communication is lacking, and guests are getting mixed information depending on who they talk to.

One last thing that really left a bad taste:

The day after the cruise ended, we could no longer view our itinerary in the app or online. There was no clear section to see our cruise history or review our full statement. Everything basically disappeared. The only records we have are whatever was sent to our email.

It honestly felt like once the cruise was over, we were just… discarded. For a trip that cost this much, it would have been nice to still have access to our itinerary, history, and billing in one place.

The Good (because there were good things)

The show productions were amazing.

The ice skating performances were high-quality, the stage productions were impressive, and the AquaShow was absolutely breathtaking. Easily one of the highlights of the trip.

The staff and crew were wonderful. Everyone we interacted with was kind, hardworking, and genuinely helpful.

The food was great, and the specialty restaurants were reasonably priced for the quality.

We also really loved having The Key Pass. Priority embarkation and disembarkation made things much smoother, we were able to choose our times, and we received an exclusive meal on the first day and breakfast on the last day.

Another positive: one of our suitcase wheels broke during their handling, and they replaced the luggage with a new one, which we appreciated.

And finally, despite there being 6,000+ guests and 2,000+ crew onboard, the ship never felt overwhelmingly crowded. The ship is massive and well-designed, and there was always enough space to get away from the crowd.

Final Thoughts

When we honestly weigh everything together, the good and the bad, this experience makes us hesitant to consider Royal Caribbean again, especially Symphony of the Seas. While there were definitely some great moments, the lack of transparency, poor port planning, minimal refunds, constant extra charges, and the post-cruise experience ultimately outweighed the positives for us.

That said, I do want to end on a genuine and positive note. Despite everything, this was still our experience, and we’re grateful that we got to celebrate our first wedding anniversary together, travel, try new things, and create memories along the way. We’re still happy we got to share this experience as a couple, and that part will always matter to us.

This review is simply our personal experience, shared to help others go into their trip more informed and with realistic expectations.",1,1767141851.0,u_PinkPassion2518,0,1.0,False
1pzywsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1pzywsb/living_in_mystic_not_visiting/,Living in Mystic (not visiting)?,"Hi, all. I have a potential job in Mystic and am wondering how it is living there rather than just visiting.   
  
Does the town feel touristy year-round? Is there a sizable local community? Does it feel authentic or is more ""theme park""?

I've visited both Mystic and Stonington Borough before, and I quite enjoyed them both. However, I visited Mystic in August, so it was still swamped with tourists and I didn't really get to fully explore all it has to offer. I visited the Borough in February, and it was VERY quiet.

FWIW, I'm a single man in my 30s, and I love to walk to coffee shops, restaurants, libraries. Would like to get involved with the local community and put down roots.

I'm going to visit both (and possibly some other towns nearby) fairly soon but would love to hear from anyone that lives there year-round or knows what it's like as a local. Thank you!",5,1767141657.0,Connecticut,0,1.0,False

1pzyvf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1pzyvf1/i_realised_too_late_that_i_had_been_groomed/,I realised too late that I had been groomed,"I don’t know where to start, but I’ll try from the beginning for some context. 

I was in high school ten years ago, age 17, with a very complicated home life. I was a very lonely kid. At school, I had friends, I was well-liked, I was involved in school activities and every year possible I was always voted a school leader of some kind. My grades were excellent, mostly because I had this internal driving force of - this is my only opportunity to make something of my life. Without getting into the specifics of my home life, I was told I wouldn’t amount to much many a time. A bit depressing but relatable to many I am sure.

I had a science teacher who was just fantastic. He was, and arguably is, based on teaching alone, the best teacher I ever had. I absolutely idolised this man. At the time, I wanted to be just like him. A science teacher who would light up the passion of students while making sure they could actually improve their grades. I wanted to be this man, I wanted to be his best student, I wanted to feel like there was something going for me.

He was loved, adored, by the students. He was young, cool, charismatic, and again, a great teacher. At lunch times he would sit in the senior breakout space in case anyone wanted any help. Totally acceptable behaviour. Many of the smartest kids, including a lot of boys, would come around to talk to him or ask for help. Being in this group meant you were smart and motivated. 

He had a very forward approach to teaching, making videos for science presentations and lectures, filmed by an old student of his who was a fantastic photographer. I wanted to be just like him too. I offered to use my free periods to help this teacher prepare experiments for these videos. I would go to his little breakout office, a narrow room between two senior physics classes. I would measure chemicals and clean glassware. It was awesome. I felt valued and trusted. I started to open up to this teacher, seeing him as someone who might understand me.

At the time, I was dating one of the most-coveted boys in the school by high school standards. State athlete, prefect, conventionally attractive. It didn’t help that I hadn’t yet realised my own bisexuality, or any of my own sexuality for that matter. I had to beg my mum to let me go out with him, and even then I couldn’t bring myself to do more than kiss him, sometimes just doing it because it was the thing I was supposed to do. I didn’t realise I wasn’t really into this guy, and him also being 17, he was also immature. The thing that made me want to break up with him was how surprised he was when I started doing better in science classes, like it was surprising I was improving and being smart for a girl. Probably not his intention, but that’s how it felt. The other glaringly obvious issue, is he was aware how different my home life was from everyone else. Again, without really opening up about my home life, I will say that I was a carer for my sibling. Heavy shit for a teenager.

After my boyfriend at the time said something about my home commitments, I broke down to my teacher. I had never told anyone so much about my life, not even my best friends or my boyfriend. Looking back, I was very clearly a girl in desperate need of counselling, of therapy, of any kind of psychological support. I divulged to this teacher time and time again how worthless I felt as a human being. 

Now that I’m much older, still not yet the age he was at the time of this story, and, now that I’ve worked in schools and had jobs where a WWCC (Working With Children Check) or RAN (Responding to Abuse and Neglect) training are required, this man broke a cardinal rule of a child confiding in you. He took it upon himself to be my emotional support. 

At first, he mentioned therapy to me maybe a couple of times, but I don’t clearly remember it. The one time I do remember him telling me, he told me in the context of his own trials with his mental health. I thought, wow, he trusts me so much with his personal life. Another time, when I told him, amongst many tears, why I felt I needed to break up with my boyfriend, he took my hand, told me I deserved to be loved, and kissed my hand, while giving me eye contact. I will never forget how my stomach dropped in that moment, but I thought, no. This man really cares about me. What a good man. I even waited until later in the day where I could go talk to him normally just to confirm in my head, that this was my teacher, a good man. 

There’s another side to this, why I mentioned the lunchtime group of boys. It was well known this teacher would keep in regular contact with students, current and ex-students, via email. School email or personal email. I had both. We exchanged so many emails via school channels. There was never any inappropriate content, but the times of email exchange had no boundary. Days, nights, weekends. It really felt like I was texting him. When there were too many for school email, we moved to personal email. I made my first proper email account so I could message this teacher. I wish I had kept everything.

Fast forward a little. I had ended things with my boyfriend, believing the only man who could truly understand me was my teacher. He had me involved in all his projects and preparations. I started using more of my free periods to help him, to talk to him. He started helping me out with some things I was struggling with at home, lending me stuff if I needed it, kindness I suppose. 

At this point it was the start of 2016, my final year of high school, I was still 17. I had a group of friends, one of which was the school principal’s daughter. There was usual high school tiffs. She liked a boy who liked me who was sad I didn’t like him and I was also maybe being groomed by my teacher but it might have been working so I was in denial kind-of-thing, but no one knew what was really happening. One day she told me and our friends, about the teacher, how he drank a lot and she knew that because her older brother was friends with him. Her mother, the school principal, was okay with her son having a friendship with the teacher. I told the teacher, horrified that she would spread such lies about him. He confronted her mother, and my friend confronted me.

She said she was worried he was grooming me. She asked if I told him what she said. That her and her mother were worried. The same mother who knew this was a teacher with no professional boundaries. I lied to her face. I regret it. I regret that moment, because it could have all been stopped right there. But I was angry. Our group of friends had been saying for months that I had a crush on our teacher, that I was only helping him to get close to him, that I dumped my boyfriend for him. Unfortunately, how could I have had the vocabulary to say - none of this is love, I think I’m a worthless human being, I think he is everything I could hope to be, and he knows that?

From there, it all escalated. I was asked to meet the assistant principal to discuss the rumours starting about me. My friends’ jokes had caught on, and the assistant principal told me that I needed to behave appropriately. He also knew this teacher maintained friendships with his past students. I was asked to only talk to this teacher in rooms with windows or doors open. No one knew he had kissed my hand, honestly I had forgotten myself.

What’s funny, is in the lead up to this escalation, there were so many red flags only I knew about. He blew me a kiss one time. Talking about my recent teeny-bop break-up, he said my ex-boyfriend must have loved the idea of me being a virgin. He would also ask me many pseudo-deep questions. I was asked things like; if you were with a partner and they wanted to get naked and experiment with drugs, would you do it? (I’m not sure) What does love mean to you? (I’m not sure) Why do some women have crazy sex-drive? My neighbors have been fucking like rabbits (I’m not sure).

\*via personal email\* 

Me: I love this ice cream place!

Him: We should go, when you graduate :)

He pulled me to the side one morning and told me to delete everything. Between us, he said, we both know there is nothing inappropriate right? I’m like a big brother. But it looks bad. Delete everything. 

And I did. And I fucking regret it.

And to cut an already long story short, he was put on investigation on account of some love letters the principal found in his desk. They weren’t from me, but they were from another teacher whose handwriting I recognised. I felt bad for her, she was married at the time these were found and he had just stuffed this card with these notes into his desk, never checking what they said. She was mortified, she had a crush on him when they started teaching together. She tried to help me, but it was too late. The principal told all the staff, prior to confirmation, that I wrote the letters. That I had an affair with the teacher. Overnight I was the school sl\*t.

Apparently, I went home with him, I f\*cked him in the janitor closet, the rest of the rumours all blurred together. Teachers I once adored no longer spoke to me, or spoke to me with caution if they did. No one offered counselling to me, there was no check to see if I was okay. My parents tried absolutely fucking everything to stop the bullying. The teacher started a legal battle with the school based on the rumours, upon which I gave his lawyer a testimony to advocate that absolutely nothing that was being said had happened - which was true. The absolute nightmare of slut-shaming I endured completely skewed my own understanding of what happened, and made me double down harder on my conviction that this teacher was an innocent, good man.

He maintained contact with my parents, who advocated for him. Sometimes I would get a message from him if my parents met him for coffee. One time my mum put him on the phone to me, and when I told him this was all my fault, he said we all make mistakes.

Somehow, I made it to the end of the year. Ironically, I got fantastic grades without ever going to school because I had the bank of video lectures the teacher had left available to the senior students. I saw a psychologist, but she wasn’t too concerned because - genuinely - I hadn’t thought of killing myself yet. She planted a seed in my head that left me planning my s\*icide every day at school. I self-harmed a couple of times in secret, but there was no point. It was going to be over eventually. When the last day of school came, it all stopped.

A year later, part of the story broke in the newspaper. An anonymous letter was sent talking about the disgraceful situation a teacher and student were put through. I saw my own quotes in there. Someone I had confided in, now that I was legally allowed to speak about the case, had included my text messages in their letter. I never gave permission for this and at first I was terrified of all of it coming back to me, but it felt somewhat nice to at least have something out there. The principal was investigated for misconduct on behalf of the bullying she allowed to incur at the hands of staff and students. She has been working, as a principal, at another school, ever since. 

One day, in that first year out of high school, I ran into a friend. He was in the year below, and he told me about one of our mutual friends, how her older sister had apparently dated the teacher when she graduated. My mind flashed through another conversation I had with a loyal, kind friend, who one day pulled me aside near the lockers to say she wasn’t judging me if I was in a relationship with the teacher. He had apparently done drugs with some of his students once they graduated. Another, older, girl I would eventually run into at uni said her year level knew there was something between him and a girl in her year level. Sometimes I want to reach out to these people to ask again, what happened, but I’m scared what I might find out will only make my guilt worse.

These stories were no longer blind rumours, and I was no longer special, and it collapsed in my mind. After almost two years in this docile, constant fight-or-flight mode, it all made sense. And no one knew, and I defended him, and I will never have justice for what that man put me through.

I’m writing this now, nearly ten years later, because he hasn’t changed. A couple of years ago, he reached out to another personal email account of mine, saying he came across some research I had been doing, and wanted to know what I’m up to these days. My mum, who is the only person who knows this entire story, saw the email, replied, threatening him with legal action should he ever attempt to contact me again. I have this email still. I thought it was over then.

I saw him in a restaurant this year. Walking in on a double date with my brother, his now-fiancé, and my now-fiancé, I saw him across the restaurant sitting with a guy who looked significantly younger. I assume his likeness with his ex-students, especially his popularity with the male ones, hasn’t changed. 

Over the last ten years I’ve really been through some shit, prevailed if I say so myself. A lot of nights, for many other reasons, I struggle with sleeping. I have nightmares often. Sometimes he is there, a side character, or someone I scream at, smashing apart whatever office my mind has constructed for him. It happened again this week, and I thought I would do a check-in. 

I already knew this man has continued his teaching career, he’s written textbooks for the state education system, whatever he was being investigated for he must have been proven innocent. My deleted emails, my repressed memories, my shame, my shame, my shame. They all say otherwise. I lied to protect this man. I lied to my family, my friends, and yes I lied to myself. It worked. He did a fantastic job on me. He is fantastic at his job. He just won a state award for his excellence in teaching. I cannot deny he is a great teacher. 

I also cannot deny this man violated child protection laws, but I have nothing to show for it. I’m okay, if you were wondering. I just needed to tell my story before this year is over. I looked him up on Monday, it’s now Wednesday December 31st, 2025. I’m happily engaged to the love of my life, I’m working in STEM, I made a life for myself outside of the academic world I was so jacked-up on validation from.

I just need to release the shame somewhere, somewhere I can scream and say I think I was groomed, and I think it worked, and I saved a predator, and he goes on like none of this ever happened, and even though everyone thought they knew something, no one knew anything at all.",1,1767141558.0,confessions,0,0.66,False

1pzytln,https://i.redd.it/ei5fvxwjofag1.jpeg,The new Gemini integration in Google Maps is really good. Here is the missing manual,"**TL;DR:** Gemini in Maps isn't just a chatbot; it’s a semantic search engine. Stop searching for coffee and start searching for quiet places with outlets and oat milk. Use it to summarize reviews instantly, find parking before you arrive, and navigate using landmarks (turn at the Starbucks) instead of distances.

Most people are suffering from AI fatigue right now, and I get it. But the integration of Gemini into Google Maps is one of the few instances where AI actually solves a friction point we face daily: the gap between *what we want* and *how we have to search for it*.

I have spent the last few weeks stress-testing this feature. I ignored the gimmicks and focused on utility. Here is how to use the new system to actually save time and reduce driving stress.

The Shift: Keywords vs. Semantic Search

The biggest mistake people make is treating the new Maps like the old Maps.

* **Old Way:** Search Italian restaurant, filter by 4 stars, scroll through photos to see if it looks nice, read 10 reviews to see if it's loud.
* **New Way:** Ask Gemini, Find me a romantic Italian dinner spot nearby that isn't too loud and has easy parking.

Gemini understands the *context* of the reviews and the vibe of the place, not just the metadata.

Top 3 High-Value Use Cases

**1. The Vibe Check (Review Summarization)** Instead of doom-scrolling through hundreds of mixed reviews to find out if a place is good for a date or a work meeting, ask specific questions about the consensus.

* *Prompt:* Does this place have a good atmosphere for a quiet business meeting?
* *Result:* Gemini scans the text of thousands of reviews to give you a definitive Yes, reviewers mention it is quiet during the day or No, it is known for loud music.

**2. The Complex Co-Pilot (Route Planning)** This is helpful when you are already driving and cannot fiddle with filters. You can chain commands that would usually require 4-5 taps.

* *Prompt:* Find a gas station along my route that also has a decent coffee shop and won't add more than 10 minutes to my trip.
* *Result:* It performs the spatial calculation and the quality filtering simultaneously.

**3. Landmark Navigation (The Human Directions)** GPS saying Turn right in 500 feet is useless if you are bad at estimating distance. Gemini utilizes visual data to give cues based on what you can actually see.

* *Benefit:* You will hear directions like Turn right after the AutoZone or Turn left at the traffic light. It reduces the cognitive load of driving in unfamiliar cities.

Pro Tips for Power Users

**The Parking Hack** Before you head to a crowded downtown area or a new venue, ask Gemini specifically about the parking situation.

* *Ask:* What is the parking situation like at \[Venue Name\]?
* *Why:* It will pull specific details from reviews like The lot is small, but there is a garage around the corner that is usually empty. This saves you from circling the block for 20 minutes.

**The Entrance Trick** Useful for large malls, hospitals, or airports.

* *Ask:* Where is the best entrance for \[Specific Department/Store\]?
* *Why:* It can often guide you to a specific door rather than the generic street address, saving you a 15-minute walk.

**Natural Language Findy** Use the camera/Live View feature for on-the-spot discovery. If you are standing on a street corner, you can point your camera and ask, Which of these cafes has the best vegan options? It overlays the data on the real world.

Best Practices

* **Be Specific:** The more details you give, the better. Don't just say dinner. Say dinner under $30 with outdoor seating.
* **Verify for Critical Info:** AI can hallucinate. If you need to know if a place is strictly nut-free due to a severe allergy, always call the venue. Use Gemini for preference, not medical necessity.
* **Use Voice:** The integration shines when used hands-free. Get comfortable talking to your phone in the car. It feels weird at first, but it is safer than typing.

How to Access It

You might already have it without realizing. There is no specific On switch in the settings; it is a server-side update. Here is how to check if you are live:

* **Update Your App:** Ensure you are on the latest version of Google Maps on Android or iOS.
* **In Navigation:** Start a drive. Look at the microphone icon. If it has the Gemini sparkle (star) icon instead of the standard plain microphone, you are active. Just tap it or say Hey Google to start chatting.
* **In Search:** Type a full sentence into the main search bar instead of a keyword. If it gives you a summarized answer rather than a list of links, that is Gemini working.
* **Visual Search:** Tap the camera icon in the search bar (Lens) to use the AR features.

  
The goal here isn't to use AI for everything, but to offload the research part of navigation so you can focus on the getting there part.

You really love me!!","Soo got up a little late for the drops and scored the shower caddy, lamps, and press-on from AI. Then my husband got all funny with me about being up at 5am. He says I guess I'll just have to get over not waking up next to you. -\_- So I lay back down in bed, and realized after I woke up, yea you will. I always was up by 7am before Vine for work and he doesn't get up till 9/10am for work.

I checked Vine Helper to see what the drops where like, and like right as I laid down Anua, several products from LoloVegan, and my fave brand Dr. Percent. Grumbled to work and then lucked out and finally got KISS nails in my RFY, then a LoloVegan from AI.

I told myself ""self you got 3 picks left and there is still possibly Lisa Frank x Kitsch scrunchies that may drop.""  So I told myself I'll hold unless it was something just amazing, like Ninja Cremi, a carpet cleaner, and video card dropped in Vine (I knew this was impossible). And right as I go into a work meeting the Kitsch Air Dry Cream drops and I was too slow. 

Then suddenly another pillowcase dropped, which I didn't have this design from the 2 I scored yesterday. Than after endless refreshing I scored the scrunchies!!!!!!! You would have thought I won the lottery with how loud I screamed in glee and danced around the room. Then no more Kitsch, so I settled for 1 more pair of press-ons to round out my 8 today. What a day :) And I saw I finally got 60k of points in Fetch, so time to cash in for $50 gift card from all my free Vine orders & games played.

1pzyby6,https://i.redd.it/dx7k4woqmfag1.jpeg,Appropiate / Inappropiate dinning tables for my floors,"Hi,

Long story short, I would like to know which kinds of table would go well and which ones should I avoid, given the floors shown on the picture.

The floors are laminated and the walls are all white.

A bit more context in case it's needed:

I'm moving and the apartment have the floors shown on the picture.

I'll get an extensible table of about 120 x 80cm (47"" x 31""), with a 40-50cm (15""-20"") extension.

It will be on a living-dinning area of 3m x 5m (10 ft x 16.5 ft)

I don't have any furniture yet, but what I have in mind so far goes on the lines of:  
\* Except for textiles, use mostly some light warm wood along with white. Too much white and the furniture would get lost in the walls, but too similar wood and the furniture would be lost in the floor. Something [like this](https://acdn-us.mitiendanube.com/stores/001/074/318/products/muebles-2_20240624_222415_0024-8cf5ecefead5e44eff17193435027678-1024-1024.webp) is ideal  
\* Use some light industrial, including black iron, on small pieces of furniture, such as the coffee table ([illustrative example](https://www.casabellafurniture.co.uk/light-mango-wood-industrial-open-coffee-table-with-shelf.html)), lighting, shelves, etc. On those, I would use the same wood tones mentioned above so they still match  
\* For textiles (sofa, chairs, etc.), I'll focus on neutral colors.

I think that's a base I like, plus gives me the freedom to give color through details (which are easier to change than big bulky furniture).

But I'm unsure about what kind of table would go well without ""getting lost"" on the floor because the wood tone is too similar.  
  
I also fear that picking a very dark wood would not go well with the rest of the style. I personally love dark wood pieces alone, but I don't want to go full dark wood for my decoration just because of the table, as it looks a bit dated IMO and makes the space too dark.

  
P.S. sorry for the pic, it's the only one I have after the remodelation",2,1767140159.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False
1pzyavn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzyavn,2025 Winter Villiage,"Hi everyone — Hope you all had a great holiday! Better late than never, I finally finished my 2025 Winter Village.

At one point I had a completely different layout, but I wasn’t happy with it—I couldn’t fit all the pieces I wanted in a way that worked. So I scrapped it and rebuilt the whole thing, and this is the final result.

On the left side, I created a small neighborhood using road plates so I could include snow-covered streets, a residential area, and the hotel. I also set up the gingerbread houses as a bakery and coffee shop for the neighborhood.

The right side is the main Winter Village. I used the Home Alone house (because of its size) as a sort of town hall or destination spot—kind of a meta element. There’s a photo op with Jack Skellington, kids throwing snowballs at the guy on stilts, and a group of mall Santas getting ready to start their shift. The others are either on break or wrapping up over at the food court area. I added a small snow hill and worked in a few shops as well.

Yes sure r an active person but also u can do breath work/pelvic floor work while laying doing so u r still in a way active about ur health but smarter about it....

Walk can be so powerful in the early weeks but with caution  ur body need to not add unneeded stress cuz its already doing alot for u to recover faster

1pzy6it,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1pzy6it/i_need_advice_for_my_brother/,I need advice for my brother,"Okay, so, I’m at my breaking point with my brother (23M), he’s level 3 autistic and is getting worse by the day, behaviour wise. He’s on anti-psychotics that are at the highest dose and made for people who suffer from Schizophrenia and yet he able to over power him.

So here’s some context, he’s non-verbal and has a severe form of OCD. His worse behaviour started during quarantine when he was going through his last years at school, since then he has gone down hill. My mum, technically his full time carer, has been trying to get him to do stuff he used to do at school, like wash-up, do the laundry and do basic word things but he refuses to do them, instead he is actively choosing to regress and basically become an animal, and I know that’s not a nice term, but he is disgusting. He shits in his room, then shoves it in the wall and he plays with himself in the living room because he doesn’t care.

We’ve had him services before but our last one ghosted us because he ran out of the moving vehicle because apparently they weren’t allowed to lock the doors, but in fact they were and when mum tried to appeal they just never got back to her and now she can’t find a service for him anymore.

Later next year, my parents and I are taking a trip overseas and I honestly don’t think we can have a successful trip because of him, because he ruins everything and makes it all about himself. We can never do anything nice and I miss out on a lot of things kids my age have always been able to do, like go on fun holidays, go to amusement parks or have nice family outings. I’m already limited on the things I get to do with my diabetes and with him on top, I can’t be normal, technically.

He destroys everything. Just half an hour ago, he hit my aunty and broke one of my favourite glasses all because mum said no to him having ab iced coffee, and then after all that he portrayed himself as the victim and screamed the house down and jumped on the floor like a child chucking a tantrum.

Earlier this month, he destroyed one of mums limited addition glasses because of the same reason. He broke into my room just the other day just to shove a piece of paper into a hole that didn’t exist and sent himself into a panic.

I am so close to doing something bad to him and I’m honestly not even scared to do it. He has ruined my life and has ruined mums mental health. My dad is fine, he works all day and my brother lowers his behaviour when he’s home because he’s scared of him. But because of my brother, we have holes in our walls. He has slammed things against the wall and has created massive holes. He is going to be the reason we will go homeless. He will be the reason mum finally cracks and either leaves us or k!lls herself.

So if anyone has an advice… please, please, please tell me. If it helps we live in NSW, Australia in a rural town where there isn’t many options",0,1767139777.0,autism,10,0.5,False

Arriving robed in midnight blue.
We count it down, we clink our glass,
Pretending somehow this erases the past.

But nothing ends at twelve o’clock,
No wounds are healed by ticking clocks.
We drag our yesterdays inside
This so-called future, open-eyed.

We swear we’ll change, we always do,
Make bold resolves we won’t see through.
Not out of spite or lack of care,
Just life reminding us it’s there.

Still—morning comes. The sun shows up.
The coffee fills the same old cup.
The world goes on, unfair, unchanged,
Yet somehow we remain—unchained.

So there’s no cheer for perfect plans,
No fairy tales or guiding hands.
Just credit due where credit’s earned:
We lived, we broke, we stayed, we learned.

A brand-new year, not clean, not kind,
But standing here—by heart, by spine.
And if that’s all this year can be,
Then hell… it’s good enough for me.

I’ve started working here helping people get fiber installed in their homes. It’s something I’m doing full-time now, and I’m trying to make some connections and slowly build my client base.
If anyone here has been thinking about upgrading their internet (especially for WFH, gaming, streaming, or if your place gets laggy when 4 people use WiFi at the same time), I’d love to help out. I can check if your building/area is eligible for fiber and walk you through the whole process. No pressure at all, even if you just want info or are curious what’s available in your location, I’m happy to check and guide.

So things have gotten worse.

It’s been a few days since I made a post on here and some new stuff has occurred.

I’ll start with the diary, as this has had its own developments since I last posted. I texted Robbie to let him know that it had reappeared and that it had more to say.

As I found out previously, the diary decided to write itself some more entries. It had written two.

The first was written as I was finishing my first post. As you may remember, this entry was for the 5th December 1966, one day after the collapse of the Shear mineshaft.

It filled two pages, and the handwriting was almost ineligible. I had to squint at some words because of how poorly they were scrawled.

Without further delay, here is the entry:

*5th December 1966.*

*Firstly, I apologise for the poor writing. I am writing this under dim lamplight, as the light from outside is now unavailable for the foreseeable future.*

*The shaft has collapsed. Unfortunately, Lewisham was correct. The ceiling has fell through about 2 miles down and has trapped twenty of us. Well, half that. Ten men are dead. They were either killed on impact or suffered slow deaths, whether their rib cages were crushed or their heads were popped clean open by the weight of the boulders. I can see their blood, and I can see limbs. But I can smell them the most. It’s strong and pungent.*

*Many of them slowed their screams to whimpers and then ceased to make sound. I saw friends of mine squashed and some most of them I didn't get to say goodbye to. They were dead as soon as the first rocks fell. I hid in an upturned trolley, thankfully no boulders landed on my metal shelter.*

*It is difficult see anything now. The only thing I can see from the entrance is the tiniest hole, half the size of a fist. We are still quite far down, and the lamps which light our prison are not enough. I even struggle to see my hand if I place it out in front of me, so I must stay close to the lamp. At least we don't have to see our fallen companions.*

*I can only truly recognise three men here:*

*There is Michael Stevens, whose wife is close with my own and they often trade their recipes at church. Nice man, quite pious.*

*There is John Dunn, who had started working here over a week ago. I believe his father owns part of the Tingrass mines. He’s a quiet boy, usually keeps his head down and is lazy unlike the rest of us. He looks at us from under his eyebrows and with a scowl.*

*Finally, there is Tim O’Connell, my dearest friend. I am overjoyed he lives, as he nearly met his fate when the ceiling fell. If it wasn’t for Stevens, I would have the unfortunate job of delivering the news to Marge and his little ones.*

*I have ordered the men to ration their food and water, and to steal from the dead. I am making them commit sins for their own survival. One of the men, I believe his name is Clark, has been praying for our safety. Dunn tells him not to, those outside shall come for us in a few days. He also says we should not ration either. If he is worried, he doesn't show it.*

*I struggle to believe him. It will be a few more days than that.*

*I am not one to pray, but I feel that if this situation does not improve I will be forced to. It is the only thing I have to connect myself to my family.*

*If the Lord above is as good as who we proclaim him to be, I hope he hears us and saves us.*

*Peggy, if you read this, I am so sorry that you must do so under these circumstances. I will be with you, always.*

That was the end of that passage.

I waited, scrunched up in the corner of my sofa. I thought another incident would happen like Saturday night; screams and crashes would fill my ears at any second.

Nothing happened. After about two minutes, nothing happened. I was relieved, I mean, I didn’t want my eardrums to actually rupture this time. However, I also felt like an idiot. For just a moment I felt like I was a fool for feeling scared of that book.

As I thought about my self-thought stupidity, the book slammed shut with a deafening bang. I almost shat myself.

It just sat there on my coffee table like it hadn’t been touched. I ogled at it before I threw that thing in the trash. This diary was haunted or some shit. Oddly, the book was lighter after I read that entry, but I still couldn’t hold it with two hands, so I had to swing my arms to launch it into the trash can like hauling a sand bag. I spun around and tried to clear my mind, continuously chanting in my head that this was just some sort of hallucination. Maybe I was spiked with LSD or salvia or something along those lines. Hell, maybe both.

However, I stepped one foot past the living room door and immediately took two steps back into the hallway.

There, laid on the coffee table, was the diary. It was placed on top of my laptop and remained closed. “Fuck this” I thought, and I opened my front door. I then threw the book outside, straight into my trash can.

I walked back into my house and into my living room. It was the same result as before.

I just lost control. I ended up setting the bastard on fire. I know, I should had more sense, but I thought it deserved it for nearly making me go deaf. I covered the diary in gasoline from basement and chucked a lit match at it. It was definitely in the burning barrel. I saw the smoke arise from my yard and twirl back towards the front of the house.

Turns out fire is useless against phantom books. I watched the thing burn to a crisp, then I turned around to come back into my house and there it was on my kitchen countertop, good as new.

To save my blood pressure from flying through the roof, I just walked away and left it there. I hoped that if I ignored it, it would go away.

How laughably stupid.

Like I mentioned, there were two diary entries that day.

The second one came before bed.

Robbie had read the message and promised to stay the night the day after, which was last night. He couldn’t come by that day because he was on patrol duty, but he let me know that I could ring him if anything happened and he’d be with me as soon as he could.

I texted him “thanks” and switched off for the night. I was going through every room downstairs and flicking off the lights when I reached the kitchen.

The diary was still there, except it had changed position. It was now open and had writing which covered the open page spread like before.

I actually felt torn whether I should've left the diary downstairs or brought it up to bed with me. I don’t know how but eventually I found myself in bed with the damn thing in my lap. I can’t even remember leaving the kitchen, let alone sitting in bed.

There was a pressure was felt in my head, almost as if someone pushed the back of my skull downwards and towards the book. Horrified, I obliged and read the new entry.

This is the last entry I have had since.

*17th December 1966.*

*I haven’t written much in the past week and I apologise for being so absent. I have had to limit my writing to little pages so the lamps have fuel to burn and the fire can keep us warm.*

*Our provisions are starting to go dry, however, I have made it my mission to keep us fed and watered for as long as possible, until they get us out.*

*The men are starting to go hungry. There were thirty packets of crackers, a few sandwiches and thirty packets of nuts. As well as this, we had twenty-four water canteens to share. We are now down to seventeen packs of crackers, ten nuts and no sandwiches. Water resources are now down to sixteen canteens.*

*Dunn becomes more agitated by the day. He berates us for rationing supplies and argues constantly with Clark for his prayers. He says they’ll be here soon, but I know that cannot be true. And I think he sees that too.*

*The smell from some of the bodies has became worse. They are rank and make me gag. We have since moved further down the mine to avoid the smell, much to little success. I can still hear some people outside talking, it is very quiet though.*

*The men often face away from the entrance and look into the abyss. There were lights down there up until a few days ago. They are no longer visible now and I think that scares them. We know there is nothing lurking there, yet our minds conjure fantasies of the unknown. I am ashamed it spooks me, but I try to remain stoic.*

*Stevens tells me of something quite alarming.*

*He wishes to go further into the cave.*

*I forbade him to go any deeper, and he started at me. His eyes were wrong. They were sharp and angry. There was a darkness in there that I simply didn’t like. He raised his shoulders like a cat and flared his nose.*

*He realised this odd display of intimidation had no effect on my judgement and so he told me “I will understand soon”, before shuffling off to the rest of the company.*

*I have spoken with Tim and he agrees to watch him closely. I attribute it to lack of sunlight and the pangs of hunger.*

*I just hope they come for us soon. I beg and I pray.*

That was what I remembered before I blacked out. I was up one second, and then I was down the next. When I woke up it was day and the diary had set itself on my nightstand.

This sends me onto the other stuff which has happened to me.

I have now started to have disturbing dreams.

For the past two nights, I have had nightmares. They start the same, but always finish differently. It’s just one dream, but it lasts a lifetime.

I’m always standing in front of the Shear mine. There’s no one else around and the only thing that lights the sky is the abundance of stars overhead. I stare deep into the mine. I’m trying to find something, I don’t know what. Even though I'm blanketed by the shining lights of above, I struggle to see anything in the gaping mouth of the cave. Tingrass is behind me, with Mount Wuthers' overarching presence always felt. I was being watched from behind and ahead. I felt the animalistic fear echo from deep within my evolved mind.

On the first night, I took three steps towards the mine before a hand reached out, impossibly long, black and twisted, touched my forehead and called my name. It was barely over a whisper, and I could feel each individual letter wrap around my mind before I woke up. That was the night I read the diary.

On the second night, whilst I was with Robbie, the dream was the same until the end. I took six steps that time, nearly crossing the threshold between the outside of the mine and the inside, towards the pitch-black. My toes scraped the boundary and the hand came. Long, bony fingers reached me and gently touched my temple. It called my name, clearer than last time. I heard a gravelly tone behind it when it croaked, “Matthew.”

I woke up and choked on a breath.

In the darkness of my bedroom, there was a black blob of a figure perched at my feet. Robbie was sat on the end of the bed. I quickly flicked the bedside lamp on and he had his eyes fixed on me. His lips were pursed and he was scratching the sheets nervously. His eyes were hesitant and wide, watching me sweat.

“You were talking in your sleep.” He whispered.

That leads me onto my final revelation.

I have also started to speak in my sleep again.

I say again, because I used to do it as a child, up until I was thirteen. I just stopped one day. No mumbles or blabbering. Dad used to come check on me when I did, and always used to wake me up if I got distressed.

It’s weird because I apparently used to be a serious chatterbox in bed before thirteen. According to him, I used to have full conversations with him.

Here’s what made the recent case different from then though.

As a child I was never able to say any names properly. If I was talking to my dad or my mom it would come out as, “dah” and, “mah”. If I was Tommy it would be, “Tohhhm”.

When I was asleep this time, I groaned, “Matthew.”

My own name.

Not only that, but I had been saying, “Home, I need home.” The name came at the end before I awoke.

Robbie tried to wake me up, but failed. It was like I had gone into a coma.

He filmed some of it for me to watch, which is certainly more horrible to see when you’re the one doing the strange shit without knowing. The video is a bit shaky and you couldn't hear much. It was just a mix of heavy breathing and me gritting out each word. I pushed my tongue against my two top front teeth, stretched my jaw almost as if it was tight and needed loosening, and bared my teeth after every circulation of the phrase. Every time in that order.

I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that it unnerved me. Made me feel ill actually.

“Holy shit,” I mumbled, “You heard that from the other room?”

He nodded. “You sounded weird, man, like you’re weird as hell already, but this was something else,”

I squinted at him and bit back, “You’ve just seen me do some freaky shit and you’re joking about it?”

He shrugged, “Just saying what I saw *and* heard, dude.”

He joked, not just for mine, but for his sake too. It’s like a defence mechanism for when stuff gets under his skin. He was skittish for the rest of the night and threatened to put duct tape over my mouth if I spoke again. Dick.

Robbie’s staying over again tonight. He’s actually seen the diary now and avoiding it like the plague. Which I don’t blame him for. He hasn’t even touched it since he’s seen it. I’ve had to put on top of the cupboard in the kitchen. Out of sight, out of mind.

I haven’t actually seen any new entries from the diary and it remains closed. I couldn’t even open it if I wanted to; the thing’s glued shut.

I have a funny feeling it'll write something new for me soon. Robbie's just left to go home and pack another overnight bag. I think he's staying for longer, especially in case that happens again. His girlfriend, Diane, won't be back for another week. She's a cultural anthropology student and Robbie's texted her for any knowledge on this situation. She's just as confused as we are, which I suppose is understandable. She says she can facetime us later on this week and we should record everything we do.

Being on my own unsettles me. It shouldn't but it does. I can see Tingrass outside my living room window so I keep my curtains shut. I feel like the only thing I have to keep my company is that diary. I'm tempted to go grab it.

I will see what happens with the diary. I appreciate Robbie and Diane's help. They’re the only ones who need to get involved. Tommy asks me how I am after I told him that I had a bad reaction to some plant in the woods. I tell him I'm fine. He doesn't need to know about this.

I just hope we can figure this out before it gets any worse.

I've gotten involved with the local community in Manila and have wonderful friends there. Now that I'm retired, I'm thinking about making the long-term move. I've visited some but not all of the potential sites. Fortunately, I have a good retirement income. If I keep my set expenses to $5-6K USD/month, I will have extra for travel and entertainment.  My hope is to find a comfortable home base and then make frequent trips out to explore in PH and SEA. 

Here's my criteria for a home base: 

1. Access to good quality healthcare and within a 2 hour trip max to the top-line hospitals. 

2. Walkability. I live in a highly walkable Asian city now and I've gotten spoiled. My overall health and QOL is higher if I can walk to at least some grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops. 

3. Access to some western comforts, like food, coffee, shopping

4. Fairly easy proximity to an airport.

5. The Philippines is a country with incredible natural beauty. Is there a way to have 1-4 and also be near to a nice beach or beautiful mountains?

Here's the places I've visited and consider as good options: BGC, Makati, Tagaytay, Mactan Cebu. Consider with reservations: Baguio, Panglao, Dumaguete, Puerto Galera. Here's places I'd consider but never visited yet: Iloilo, Davao, Roxas City. 

It seems like none of these places check all the boxes. One option is to settle into a city like BGC or Mactan for daily comforts and then travel to see nature. Dumaguete checks a lot of boxes but seems over-saturated with expats. Tagaytay and Puerto Galera have beautiful nature and most amenities, but are farther to good hospitals. 

What am I missing? I know I can't have everything, but which is closest to the Holy Grail of home bases?

I know that I might get closer to my dream in a place like Chiang Mai or Da Nang. I plan to visit Thailand and Vietnam before I make the decision. Right now I am leaning for PH because of widespread English use and easy visa options. I've spent the last 5 years living in an Asian city where English capacity is low and I feel very isolated outside my small social group of expats. ",4,1767139191.0,Philippines_Expats,8,1.0,False

1pzxtq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzxtq1,"OC Introduction! Kyoko, the Mistress Of The Railway- Japaness National Railways 9600| Based on Kyoko Kirigiri From Danganronpa","Kyoko, based on Kyoko Kirigiri from Danganronpa, a class 9600 from Japanese National Railways, was the original NWR number 8. She was gifted initially on extended loan because the fat director served in Japan for a while, and she was a gift. The best of her batch of locomotives was nicknamed the mistress of the railway. She helped build the NWR and arrived around the same time as a C1 Atlantic from the GNR, Named Alex; an LBSCR L class named Simon; two LBSCR E6 named Daniel and Kenny; an Experimental L&YR class 28 mogul named Eagle; and a Stirling single named Emily. Plus a Furness Railway K2 Larger Seagle that was bought by Edward and LBSCR E2S, one purchased and one on loan at the time, Thomas and Jessie, both eventually staying; however, only one got numbered. These engines would arrive around 1915. and Simon, Alex, Kyoko, Daniel, Kenny, Eagle and Emily would get numbers 6-12 around 1924/1925ish when the grouping act happened and their orginally railways decided they could keep the engines(kyoko's railway had literally Hundreds of her class so for simular reasons the NWR could keep her) ; however, due to the rivalry of LMS operations of the Brendom branch, as the W&S merged with them instead. This would cause the downfall of these engines, the former TKW&S engines, the W&S engines themselves, and for older NWR engines when the great depression hit.

The railway board opted to sell these engines for scrap, the weak links. The NWR had a fair amount of expermental failures or engines that weren't doing much for the NWR, such as Henry,who was still struggling emesely at the time, Hurricane, NWR 20 and the GER Decopode rebuilt into a tank engine for banking up Gordon's hill and taking heavy goods trains, which was really only suitable for banking trains and more than a few engines did the same job. Some engines they felt had passed it. The Coffee pots, Emily, and Edward were on the scrap list. And engines that did the same job was Kyoko, geoffery a ROD 2-8-0 nwr 21 along side Henry. Gordon, Alex, and Simon all took the WNW. Eagle was deemed useless. And multiple others were too. However, instead of scraping the fat, the director knew where to send the engines. A logging railway. Misty Island. it was where the S&M engines ended up for the most part. So, besides Thomas, Jessie, Edward, Henry Gordon James, and a select few others, 6-20 was sent there. The LMS sold the W&S engines there, too, because they didn't want non-LMS engines, and to keep it discreet, they also sent some older engines. However, in the 80s, when Thomas washed up on Misty Island he, along with the Misty Island engines, found their way back to Sodor, and they were restored and worked on the NWR again

As for Kyoko, in her early life. She mainly handled goods trains, primarily heavy goods and covered Henry's trains. She was sent away in favour of keeping Henry, since the NWR wasn't sure how long the depression would last and if it lasted lon,g it was calculated that repairing Henry would be cheaper than outsourcing parts from Japan, no matter how reliable Kyoko was. When retruning to Sodor she got to meet a D51, named Hiro(not sure if there will be any more japaness engines on sodor by this time as Hiro, Leronzo, Gina, Hugo and a few other engines were apart of Nazi Rail support and find about a invasion plan on sodor,so they go to warn the NWR, but it fails as they get sabaotaged by their crews and get lost in the prossess and arent found till the 60's) anyways as the RWS engines are going on a world tour. Kyoko needs to be repaired, so she and Hiro are sent to Japan, where she's restored, and she meets other Japanese locomotives who run a small heritage line that they literally just sit around in while diesels pull their trains. The steam engines are just for show; they are just being steamed up because Kyoko and Hiro are there, and the Sodor engines are meant to visit. When the Sodor engines come. Kyoko, being the detective she is, starts to put everything together and talks to the fat controller, and after lengthy discussions, buys the engines. (after purchasing a complete American railroad and its fleet, might I add. But keep in mind, business is booming, and they need locomotives for what's about to happen on Sodor.

Once returning to Sodor, Kyoko gets a new number (I haven't figured out which number, as I don't know where the numbers will be by the time she returns) and returns to a heavy goods engine. She works well with Henry, acknowledging how far her friend has come from his early days. She's also thrilled to have other engines from her county on Sodor. It's a bit weird for her as she often brings a lot of terror in, being an original Number and a non-British engine in England. But she doesn't mind. She enjoys telling her stories. She also enjoys solving mysteries  
(also for those curious, a fraction of the W&S split off due to needing funds for an expansion was sold to the TK&E to and they extended their line to the W&S tracks so they shared track for some parts, becoming the TKW&S(Tidmouth Knapford Welsworth and Suddery Railway,) both railways being on good terms and often sharing resorses it was mainly just so the W&S could extend its line to Barrow 'N Furrness using the S&M track and start running express survicess but to do that they had to sell some stuff make some conections)",3,1767138891.0,thomasthetankengine,0,1.0,False

1pzxsxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingUncertainty/comments/1pzxsxk/gift_economy_holidays_trading_stuff_for_meaning/,"Gift Economy Holidays: Trading ""Stuff"" for Meaning","

As the economy shifts, many families are finding that the traditional ""buying spree"" of birthdays and holidays feels more like a burden than a celebration. The Gift Economy Holiday is a way to opt out of the consumer cycle without losing the spirit of the occasion.



The goal is a ""Handmade or Second-Hand"" agreement: a family pact where no new items are purchased from major retailers. This isn't about being a Scrooge; it’s about elevating the value of the gift through effort, story, and sustainability.



1. Navigating the ""The Talk""

Proposing a change in tradition can be delicate. The key is to frame it as a gain in quality, not a loss in budget.



Frame it as a ""Creative Challenge"": Instead of saying ""we can't afford gifts,"" try: ""I’d love for us to try a 'Makers and Curators' holiday this year to see what cool, unique things we can find or build for each other.""



Set Clear Boundaries: For a gift economy to work, everyone needs to agree on the rules. Common pacts include: ""Only items from thrift stores,"" ""Only consumables made in your kitchen,"" or ""Gifts of time/services.""



Propose it Early: Don't bring this up on December 15th. Start the conversation months in advance so everyone has time to keep an eye out for second-hand treasures or start a time-intensive DIY project.



2. The ""Handmade"" Route: Gifting Your Skills

In a bad economy, your time is your most valuable currency. A handmade gift shows that the recipient was on your mind for hours, not just the three minutes it took to click ""buy now.""



The ""Consumable"" Win: If you aren't ""crafty,"" you can still cook. A jar of homemade granola, a ""soup kit"" in a mason jar, or a loaf of fresh sourdough is always appreciated and never creates clutter.



Skill Certificates: Design a ""gift card"" for a skill you possess. Examples: ""This certificate entitles you to 4 hours of garden weeding,"" or ""One private lesson in basic coding.""



Personalized Digital Assets: Use your tech skills to create a digital family photo album, a curated ""soundtrack of our childhood"" playlist, or a video montage of family memories.



3. The ""Second-Hand"" Strategy: The Art of the Find

Gifting used items used to be a ""faux pas,"" but in the New Economy, it is a sign of a savvy, eco-conscious curator.



The ""Buy Nothing"" Hunt: Use your local Buy Nothing group to find high-quality items—like wooden toys, vintage glassware, or coffee table books—that neighbors are giving away for free.



Thrift Store ""Upcycling"": Find a sturdy but ugly picture frame at a thrift store, spray paint it a modern matte black, and put a family photo inside. You’ve turned a $2 find into a ""Grade A"" sentimental gift.



The ""Heirloom"" Swap: Sometimes the best gifts are things you already own that a family member has always admired. Passing down a piece of jewelry, a favorite book, or a vintage tool creates a deep emotional connection that a new item simply can't match.



4. Making the Event Special

Without the ""mountain of boxes,"" the focus shifts to the ritual of the day.



The ""White Elephant"" Swap: If you have a large extended family, suggest a ""Secret Santa"" or ""White Elephant"" using only items from participants' own homes (the ""regift"" challenge). It adds an element of game-playing and humor to the day.



Experience Over Objects: Suggest that instead of individual gifts, the family pools the money they would have spent on a shared experience, like a potluck dinner or a ""No-Spend"" weekend camping trip.



Why It Matters

A Gift Economy Holiday removes the ""price tag"" from love. When you remove the pressure to spend, you remove the stress that often clouds the holidays. You’ll find that the most talked-about gift isn't the most expensive one; it's the one that required a walk through a thrift store, a messy afternoon in the kitchen, or a heartfelt ""I thought you’d love this.""",1,1767138835.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

There’s been a lot of focus on the role El and Kali are expected to play in the finale, but **I personally believe that the setup surrounding El and Kali may be a red herring for the much larger role Will and Mike will play in Season 5.**

# Part 1: Meta-Dialogue

In Season 5, Volume 1, we were given some **very** interesting meta-dialogue specifically tied to Mike and Will. I’ve seen plenty of discussion about Mike’s line (*“Eyes on me! Eyes on me. Remember?”*), but I haven’t seen nearly as much attention paid to Will’s line (*“She hasn’t seen what I’ve seen, and I am not gonna look away. Not again. Not until this is over""*).

[Mike reassuring the kids by telling them to look at him, not the demogorgans.](https://preview.redd.it/38bbj6hseeag1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddfb35b7fa4f1e22bd235b5418ecdcf358e0ebd1)

[Joyce expressing guilt over not noticing when Will first disappeared and emphasizing that Robin doesn't know Will like she does. SIDENOTE: This also feels like intentional meta-dialogue to remind the audience that Robin isn't necessarily a reliable narrator when it comes to interpreting Will, including her assumption that Mike is Will's \\""Tammy Thompson\\"". ](https://preview.redd.it/vljy2bwkeeag1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29a191ae1ad8eecf06169d885b8c21d53bfb6b7a)

Isn’t it interesting that both Mike and Will are given explicit dialogue centered around watching, seeing, and not looking away? And isn’t it interesting that they’re the **only characters** who receive this kind of dialogue framing?

I believe these lines are hints to the audience that:

1. We need to pay close attention to Mike and Will in Season 5
2. Vecna has been paying attention to Mike and Will this entire time
3. Mike and Will are a part of Vecna's final plan, whether or not they realize it yet

# Part 2: Will isn't fully himself right now

This has already been expanded upon by multiple users on Tumblr and in this subreddit, so I won't focus on this too much. There has been lots of evidence to suggest that Will isn't fully himself right now and that Vecna's memories are bleeding into Will's.

A couple things have been ""off"" about Will this season, including but not limited to:

* Will not wanting to put on a jacket during his conversation with Joyce (*he likes it cold*)
* Joyce mentioning that Will was kidnapped when he was 11, even though he was 12 years old when it happened (*birthdaygate anyone?*)
* Will mentioning that he loves getting milkshakes with his friends at Melvad's even though Melvad's is a general store (It was, however, a diner in Hawkins when Henry Creel was growing up)
* Will mentioning that he loves to get lost in the woods with his friends *(you mean the same place he was kidnapped??)*
* Will standing in the same posture Henry often does

Vecna (and by extension, the mind flayer) are using Will as a spy again. Will is *still* part of the Hive Mind, and Will is a part of Vecna's final plan.

# Part 3: Why Mike may be in danger of Vecna

In Season 5, Mike is under an incredible amount of stress: his sister has been kidnapped by Vecna, his parents were attacked by demogorgons, El is emotionally distancing herself from him, and Will is once again in constant danger.

We haven't been able to see a lot of Mike's POV this season, but we do get one crucial insight into his thought process: his conversation with Holly.

[Mike explaining to Holly that he pretends to be \\""Mike the Brave\\"" whenever he is scared.](https://preview.redd.it/3hxrlqizmeag1.png?width=2700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e10eab7f217280a7a76cbab830b767b40543d1c)

Mike is sh\*t-scared, and instead of expressing that the way he normally would **as one of the most expressive characters in the series** ***(seriously, his face normally gives everything away)***, he’s been forcing himself to hold it all in, presenting himself as “Mike the Brave.” That coping mechanism has worked so far, but it’s clearly unsustainable. Something is going to push him over the edge and force him to finally break.

Perhaps you could say Mike is like a water pipe about to explode? Or perhaps a ticking time bomb?

[Mike accidentally hitting the water pipe, causing it to explode.](https://preview.redd.it/6ke2ir2cueag1.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=6550cc2574ab6e1827310e65a184eba0d147c5fa)

[Mike explaining to Robin how he built the bomb to blow up the Upside Down.](https://preview.redd.it/ee5xp1dkueag1.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9cb1718e8e03af9268332b4b5e80490257c3b28)

**Don't forget that Mike is the one that caused the pipe to explode.**

**Don't forget Mike is the one who built the bomb.**

*Funnily enough, these moments were accompanied by a d\*ck joke and a butthole joke. Do with that what you will.*

[do i even need to caption this? if you know, you know](https://preview.redd.it/nfri84kqueag1.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d900a435c802ee6b63d60e7e0aba57097373bc5)

We know that Vecna targets people who are deeply traumatized, overwhelmed by guilt, and emotionally isolated. We also know his attacks often begin with dissociation and disrupted sleep. This season, we’ve seen Mike drinking significantly more coffee (*has he been struggling with sleeping?*) and visibly dissociating at the hospital.

[Mike and Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/xlo9h5vtyeag1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e9da8123cccf6a8d560660094a90d78ad60e59)

[Mike dissociating when Nancy is complaining about not being to check on their mom at the hospital.](https://preview.redd.it/byubabi3yeag1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfece3d7dbaa15e023f22f959dc9cb6c3752467f)

All the warning signs are there.

***Something*** is going to cause Mike to crack and leave him especially vulnerable to Vecna.

Maybe something like finding out that that his best friend, who he *just* learned has been in love with him this entire time, is being taken away from him once again?

# Part 4: Regarding Kali, the ""traitor""

There's been a ton of speculation that Kali will be the traitor to the group and that she's been influenced by either Vecna or the Mind Flayer. And there certainly been evidence to suggest that she could be suspicious, for example:

* Kali mentions having “psychic friends” (*since when did she have psychic friends?*)
* Hopper openly distrusts her motivations
* Her worldview closely mirrors Henry’s, particularly the idea of harnessing power through anger
* Her abilities (her use of illusion and manipulation) also parallel Henry’s in unsettling ways

We as the audience are meant to be distrustful of her at this point of the story, especially since she believes that her and El's death is the only way to stop the cycle of abuse.

However, I can't help but feel like this is a red herring. The suspicion surrounding Kali feels too overt, and I think the idea of Kali being the traitor and the final puzzle piece to Vecna's plan is just a distraction designed to keep our attention away from Mike and Will.

In other words, Kali *could* be suspicious and *could* be potentially mind-flayed, but **I don't think she's the one we need to be watching out for.**

# Part 5: El's Independence Arc and the Three Doors

This season has placed heavy emphasis on the idea of multiple pathways and overlapping plans rather than a single, linear solution. We see this repeatedly in the story, for example:

* Hopper's fail-safe plan
* Max and the three doors
* The three waterfalls
* Using both Erica’s plan and Lucas’s plan rather than choosing one

So far, El has been introduced to two options for her future:

1. Mike's ""Three Waterfalls"" Future - idealistic and a fantasy
2. Kali's plan for death - pessimistic

Which raises the obvious question: which one will El choose?

But maybe that’s the wrong question.

If this season keeps insisting that there are always multiple paths forward, are these really the only two options available to her? Or is there a third, unseen pathway— one the story has been quietly preparing us for all along?

# Part 6: My predictions

Here are my rough general predictions for the season finale:

* The Henry Creel / Patty Newby backstory and the reveal that Vecna has allowed the Mind Flayer to possess and take over him.
* El will follow her instincts and choose neither Mike’s version of the future nor Kali’s. Instead, she’ll discover a third pathway, completing her independence arc. I think Kali will initially resist this choice, but through the power of SISTERLY LOVE^(TM), El will convince Kali to follow her.
* At this point in the story, Will is resigned and riddled with guilt. He believes Vecna will always use him. And he, *not El*, will attempt to self-sacrifice in order to stop Vecna once and for all.
* Mike will realize that Vecna has been using Will and will follow him & try to save him.
* When Will attempts to sacrifice himself (likely as an attempt to stop Vecna's plan), Mike is finally going to have is breakdown, leaving him vulnerable to Vecna
* Whatever plan Vecna has with Will is going to fail, and Vecna will pivot and use Mike in his plan instead. There will be a reveal that Mike is and has always been Vecna's ""fail-safe"" plan.
* Will and Mike will finally tell each other the truth and save each other with the power of LOVE^(TM).
* Byler endgame. Duh!

Other things I'm manifesting:

* Mike and El discussing their relationship and mutually agreeing they are better as friends (and maybe a reveal that they broke up in the time skip)
* Will gets another coming out scene, this time on his own terms and without the threat of the Mind Flayer or Vecna. It'll be in front of his closest friends and family, and he gets to unapologetically say ""I like boys"". **Full self-acceptance**.
* Mike yearning for Will
* A Byler basement scene (WSQK... coke and coffee anyone?)
* Mike and Will montage scene
* ADDRESSING THE FREAKING PAINTING LIE
* The reveal that Mike is not Will's ""Tammy Thomspon"" and is actually Will's ""Vickie""

No expectations here, but I'd figured I'd try it out. I'm on the brink of a new chapter in my life and just looking for someone who has maybe gone through something similar or at least just someone to have in my corner. 

I'm a very transparent person so here it goes: on the verge of formal divorce but currently separated in the same house with a move out by March. We split custody of our toddler (f) and so forth. I didn't expect it go out this way, but life goes on. 

About me: 32, not big (5'8, 160), but in decent shape (picture on my profile if you're curious). I work from home and run a cyber security consulting business in Florida. I love to cook a bit of everything, but Cajun food is my specialty. Other than that, I'm into heavy metal, some PC gaming, fitness, bourbon / cocktails / wine, reading / economics, coffee and a little bit of everything. Hard to sum up 30+ years of interest in a post anybody wants to read.

The good news is that I'm nerd so if you have something you really nerd out with too I will probably lean in and learn something too. :) it'll be cool to have some things in common or just mutual interest, but if you just enjoy conversation we'll get along just fine. 

You? Somewhere near 26-36, just someone chill who likes meeting new people. You like getting to know people and have a sense humor along the way. I can definitely hold a conversation if there is one to be had so if we connect it'll be obvious. If not, I'm respectful enough to mention it. 

I know it's a lot, but I know there are some great people out there going through their own journey and having someone to talk it out with is worth the trouble sometimes. ",0,1767138571.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

# [Eco-Friendly Turkish Coffee Recipe: A Rich Tradition](https://faircoffee.co.uk/coffee-blog/eco-friendly-turkish-coffee-a-rich-tradition-recipe/#google_vignette)



# Ingredients

* 7g very finely ground, [sustainably sourced coffee](https://faircoffee.co.uk/product/coffee-blend-dark-french-roast-sustainably-sourced-fair-coffee/)
* 70ml cold water
* Optional: sugar to taste

To pay homage to the traditional Turkish coffee recipe You’ll also need a cezve (traditional Turkish coffee pot) or a small saucepan.

# Instructions

1. Combine coffee, water, and sugar (if using) in the cezve.
2. Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves eventually.
3. As the coffee heats, a foam will form. Additionally, when it starts to rise, remove it from the heat
4. Skim off the foam and add it to your coffee cup.
5. Return the cezve to the heat and allow it to rise again.
6. Pour the coffee into the cup, capturing the foam.
7. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the grounds to settle.

Serve in small, reusable cups. Remember, enjoying Turkish coffee means sipping it slowly, enjoying the rich flavour and aroma.

1pzxmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1pzxmkl/need_perspective_on_a_thought/,Need perspective on a thought,"Waddup my brotato chips, i need some opinions on a thought, which may help with my compulsion to revisit it. But first imma run through some contextual history so you can kinda understant the point where Im in now. 

I had sexual orientation OCD as a teenager for a little while which is my first experience with the shit we call OCD. Ive resolved it by not giving a fuck about me being gay after all and it turns out im really not. But ive decided it would be okay if I were. So „giving up“ has solved that OCD. Could be a helpful technique for some of ya‘ll. I mean it comes back from time to tim but giving up resolves it every time. 

But broskis, I must regretfully say that wasn’t my last experience with OCD unfortunately. My brain likes to create problems when I really have none and now I got to experience RJOCD  for a couple of years now. 

So I never considered myself the jealous type from my actions though deep down, emotionally, I feel it though recognize the irrationality of it depending on the situations. I am very comfortable with my wife. Very early on we had a conversation where she mentioned she only ever broke up with her partnerd amicably. A fact which I admired. It was all smooth sailing for her. 

So a couple years ago, my girlfriend (now wife), still communicates sporadically with a former fling of hers. Not regularly but it happens. They are distant friends. Their romantic chapter ended way before I met her and their sporadic communication was going on before I met her myself. They have a phone call every half year or something. At most they have a coffee if she was ever coincidentally in his city. Shes been very transparent about it and I haven’t given a shit about it much. But one time they were on the phone and I realized they had sex all those years ago before I met her and that image burned in my mind and I got really jealous for a while so I had that RJ for a little while. But this one subsided. It was easy to understand. She told me why they broke up and all that shit and hes a cool dude. Rationally it was alright. Helps a lot when I slip myself into her shoes and see things from her perspective. 

But brochachos, that was only a little taste of RJ.

One time we had a phase of watching this trash show „infieles“ from Mexico where some chick goes interviewing random couples and expose potential cheaters. 

And one time my girlfriend mentioned she suspects to have been cheated on by a previous partner before and I was internally perplexed and outraged.

So apparently the dude found some random girls underwear in his apartment and he showed it to her (through a videocall, they had some miles separating them) and asked if it were hers. It wasn’t. And apparently that didnt compell her to dump the dude. At the time she was a bit shocked sure. But that burnt into my brain. And then we were talking about it more and then she mentioned, how in the beginning, he told her „I know from your personality, that we‘re not gonna last long.“ Which I found an outrageous way of communicating a limit to a relationship. Which is normal but the wording is just downright disrespectful from my point of view.

  
So that’s when the RJOCD hit and I couldnt stop thinking about specifically those 2 thoughts over and over and over and over and over and over and over again:

  
1. Why shed stick with him at the time if he showed her some other womans panties. 

\-This held most of the emotional charge.

2. „I know from your personality that we‘re not gonna last long„ 

  
So those thoughts were ruminating for like years and it took me a lot of effort to talk about it sporadically with my now wife who has no clue how much damage it has done to my frontal lobes, brochoskis. 

But in one of the talks she mentioned that for the first point. He had an alibi and he said that it must have been from before they were seeing each other (otherwise he wouldnt have been dumb enough to ask her in the first place, duh) and she was naive enough to buy it and honestly in her shoes I would have been too and this was the key to „Solve“ this particular OCD thought. 

  
And for the second point, she doesn’t remember the exact conversation about the relationship limit. But she did say he definitely said those words. 

  
So Brochachos, I am stuck with one recurring thought. I am constantly visualizing the conversation of him telling her “ I know from your personality that we’re not gonna last long”.

I can’t rationalize sticking around after being told that. 

And I suspect the emotional charge of the “cheating thought” has carried over to this thought.

Is the wording as harsh as it sounds like for me? 

  
I would have said something in the lines of “we have our differences and I know for me this isn’t something long term, I hope you okay with that”.

Can I have your opinions on this?

In the past two years, we’ve had sex one time, and it was before I was about to travel to my home country alone, so I’m not convinced it wasn’t some sort of hysterical bonding where he felt obligated in order to keep me from cheating (although I never would).

He’s an alcoholic and has been sober for 1.5 years, and I knew he had a problem when I married him, so this is something I committed to. 

We had a great sex life when we were dating, but the stress of drinking heavily and then quitting have really impacted his libido. He’s on medication for cravings as well as anti-anxiety meds which contribute to this.

For several months/years he’s been “feeling things are getting better” in terms of his libido, but there’s been no noticeable change. At all. I stopped initiating a long time ago because I can’t take the rejection. My body is changing, and ovulating is absolutely TORTURE when the man I’m obsessed with is right there but doesn’t want anything to do with me sexually.

He’s still very affectionate and our relationship is great in nearly every other aspect. I don’t think he’s cheating, and he doesn’t have a porn addiction. He just has a low libido and takes very little action to get it back.

He expresses wanting to change, but there’s never any progress. He doesn’t want me to try and initiate because the lead up gives him performance anxiety. So I just go about life trying to pretend like this doesn’t bother me at all. 

He complains about anxiety a lot, and it’s one of the reasons why he doesn’t try to ignite any kind of passion or let me try and spark any responsive desire in him. But then he’ll drink like 3-4 coffees a day, which I’m assuming is a main contributor to his anxiety. I try to be sensitive to this because I am sober from a years-long marijuana dependence, and sometimes it feels nice to have SOME sort of substance in your system, like caffeine, so I get it.

I don’t really know what to do. I try to encourage therapy, but I can’t force him. I try not to break down at least once a month when I’m fully feral and just want my husband to rail me. I feel like I’m nearing the end of my physical prime, and I’m so heartbroken to spend these years celibate.

Any advice? I’m getting resentful, and I hate that. I won’t leave him, so please don’t suggest that.

1pzxk6a,https://i.redd.it/4masdyc6hfag1.jpeg,It was easier to buy a home during the Great Depression than right now,"The housing system is unsustainable.

People that have paid around $160,000 in rent over 10 years, that never missed a payment.. THEY STILL CANT QUALIFY FOR A MORTGAGE.

That alone should sound insane. We keep being told it’s about budgeting. Coffee. Netflix. Lifestyle choices. But the math doesn’t back that up.

During the Great Depression, the median annual pay was about 22% of the cost of an average home. Today it’s closer to 14%.

Meaning it was statistically easier to buy a home during the Great Depression than it is right now. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE.

Then there’s rent itself.

Rent is usually the largest bill people pay, every single month. They pay it on time for years and it barely counts for anything.

Miss a credit card payment and it follows you everywhere.

Meanwhile, just trying to apply to live somewhere costs money. Listings pull in 20 applicants at $50-$100 each. That’s hundreds of dollars per month per property collected in application fees alone. Even though they know they will reject almost everyone.

The unit never even gets filled. Sometimes rent gets raised, tenants leave, and the place gets relisted cheaper. So people pay to apply, pay to move, pay to leave, and pay again somewhere else.

And yes, not every landlord is bad. But the system itself rewards hoarding and gatekeeping. Landlords don’t “provide” genuine intention housing. Construction workers do. Landlords take housing that already exists, hold it behind paywalls, and remove people the moment they can’t keep up.

According to reports, 39% of Americans have skipped meals to make housing payments. People are forced to choose between food and shelter.

1pzxhzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1pzxhzm/alkalizing_coffee_versus_the_role_of_acid_in_the/,Alkalizing coffee versus the role of acid in the finished cup,"Sometimes an upset stomach can make me want to avoid coffee entirely. I usually have one to two cups daily and usually avoid caffeine afternoon. This is much less of an issue with milk drinks. 

I was wondering if the acid in coffee might be driving some of the issue.

There are products advertising to neutralize acid in coffee — Alkamind Acid-Kicking Coffee Alkalizer,
Coffee Tamer and JavaAcid Coffee Acid Reducer.

They seem to be a mix of potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium and calcium salts.

I know there’s been a lot of work on the water chemistry you brew with - but what about adding bicarbonate after you’ve brewed the cup. 

Knowing that some people really like lighter roasts for acidic/brighter mouthfeel - it would be very interesting to see the importance or relative lack of importance acid in brewed coffee. 

Does anyone have first hand experience with these? Any idea if James would find this an interesting topic? (I know Jimseven is sometimes here.) I don’t think he’s covered it before.",3,1767138057.0,JamesHoffmann,2,1.0,False

Antartica Compound, Sublevel 3.
(Click)
""Keith O'Donnell, head geneticist at the New Organism Vitality & Advancement genetics company. They want me logging from day one, so here’s day one.

The air down here smells like oil and rust. We’re beneath an abandoned NORAD-adjacent facility, built in the fifties, decommissioned in the eighties, and repurposed for NOVA Genetics in the nineties. Gotta love recycling.

What we’ve found—or what NOVA claims we’ve found—could be a major breakthrough in biochemistry. 

They call it Syberium — a viscous, violet liquid, drawn from the Chersky Range four years ago in Russia.

After examination, it yielded potential benefits for the subjects. Proceeding 14 tests, the conclusive answer is that Syberium acts as a growth accelerant and is extremely potent; as of now, only 20 CC is needed for complete growth. 

But...again, none of the subjects have made it out of the newborn stage,(sigh) all dying from rapid cellular decay.

I fear the Syberium itself is missing to endure the constant strain of duplicating molecules. We'd need a stabilizer of some sort.""

(Click)
04/10/1991 – Personal Tape 1

""They hired me four months ago. Since then I’ve lived in the compound. Food, objects, comforts — whatever I request appears at my door. No questions asked.

There are at least five other scientists here. We’re not alone, though it often feels like it.""


""Every two days we’re marched to a repurposed barracks for dinner. Rust creeps along the floor. Dead plants crumble in their pots. Appetite killer.

Tonight something unusual happened: the cameras and mics went dead for a heartbeat. In that gap Mark — our resident ‘conspiracy’ biologist — whispered about a program from the 80's called Overgrowth. He said this facility sits on it's bones. He continued talkinga bout it for a damn while, but while talking he bumped my foot with his and handing me a crumpled piece of paper under the table, I took it quietly and pretended to still listen to his blabbering.

Before he could finish, three guards rushed in and hauled him off, muffling his screams as he fought.""


04/22/1991 – Tape 5

""Syberium-DNA trials continue. We’ve stabilized fragments. But it still doesn't look good;(deep sigh) we've now done avian, oceanic, and terrestrial. None of them pass as newborn. But everybody knows stubbornness wins in the end.""


04/22/1991 - Personal Tape 2

""Every failure is logged, and shipped straight back to NOVA HQ. I wonder where they go? Incinerators? Freezers? A second lab? Never asked. Sometimes I wonder if we’re the only lab.""


""Also Mark hasn't come back, so guess what he said had some weight behind it.""


04/23/1991 - Tape 6
""Stabilized fragments. Still dying. I’m tired.”

04/29/1991 – Tape 7

""New orders. New material.

Apparently, a German drilling project uncovered microbial life in glacial pockets that could be useful to our project. NOVA doesn't know what it is, so they're sending me to harvest.""


04/30/1991 - Personal Tape 3

""The world’s gone quiet since the Berlin Wall fell. Wars ended, empires crumbled. But in the shadows, men like our mysterious CEO pick through the ruins looking for scraps of god.

(Chuckle)
And I’m the one stitching them back together.""

05/12/1991 – Tape 9

""Arrived at the McMurdo-adjacent outpost. White horizon in every direction. The sky feels too big here. The silence is too absolute... It's driving me crazy.""


""I saw a penguin get eaten by an orca.

Orcas scare me. Just like what we're about to do.""


""We descended into a canyon previously covered by ice.

The algae was right there. (Window tap tap) Dinoflagellates, frozen in glacial caves, alive after what seems to be millions of years. I took samples.""


""I tested it on a mouse's fibroblast cells. Cancer took them over. The algae repaired them. Whole again. As if the disease never existed. But in the process it fused itself with the cells.

From what I could gather, there is no adverse side effect to the now ""healthy cells"".""


(Hmm)""If the algae is compatible with the subjects DNA,  if Syberium and the algae work together. We won’t just bring them back. We’ll bring them back perfected.""

05/20/1991 – Personal Tape 4

""If this works, history rewrites itself. Not some Land Before Time fantasy. Not just cloning. Something more. Something beyond.

The thought…keeps me awake at night.""

(June–July 1991)

06/03/1991 – Tape 14

Antarctica, Lab Dome C.

""Day 22 with the algae culture. This stuff is patient, eternal.

The bioluminescence seems to be part of the ""healing"" process of the cells; it can't seem to be destroyed, and it repairs itself at every iteration of the elimination tests.""

(2 days later)
""After further testing, It's only weakness seems to be heat, but for it to do anything it has to be hitting close to 3000°C.""

06/07/1991 - Personal Tape 5

""I might receive a new sample of theropod for the next test; they told me it would be finally time to mix the two substances together while growing a living being.""


""I'm hearing voices, but I can't discern if it's in my head or the al...no, can't be; it's just the cold and nothingness. I won't let it get to me; I can't.""


06/15/1991 – Tape 17


""Test subject designation: S-42. Deinonychus embryo. First hybridization trial complete: algae + Syberium + Deinonychus DNA.

For the first time, the cells didn’t implode. Division held. Nuclei remained intact.

I’m not looking at soup anymore. I’m finally looking at life.""

(A few hours later)
""She hatched today. Size of a raven, talons like scalpels, eyes bright and alert. When I extended my gloved hand to the containment box she chirped — not hissed. Not snapped. Chirped.

I’ve handled rats, chimps, even one unlucky goat. None ever looked at me the way she did, tilting her head as if asking a question.""


""Her colour came after a few hours — black as a starless sky.

I’m calling her Nyx. Little shadow.""


06/22/1991 – Personal Tape 6

""Nyx follows me everywhere. She curls near my workstation like a cat, watching, listening, I actually ended up writing her name instead of her designation on the report, she's really gettin' to me.""

""Today I noticed her spine; there's subtle luminescence under the skin. A thin glowing line from neck to tail. Not constant, but pulsing when she eats or plays. The algae is expressing itself through her physiology. Surely a reaction of the bonding with the cells.""

06/23/1991 - Personal Tape 7

""NOVA wants results. They’ll get more than that. They’ll get monsters. Raptors aren’t supposed to be affectionate. But of course that's not what they want; they want carnival attractions with teeth. 
But hey... at least Nyx...she’s affectionate toward me.""

07/01/1991 – Tape 22

""New orders again. Transfer to a higher-capacity site, codename Excelsior. Location is classified even to us until departure.""

""They argued with me, of course. Said Nyx was too fragile for transport. I insisted. So I built her a crate with bedding. When the helicopter lifted, she shrieked until I put my hand on the box. Then she went quiet.""



""I don’t know what Excelsior is. But I know this: she’s coming with me. And I would burn this whole compound before leaving her behind.""

07/05/1991 – Tape 23

Colorado Compound, before departure.

""Dr. Brennan handed me an envelope with a number and three lines of code. In case containment fails, in case things go ‘beyond salvage.’ She always was a good one.""

07/12/1991 – Personal Tape 8

Site Excelsior

""We arrived. And this place…
(Scoff)
Imagine a military base fused with Disneyland’s underbelly. Tall fences, endless labs, hidden on red desert salt flats. The air smells of sodium and sulphur.""


""There are dozens of scientists. Geneticists, engineers, ex-military handlers. Some look pretty excited, some a little haunted.

Nyx hated the trip. Complained the whole way, she sleeps in my chamber now, curled right next to me. Like a watchdog.""

(August–October 1991)

08/01/1991 – Tape 28

""Goddamn thing....Excelsior’s projects dwarf mine. Three Utahraptors grown in parallel: Specimens U-1 through U-3. Thrice Nyx’s size, thrice her aggression.

They seem… synchronized. When one tilts it's head, the others follow. When one growls, the others echo. It's Not communication. Not mimicry. Something deeper. A hive-mind-like behaviour.

And then the hairs. They’re like structures on their skulls, similar to antennae. They vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies, resonating in their hollow nose chamber, generating a droning roar. Heavy. Mechanical. Like standing under a military helicopter motor.

NOVA calls it a ‘novel adaptation.’ I say it’s a warning.""

""Their genes are...weird; they mixed in the saltwater crocodile to give them reptile features, making them look like ""real"" dinosaurs. It also makes them hyper aggressive. They somehow put in cicada as well...explains why the droning is cranked to 11.""


""ALSO Dinosaurs had feathers, goddamn airheads.""


08/18/1991 – Tape 32

""Nyx is scared of the Utahraptors. She presses against me when their chambers hum with that awful sound. It resonates throughout the whole complex, vibrating metal and glass slightly.

They’re machines. Bred for amusement.

I fear them. Yet I pity them. But mostly—I hate what they represent.

Because if Nyx is my miracle, then the raptors are someone else’s monster.""


09/02/1991 – Tape 37

""The CEO visited today.

A man in a burgundy suit, decorated by a simple black tie with a gold inlaid DNA strand pattern. His face obscured by round sunglasses and lack of light. They never gave a name. Never spoke above a whisper. Only watched through glass as the Utahraptors were fed live prey.

The Raptors were extremely vocal the whole times the CEO was there except when he spoke, then they shut right up as if their vocal cords were cut.

When he left, every handler stood straighter. The strength of gravity itself seeming to shift.

Whoever he is, he doesn’t want amusement. He wants power. The ‘park’ is just a mask. I feel it.""


09/22/1991 - Personal Tape ø


""The CEO summoned me into his office, first time I’ve ever been up there. Felt like walking into a different world. Polished black marble instead of rust. Carpeting so thick my sneakers sank. And cold. Not air-conditioned cold — vacuum cold. Like standing in a server room with no servers.

The secretary, no badge, no name, she just nodded once and led me through a long corridor lit by violet strips in the floor. No sound except my own footsteps.”


“His office was…lovely. Massive bookshelves rising from floor to ceiling curling themselves like ribs to the entry doors, within the shelves an extreme adornment of books varied as the colors of the light spectrum.

A cherry mahogany desk, a single chair behind it, an exquisite couch to repose oneself, behind it all a wall of black marble exquisitely inlaid with gold accents representing the solar system adorned with thousands of stars.

He stood with his back to me, hands clasped behind him. Same suit, same inner fear. When his voice came it wasn't speaking. It was a whisper that felt like it landed directly in my inner ear. Like a demon making me surrender to his wicked whims.

‘Doctor O’Donnell,’ he said. ‘You’ve done well. The little one—Nyx—is proof of concept. Proof that Syberium and the algae can coexist without degradation.’”

(Pause)

“My mouth was dry. Like the desert we were stationed in.
The room was dark, very dark.

He then turned. I still couldn’t see his eyes; the sunglasses
completely masking his sockets.

He didn’t sit. He leaned closer. ‘We’ve waited long enough for men to catch up to their ideas,’ he whispered. ‘Now our ideas will grow men.’”

""He walked a few feet and pressed a button on the wall, a drink came out, a delicate marshmallow smelling espresso cup.

The smell was like Lsd... tickling the back of my amygdala, striking a complete fear response immediately replaced with pure benign pleasure.

The coffee then began to smell like the freshly buttered pancakes my mom used to make in the morning for me, then cinnamon buns like my grandmother's place.

The scent shifted every few seconds, until it returned to a soft fire licked marshmallow aroma, all those flavors seeping of nostalgia, the man then sipped the cup gently.

I noticed when his lips parted from the drink, his tongue was partly purple as though stained by a food.

He proceeded to sit down on the chair rolling it to the start of the desk, depositing his ceramic on a coaster.""

(paper shuffle)

“He slid a folder toward me. No logo. No title. Inside, a requisition order for primate embryos and human stem cell lines.

The bottom line read, simply: ‘Phase Two: Homo sapiens trials. Directive Immediate.’

I stammered something about protocol. Ethics committees. He laughed — no sound came out, just a low vibration in my eardrum.

Then he said: ‘You'll see the files. You know the potential. We’ve cured cancer. We’ve accelerated evolution. You think our species can wait?’

I didn't understand what he was talking about but...I couldn't say no to the boss.”

(Deep breath)

“I left with the folder under my arm. His whisper still in my skull.”


10/15/1991 – Personal Tape 9

""I remembered Mark today. That note — OVERLORD PASS OVER 557 — has been burning in my mind. Curiosity finally won.

I slipped into my manager's office after lights-out. Computer still running. Login screen waiting. I typed in OVERLORD… password 557.

It worked.

Whole directories opened like a vault. Dozens of projects, dates stretching back into the eighties. But one file was marked red. Project Overgrowth.""

(DRRRRR—static)
(Click)

""It was a human trial. Subject codename: HELIX.

Male, early forties. Terminal — stage four liver cancer. The file described him as ‘selected for expendability.’ Government phrasing for dying anyway.

They placed him in a sealed observation room with a faint NOVA logo on the door. Bed. Chair. Nothing else.

First injection: Syberium, direct to the neocortex, targeting ARHGAP11B — the gene linked to cortical expansion.

On paper it was simple: accelerate brain growth, heal the body. A miracle in a syringe.”

(Pause. Paper shuffle)
“But it didn’t heal. It rewrote.

By day 3 the cancer was gone, but the scans showed something worse.

The Syberium had threaded into every cell, photo-reactive, violet veins glowing under the skin.

His immune system didn’t just kill tumors — it killed everything, rebuilding tissue with a strange lattice, the chemical, binding itself to the host.

He didn’t speak anymore. He didn’t sleep. He sat awake, eyes open, as if listening to something outside human range.""


""Day four — the skull fractures began. His brain pushed against bone, swelling, cracking sutures and then resealing itself with every pulse.

Like the body couldn’t decide if it was healing or birthing something new. The glass walls shook from his screams.

When they resumed injections, the swelling receded, but his eyes stayed purple — and the room itself seemed darker around him, like the light bent away.”

(Silence. Deep breath)
""They noted psychological collapse. Recording transcript, day five:

‘42…42 is the answer…atoms tell me…they glow, like stars, endless, endless. You can’t contain it. It doesn’t belong to you…’

Then he lunged at the glass. Whispered through blood and cracks:

‘You cannot control what you do not understand. The old wrath will return. We have stolen the throne.’”

And then, in stamped red:
[PATIENT TERMINATED].

Signed with nothing but a DNA helix emblem. No names. No initials.""

10/22/1991 - Personal Tape 10


""This is getting goddamn weird...it's(pause) what? (Looks at nyx) what do you mean? 
Yes...but that doesn't explain the quantum irregularities in the sample of Syberium I analyzed.

I mean if you take in...
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, but it still doesn't...
Shit....so that's why.
The isotopes...Of course!
But what should I do?
No, I can't its too dangerous, what if they find out?

Yes I could...
Man you're smart!
How do you know all this!?
Collective unconscious huh?
That's really damn gnarly!""

""Anyway, like I said things are getting peculiar here....the Raptors, the files...the goddamn files.

Man they're still borrowing in my head like worms, and the....the RAPTORS THEY DON'T STOP THEY...DON'T...
(DRRRRRRRRRRR)
(Whispers under breath)
Make it stop...please make...stop it...stop.""



10/31/1991 – Personal Tape 11

""Containment breach. U-2 killed a handler. The hive reacted as one. By the time guns fired, three men were dead.

I reached for the slip. The number. My hand shook. But I didn’t call it. Not yet. I had to get to the control room.

Nyx pressed against my leg, glowing brighter than ever, spine alight, her little head cocking to the side like a cat. I knew what I had to do""

10/31/1991 - Personal Tape 12

""To anyone who finds this tape… understand this: the algae’s not a contagion. It doesn’t spread. It regenerates. Repairs. Makes things possible that shouldn’t exist.

That’s why we were able to do things not even imaginable to the common mind. And it's also why they should be destroyed.

We wanted to learn, to reach back into deep time and...bring something beautiful forward. And we did.

But greed resurrected what wisdom left buried.""

""I’ll stay with her. She doesn’t deserve to die alone. Neither do I.

All lean meats and fish, green vegetables, a banana or blueberry’s for snacks and low carb protein shakes.   2 hard boiled eggs and 2 cups bone broth a day.   1 Cup of coffee in morning and nothing but water for last 8 weeks.   I added a 5 cal 20mg of protein powder to add to water to up my protein without the calories.  No side effects and I feel amazing everyday.

If anyone has any suggestion on what to add I appreciate any advice.   I am worried about my low calorie diet not getting enough protein and that’s why I added the protein water.   I’m getting an average of 125 to 140 grams of protein a day.   I was planing on doubling that once I hit my goal weight and start a harder weight lifting routine.   I might set my goal weight lower depending on how I look and feel when I get there.   I’m hoping to hit goal by Feb 1st for my Florida keys motorcycle trip.

They’re both busy students juggling classes, projects, barely functioning coffee machines, and the occasional existential crisis about the future.

But the universe seems determined to turn their quiet moments into controlled chaos.

Every time Peter plans something cute a study date, a movie night, a trip to the park something happens. A random explosion downtown, a malfunctioning Stark-tech drone flying into the library window, Gwen’s new science experiment deciding to smoke on its own… 
something always interrupts.

And yet, the two of them keep managing to carve out tiny pockets of normalcy between all the madness: late-night ramen runs after patrol, Gwen patching Peter up while pretending not to worry too much, Peter rambling nervously whenever Gwen gets too close, Gwen teasing him until he turns red.

Also spiderman stuff the main idea will be he is still street level with the inclusion of alot of marvel characters but it's not that important as much as there relationship

The tone is a mix of:

Slice of life: college life, roommate chaos, trying to pay rent, cramming for exams.

Action: sudden villain appearances, mini-patrols, accidental rooftop chases.

Comedy: Peter’s awkward charm + Gwen’s quick wit = endless teasing and mishaps.

Romance: slow-burn affection, soft moments after high tension, “almost kisses” interrupted at the worst possible times.

Why is it so hard to find a place that’s actually good for working or studying for a few hours?

What I’m imagining is honestly pretty simple:

1. A calm, cozy atmosphere (not library-silent, but not loud either)
2. Really good coffee
3. A place where you can sit for a long time without feeling rushed or getting side-eyed

Most coffee shops here fall into one of two extremes:

   \- Either they’re loud, crowded, have no outlets, and clearly aren’t designed for people who want to stay and work

   \- Or they’re basically grab-and-go coffee spots

I feel like there’s nothing in between.

In Korea, it’s really common to have study cafes where you pay by time or use a membership. People go there specifically to work or study in a cozy, comfortable space. Plus they are open 24/7(although I don't expect that here..)

Honestly, I feel like I’d gladly pay for something like that here if it existed. Even a day pass or a weekly membership would make sense to me if the space was right.

Am I the only one who feels this way?

I go to UMD for computer science. I’m also a licensed private pilot working on my instrument rating, with the long-term goal of flying for the airlines.

I’m a pretty lowkey person. Ambiverted. I’m more into movies and shows, gaming, just chilling at home, and quiet nights than bars or clubs. I like real conversation and quality time.

I’m looking for one genuine connection that can turn into something serious. I’m not into dating around or the “talk for a week then disappear” kinda thing. I prefer things to build naturally through consistent conversation, simple hangs like coffee or a walk, and actually getting to know each other.

A few things about me:

\- Massive FC Barcelona fan and I watch every match

\- I’m consistent and relationship-minded, and I will make you my priority. I care and I’m supportive and I will yap to you for hours about anything in the world. If we ever have a disagreement I have the mentality to not just give up but find what works and grow together.

\- i have a lot of very niche interests that are all over the place, odds are we have something in common. But my big interests are cars, soccer, f1, aerospace and history.

\- my favorite show is Dexter (I WILL NERD OUT ABOUT DEXTER/WE WILL WATCH DEXTER)

What I’m hoping to find: someone kind, affectionate, emotionally mature, and looking for a real relationship, not a situationship. If you’re the type of person to rather just chill at home with your person rather than go out and party, we will get along. I’ve only been in a couple of relationships and I’m kind of inexperienced so someone in the same boat would be ideal so we can learn and grow together.

I had to forcefully reflect on my abilities to even notice how far I've come because it's easy to miss things when you experience little to no anxiety doing them.

A few months ago I had no life. Now I have done so many things, small to the average person, that I wouldn't have done before, listed below.

By the start of summer, the very beginning of recovery, I started making better eye contact with customers.

Last month I went to the opticians. I hate appointments, they are a huge source of anxiety for me. I phoned a shop to ask what time they shut.

This month I'm confidently ordering me and my boyfriend's coffee order. I'm making small talk (only a tiny bit) which I didn't do at all before. The other day I had to phone 10 different taxi companies until I could get an available taxi. I'm also noticing that I'm slightly less anxious simply existing around people.

In January I have a hairdresser appointment booked.

Kinda crazy honestly. Everything I mentioned in this post I wouldn't have been able to have done at all in June, when I started.

So is it worth taking a risk on air build quality as has quite good reviews for the consistency of the grind size also is almost 1k cheaper that C3s 
Or go for c3s and play safe

Even if their as a big of difference btw those to other than the body and which one is better 

currently use a v60, french press,SIF and a moka pot for brewing my coffee might go for a aeropress in future 
And have no plans for a to espresso machine anytime soon.

1pzwtnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1pzwtnh/my_hemhorroidectomy_story_1_day_post_op/,My Hemhorroidectomy Story (1 day post op),"TL;DR: this is the story of my hemhorroidectomy operation yesterday morning.

It's 5:15 AM and my alarm clock buzzes. It's my last chance to drink water, so I gulp down a liter or so, then force myself to drink a little more.

The part I'm really dreading is the enema. I lay down on my side, leg up and squeeze it in. The feeling of fullness and pain from the bottle is totally disgusting, and when I sit on the toilet with my legs on the squatty potty, blood immediately shoots into the toilet. 

I realize I'm running out of time, it's 7:15, and I jump in the shower. I can't believe this is happening, the thing that I've resisted, surgery for the large external hemhorroid (potentially partially internal too) and my internal hemhorroids is today. They will be cut off with a hot knife by my surgeon.

I'm not ready for this! 

As I sat in the waiting room, I really considered leaving a few times. Seriously considered getting up and just going. Then I thought how I would feel, going back to the daily pain and anxiety my hemorrhoids have been causing--usually putting me in pain for an hour or more a day, the blood, the swelling, the fear.

 They call my name and I go back to the surgery prep area.

I'm really not ready for this! I'm terrified!

A nurse named Ana (real name changed), who has a kind and friendly smile, is taking vitals and preparing the IV line. She is asking me some standard questions. It's hard for me to answer. I tell her I have never been this nervous in my life.

She starts asking me about my life, my time abroad, she seems a little worried about me. She asks me to slow my breathing as they take my heart rate, I hear a fast beeping and wonder if my heart is beating that fast.

The anesthesiologist talks to me, then my surgeon. I can't think of much to ask, just if they'll have pain meds. Ana pushes a fluid into my IV and asks if it's cold. It was. I think it's some kind of numbing medication.

They wheel me to the surgery room, and ask me to get up onto the bed. It has a hole in it where my bottom will be for the surgery. I lay flat, an oxygen tube in my nose.

I ask if I'll be flat the whole time--they say no. I wonder how the surgery will actually work, if they open you up, which position, but I don't have much time.

I'm thinking it's my last chance to leave! I just don't know if I can really go through with it. I make a final decision to stay the course, how sad I'll feel walking out of here if I really leave.

They tell me they're starting the anaesthesia through the IV. I ask if I'm going to be out. They said no, not yet, and no surprises. I talk with them a little more, and then my consciousness cuts out.

I wake up with someone talking to me. I am in severe pain, but it is not so great that I need to scream. They're asking me my pain level. I say 8/10, I guess I already had extensive pain killers but I don't know. She pumps something into my IV, I'm drifting, in great pain.

Later, she asks again my pain level. 8/10. She reluctantly pumps more of something into the IV, and my pain level drops.

I have a vague recollection of talking to my surgeon at some point. I remember thanking her, and then she left. It may have been a dream but I think it was real. She had told me she would talk to me after the operation but that I likely wouldn't remember.

I wake up, in the hard hospital bed. I'm so uncomfortable, although it's more manageable, it's just a persistent pain in my anal area. The bed makes it worse. The sheets are messy and I try to ask them to straighten them, it's somehow adding to my pain. In a way, this moment was the worst part so far.

They ask me to pee and I can't. It just won't come out. They use a devise and realized there is almost no pee in my body--they are concerned because apparently some people can't pee after the operation.

I ride home. At this point things feel manageable. I'd had two 5mg oxycodone I guess before leaving.

I got home and without showering, changed into underwear. My temperpedic bed felt hard. I went to the spare bedroom and found the other bed much softer which has made lying down so much easier these past 36 hours.

At this point my anal area was in this intense, dull pain. I was halfway conscious. I felt terror that I'll feel this way potentially for days. It's awful, it really hurts. 

But then, as I sleep, it suddenly subsides within hours (or maybe less, I don't know), and becomes very manageable.

I wake up at 7PM. I actually at that moment feel so, so good. The pain is so much less. I could have taken oxycodone again, but somehow didn't, drinking tea and water and eating a light meal.

But I can't sleep. I take oxycodone, gabapentin and colace around 11:38, and after that I am in for a night of pain.

I somehow really did not respond to one or more of the medicines, and spent the entire night awake, feeling like I had to have a bowel movement, like I was full of gas, but unable to release any of it. Around 7AM I ate a meal and took two Advil and no more of the drugs they gave me, and drank a bit of coffee, and soon had some relief.

The second day has been very hard, but that is another story. Thank you for reading my chronicle. Please send me prayers that I heal and that this feels less painful ♥️",3,1767136344.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

I pull over,check the entire backseat seat,under seats,console,doors,under mats and I find nothing.
I message her to tell her I haven’t found anything and she says “are you at XYZ?”
I reply- “I was because I dropped a passenger off there” 
She said “the passenger must have taken them”
I replied “let me know if you still see them, I’m somewhere else now”
I picked up my son at home and we went to a local business and she comes storming in,screaming and threatening us.Then she starts screaming at the staff and accusing THEM of stealing her property. 

The staff intervened and I told her to check my entire car. 

She had left lost item in the trunk where she had placed her belongings at the beginning of the trip 

At that point I am beyond livid because this whole situation took place with my kid present.
Now she wants to apologize and buy me a coffee.
And at that point I told her to go f*ck herself.

THEN- I get a message from Lyft that she reported me for STEALING her property. 😂

So now I had go to make a police report because she’s not going to get the jump on me and get me banned because she’s a dumb ass that left her property behind. 
I contacted Lyft driver support,went through the entire saga and they said they will “investigate”, whatever that means and that I “won’t see her again”

I’m not looking for anything loud or overly social — more like calm, optimistic, genuine connections. Maybe occasional gym sessions, walks, coffee, play sports or just checking in to stay accountable(if you're in melb)

1pzwq9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/1pzwq9y/two_week_postsurgery_update/,Two Week Post-Surgery Update,"I have spent three years utilizing everyone's advice here so I wanted to post an update for my surgery which happened two weeks ago. 



Pre-Surgery: I tried cab for 18 months prior to surgery, it wasn't a terrible experience.  The cab lowered my prolactin but tumor didn't shrink at all. The artificially low prolactin affected my immune system and I was getting every cough, cold, flu, stomach bug that went around.  Used a lot of unpaid sick days at work, still tired all the time, no interest in life, very anhedonic. I developed secondary hypothyroidism from the tumor so began taking meds for that too.   My ultimate goal is to be med-free, so I added my name to the waitlist for surgery. For reference, I am 38, female, overweight and not in especially good shape. 



Surgery Day: I was more worried about dying under anesthesia than the surgery itself. I trusted a perfect stranger to chop my brain up, but wouldn't trust my own body to make it through a surgery. In fact the anesthesia was a cakewalk, I would have no concern going under again. I told the nurse I was nervous and she gave me a pill to help. 

My surgery was 4 1/2 hours long.  Catheter was put in while I was under. Felt like time disappeared, I woke up shivering and shaking in post-op and a nurse was hugging me (I think?) telling me that I just had an operation and that it's a totally normal reaction. They fetched warm blankets and I think I fell asleep as soon as I reached a warm temperature. 

I woke up later in the ward with my bed on a 10% incline.  I was in and out of it, head/face pain was bad. It really just felt like sleeping with intermittent wakeful moments.  I was given Tylenol and when it didn't work, I was given oxycontin twice that first day.  Pain level was 9/10 but the oxy kicked in immediately.   My husband was with me and fed me ice chips or water through a syringe because I couldn't sit up to drink.  About 10 hours after I got out of surgery, I pushed myself up and threw up into a garbage can, it was an easy single throw up, no retching; the nurse said this was the damaged throat blood/tissue from the intubation coming out. I was being woken up every 2 hours for blood tests and catheter monitoring but went right back to sleep  I had two IV antibiotic drips in. I used the saline oxygen nebulizer mask most of the night to help sleep

Recovery Day 1: My head hurt all day.  I was in and out of sleeping (or trying) all day, with the same 2 hours blood checks and urine disposals.  My kidneys starting ""dumping"" water and at one point I was apparently making 800ml urine/hour. This was despite still being at 10% incline and barely drinking any water.  I did two sneezes this day because I was too out of it to stop them (tip: practice before the surgery how to stop a sneeze by pushing hard on your filtrum and pushing your tongue against the back of your teeth). I had a lot of lumpy mucus running down the back of my throat but my nostrils were totally dry.  They had put dissolvable packing in my nose to protect the surgery site. I did not have any gauze on my face.  Everyone kept asking if I had a salty taste in my mouth, but I had no sense of taste so couldn't really answer this.  I was on bed rest orders, but  was allowed to get up and use a commode to get to the bathroom to poo.  I couldn't wipe because my hands had IV attachments in, my husband had to wipe my butt.  I wasn't allowed to strain to poo.  I would advise eating a light meal the night before surgery because my stomach was uncomfortable all day from knowing I needed to go. 

That night I had a issue because in my sleep my catheter shifted in my bladder.  I woke with a painful full bladder and swollen hands. The nurse repositioned it which didn't hurt at all and then I felt the water start to pass. I have some catheter trauma from my past, and this was very scary but pain-wise, it was managable.

Recovery Day 2: Still on bed rest per doctor.  My husband gave me a bedbath and despite my discomfort I had a fleeting spontaneous sexual thought - big deal! It's been about 3+ years since that happened.  I was allowed to take a melatonin to sleep but it didn't work at all: I was tired, but couldn't sleep.  I'm not sure if it was to do with the noise in the ward, or the frequent wakings, but I could not get back to sleep. Emotionally I still felt good, tired but good. I couldn't read or look at my phone because it hurt my eyes/face, I mostly just stared ahead or closed my eyes and listened to everything happening around me. 

Recovery Day 3: Again woke up with very little sleep (1-2 hours) overnight.  I woke up with a sense of hope though, which again: pretty big deal, it's been a while!!  I was taken off bed rest to go to the bathroom. Every morning I was given a morning laxative drink since the surgery FYI. My water input/output amounts had been monitored for the past 24 hours since the dumping episode and I was cleared for catheter removal. Not pleasant, but quick, and my nurse was a star.  Vital checks were reduced to every 4 hours.  My salts were too high (sodium and chloride were out of range), but the only symptom of that I could feel was that my tears were salty and burned my eyes. A damp washcloth helped. I took a couple of melatonin tablets throughout the day just to catch 2-3 hours sleep here and there.   I also took a walk with my walker/zimmerframe and went about 40 ft outside my room.  It was very overwhelming with everyone around, and the bright lights. This was a pretty tiring day and I slept six hours that night. 

Note: until this point I was taking 650mg Tylenol every four hours my entire stay.  My pain was never over a 4/10 after the first day, but if I didn't take the meds, the headache came back quickly and took longer to go. I am usually frugal, but tried off-brand acetaminophen and it absolutely did not hit the same way as Tylenol brand.  I also really recommend having a travel neck pillow as having it under my chin was one of the only way I managed to sleep at first



Recovery Day 4: After a long six hour sleep, my appetite seemed to return with a vengeance. The gap between dinner and breakfast was about 12 hours and I woke up starving.  Luckily my husband had left me sandwiches, jello, fruit cups so ate those.   I washed myself using the bathroom sink, and the exertion made me need to lay down for an hour.  I took a nausea med before walking but managed two walks that day of approx. 75-100 ft each time. My nose was congested and I could feel my sinus's draining in my face once I started getting up and moving around. I did some small face lymph massage on myself to encourage this.   People moving around too fast near me was disorientating, videos on my phone were more movement than I could handle. 

Recovery Day 5: Washed myself again, did some small walks around the ward.  I was discharged around 6pm. My face was stuffy, congested but when I woke in the morning I was breathing through my nose. The discharge doctor changed my PPI while I was in the hospital so I was told to keep taking the new PPI instead of my old one. People moving too fast near me made me a little dizzy/blurry vision, but I was feeling surprisingly good. I was eating every 3 hours, smaller portions than usual. I took another anti nausea med before taking the trip home from the hospital. I had rented a walker to help me get to my room, but actually didn't really need it.  We were staying in a hotel. I set up my bed with 6 pillows so I could sleep sitting up. I put my comfort TV show on but couldn't sleep. I was having hypnic jerks and each time I felt myself nodding off, I would feel my chest falling in, and see blackness coming in and startle myself awake. I felt very anxious being away from the nurses in case of any issues. I asked my husband to sit with me and just watch while I fell asleep to be sure I was ok. These are apparently after-effects of the anesthesia. 

Recovery Day 6 - 14 : Lots of congestion cleared at the hotel. I slept with a humidifier a few feet from me, highly recommend you use one if you live in a dry climate. Watched a lot of movies, pottered around the hotel, used a shower chair for the first couple of days. Woke up inhaling stomach acid one night and that did not help my anxiety with trying to fall asleep.  The next night I had developed a dry cough, shortness of breath and pressure in my chest so we went to the ER.  After lots more poking, chest x-rays and blood tests, it was determined to be acid reflux, likely due to the new PPI.   Those first few days after discharge really felt quite euphoric.  I felt desire for the first time in a long time, journaled a lot. Showering was tiring, but made me feel much better each day. 

I did have a small reaction to eating a very salty (Chinese food) meal around day 10.  I got very hot, twitchy, shaky and sweaty.  It felt like a dump of adrenaline, the shaking was involuntary and I was concerned that it would progress to a seizure so we called 911.  They measured my blood pressure, sugars and heart rate and saw no issues so I chose to not go back to the ER.  Within an hour it had passed. I've shared this with my endo but not heard back yet. This was something I had a couple of times prior to surgery, but due to being post-op, I didn't want to take any risks. 

Today (13 days post surgery), I am taking 650mg Tylenol when I wake up and an hour or two before bed.  I still can't bend over to pick things up, and reaching for things will hurt my head momentarily.  My nose is open and I can sleep with my mouth closed, but I still have some mucus running down the back of my throat so I'm mouth breathing during the day.   I am sleeping 10-13 hours at night (no naps, but I do rest a lot during the day).  My appetite varies, but the constant is that when I get hungry, I want food immediately.  I have someone to help cook for me, but if you don't, please stock up with easy to eat snacks. I have eaten a lot of fruit cups, toast, baby oatmeal,  fruit, granola bars, bananas, jello, banana bread, easy to make sandwiches, juice, reheated soup, cookies. Strawberries taste like heaven.  Coffee made me quite anxious, I've switched to decaf for the foreseeable. I have a chemical/metal taste on my back teeth, which I think may be GERD/Tylenol related. As long as I don't move my head around too fast, my headache is fine.  My eyes get tired easily, so podcasts and movies I can listen to are relaxing, but too much time on my phone will give me a headache.  Energy wise, I am just shlepping around the house.  When I have a busy couple of hours (e.g. tidy up, shower AND go to the store) it can really wipe me out later and I \*need\* to rest.

Lunch - chicken salad mayo bap, cheese, tomatoes and a kiwi 10/10 (this was really yum)

Snack - ADULT LUNCHABLES, crackers, jam, ham and cheese 11/10 (I really enjoyed this combo, so 100% going to be a new staple)

Dinner - chicken, gravy, sweet potato mash and broccoli 8.5/10 (has the whole thing of mash which was a massive challenge and left me full but proud of myself!)

Dessert - M&S shortbread tree, my new mini Tony's and some fudge 11/10 (fudge is a massive fear but I really enjoy it, but only a little as it is VERY sweet. also Tony's is just the best, the plain milk was actually my fav out of the three, then the sea salt caramel and then the pretzel. But honestly plain milk was divine).

Snack - Jasons sourdough, butter and strawberry jam 10/10 (panicking now as I LOVED this but also love my crumpets and can't decide which I will have each night lol, stupid ED brain, thinking of flipping a coin each evening to decide?)

Snack - muesli with whole milk, yogurt, banana, strawberries with an oat crunch biscuit. 8/10 (oats are definitely better, but the biscuit was nice!)

Proud of myself for today, because it was hard. Very hard. I struggled so much with indecision, trying to decide the 'best' option. Should I have sourdough or crumpets?, then what should I have on my chocolate plate?, should I challenge rice pudding? but what about muesli with whole milk? digestive or oat crunch? and then my head starts playing but your having digestives tomorrow, your having crumpets tomorrow etc. That is why I really really really appreciate the input I am getting from one of you and locking in the plan for each day to meet my energy but also challenge myself to some variety and fears that aren't going to completely derail me - YAY! Like today I did well with variety, for me anyways! I had sourdough, muesli, ham and jam with crackers and new chocolates but also know I stuck to favourites my oats, and my lunch. 

I also have gotten a little sad this evening because I am really enjoying how I am eating at the minute, despite my fullness tonight kinda panicking me! But I am worried I will have to go back to restriction like after I ‘recover’ and that I need to make the most of all these foods because soon I won’t be allowed to eat them, I know mostly this is the ED talking but I also know realistically this is a weight gain meal plan and I won’t be able to eat like this forever and it kinda scares me mentally how I will adapt without getting carried away with restricting! 🫣

I am really, really, really looking forward to getting away from dad tomorrow night. I can cook in freedom, shower for as long as I want, I won't have to listen to him making comments all evening about god knows what. I think that is one of my main motivators for recovery, to get well enough to move out, get my own space and away from this toxic environment. I was thinking of maybe doing polls, on here, to help when indecision is really bad? but then I also don't want to be annoying! anyways proud of me today, just have to be consistent!

One reading for one question is only 5$. I will pull three cards for you and explain what I feel coming from the cards. 

🔴 The readings are delivered within 24h, but usually I take less than that. I just need to have time enough to cleanse my energy before doing your reading! 

 Payments are upfront via buy me a coffee/PayPal.

🔴 Please, check my profile before requesting a reading, so you can read my reviews and reading ethics.

Feel free to DM me for more details, questions or just to connect.

Looking for warmer weather (I spent three years in Australia and miss the year-round green and palm trees.) My daughter has a beauty-related business she's trying to grow. Florida is one is our finalist states for various reasons including the ease of her acquiring her license there. We're kind of wavering between Jacksonville, Tampa,  Naples and are open to other suggestions. 
Also how to avoid rentals that are roach infested? That's one thing we've not dealt with much and it freaks us out. Apartments have reviews but what to look for in houses?
Side question.. Is Cuban coffee available only in Miami area or all around the state? 
Thanks all. ",0,1767135850.0,AskFlorida,43,0.36,False
