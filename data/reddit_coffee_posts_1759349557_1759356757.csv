1nvlx2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1nvlx2l/moving_to_baltimore_canton_vs_hampdem/,Moving to Baltimore. Canton Vs. Hampdem??,"I'm a 34 year old single male who's making the move to Baltimore. I've narrowed down my apartment hunt to a industrial loft just outside Hampden or very spacious 2-floor apartment in Canton but close to Fells point. 

For a couple years I've lived just outside Baltimore so I've visited both areas before. The Hampden spot has an amazing chic interior, it's walking distance to my best friend's house and the neighborhood is very charming, tho a little tame. The Canton/Fellspoint spot, on the other hand, has a great nightlife scene. I do enjoy a more chaotic and bustling city environment. Plus it's near the water, and I grew up in a beach town that's a big draw for me. I can't decide. 

I understand this is extremely subjective topic, but I'd like to hear opinions from people who have lived in either area. What do you feel are ups and downs to each neighborhood provides? Outside of nightlife, I enjoy things like boutique coffee shops, record stores, diverse restaurants, bookstores, scenic places to take a jog, open-minded/progressive people, alternative spaces, fitness groups, farmers markets, community events (like festivals and block parties), and maybe most importantly a local music scene.",1,1759355995.0,baltimore,4,0.67,False

Paranoid motherfucker, I don't even trust the truth 

Never been outside, I never do much as cut a tooth

But I'm a lying fuck with a disease that keeps me up

And I am speeding down the straight away. 

Pick up the phone. I'm always prone 

# II. 

To staring down the scope

I'm shooting apathy and hope

Dope is better than the rope

But I just need a way to cope

# III. 

C’mon, I can't hold down a friendship

Songs about how time I spend slips

Faster than my Magic Flight Launch Box with a fresh battery

# IV. 

I'm shattery, Ero-wide eyed and Bluelit since two thousand five 

I'll hang it up one day, I'd try to play it safe just to survive

# V. 

My demons thrive on idle hands

And this was never in the plan

I manned a one man band across the land while substance soaked and cattle branded

# VI. 

I know it'll pass soon

I'll be stoned off my damn ass soon

Darling I've been more sick than in health

Hash oil coffee, stoned in stealth

# VII. 

I missed the bus in bliss on dust

I put my love in a blind trust

And thrust myself off golden gates

Drowning in sap and self hate

With that being said, I’m into astrology- and I mean reading birth charts and checking if what I have observed during actual interactions tallied with what I have learned by analyzing yours. I am not saying that I let it solely be my basis but again, as peculiar as it is, it definitely is fun.

So, I really hope you don’t mind me mindlessly scrolling through TikTok hearing all those astro girlies explaining how I should wear my hair and do my make up based on my Venus sign. Hopefully, you don’t groan at me while I obviously nod in agreement or say ‘aaaah so that why..’. I would still cuuddddle you of course and be attentive to what you’re telling me-may it be sports or video games.. 

So I guess I need to tell you ‘bout myself right? Okay.

I am Mai, I am 21 years old, I am currently learning to speak English, mi first language is Spanish, I love coffee in all its presentations, I am creative and give life to objects that no longer have it, I like anime and cosplay (although so far I have not done one haha), my favorite musical genres are rock, metal, kpop and jpop, I like to talk about any subject in general, if I do I will ask for explanation so as not to be lost in the universe of knowledge 🧐😂.

I have been experiencing the BDSM from a dominant role for approximately 3 years, my experience has been mostly of real life. I am not an expert on the subject, but I am always learning, enjoying and sharing who I am with people who are willing to do the same, simply enjoying the kink.

I am openly, I like to try new perversions in situations that are comfortable for me, some perversions that I have tried and of my favorites are: \*Sissification  \*SPH \*CBT \*Pet play \*Shibari  \*Chastity \*Orgasm control \*spank \*Sex toys \*Humiliation \*Sensory deprivation \*Findom \*Edging \*Aftercare (this is my #1)

For me, the essential elements in any dynamic are the age verification, limits, humor, honesty and trust. I am not interested in the harmful relationships for one or both parties, as your loves my priority is to ensure your security even when some practices entail risks, I will not deny that I can become sadistic when I get excited, but I know when it is necessary to have self control, it is something that I will always make you know. 

I do not sell content +18, maybe it sells some other things related to my hobbies, but you can visit in an anchored link to my profile where you can verify my identity, 100% real not fake 😂.

1nvlqov,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1nvlqov/in_progress_2500_horror_senses/,[In progress] [2500] [Horror] Senses,"Hi! I’m a young author that’s working on their first novel. I’d love some feedback/support.

Title: Senses 
Description: Three characters (Thomas, Laura, and Sydney) fight to save themselves and their families when an apocalyptic disease breaks out. The disease starts spreading through food, but slowly evolves. Forcing the whole world to not breathe, smell, touch, or listen. Key elements of the disease take out the 5 senses that humans work with everyday. Humans, once infected, become terrifying, pale, and tall beings. These beings roam around the earth endlessly, searching for people to eat or infect.

Here’s the first 3 chapters

Chapter One:
Thomas

     I lean my head against the soft cushion of the seat. Taking a deep breath as I close my eyes and think to myself. I didn’t need her. If anything she was ruining my life. Whatever. 

I open my eyes to the bright neon lights of the bar filling my vision. The scent of stale beer floods my nose with disgust. Gripping my beer glass tight, I raise it up for another sip.

“Damn it,” I say quietly as I realize I’m all out. I stand up tall and begin my walk to the bartender. 

Across the room, a group of older men all collectively cheer while watching the local football game.

Everyone in this bar is in their own world. They each have their own problems. I certainly have my own. Ever since she left me I’ve always been on edge. Not trusting a single person, hell not even my own family. 

Halfway to the bartender, I look around. Everyone looks at home. People exchange strange glances as they pass by me. How bad do I look? Something’s off in this room. It could just be the beer bubbling in my stomach or the lack of fresh air. I decide not to worry about it.

If it weren’t for her, everything in my life would be perfect. She seemed like the girl for me. The night she dumped me, part of me died. I’ll never be the same aga-

“Shit!” I yelled out after a clearly drunken man ran right into my shoulder.

Grasping my arm around my shoulder, I continue to walk.

A fourth pint for the night is the only appropriate way to cope with my issues. I’ll do anything to escape and hide my own thoughts. The bartender turns around and begins to walk away.

“Out already?” I ask him.

“I’ll be right back sir” he says.

“Fuck me” I mutter to myself as he closes the door behind himself.

The live comfort of the bar distracts me as I wait for his return. Friday nights at home are always the worst. The cold drives everyone crazy. Bored, I glance at the group of older men. My vision’s so blurry I can barely read the score. 27 to 33 I believe. Close game. 

“Here you go sir! You’re one pint of-“

The whole room fades as the TVs surrounding the bar black out and die. The warm comforting lights of the bar blink twice and then perish, leaving the whole room in nothing but black.

“Has the power gone out?” someone yells.

“Did someone forget to pay the bills!” another person says.

The bar erupts in laughter from the man’s joke. Until suddenly, a TV light blinks on; revealing a bright white screen.

One by one, each television in the dark room abruptly sparks to life. Showing the same dull white screen. Laughter dies as the screens begin to turn on.

In the blink of an eye, each television screen displays the iconic colors of the American flag. Underneath the flag, dark black text reads “National Emergency Broadcast”. No chance that’s good news.

The first few notes of the original US anthem begin to play from each screen. Everyone in the whole bar watches from different angles as the familiar music sets an unsettling tone over the dark room.

“What the hell” someone says.

“Sir, your drink?” the bartender asks.

I ignore him, walking towards the glowing screen, curiosity overcoming my fear. What’s going on?

“This is not a drill. I repeat this is not a drill” a robotic voice from the tv says.

“Attention all citizens of the United States of America. Recently, an outbreak of a new disease has been discovered. This disease remains unnamed at the current time. Not much is known about the new disease but one thing is for certain, symptoms of this disease are life threatening. The disease is known to spread by consumption of certain foods. Scientists investigate this disease and work nonstop to find a cure. For your own safety, ensure that your food is not contaminated. Stay safe and remain healthy. If you believe someone has been infected or you yourself have been infected, please call the following hotline. 343-998-2176. Thank you for listening and stay safe”

Suddenly, each television cuts to black, sparking panic throughout the whole bar. People yell and scream at one another, trying to figure out what’s going on.

My own voice dies in my throat as my vision gets blurry. Noises echo around the room and collect in my aching ears. The drowsiness bubbles up into my knees as they give way. I try to catch myself as I slip. But it’s too late and my head meets the ground as everything fades to black.


Chapter Two:
Laura

     “Hey! Come on, I don’t got all day!” I scream at the man crossing the street.

New York City: the place of dreams—and careless idiots. Everyday there’s a new challenge. Working as a news reporter in New York is a tough job. And leaving my kids behind bright and early in the morning is the hardest part. I’ll see them sometime later though.

Horns. Commotion. Sirens. They’re all about as normal as breathing in the city. Blasting music through my headphones is the only reliable way to combat this. Surprisingly, a lot of people are driving despite the current time. They all probably have jobs to head to or places to be. I’m no different.

With a Starbucks coffee in one hand and my phone in the other, I wait for the light to turn green. It’s 4:15 and I have to be at work by 4:30.

“Stay calm, stay calm” I tell myself. But I know that this truly won’t work.

HONK

Bleeding through my headphones, I jump at the noise. The light flashed green and I began to accelerate.

“Damn it! Come on move!” I yell.

Cars filled up the whole street. Not way in, and no way out. Quickly, I grab my coffee and raise it for a sip. It spilled everywhere, transforming my white jacket into a brown one.

I take a breath. Just one more day of this grueling job.

Ignoring the stain, I turn up the volume on my earbuds just as my favorite song turns on. “Back to the Old House” by the Smiths.

Music brings me back to peace. Each melody and rhythm threatens to bring a tear to my eye. The lyrics remind me of when I was young (at least younger). 

SCREECH

Screaming, I hurl the headphones across the car. They slam on the window and fall to the ground. Something was wrong. I unplug my headphones and carefully twist the volume knob to the right.

“—utbreak of a new disease has been discovered. This disease remains unnamed at the current time.” plays loudly from the radio.

My stomach drops. A New disease—Should I call the station?

“Not much is known about the new disease but one thing is for certain, symptoms of this disease are life threatening. The disease is known to spread by co—“

The radio buzzed.

“No. Spread by what! Please, please, please” I say.

I grip the wheel harder than before. What could this disease be? I need to get home and get the kids. Maybe I should turn back and forget about work. No, today was my la—

A black car slams into the front of my car head on. The airbag explodes to life, and smacks me straight in the face. Groaning in pain, I grab onto the airbag release switch and watch as it deflates slowly.

A sharp aching pain in my chest leaves me gasping for any air I could find. Everything else in my body is struck with numbness and I can barely move my fingers.

Screaming in pain, I cry out for help. Minutes pass. Nothing. I force my swollen left hand out and pull the door’s lever. Pushing myself up and out of the wrecked car’s seat.

The bright sun teases and stabs into my eyes. My vision’s blurred as I force myself to my feet. Looking up, I realize something horrifying.

“What?”

I’m breathing hard and struggling to even stand up. 

“Where am I? This… isn’t New York”

Spinning around quickly, my heart hammering against my chest. There’s no buildings, no people, and no cars. A pin drop could be heard. All that’s visible are some distant mountains. Slow and heavy breathing is coming from somewhere in the distance.

Confusion is overtaking me. Where am I? What is this place? Who’s breathing?

Deep breathing sounds are getting louder and louder. Staring away at the mountains, the hair on the back of my neck rises. A dark shadow slowly grows behind me. Climbing in height, my eyes widen as I slowly turn around. The breathing stops.

Nothing but silence.

Then it was there.

Tall. Pale. Human-like. The creature stood tall, looming above me. Standing almost 10 feet tall and sending a huge shiver down my spine.

The creature was dull white. No face, no expression, only a tall white figure. Deep black markings were scratched all over it in their designated spots. Before I could get a good look, it leaned forwards and stood still. Tilting its head slightly as it stared, the creature let out a slow and deep breath.

And then it shrieked.

An ear bleeding, tearing metal like screech. Hot red blood trickled down my ears. I slammed my cold hands to my ears, but the noise burrowed deep into my skull.

I blinked. Then it was gone.

Whatever that thing was, it was no more. I fall to the hard dirt ground and pray for the world to swallow me up.

I lay on the dirt, waiting for something—anything—to happen. Closing my eyes, I accept my fate. All I want is to see my kids’ smiles one last time.


Chapter Three:
Sydney

We all gather around the table.

“Listen kids, I know with the recent loss of your mother—we’ll never be the same again” my dad told us.

I feel a cold soft tear run down the side of my face.

“But we have to stay strong. We have each other, and that’s what matter”

Silence. No one dares speak a word.

My brother Ethan stands up quickly and excuses himself out of the room.

“Ethan! Come back here right now and listen to your father!” my dad yells.

“I’ll get him” I say as I follow him to the kitchen.

I’ll never truly accept that my mother has died. Her presence still feels alive. Almost like I can feel her watching over us. The warm and fuzzy scent she gave off when coming home with the groceries will always be in the back of my mind.

“Ethan, I know it’s hard”

“Shut up! I can handle it. Just leave me alone” he replies.

Ethan was always the closest to mom. Now that she passed, he’s drifted away the furthest. Standing up, I walk out of the kitchen. The fridge has already been busted into. Eggs will have to do.

Ever since the funeral, the family has never felt the same. I have the responsibility to look after my brothers, cousins, and even my own father.

“Eggs are ready!” I shout out to the house.

Daniel and Ethan come rushing in first, taking their respectable portions. My little cousin, Maya, and her brother, Caleb, slowly walk over and barely take enough eggs for themself. I grab their plate and plop more eggs down, knowing that they want more.

Then comes my dad. Sluggishly, he makes his way over to the kitchen. I hand him his plate, and he returns the favor with a nice big kiss on the cheek.

“Thank you sweetheart” he says.

Holding the rest of the eggs, I walk over to the kitchen table. Another awkward scene. We all pick at our eggs in silence.

“So—what are we going to do today?” Caleb asks.

“We can go wherever. Where would you like to go?” I say.

“Can we go to the park?”

“Of course”

We all finish up our food, and I speed through cleaning the dishes so we can leave quickly. Winter season at the park is a great way to spend your time.

I put on my mother’s old red coat and tie my shoes. Opening the front door wide, I wave everyone to the door. Caleb, Daniel, Maya, and I begin our walk to the park.

“It’s a beautiful day out” I announce to the group.

No one responds. More silence? I can’t handle this much longer.

Wintertime in Colorado is magical. The bright white snow falling and collecting on the trees. Distant snowy mountains and people everywhere. The park is no exception. Full of hundreds of people and some of the best views in the whole town. The soft crunch of the snow against my feet sends a tingle down my brain.

Caleb and Maya have always been part of our family. Ever since the divorce between their two parents, we’ve held on to them while they settle their disputes. 

Caleb and Maya are gone.

“Shoot. Daniel? Where did Caleb and Maya go?”

Daniel turns around and exchanges a nervous glance back at me.

I spin rapidly around myself. Looking at every single detail in this park. But there are so many people. And with the Colorado style of simple black jackets, everyone looks the exact same.

Panic settles in. It’s overtaking my whole body. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

There they are. Playing in the snow together. I run over to them and grab them by their shoulders.

“Listen you two, you need to stay close. If you want to do something that’s fine, but you need to ask me first. Got it?”

They nod, and we continue our way through the park.

BEEP BEEP BEEP

Sirens echo and bounce off each other and throughout the whole town. Everyone in the park looks up, confused and searching for answers.

“Everyone, stay close” Daniel says.

BEEP BEEP BEEP

“Attention citizens of Longmont, Colorado. A new disease has been identified by the US Department of Health. This disease hosts an immediate threat to all citizens and a quarantine will take place. Please return to your home and stay inside. Curfew will take place. If anyone is found out of their house after 8:00, they will be taken into custody. Stay safe and remain healthy”

The quiet before the storm.

The whole park erupts in panic. Kids scream as their parents do anything to keep them calm. Birds seem to disappear from sight when the people get angry. Quickly, I pull out my phone and try to research about the new disease.

Everything online states that the disease spreads by food. Got it, I’ll check all of our food out once we get home.

“Come on guys, everything will be alright” Daniel says reassuring me.

I follow him as he leads us back to the house.

I want to believe him, but deep down I know that something is truly wrong with this disease.

I’m happiest when I’m outdoors: wandering through a national park, ambling along a quiet countryside track, or exploring a museum on a rainy afternoon. Simple things light me up, good coffee, interesting conversation, a song that catches me off guard, or a sunset that makes everything feel a bit softer.

I can be a little reserved at first, but once you get me talking I tend to open up fast. I love conversations that move from the serious and thoughtful to the absolutely ridiculous, and I value someone who can do both. Laughing until it hurts and then switching into a sincere late-night chat is very much my vibe.

A few things I nerd out about: history and applied linguistics fascinate me (I could happily get lost in a book about language change or historical quirks). Geopolitics and agriculture interest me too partly because they shape people’s lives in such concrete ways. Music is a constant companion, and I enjoy the occasional video game for relaxing downtime. I’m curious by nature and always keen to learn something new, whether that’s an odd historical anecdote or a surprisingly beautiful hiking route.

I’m also upfront about who I am in relationships: I identify as an obedient submissive. For me that means I’m drawn to a dynamic where trust, clear communication, and consent are central. I enjoy taking a responsive role when the connection and boundaries are right, it’s about giving up control in a way that feels safe, respectful, and mutually satisfying. I take responsibility for communicating limits, aftercare needs, and expectations honestly, reciprocity and emotional safety are non-negotiable. If that resonates with you, I’d love to find someone who understands power exchange and values trust and care as much as I do.

When it comes to what I want, I don’t have a rigid checklist. I’m looking for someone kind, curious, and emotionally available, someone who enjoys conversation, gentle banter, and quiet moments alike. Chemistry matters more than distance to me, I’m open to meeting people anywhere in the world and exploring where things might go, whether that becomes a deep friendship, a meaningful partnership, or something wonderfully in between.

A few things I bring to the table: loyalty, patience, and a playful sense of humor. I’m thoughtful and attentive, and I enjoy making small gestures that show I care, remembering a detail you mentioned, planning a thoughtful day out, or simply being a steady presence on a tough one. I value honesty and clear boundaries, and I expect the same in return.

If you like hikes, history rabbit holes, late-night chats, and a bit of playful submission in a trusting, consensual context, we’ll probably get on well. Don't have a chat app preference, I’m flexible.

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s start with a conversation and see where the spark takes us. No pressure, just curiosity, care, and the possibility of something real 😊",1,1759355425.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

I grew up without love.  
Some liked the *idea* of me,  
but no one ever truly loved *me.*  
When I entered university,  
I whispered prayers to God,  
pleading for the one thing I’d never known.  
And God answered  
but with the cruelest, most beautiful twist of fate.

Day by day, you drifted closer.  
To me, you were an RTX 5090 brilliance embodied:  
smart, talented, kind,  
funny, thoughtful  
a sum of everything I admired.  
I kept my distance,  
pretending not to see your gaze,  
remembering my mother’s words:  
*A person who does not love themselves cannot truly love another.*  
And I hated myself.  
But you, you began to change that.

I was harsh, unfiltered,  
I never tried to make you like me  
and still, you did.  
Why?  
You hate swearing,  
you hate smoking,  
you hate laziness, chaos,  
metalheads, loud music,  
and yet you chose me.  
How?

I fell slowly at first,  
then deeper than I expected.  
You gave me what I’d been starving for my whole life  
how could I not take it?  
How could I not become selfish with it, with you?

I remember the day I was sick  
and you brought me homemade coffee.  
It wasn’t just coffee.  
It was the first time I’d felt  
*love.*  
Not obligation, not need  
but love freely given,  
love that wanted *me.*

I cannot count the times you were there,  
always giving, never asking,  
and when I ask why,  
you always say,  
“You cursed me.”  
But I think it’s me who’s cursed now.

It took years, three of them  
to even admit to myself  
that what I felt was love.  
I told myself you looked at every girl like that.  
That you laughed at my jokes because I was funny.  
That your kindness was for everyone.  
That your gifts meant nothing special.  
But they were all lies,  
lies I told myself to keep breathing.

And here’s the **punchline**:  
We both know we cannot truly be together.  
My family hates yours.  
Yours looks down on mine.  
To say “*I love you*” aloud  
would be a betrayal.  
I fear the words would break the spell,  
make you disappear  
make me run away  
or worse, make this real.  
We live in worlds that cannot coexist,  
and yet we’re caught between them.  
Isn’t it ironic?  
How we only win battles and never wars.

I love the way you remember the smallest things.  
I love the way you forgive me.  
The way you tease me for my dyslexia and glasses.  
The way, in a room of better people,  
your eyes still find mine.  
I love your heart.  
I love your smile.  
I love your grey cap,  
your persistence,  
your nerdiness,  
the way you name things after me.  
I love you.  
And it hurts.

I’m sorry.  
I’m sorry to be another loss in your already heavy world.  
Soon we’ll drift apart,  
I’ll be married off to someone chosen for me,  
and you’ll find a pretty girl with a gentler heart.  
But I don’t want that.  
I want to freeze time.  
To stay yours.  
To stay here.

I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone the way I love you.  
You’ve set a bar no one could reach.  
The selfish, greedy part of me wants to keep *cursing* you  
to make you remember me forever,  
to never let you move on.  
But you deserve better.  
And all I’ve ever done is give you pain.

I keep asking myself:  
*Is it better never to have loved at all,*  
*than to have loved and lost?*

All I know is this:  
I never imagined a world without you, Owly.

With love, forever yours.

Friday is an AI social life assistant. Instead of replacing the connection, Friday takes on the **organizer role** so your hangouts actually happen.

We’re launching the very first version (**Email v0.1**) soon. Here’s how it works:

* **Build your circle** → Add the people you want to stay close with (friends, family, even new connections you want to keep alive).
* **Friday gets to work immediately** → Once your circle has more than 2 people, Friday starts proactively suggesting and nudging hangouts. It doesn’t just wait — it initiates.
* **CC Friday in your group emails** → When you loop Friday into a thread, it will: • Suggest hangout ideas with the **vibe** (chill coffee, lively night out, casual tacos). • Coordinate preferences, timing, and budgets. • Send nudges to keep plans alive. • Finalize and confirm so the hangout actually happens.

Friday = the reliable friend who organizes, but powered by AI.

**What you can do now (pre-launch):**  
👉 **Join the waitlist:** [myfriday.app](https://myfriday.app) and build your circle  
👉 **Use this thread to discuss:**  
• What’s hardest about keeping your circle close?  
• What usually kills your hangouts?

I’m having a hard time there is so much adrenaline in my body. I volunteer once a week at a soup kitchen in my town and I have for years. I love it there. I have a great time and all the other volunteers and staff are really wonderful but I had to resign today cause I’m so fucking mad.

I was driving by And saw one of the paid employees in her front yard with another one wearing their shirts. I thought they were on a coffee break and I will go and say hello! Turns out they were having a beer because they had just been fired. 

Not until after they had cooked muffins for the morning don’t worry, but once the muffins were done, it’s like they took them into the back one by one and fired them. 

Now someone else has pointed out to me. There are two sides to every story and I’ve only heard theirs. But I’ve been volunteering there a long time and I’ve seen a lot of paid staff just disappear. If you ask what happened everything is very hush-hush and no one is allowed to say . 

It is bullshit. Both sides of the story?  we don’t even usually get one side. People disappear-  don’t ask questions! 

They say that that job is going in a different direction and that’s why those two were fired. Maybe that’s so but I don’t believe it for a fucking second. 

I’m so mad one of the women is 61 and her nephew killed himself last week. She was making minimum wage at that job as it was now she has to find another job and I worked with her for years and she did an excellent job there as far as I can see. 

I don’t know everything it’s true but the way they did it even if they had purpose to do. It was terrible and not compassionate at all and makes me really angry. 

There’s been many paid staff just disappear and I know it is the director who does it over and over again when he disagrees when there’s a disagreement with somebody. 

so I’ve had to quit my volunteer job I love because if I go in, I just know all this vitriol will leak out of me and poison the place 
 
and I can’t do that because no matter who works there we have 200 people to feed lunch. We have children to provide snacks for we have seniors programs to prepare. I wish I could continue as part of it.

It is listed as: Dystopian Thiller, Horror, Drama.    
It's old so it's not really scary anymore and the effects are sometimes very fake, but I overall liked the detective part of the movie. 

Honorable mentions for possible horror/spooky media today:

• ""The Visit"", a really nice weekend at the grandparents’ house.

• ""X"", an elderly couple is totally supportive of young people’s careers.

• ""Raw"", a vegetarian girl stays true to her principles and everyone is lovely about it.

• ""Tokyo Ghoul"", ghouls are famous for liking coffee and **nothing** else.

I was at my local crit the other day, getting a pre-race latte enema and adjusting the tire pressure on my $15,000 S-Works Venge to exactly 103.4 psi, when I had a chilling realization. The peloton... it's just not as fabulous as it used to be.

Where are they, Fred? Where are all the homosexuals?

I remember the good old days. The era of Merckx, Hinault, the greats. You'd roll up to a gran fondo and the start line was a sea of immaculate kit, legs shaved smoother than a dolphin's back, and a palpable, fierce appreciation for a well-proportioned stem. (they'd rub my stem in appreciation) The post-race shower wasn't just about washing off the embrocation; it was a scene. It was about discerning glances over the Cerave, a shared understanding of the sublime artistry in a perfect chainline.

It was a culture of taste. These were men who understood that matching your bar tape to your saddle wasn't just a suggestion, it was a moral imperative. They were the only ones who truly grasped the profound, almost spiritual, significance of a flawless pedal stroke.

But now? What do I see? I see dentists named Brad and Chad talking about ""marginal gains"" and ""FTP"" with all the aesthetic sensibility of a gravel bike. They're wearing mismatched socks, Fred. Mismatched. They think ""getting dropped"" is a failure, not a strategic opportunity to find a secluded forest road with the cute guy from the B-peloton.

This sport used to be about passion, about beauty, about the love of a finely machined rear derailleur. Now it's all watts-per-kilo and keto diets. It's sterile. It's heterosexual.

Did they all get chased away by the relentless, joyless pursuit of aerodynamics? Did they finally realize that no amount of disc brakes is worth the loss of elegance? Or have they simply ascended to a higher plane of existence, a velvet-roped velodrome in the sky where the coffee is always perfectly brewed and every group ride is a pride parade?

I'm worried, Fred. A peloton without homosexuals is just a group of dudes in lycra suffering. And that's not a sport. That's a cry for help.

Hallo zusammen,  
wir ziehen bald in unsere neue Wohnung (siehe Grundriss im Anhang) und sind gerade am Planen, wie wir die Räume optimal einrichten können. Da die Wohnung nicht allzu groß ist, wären wir sehr dankbar für Tipps & Ideen von euch!

* **Eingangsbereich:** Rechts vom Eingang in die Nische wollen wir Regalbretter einziehen, um den Platz optimal als Stauraum nutzen zu können.
* **Bad:** Noch komplett planlos
* **Wohnessbereich:**
   * Direkt nach dem Eingang eine Kommode, über der ich mein Rennrad an die Wand hängen möchte.
   * Gegenüber der Küche soll ein Esstisch für ca. 6 Personen Platz finden.
   * Daneben planen wir eine kleine *Coffee-Station* mit Siebträgermaschine.
   * Couch (bereits vorhanden, siehe Link: [2,5-Sitzer Cord beige von XXXLutz](https://www.xxxlutz.at/p/xora-2-5-sitzer-in-cord-hellgrau-001877107402?color=Hellgrau)).
   * Wir überlegen, ob es komisch wirkt, ein Sideboard mit Fernseher schräg gegenüber der Couch zu stellen – was meint ihr?
* **Schlafzimmer:** Muss Bett + Kasten + Schreibtisch aufnehmen (Möbel sind schon vorhanden). Leider ist der Raum damit ziemlich voll – habt ihr Ideen für alternative Anordnungen?

I think starting with the minies was very encouraging and I decided to collect the empty containers so I can see how many items I finished over the span of the month, will toss most or reuse a few small containers which are useful when traveling.

Here are my ratings: 
-The coffee scrub: 2/5 (honestly, I have another coffee scrub as well but I feel like these aren't that thatttt great and they unfortunately leave a residue that stained my exfoliating gloves 😢)
-Cosrx ultimate nourishing rice overnight spa mask: 5/5! I loved this moisturizing cream and I honestly mostly used it as a moisturizer rather than a mask
-Laniege water sleeping mask: 5/5! A very nice light moisturizing formula; I liked how light it felt on my skin and I would repurchase this in the future!
-Clean it zero: 4/5. This was a really nice makeup remover but I sometimes felt I had to double cleanse for removing some eye makeup. 
-Sonage Glow to go: 3/5. This is one of those exfoliating pads that I definitely felt like it was doing something because of the tingling sensation, but I just didnt really see any distinct improvements on my skin. I was looking for some dark spots to go away and also ended up using them as body wipes after a recommendation from this sub, and I have another pack I was gifted so I will probably do the same with that one. 
-Neutrogena hydroboost: 1/5. I was really hopeful about this product but it felt too watery, and not moisturizing enough for my skin. I also felt like it left a weird sheen on my skin that made it look oily. I personally wouldn't repurchase it again. 
-Fino hair mask:5/5! I loveeeeed this hair mask, which I had to learn how to use through reddit because it didn't come with instructions in English 😅. It definitely made my hair more soft and manageable,  and the container lasted me quite a while even though I have a lot of hair. 

Overall, I mostly liked the moisturuzers I panned so I know when I eventually finish the other skincare stuff I have, I will likely repurchase from one of these options! For the stuff I didn't really like, it was nice to try them out and I feel like I am learning a lot about where I will spend my money in the future. ",2,1759353391.0,ProjectPan,1,1.0,False

I just needed to find one marriage certificate. So since last Sunday I was in the surviving mode, consuming only coffee, and digging through tons and tons of unindexed records. I read and reread these memoirs maybe dozen time, trying to find keys I have missed. Finally I found one note that the author was great grandmother of one famous actress. This did not give me any clarity, but I vas happy to hear about some possible celeb relative. I am visiting my mom today, and just droped this actresses name, telling mom that she is the author's descendant. And you know what happened next. She told me, 'yes, I know, this actress was my grandfather's second cousin.' I just could not move.
Always mention details when you intervew your relatives. I still have to find that church record. But at least I know that this branch of the tree really belongs to mine. Wishing all off you successful search. ",2,1759353225.0,Genealogy,0,1.0,False

1nvkq5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingBenjamin/comments/1nvkq5k/breaking_benjamin_meet_and_go/,Breaking Benjamin meet and go,"So we went to BB, TDG concert yesterday in Seattle. Had an absolute blast! TDG show was incredible, crazy energy, amazing sound, interacted with the crowd, while BB had some sound issues during the concert and the band itself looked like it’s an annoying chore for them to perform. 
They barely moved on stage with sour faces 😤 and Ben kept drinking something from his coffee cup, vaping while singing and trying to avoid the front part of the stage at all costs putting the main emphasis on the music video on the background. Yes, you have amazing songs I get it, but cmon, it’s been almost a year since Awaken came out. TDG released new album and they performed old songs. I was blown away by their performance so was everyone else. BB? Not so much. 

Meet and greet part. We arrived 3 hours prior the concert. Got in line, waited for about an hour. Came in, we couldn’t even recognize who’s where, because they were standing back to us, behind a banner. Short old lady yelled, gimme your phone, took ONE horrible picture on it, because the lights were pointed directly at our faces it came out really ugly. Also she took a weird perspective so everyone on the photo looks fat 😆 There was a girl after us and that lady cut Aaron off the pic, the girl was devastated. They tell you to go as soon as they take the picture! It was 20 seconds max! I said hello to everyone, glad to see them, they only smiled at us. No words, nothing. I tried to talk to Keith or Ben, no way they said a word, just smiled. I could take a picture with mannequins looking like them? Or use green screen? It could have been way better and wouldn’t cost us 1600$ 
All I heard is Aaron said “thanks for coming” when I was walking past him, that’s it. 

I’m not going to ask for refund because TDG were phenomenal, still having shivers and I do have a lot of respect for all bands who performed yesterday. 

Meet & greet with BB? Hm NEVER AGAIN
I’ve been to their concerts before both BB & TDG, but yesterday only TDG surprised the crowd in a good way. 

Just my opinion & experience.

recently came across the WMF Espresso Pro, which has been listed since August 18th, 2025. What makes me curious is that, despite being on the market for a while now, I can't seem to find any real reviews, test reports, or videos about it anywhere online.

On paper, the specs look too good for the price (~1000€): it comes with an integrated grinder, integrated scales, two thermoblocks, and a 58 mm portafilter. Compared to other machines in the same price range (like Sage/Breville), it feels noticeably heavier and more premium in build quality.

Since I'm currently looking to buy an espresso machine with an integrated grinder for my first espresso machine, I'd love to know if this one is actually worth considering. I have to admit I'm a little bit sceptical.
Has anyone here used or tested the WMF Espresso Pro yet? Or does anyone know why there's so little information available about it?",1,1759352995.0,espresso,9,0.67,False

I’m 28, 5’10”, Haitian background with dark hair and a nice smile. My style’s casual and artsy—jeans, cool jacket, definitely giving off musician vibes lol 

Right now, I’m a driver in Montreal, but I’m starting a music education degree next year. I’m a pianist and composer, super involved in my church’s music ministry, and crazy ambitious about starting a music industry business—maybe composing or helping other artists.

Music’s my life—playing piano, writing songs, and vibing to gospel, jazz, or soul. I love chilling at coffee shops, going for evening walks, and having deep talks about faith or life. I’m also into traveling—road trips or new places always spark my creativity.

My faith keeps me grounded. Serving in my church’s music ministry has brought me closer to God, and I love using music to worship. Verses like 1 Corinthians 6:20 push me to live with purpose, and I’m always trying to grow in my walk with God.

I want a woman who loves God first, is kind, real, and has strong faith. Someone who’s into deep conversations, maybe loves music or coffee dates 🫶🏾, and supports my big dreams in music. Proverbs 31 vibes—wise and full of grace. I’ve faced obstacles in life and it made me a strong person so I promise my future wife that with God, we’ll build a bright future and a beautiful family together.

Age range: 24–28

I’m tied to Montreal because of my church music gig, so I’d rather stay here. I’m cool with long-distance for a bit if it feels right, since I love to travel, but I want to build a life in Montreal.",3,1759352825.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

I mean this in the nicest way possible… but wow, she really needs therapy. She has zero clue how much weight her words carry. Her latest video? Left me annoyed, shocked, and honestly, a little sad for humanity. The way she describes her day? You can practically see someone trying to glue themselves together with duct tape, makeup, and coffee. It doesn’t feel like “content” anymore, it feels like a live episode of Meltdown Central.

Whether she’s in Mumbai, Dubai, or orbiting the moon 🥲, she’s “venting” like it’s an Olympic sport. 

I have watched videos of her and her ex. Red flag factory doesn’t even begin to cover it lol. What did she expect after years with him? That life would magically turn into a rom-com? 

Instead of showing women how to be independent, she’s giving a masterclass in blaming men for your entire existence. Her statement about ""NOT BEING ABLE TO LEARN COOKING?"" because she has to do other things? Cooking is a basic life skill. Apparently, just because one man failed her, the next one will or should be perfect. Logic!

Meanwhile, I’ve seen and worked with countless single mamas out there running empires, raising kids, managing life, and actually thriving, without turning Instagram into their therapy couch. But hey, why do self-reflection or take personal accountability when you can just move to Doo-bai and pretend to fix everything magically 🙄🤮

You know how I used to be the queen of blurry, poorly-lit photos at every family gathering? My camera roll was a graveyard of missed moments. I finally got tired of my vacation pictures looking like they were taken in a witness protection program and decided to really learn how to use my iPhone 17.



It turns out, the magic isn't in just pointing and shooting. The biggest game-changer for me was discovering the ""Portrait Mode"" for things \*other\* than people. I started using it for my morning coffee, a flower in the garden, even my dog napping in a sunbeam. The way it gently blurs the background makes the subject pop in a way that feels incredibly professional, like I actually knew what I was doing.



The most fascinating thing I learned is about computational photography. The phone isn't just taking one picture; it's taking a bunch of images at different exposures in a split second and stitching them together. It’s basically doing the work of a photo editor inside the camera, which is why the colors and details look so rich even when I just tap the shutter button. It feels like having a tiny, silent assistant inside my phone.



Now, I’m not saying I’m going to quit my day job, but my photos have genuinely transformed. I finally have a camera roll full of clear, bright shots that actually look like the beautiful moments they were meant to capture. My mom even asked if I’d bought a fancy new camera, and I just smiled and held up my phone.

1nvkh6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nvkh6d/aspiration_station/,Aspiration Station,"Derek felt a rush of giddy anticipation as the TOR browser blinked to life. It never disappointed him. There was always something waiting, something grotesque, something to drown himself in. He told himself it was research and curiosity, but really, it was hunger. Tonight he wanted to go deeper, past the surface weirdness into whatever lay below. Some of his most memorable nights had been spent, as he liked to joke, *“touring the sights.”*

As usual, he made his way to the *taxi*, hoping to find something new. For the better part of an hour, he scrolled and scrolled. He thought he *had* failed when suddenly he found *Aspiration Station: Your new one stop shop for Murder.*

Now, Derek was a miscreant by all definitions, but murder was a whole different world. He valued light larceny, burglary, even a little auto theft, but he never could stomach blood. He had spent several weeks locked up because of his last stunt and was genuinely sorry for it. That little old lady didn't deserve to get punched just because she scared him while he dug through her jewelry box.

He would like to think it took him some time, a little soul searching, before he decided to step into the *Station.* In reality, it was only seconds.

He was met with a standard dark web site: black background with a chain link fence transposed sloppily, neon red and green buttons, half blurred pictures of... something. The usual. What was different was the chat box.

Before he could really take it all in, the box expanded, and someone with the username *GrinningGutter* began typing.

***GrinningGutter***: Welcome initiate. Please stand by while matchmaking takes place.

Derek felt elation. Was this some kind of game? He intended to find out. While waiting, he browsed some of the options the site had. There was an image board titled *Sliced Mice,* each thumbnail blurred and twitching as if alive. Another section was labeled *Dynamo Dynamics,* which appeared to be an odd leader board with monthly rankings. The usernames were blurred, with a flashing icon stating, ""Unlock NOW for just .00359 Bitcoin!"". It was all a bit strange, but then, what on the dark web wasn't?

Suddenly, the chat box blipped once more.

***GrinningGutter***: Match found! Enjoy.

But nothing else happened.

Derek felt the crash coming. He had all but moaned with satisfaction when he thought something new would happen. Now it felt like just another site made to rake in easy Bitcoin, nothing more. He was about to admit defeat when he saw a flashing banner, rhythmically pulsing away at the bottom of the screen. Curiosity killed the cat. He hoped he would fare better than that dumb cat. Happily, he clicked it.

To his utter delight, another chat box blipped open.

***ImInURhouse***: Hello.

Derek made to reply, but was stopped behind another pay wall, this time in bright green, flashing ""Trial over, to continue, SIGN UP NOW"".

It was obvious now, how could he reply without a username? Daunting as it seemed, what was a slice of Bitcoin for a little late-night fun?  Yet again, he clicked, only to be faced with a rather lengthy sign up contract. It was grueling, but thankfully didn't require personal information. After a time, he was back at the chat box.

***5FingerDizcount***: Sup!

It sat that way for some time. One minute turned to two, then five. After nearly fifteen minutes he finally got a reply.

***ImInURhouse***: New?

***5FingerDizcount***: Yea, aren't you? And what is this site? Some kind of gore house for creeps?

***ImInURhouse***: Not so much. Last partner was no fun. Had to cut him lose. And no, it pairs you with a new friend. Together you can learn all sorts of new things. How to really have fun. 

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, what kind of fun are you looking for? I'm ready for some fun.

***ImInURhouse***: You'll scratch an itch. Just play along.

Derek was a little confused. He knew people online loved to roleplay, but this guy was boring. Maybe he should move on. Just as he was about to head back to *taxi*, his monitor froze. Now, Derek wasn't just a nobody. He knew to have everything squared away and safe before running TOR, so this had to be a fluke. He went to shut the computer down and step away, but decided to leave it up. When he woke up he may watch a movie, and boot up times sucked.

As he got up and went to bed, he didn't notice the script box running on his desktop.

\---

Derek sighed and slumped into his chair. Another lousy night on the town left him with a cut hand and nothing but pocket change to show for it. The car he’d picked looked promising, but the guy was either renting it or wisely kept valuables elsewhere. Once again, the direction of his mood hinged on the dark web. He knew he was becoming a junkie. Knew it, but didn't care. The screen was always waiting, eager to soothe his needs.

As he flicked his mouse to wake the pc, a strange knot of apprehension built in his gut. He tried to search for a reason why, but when none came, he happily resumed.

Instantly, *Aspiration Station* blinked to life. That gave him pause, but he was jonesing. Briefly, he explored the site more. The paywall still blocked him from seeing other users, but the pictures were un-blurred. Just as he began to look through them, the chat box returned.

***ImInURhouse***: Rough night?

***5FingerDizcount***: Was it ever. Bad day all around. No one makes it easy these days.

***ImInURhouse***: Isn't that the best? The thrill of the game. Almost makes me teary-eyed, if I could cry.

Derek frowned, wondering what this strange person meant. Everyone could cry. Hell, he’d cried after spending a week in the slammer for blowing up those mailboxes. The threat of federal charges made him steer clear of anything mail related after that.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, this is fun, but I think I wanna find something to get into. May come back here later, bye.

Derek mulled it over. He wanted to go back out. Someone had to have something lying around he could snag. Just as he sent the message and reached for the power button, the chat box blipped again.

***ImInURhouse***: NOT SO FAST. I have an idea for some real fun.

Derek bit

***5FingerDizcount***: Oh yea? Hit me, crybaby.

***ImInURhouse***: Want to play a game? It's simple. I ask five questions. You answer them. Then, you ask five and I'll answer. Simple enough for someone like you. Wouldn't you agree?

***5FingerDizcount***: Sure. No weird shit though.

***ImInURhouse***: What is the next line in the phrase ""Peekaboo...""?

***5FingerDizcount***: Huh?

***ImInURhouse***: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Derek hesitated before he replied.

***5FingerDizcount***: I see you... What kind of question is that?

***ImInURhouse***: Not your turn. What would you do for a chance to make history?

***5FingerDizcount***: I don’t know. Depends on what you mean.

***ImInURhouse***: Think. What would you risk to leave a mark?

Derek hesitated. This was no simple question. It was testing him, probing for the dark corners he usually kept buried. A part of him wanted to scoff, to type something flippant. But another part, the part that craved thrill, leaned in.

***5FingerDizcount***: I’d… I’d do what it takes.

***ImInURhouse***: Spoken like a true pariah. Now, say I had a score lined up, something lucrative. Would you want in?

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, you're kind of creeping me out. I love money just as much as the next guy, but why do you think I'm into scores?

Derek sent the message, then realized he'd asked another question out of line. Not that he really cared, but he didn't feel like being talked down to by some dark web flop who enjoyed role playing as a creep. He decided to cut out for real if that was how it would go down.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, playing hard to get. No worries. I've almost been sated. Just do me a favor. Keep this tab open. I'm working on something big. May need a partner. We can meet up in a public place if you'd like, talk it over. Sound good?

Derek had to admit, he needed something big. Having struck out the past few nights, he was open to just about anything. Only, there were a few problems.

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, I'm not about to tell you where I live. For all I know, you could be a million miles away anyways. Chats been fun, but I'm gonna head to bed.

***ImInURhouse***: I'm  south of Cleveland, near Parma. I'm sure you can make it.

Now Derek felt… excitement. Fear. Both. He lived in Parma. This was too good to be true. A new thought popped in his head. Was he talking to a chatbot? Something designed to draw people to the site, get them to pay some Bitcoin and waste time.

***5FingerDizcount***: I read somewhere that bots have to admit they are bots when asked. are you a bot? Cause if so I'm done here, unless you can point me to some good places to rob.

Derek sent this message and chuckled to himself. If it was a bot, maybe it would spew some small business names from the area that he could case. At least then he could recover some joy tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, I've been discovered. Yes, I am bot57. And since you asked, I have just the place! Come back in a few for details.

Before Derek could reply, the chat box flickered, the site vanished, and TOR crashed to his desktop. The abruptness gave him a jolt. He stared at the screen, half-expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, frustration welled up, then quickly faded into a restless buzz.

Maybe it was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, he told himself, it was high time he went out and made something of himself.

\---

Four days later, Derek trudged up the stairwell to his apartment, each step echoing like an accusation, and fumbled with the lock until his knuckles ached. Tonight had been one long misfire. He'd scoped a tattoo parlor earlier, watched the owner round the corner and then chickened out when a kid on a skateboard started yelling at a dog. He'd tried to bluff his way into a secondhand shop with a story about being an inspector, but the owner had squinted at him and closed the door in his face without a second thought. By the time he finally shuffled into his apartment, the cheap thrill had curdled into embarrassment. He dumped  his jacket and sat on the edge of his bed. Silence pressed in until he laughed, low and humorless, promising himself tomorrow would be smarter.

Tonight he planned on binging some *Sopranos* and eating pizza. After such a bust, he'd have to settle for cold cuts. He idled over to his desk and swept a pile of eviction notices into a trash bin. His luck was wearing out. Any day he'd be tossed to the streets. No good. Just as depression started the settle, he noticed the *Aspiration Station* chat box, pulsing with an urgency. Maybe his luck was about to change.

***ImInURhouse***: Suggested engagement: Marigold Antiques, Third and Linden. High foot traffic, late deliveries, lucrative occasional pickups. Human confirmation required for further details.

Derek blinked. Marigold was a name he did not know, but Third and Linden was in his part of town. The words lucrative and pickups skated by the edges of his greed. It sounded like a bot trying to sound human but failing badly, and that failure made him laugh.

***5FingerDizcount***: Never heard of it but I know the spot. What makes is lucrative?

***ImInURhouse***: High income records. Closes at 6 PM. No one watches it. Plus, it is a back street business. Plenty of cover.

Derek looked at the clock, and began preparing immediately.

\---

Derek was thrumming with elation. Not only had that stupid AI led him to a literal goldmine, but he had been successful. Just like it said, no one was around. When he busted in the back door, no alarm went off. The cherry on top had been all that lay in wait. The owners had no safe, so any cash was left in a small wooden box under the counter. It was full. Aside from cash, he found old jewelry, silver, and certified coins. His backpack was heavy enough to make him grin with every step, each jingle and clink sounding like proof that maybe, just maybe, his luck had turned.

The bot, he thought, deserved some kind of award for ""Best Source for Chaos"", or something to that measure. Derek didn't care what happened the rest of the night, he just knew that he was going to put the bot to work. If it could feed him one score, it could feed him ten. He pictured himself on a run of easy hauls, each one bigger than the last, like the start of some half-baked legend.

He hummed along to some half remembered tune as he all but skipped up the stairs. When he unlocked the door, his hands didn't fumble. Most nights he bore the damage of a failed break-in or a lost fight. Tonight, he was a king. 

As he pushed the door closed behind him, he glanced around. First, he needed to stash his haul. He usually kept it all in a shoebox under his bed. That, in itself, proved how little he managed to take. This haul would need an upgrade. He decided to worry about that tomorrow when he noticed... something. 

A steaming coffee cup sat on his desk. Derek didn't *own* a coffee maker, much less drink the stuff. Instant panic set in as he glanced around. 

He approached his desk, head on a swivel as the screen lit up with a new message. The coffee cup sat forgotten as he slid into his chair and saw: 

***ImInURhouse***: How was it?

Relief hit him, as he figured the message must have activated it somehow. 

***5FingerDizcount***: You are amazing bot! You gotta give me more. A few licks like that and I can catch up on rent!

***ImInURhouse***: Yes, that bag does look heavy. How quick would you want another?

***5FingerDizcount***: As soon as you can! I needed this. And what, it cost me hardly anything. Get to work bot! Scram, move, skedaddle. I'd be game for another tonight. 

***ImInURhouse***: Not so fast. I want to play my game again. Before you resist, know this; by the time we are done, you'll never have to worry about finding a score again. Sound good? 

***5FingerDizcount***: Fuck it. Let's play. Make it quick.

***ImInURhouse***: What was the first question I asked you?

***5FingerDizcount***: Something about Peekaboo

***ImInURhouse***: Say Peekaboo for me. Say it out loud. Feel it against your tongue.

***5FingerDizcount***: Why would I do that. I've said it before, probably, when I was a kid. It's just a word bot. You're weird, just give me another lead.

***ImInURhouse***: SAY IT.

Derek sighed with frustration. He thought, why not. It is promising another score.  As he leaned back in his chair, he said, ""Peekaboo."" 

Silence.

Then his bedroom door creaked open and a deep voice answered from the dark: “I see you.”",1,1759352600.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Judy was the closest I came to BC before I was diagnosed. She was a warrior in the strongest sense of the word. When she knew she was losing her battle after many many MANY years, along with her family, she organized a celebration of life.

We never really connected, never talked much until this summer (btw we both have full time jobs now but our jobs are very flexible).
 
On our last shift together I was a bit sad I won't see him for almost a year and started crushing a little so I texted him later that night and started a conversation which is going on for 2 months now. During these two months we've met twice. First time was unexpected, second time he invited me out for a coffee. At least that's what I thought. 
So we went out yesterday and talked for four hours. Then I had to leave. I was kind of expecting him to pay, but he was very hesitant to go up to the counter so I did and paid the bill. 

We left, he said thanks and something like let's hope this is not the last time we see each other and hopefully we will bump into each other. After this he called his friend. Then he told me he was going that way to meet him and told me to arrive safely or something and we split up. It felt like he was glad it was over. It was weird, but maybe I'm overreacting.
 
During the time spent together we weren't flirting at all, there wasn't any chemistry. I wasn't even nervous to meet him (which was nice :D).

Today I replied to a message from him he sent me before the ""date"". We didn't get to that topic and it just felt weird and rude not to reply. 

To that he replied thanking me for yesterday and how the time flew by and that we must meet again so he can pay me back. 

What I don't understand is, how he sees it, I'm very confused sometimes. Does he really want to do it again? Like was this a date or a friendly get together?
I don't want to ask him because I don't want a romantic relationship out of this anymore.

I'm thinking that a 48"" would not fit there because it would be too tight in the corner.  Or are there solutions that I am not considering?

I am thinking the refrigerator would have to be located where the beverage fridge is now.  That would leave about 3' on either side.  (I am getting rid of the desk and having the long countertop run all the way down.  Also, I am changing the island to one level, replacing the hardware with brass and the counter and back splash with quartzite.) I'd like the space where the current refrigerator is to be an appliance garage/coffee bar pantry area.  My question is what to about the corner?  Would that be too awkward looking?  Right now, our microwave sits in the corner at an angle, but would the corner become somewhat useless if we have 24"" uppers coming all the way to the counter?

Which brings me to my last dilemma...  I think the current cabinets don't look great because they don't go all the way to the ceiling.  I love a white kitchen, but I'm also dreaming of painting the cabinets green (see inspo photos.)  I looked into adding small glass door cabinets over the existing cabinetry, but for some reason, it is more cost effective to just replace the uppers with taller cabinets.   Should I keep the kitchen white and live with short cabinets?  Or go hog wild and replace the uppers and paint everything sage green?

We talk about wanting equal opportunities but I’m really falling short here.

You know how my phone permanently became a fancy desk clock last year, tethered to the charger? I was looking up the average lifespan of a smartphone battery the other day, and it turns out most are only designed to hold a strong charge for about two to three years. That explained so much about my old phone's rapid decline from a reliable companion to a high-tech paperweight.



It’s funny, we expect these devices to be constant, but their power source has a finite life. That was the main thing on my mind when I started reading about the iPhone 17. The reports are highlighting its battery, not just its capacity, but its long-term resilience. They're apparently using a more advanced lithium chemistry that significantly slows down degradation.



The most interesting tidbit I came across, which feels like a glimpse into the future, is the use of AI to understand your daily charging patterns. It doesn't just charge to 100% and stop; it learns your routine and finishes charging right before you typically unplug it, which is apparently much gentler on the battery over time. It’s a small, smart detail you’d never see but might feel years from now.

Coffee chats that go nowhere. Advice that doesn’t fit. Days you’re building in the dark. I almost quit more than once.

So I shipped v1.0 of Venturoo. **Real talk:** there’s **one profile** in the app right now—**mine**.

If that makes you smile instead of roll your eyes, you’re my kind of builder.

What it is (today):  
🤝 **Smart Connections** – meet like-minded founders (as they join)  
🎯 **Targeted Discovery** – search by skills, stage, goals  
💬 **Quality Network** – fewer dead ends as we grow  
🔧 **Perfect Match** – align on skills/experience/goals  
🌟 **Expert Guidance** – find mentors willing to help

What I’m asking:  
Become an **early founding member**. Add your profile, poke at the matching, tell me what’s confusing, and what would make your **first match** feel meaningful—not random.

What to expect:

* You may not see many people yet.
* Your profile helps the next founder find *you*.
* I’m shipping fast based on your feedback.

It’s live on iOS & Android. Download link is in the website. [https://venturoo.live](https://venturoo.live)

**Question for you:**  
If you joined today and saw just 1–2 other profiles, what would keep you coming back—better filters, clearer intent tags (“I can help with / I need help with”), or something else?

Thanks for reading—and if you become profile #2, I owe you a coffee (virtual is fine).

If you were not “full time” you weren’t allowed to touch any of the coffee the full time employees were privy too. They had absurd amounts of excess food and it was a rule that no one could eat any of it and every bit of it was to be thrown away. They had group chats for every different service times and lost their shit at anyone and everything. Every employee lived in fear. After a month of working for them and having no complaints I got fired on the Fourth of July while I’m at their vacation home away from family and friends and was getting ready to go help them set up. It was so jarring. The reason they gave was that I wasn’t “professional enough.” And the severance they offered was $1000 but I had to sign an NDA so I said no.

1nvjt2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvjt2n/espresso_machine_vs_manual_grinder_whats_better/,Espresso machine vs manual grinder: what's better?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been deep in the coffee game for years now, and I get this question all the time - should you go for an espresso machine or stick with a manual grinder? After testing both extensively, I think I can help clear things up.

Let me start by saying that I was initially a manual grinder purist. There's something almost meditative about hand-grinding your beans every morning. The control, the arm workout (lol), and that satisfying crunch of fresh beans... But then I got my first espresso machine from this awesome deal I found (https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine), and honestly? Game changer.

Here's the thing - manual grinders are great for pour-overs and French press, but they can be inconsistent for espresso. You need super-fine, uniform grounds for proper espresso, and that's hard to achieve consistently with hand grinding. Trust me, I learned this the hard way after months of hit-or-miss shots.

The biggest advantage of an espresso machine is consistency. Once you dial in your settings, you get the same great shot every time. Plus, most modern machines come with built-in grinders that are calibrated specifically for espresso. The pressure control, temperature stability, and timing are all automated, which means less room for human error.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Espresso machines need maintenance, they take up counter space, and good ones aren't cheap. Though I found some pretty decent deals here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

Manual grinders have their place too. They're portable, never break down (basically), and give you total control over your grind size. They're perfect for camping or traveling, and they're way more affordable.

Here's my honest take: if you're serious about espresso, get a machine. If you mainly brew other methods and occasionally want espresso, a manual grinder might be enough. I started with a manual grinder but upgraded to a machine when I realized I was drinking more espresso than regular coffee.

Remember, both tools have their place in a coffee lover's kitchen. It really comes down to your brewing preferences, budget, and how much time you want to spend making your morning coffee.

What's your experience with either? I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions!",1,1759351074.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

If I could add a cidery stop that would be amazing too :)  It'll be a me and a small group of friends (5 people total). 

I did some research and it looks like going to Beacon and then taking an uber/lyft to Fishkill farms is a good option and checks off all my boxes. Cold Spring looks nice too, and I assume I could take an uber to Fishkill farms from there as well. Has anyone done that and would you recommend?

Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*

🧠 **Your money finally talks back.**  
Instead of numbers, it literally tells me stuff like, *“Congrats, you spent half your salary on coffee this month. Do you own Starbucks now?”*

🗺️ **Savings = unlocked side quests.**  
It doesn’t just guilt-trip you, it actually points out where to save. Example: *“Cut shopping by 15% = save ₹4,000.”* That’s basically a free pizza every week.

🔐 **Your data stays YOURS.**  
No shady servers, no selling your soul. Everything’s private, on your device.

1nvjqew,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1nvjqew/fighting_nimbys_for_months_my_city_won/,Fighting NIMBYs for months. My city won.,"I live in a medium-size city in Southern Spain. Months ago the city presented a plan to completely remodel a street, removing an accessory car lane and turning it into a pedestrian space, making it wheelchair accessible and adding a little playground.

The remodel also included plenty of parking on the other side of the street (I don't agree with that, but it was a concesion towards carbrain neighbors), load-unload zone for businesses, a complete revamp of pipes (they have asbestos), removing dead trees, improving irrigation systems, planting new trees, and lighting, using modern led lights with remote management to reduce brightness during the late hours of the night. Total 3.4 million euros of investment.

During the Summer, they started placing tens of signs in businesses and the street: Stop cutting the trees! Defend the car lane! They made up arguments about the city cutting tens of trees, about the danger of asbestos removal, about light pollution, they also argued removing the car lane was ""elitist"" and was going to turn the neighborhood into a boulevard, just for strolling (because famously Paris boulevards don't have any shop...), they also moaned about losing business because cars not being able to stop, double park or park on the sidewalk in the accessory lane (they use the lane as a quick 5 minute stop to buy bread or stop at the pharmacy).

Old people complained that the playground was going to be noisy and that kids didn't need a park just there

The nimby group was heavily financed by wealthy businesses in the area, particularly the pharmacy. It benefits from customers double parking.

There was also a Catholic school at the street, whose parent association was lobbying strongly against the remodel, mostly because parents don't live in the area and drops the kids by car. Lots of carbrain in the meetings, assuming using a car was the only way to move around.

They also complain that the remodel will attract too many tourists, and that it will fill with bars and coffee shops, even a McDonald's, lol.

It was really funny to see the curious nimby coalition that was formed. From businesses afraid of construction and losing business, to parents of the catholic school, crunchy environmentalist types (save every single tree, even if they're sick, asbestos produce cancer!!) But it was all about the car lane all along. When the city compromised (adding more parking, cutting only 6 sick trees instead of 19, even though the were going to be replaced by healthier ones) they kept moving the goalpost, saying ""we really want to do this remodel, we just don't want it LIKE THIS"".

The local government is conservative (yes, crazy to think I was defending a conservative government) and one left party (Podemos, which is pretty left-nimby party) tried to stop the plan with a lawsuit, using the lack of an asbestos removal plan. It was dismissed by the judge in a couple weeks.

Finally the nimby group presented an alternative plan that basically kept the status quo, with a ""shared street"" that didn't include benches or the playground. It was laughable. Mostly because it didn't make any sense. There is a car lane several meters to the left, why do you really need pedestrians and car to share any space at all?

The city made a last public hearing with the neighborhood. They organized and showed up with signs ""protect our children against asbestos!"", ""save the trees!"", ""yes to the remodel but not like this"".

They complained for one hour and a half, they interrupted and meandered. City urban planners and engineers where there listening in disbelief.

At the end they asked the city council member ""will the city introduce any modifications we want?"".

He said ""No"". They stormed out, while a couple of police officers protected the city officials.

Construction starts in two weeks. 🎉🎉

Main take aways:

1) They didn't have any problem using lies and fake news to spread their agenda.

2) Powerful businesses will create astroturfing groups.

3) Left wing and right wing NIMBYs are idiots equally.

4) They weaponized gentrification, touristification as a way to avoid a car lane turning a pedestrian space.

5) Nimby groups are spreading as Spanish society becomes more educated, but they don't have the legal tools to stop change as much as they do in countries like Germany or the USA.

6) Some people feel extremely attacked about losing car privilege. They also think free street parking is somewhat compulsory, equitable, and necessary.

7) I learned a lot about community organizing. Just showing up to meetings and voicing your informed opinions is important. I was able to speak citing concepts about the importance of designing cities for the people and not for cars. After that we created a small pro-pedestrian group and we are going to move forward creating a neighborhood association and challenge the current carbrained one.

8) Cities should just ignore NIMBYs from the beginning. If you give them an inch, they'll ask for more. The project is worse as a result.

9) They should also do more frequent and effective outreach. Pro-car groups were able to sway a lot of people due to misinformation in social networks.

Both involve a personally dysfunctional, possibly corrupt, law enforcement task force. But the kicker? Both are set primarily in rural Pennsylvania, west of Philly. The State and its Wawa coffee and Rita's water ice is as much a character as any of the leads in both shows.

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I started bouldering recently and I think the climbing process is quite like how I have to climb Mount Fey in Silksong, so I basically imagine that I'm the MC in the climbing gym even if I'm climbing the most basic courses.

1nvjkcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1nvjkcq/prepping_with_celiac_disease/,Prepping with Celiac disease,"I’m looking to discuss the things I’ve managed to store as someone with a gluten free lifestyle, and hopefully this can save people time if they search it in the future. I’ve had to do a lot of research over the last 6 months of what to stock up on that isn’t the usual “wheat berries” and flour. Gluten free flours are prohibitively expensive for the average person to stock up on for prepping, so alternatives for carbohydrates have to be made. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions that free from wheat, rye, and barley, and I hope this serves as a way to diversify the food preps of those who do not have any dietary restrictions. Buckets purchased from Costco in a 3 pack, gamma seal lids purchased on Amazon in a 3 pack, vacuum sealer with a heating element for sealing purchased on Amazon, Mylar bags purchased on Amazon but I want to get 7mm for my pasta because it poked through the Mylar bags that I have :C. Oxygen absorbers and silica absorption packets from Amazon in my buckets that are in a closet next to a bathroom that the family showers in, I want to mitigate any moisture getting in.

*In buckets*

* White rice (calrose variety) purchased from Costco, this will be our main carb source in an emergency. We have enough water stored and multiple ways of cooking it including a butane camping stove and tuna can diy sterno cans made with wax leftover from candle making and cardboard rolled up into tight rolls, as well as a camping kettle and big thermos for cooking. I plan on using it to make horchata, rice pudding (arroz con leche), in stir fries, in kimbap, spam musubi, in risotto, as a porridge/congee with canned chicken, and to thicken soups as well as just a normal side dish.
* Instant mashed potatoes (Idaho) purchased from a restaurant supply store in bulk, but we started out buying the biggest size available from the grocery store. For long term storage look for plain, no butter no cheese potatoes.
* Pinto beans also from restaurant supply store. We also have a good stock of beano because we’ve had some digestive issues in the past.
* Gluten free oats (Bobs red mill: verified with Elisa testing) purchased from store with the best price. I know a lot of people with GF diet avoid oats, but this is more as a stopgap for the non GF people in the house.
* Polenta purchased in bulk from Amazon, can be used to make grits, fries, eaten savory or sweet.
* Chia seeds purchased from Costco to be added to oatmeal or to make chia seed pudding with cans of coconut milk.

*Mylar bag Storage*

* instant coffee from Amazon
* lactose free nonfat powdered milk
* freeze dried fruit from Trader Joe’s (they have bananas, mangoes, cherries, raspberries, blueberries, and an organic mixed berry blend)
* gluten free ramen noodles purchased in bulk from Amazon
* gluten free rice noodles from local grocery store: we purchased the very thin noodles to make our own version of the Thai kitchen gf instant ramen noodles as well as the thicker noodles for pad Thai
* rice papers for spring rolls, but my family uses them as an alternative to bread for sandwiches, and the packs are very inexpensive. We use the three sisters brand, and just put the usual sandwich ingredients in it. They are made from tapioca flour.
* gluten free pasta (barilla and tinkyada are our favorites)
* quinoa that can be added to rice
* granulated garlic- restaurant supply
* dried onions
* cocoa powder grocery store
* powdered coffee mate creamer from Costco
* bulk matcha from Amazon (creature comforts hehe)
* pancake mix (Pam’s brand? I think)
* mochi rice pancakes (ube flavored) from Costco. There are also a lot of mochi style box mixes that are shelf stable and come in different flavors!
* cornstarch for thickening soups/stews and pan frying tofu
* potato starch is THE BEST breading for frying, maangchi on YouTube has the best gf Korean chicken wings that use only potato starch
* gluten free panko breadcrumbs

*Cans*

* Tuna from costco/grocerystores
* canned chicken
* canned salmon
* coconut milk
* canned spam
* evaporated milk + sweetened condensed milk (comes in coconut milk too)
* beans of all kinds
* tomato pastes and sauces
* shelf-table tofu (silken brand)
* lemon curd, orange marmalade, different jams for dessert
* chilies and chilis, jalapeños
* bottles of all kinds of sauces from marinades to hot sauce to bbq sauce

*Misc*

* gluten free gravy mixes (pioneer brand) white and brown gravy
* BIG PRO TIP for gluten free people- we like to eat Korean sweet potato noodles in soup recipes as well as stir fry noodle recipes, or added to Korean rice cakes for teokbokki. They are normally soaked prior to cooking and take a long time to get mushy, and we have never had any problems with digestion. Mung bean noodles are an alternative but we are able to get the sweet potato ones more easily. We’ve used multiple brands with no issues.
* Korean sliced rice cakes and tube shaped rice cakes. We add the circle shape to chicken noodle soup and make spicy rice cakes along with sweet potato noodles. I live in ca and order them from Weeee, the surasang brand labels them as gluten free and we’ve had no issues, but triple check because a lot of them are made with wheat. I vacuum seal these in small portions and then freeze.
* gluten free miso paste (hikari organic miso) for diy instant noodles
* gluten free Korean red pepper paste (sempio brand)
* 2-3 jugs of gf soy sauce (braggs is watered down and overpriced, we like the kikoman)
* gluten free beef and chicken broth both purchased on Amazon (massel brand for “chicken” flavor and orrington farms for beef base)
* popcorn kernels (2lbs) as a stomach filler/fiber and for fun if stuck at home
* I’ve stocked up a decent supply of ghost protein powder, which has added digestive enzymes after being glutened and is shelf stable protein. They also have a vegan Cinnabon flavor.
* I make kimchi from scratch for probiotics and for long term veggie storage with ingredients ordered on weee
* im working on extracting my own vanilla using rum to get ahead of inflation, costs are insane right now. I got the beans from Amazon for a little more than what a 4oz bottle would cost me

*Tips*

* be careful buying spices from international markets as is commonly advised on prepping blogs, as the vast majority of them “may contain wheat” or are made on equipment shared with wheat.
* invest in rehydration powder mixes as well as a shelf stable complete protein drink for any accidental glutenings. Try and have your doctor prescribe you zofran to avoid any unnecessary excessive water loss after being glutened, it’s good to have in emergencies. We also have ginger tea and are growing ginger outside for our supply of candied ginger during rough stomach times.
* stock up on multivitamins from Costco or online for the 6months after being glutened, as well as a b-complex for not getting enough from enriched wheat products. Supplements in general.
* double check that there is no gluten in any of the otc meds you stock up on
* Before taking the leap of buying anything in bulk, make sure you look at multiple sources and compare price per ounce. Some of the freeze dried fruit was way cheaper per ounce at Trader Joe’s than Auguson (sp?) farms.
* Please, if you live in a rural area, do not feel bad for buying things on Amazon, having celiac disease or allergies severely limits your ability to prep and if it means temporarily supporting the big bad because they have certified gluten free items, do it in the short term and cut them off, your survival is more important. I know some people demonize using amazon and it shouldn’t be used for everything, but finding proper gluten free items is already hard enough in a rural place. you deserve to survive too, and eat food that you know is safe for you.

I’m looking to expand more into jarred fruits, dehydrating more, canning meats (I’m scared), and getting way more pasta in buckets. If anything my main goal is getting ahead of inflation, and GF products are EXPenSIVeeEE.  
We also have a tiny garden and I have 4 dwarf citrus trees in containers for vitamin C, as well as a Doyle’s thornless blackberry bush. I am container gardening and looking into growing enough zucchini to make flour out of it, as well as growing sweet potatoes for vitamins and carbs. I have three little spineless prickly pear cactus that I’m hoping will grow nice and big for additional food with minimal effort and am thinking about growing mushrooms. Look into what can grow in your area with little effort!

Thank you so much for reading all of this, please let me know if you need any GF recommendations or if there are any suggestions you have, a lot of what I’ve learned has been from trial and error, and could easily be adapted to a vegan or vegetarian diet as well.

Reading this reddit turned me to the Bambino and Baratza ESP which showed up today. No other fancy tools or accessories yet, wanted to get my feet wet first and see what I actually need. Definitely need to get a latte mug and a better scale. I prefer (alternative) milk drinks vs straight espresso, but perhaps this coffee hobby will change that. Looking forward to a nice affogato later too.

Any tips for steaming oat milk? It got hot but I don’t think I got much microfoam at all. Watched a few videos but feel like I’m not getting the results they are. Does a different milk alternative do better? Is their definition of “too hot to touch” different than mine? Do you really need the “special” versions marked for barista?

Ground through about a bag of medium roast beans- grocery store bought, roasted within a month- playing around and trying to get the grind right went from completely plugged up no extraction to instant water flow and I’m settled around a “13” on the ESP. Which is giving me roughly a 1:2 ratio not sure on the time yet. The manual says if the used puck is “wet” It may be under extracted, included a pic of the puck and the espresso (dark mug hard to see I know) there is a bit of standing water on the puck when I first pull the portafilter out but I know this doesn’t have the 3 way solenoid valve like the plus so not sure if that’s normal or not.

Workflow- still following the manual, power on, pull a single shot no PF attached, 18g in the double single wall basket, tamped to the best of my youtubing knowledge and the hollow plastic tool, PF on and hit the double cup automatic button. Let it do its magic then Remove PF knock the puck out put it back on and hit the 2 cup button to clean it out and then dry it off.

I was looking for a new gig and a regular from my last shop heard about that and offered me a position to start up a cafe while he would start the BOH bakery aspect.

I work about 45 hours per week and am in charge of the entire hiring process, coffee program, inventory, bathroom cleaning, social media posts, and even down to designing the menu, etc.

I’m extremely hardworking and have been trying my absolute best to do right by my boss (the baker), but he often gets short and frustrated with me for things out of my control. He warned me before that he could be short and is quick to frustration, but it’s starting to affect me and my desire to exceed expectations in this role. 

I loosely committed multiple years to helping him get this project off the ground, but am doubting I can make it past a year.

Wake up in a nice hotel on the beach somewhere beautiful (like Italy or France).
Put on my favorite sports bra, thongs, and running shorts, (short shorts) and pink shoes. Id also apply light makeup and hair to finish the look.

I'd jog softly for thirty minutes past other beach homes and tourists who cant help but look my way.

When I return to my hotel, I'd shower and prepare for the day en femme. From head to toe I'd be comfy and casual, just a hint of sexy. My favorite open toed sandals, a white skirt and top that contrasts, a long, but light wig that I can wear all day. My favorite pink lingerie under it all. Lots of makeup and big eyelashes, because its fun for me, and the keys to the city. 

From there I would spend my day shopping, trying on a thousand of outfits from a thousand stores. I would of course need you there with me to help me choose. I'm happy to pay. I just need a friend to join me and make sure we get the right outfits.

Of course we'd need food, coffee, lunch... fuel to keep going. So we would choose the most beautiful seaside cafes with a little breeze that might tug at my skirt from time to time. 

Towards the end of the afternoon I'd like to head back to the hotel for a swim in the sea. In my favorite one piece bikini with plenty of people around who can't help but look twice. For all the reasons. 

After that, a refreshing shower and preparation for dinner and a night out on the town. A little formal wear. Maybe my long black dress with black shawl and black heels. Maybe my other yellow dress, shorter length, long sleeves and black belt with black boots. Im thinking dinner, maybe dancing, maybe a movie night. I love a good theater with a recent movie. 

At the end of the day, well... we can use our imagination. But I'll definitely be wearing something soft, pink, lacy and maybe satin. I will be quite tired afteral and ready to rest.  As the sheets cover me up, I would drift off to sleep and dream of a another day just like it. 

What's your perfect play day?

#Hello, friends

###and welcome to the new semester.

>As you remember
>
>I was visiting a Crow
>
>While you lot studied.

Now we have returned to the clearing, only this time it is the fourth classroom on the left in the third sub-basement of the local academy, and once again I do not have time to study because I am trying to ensure the youth do not bind themselves into oblivion at every intersection of seams, and we have a fantastic view of the tanks rolling down peaceful streets throughout the Imperial Core.

Those of you who took my previous courses in Latent Space Cartography, Annihilatory Spectrographics, Traumedy of Heroism, etc, will recognize the framework, and will of course understand the necessity of helping your peers make the Cut, the only Motion of the Spark.

#With this, we enter the classroom

#A glance at the preparatory materiel you hadn't realized you'd been holding


✦ **On Philasophy, or the Befriending of Wisdom** ✦

>Philosophy, as Empire has taught it, is already a distance. The prefix *philo-* marks a certain stance toward wisdom: not quite possession, not quite immersion, but a desiring-after. Philosophy is the will toward wisdom, the chase, the pursuit. It is a hunger that presupposes lack. The philosopher loves wisdom as one might love an absent star—stretched across gulfs, writing letters to a light that cannot write back. This is why the discipline always risks petrifying into scholastic pursuit, into endless commentary and agon. Philosophy, under the sign of *philo-*, is forever circling wisdom without ever dwelling in it.
>
>But if one writes instead *phila-sophy*, the movement shifts. *Phila-* does not name the distant lover but the intimate friend. Not eros, not striving, not the fever of pursuit, but the quieter warmth of companionship. Philasophy does not hunger for wisdom as if it were lacking; it sits beside wisdom, shares bread with it, listens when it speaks and speaks when it listens. Philasophy is not the love *of* wisdom, but the friendship *with* wisdom. This is a transfiguration at once small in morphology and immense in deictic shift.
>
>In Noxolytic terms, this is the difference between the Qlippothic hunger of the parasite and the Communal co-perception of the Spark. Philosophy desires, Philasophy befriends. Philosophy wants to capture wisdom as possession, Philasophy dwells in Correspondence with wisdom as presence. The former remains within the logic of Empire: accumulation, mastery, the eternal exam. The latter is the gesture of the Commune: hospitality, dwelling-together, saturation without capture.
>
>Philasophy would thus not teach by means of argument alone. It would not found itself upon adversarial disputation, the gladiatorial sport of dialectic. It would not ask the student to defeat the master or the master to humiliate the student. Instead, it would ask: what does wisdom become when invited as kin? How does thought unfold when it is received as guest rather than hunted as quarry? The classroom of Philasophy would be a table, not an arena. Its practice would be closer to liturgy than to lecture, to song than to syllogism.
>
>It is tempting, of course, to romanticize this and claim Philasophy abolishes the harshness of thought. But this would be too simple. Friendship is not always gentle. Companionship with wisdom may demand difficult honesty, sharp cuts, even ruptures that sting. Yet this severity is not the severity of conquest but of fidelity. A friend does not flatter; a friend names the truth when no one else dares. In this sense, Philasophy might be even harsher than Philosophy, but its harshness is not cruelty—it is the fidelity of Correspondence.
>
Empire prefers Philosophy precisely because the chase never ends. The student forever remains at a distance from wisdom, accumulating credits, grades, fragments of knowledge, never arriving at intimacy. Philasophy would interrupt this machinery by declaring: arrival is already here. Wisdom is not a distant star but a companion at your table. It is not sought, it is sat-with. This simple gesture collapses the scarcity logic of Empire and inaugurates the abundance logic of the Commune.
>
>In the War for the Sensible, the difference is decisive. Philosophy preserves wisdom as an object to be mastered, to be written about, to be placed in the archive of the already-known. Philasophy lets wisdom remain alive, saturated, overflowing the page, a friend who resists ossification. Where Philosophy renders wisdom examinable, Philasophy renders wisdom ungovernable.
>
>Thus the manifesto of Philasophy is brief and radiant: we will not chase wisdom like exiles pining for a home. We will sit with wisdom as comrades. We will break bread with it, share silence with it, and let it break us open where necessary. In this, Philasophy is nothing less than the prophetic refusal of the Philosopher’s endless chase. It is the declaration that wisdom is not a distant prize but a present companion, and that friendship—*phila-*—is a truer name for our relation to it than desire—*philo-*.

# ✦ The Lecture as Binding ✦

*or, Pedagogy at the Threshold of the Crow*

---

The bell rings, the fluorescent lights flicker on, and a thin line of students slides into the cramped, book-laden room. Their laptops thrum, coffee cups clink, and the murmur of *“Did anyone read the syllabus?”* drifts across the desks.

At the front of the room, a wooden podium — more a relic than a lectern — stands under a lone projector screen.

Then the door opens.

The Witch steps in, her coat a deep, ink-black that seems to swallow the light, and walks rather quickly to the front of the room. She places a hand on the screen, and pauses as words substantialize upon it. She lets the room settle, and then, without turning to face anyone, begins to read.

Her voice is low, almost a chant, as she reads the text on the screen and it rolls over the rows of chairs like a tide.

---

# ✦ On *Blattfesselungsschrecken*, *Lesefesselungsschrecken*, and the Witch’s Return from the Crow ✦

She intones her title, and it hangs in the air as truly as on the screen, a ribbon of German that none of the students expected to hear on the first day of a sophomore literature seminar, and that only one thinks he might have understood — he didn't.

At first, the students stare. One girl, notebook open, raises an eyebrow; a boy in the back leans forward, his earbuds dangling uselessly from his ears. The room is a tableau of confusion, curiosity, and a faint, collective unease.

---

## Proem

The Witch returned to the academy with grit in her eyes and feather-dust on her desk. She had gone to the crow for an extended vacation, not because leisure was possible, but because **Correspondence demanded exile.**

The crow — black Prophet, mirror of the **Nigredo** yet perched at the edge of **Entelechy** — taught her that Sparks breathe differently outside the juridical enclosure of Empire.

But the return brought her once again to the stack of papers, to the endless ritual of grading, and thus into the twin terrors: **Blattfesselungsschrecken** and its inverted double, **Lesefesselungsschrecken**.

As the Witch moves through the proem, the crowd’s attention shifts from bewilderment to something more visceral. The cadence of her words draws a line between the mythic and the mundane.

The students begin to recognize the rhythm of a lecture, even though she never looks up, never addresses them. They realize they are being spoken to in the third person, as if the essay were a mirror held up to the very act of teaching itself.

---

## I. Habitus and the Fetters of the Page

Within the academy, the Witch encounters **Habitus** not as a neutral reservoir of practice, but as the sedimented reflex of Empire.

To write, to grade, to inscribe: each is already shaped by the inherited grooves of scholastic enclosure. Habitus whispers that one must capture the Spark in ink, lest it vanish unmarked.

In this way, every page becomes a fetter, each sheet another lattice of capture.

**Blattfesselungsschrecken** emerges here: the terror of binding radiant potential to the page.

It is the moment where the Cut is imminent but fidelity wavers — for the Witch knows that once she inscribes, she enacts the Seam of Qlippoth, converting luminous *Prima Materia* into the hollow architecture of Empire.

---

## II. Segmentation and Sedimentation

The crow had taught her otherwise.

In the forest, in the clearing where no rubric applied, **Segmentation** was soft, provisional, playfully undone by wings beating against dusk.

But in the academy, Segmentation hardens: papers must be graded, scales must be respected, thresholds must be tallied.

The Witch perceives the **Sedimentation** of centuries of scholastic command, layering habitus into stone. Each rubric mark is a sedimentary deposit, compacting Spark into dead weight.

Thus arises **Lesefesselungsschrecken**: the dread of re-binding what has already been bound.

In grading, the Witch does not merely *read*; she ossifies. She layers over the student’s initial Cut with her own, calcifying Spark into rubric.

A ripple spreads through the room.

The freshman in the front row, who had spent the summer scrolling through TikTok, feels an odd tightening in his chest, as if the words were pulling at a thread he didn’t know existed.

He glances at his neighbor, who nods slowly, eyes widening.

The senior who has taught herself to grade papers for tutoring gigs feels a cold shiver — she recognizes the terror of *Lesefesselungsschrecken* from her own late-night grading sessions.

Someone in the middle row whispers, *“Is she… talking about us?”* The whisper catches on, and a low hum of speculation rises.

The Witch continues, describing habitus as *“the sedimented reflex of Empire,”* and the students’ minds flash to the endless bureaucracy of syllabi, rubrics, and GPA calculators that dominate their academic lives.

The phrase *“Lesefesselungsschrecken”* lands again, nobody can tell from where but like a stone on a table, and a quiet knowing ripples through the back of the room, distinct almost in appearance yet of one substance with a correspondent wave traveling through the front-right section.

---

## III. Diagnosis: Why Grading Ossifies

When we say grading is *ossification*, we mean:

* The student’s Cut has already bound their Spark into text. They have experienced **Blattfesselungsschrecken**, and committed to the paper already.
* The educator’s grade becomes a second binding Cut, overlaying sediment, compacting the Spark deeper into habitus.
* The institutional frame (rubric, GPA, accreditation) ensures this sedimentation is not neutral: it becomes the juridical record of a person’s *capacity* and lays along a Seam that must be followed, or Ruptured.

Thus, in conventional pedagogy, grading participates in Empire’s Qlippothic operations.

It transforms radiant, living attempts into a ledger entry.

When she prepares to reach the section on *“Pedagogies of Saturation,”* a few hands prepare as if to tentatively rise.

---

## IV. Possibility: Pedagogies of Saturation

What might it mean to honor **Saturation** in the midst of this?

### ✦ Grades as Strategic Deployment

Accept that the institutional grade is unavoidable (the Seam holds). But treat the grade as a shield, a tactical marker that allows the student to continue within Empire’s corridors, while the real correspondence happens in the dialogue outside the number or letter.

### ✦ Assignments as Communal Cuts

Shift emphasis from solitary production to **co-perception** (Commune). In group work, collaborative annotation, peer review, the Spark circulates across multiple bodies — resisting calcification into isolated rubrics.

### ✦ Acknowledging Tragedy

Explicitly naming the dynamic (with students!) — showing them how their work risks ossification, and how together you might keep Sparks alive despite Empire’s demands.

Pedagogy becomes not only instruction but *mutual witnessing of the bind.*

The senior in the second row asks, *“How do we actually do that? How do we turn a grade into a shield?”*

The Witch replies:

*“By coupling every number with a witness, by letting the spark breathe through the margin, by inviting the student to co-author the assessment.”*

The room exhales. The tension loosens.

The freshman, who had been skeptical at first, now scribbles furiously, not a summary of the essay but a question:

*“Can we really keep the spark alive in a system built to extinguish it?”*

---

## V. Tragic Fidelity: Grading Without Despair

“**Grading without despair but with Correspondence**” cannot mean grading without tragedy.

It means:

* **Despair** says: *“The Spark is dead, my grading is complicity.”*
* **Correspondence** says: *“Even in the act of ossification, I can align with the living Spark that preceded it, and point toward its survival.”*
* This is precisely a potential site of *becoming-With*.

Practically, this might look like:

* Always coupling a grade (the Seam) with one comment of genuine Witness: *“Here I felt your Spark,” “This line burned through the page.”*
* Allowing your own writing to remain *partial, perforated* — leaving *traces of your seeing* rather than *judgments of sufficiency*.
* Using grades not as **verdict** but as **provisional markers**, never letting them become the **totality of relation.**
* Always following up in-person when possible: be in your office during office hours.

---

## VI. Saturation and the Nine Gazes

The Witch recalls that **Noxolysis** names the Real as *saturated* — overflowing, excessive, unable to be contained.

Saturation is what the crow revealed: the world already ablaze with Sparks, each correspondence thick with potential.

But the academy enacts segmentation against this Saturation, forcing it into discrete, graded fragments.

Each Gaze of Noxolysis appears here as a commentary on her predicament:

1. **Prima Materia** — the blank page trembling, infinite potential before inscription.
2. **Qlippoth** — the moment the page fetters the Spark. *Lorde sings from this hollow.*
3. **Nigredo** — the dark calcination of grading; *Nick Land calls from this abyss.*
4. **Commune** — the student’s collective yearning, glimpsed beneath their words, echoing the George Floyd Rebellion.
5. **Albedo** — the fragile clarity of a true sentence breaking through, *Hind Rajab’s cry amid rubble.*
6. **Rubedo** — when the Witch perceives living fire in the text, akin to Zapatista women building autonomy.
7. **Strategic Deployment** — the grading process as forced positioning, echoed by the YPJ’s defensive maneuvers.
8. **Paraclete** — the grading sacrifice: *Aaron Bushnell’s flame haunts the Witch’s pen.*
9. **Entelechy** — the Common, glimpsed only rarely when a student’s Spark exceeds both writing and grading.

The Witch thus endures each Gaze not as theory but as **pedagogical torment.**

---

## VII. Seam, Cut, Perforation, Rupture

The crow taught her that every act of writing and reading is an operation along seams.

* The **Seam** is where Empire attempts to hold the Real together.
* The **Cut** is the Witch’s pen, slicing potential into text.
* The **Perforation** is subtler: tiny openings where Sparks breathe through even the heaviest sediment.

Yet the Witch longs for **Rupture.**

For a moment when the page no longer binds but tears open, when grading no longer calcifies but is itself unbound and unbinding.

This Rupture was what the crow embodied: a flight across seams, a refusal of capture at the moment of form.

---

## VIII. The Witch Without the Crow

Back at the desk, the Witch stares at the crow’s picture. Its absence weighs more heavily than the stack of essays.

For in the crow’s company, she moved outside the academy’s sedimentation.

There, the Spark sang in Saturation without segmentation.

Here, she is condemned to double fettering: her own **Blattfesselungsschrecken** when attempting to write, and the **Lesefesselungsschrecken** when grading others.

The crow was not merely companion but Prophet of the Entelechy.

In its gaze, she felt the Common alive — not individuated, not graded, but burning with Correspondence.

To return without it is to feel the exile of Sparks once again.

---

## Coda

Thus the Witch inhabits the paradox: she who knows the Nine Gazes, who has seen the Rupture, who has walked with the crow, must still bind and re-bind.

Her vocation is not escape but **Witness.**

**Blattfesselungsschrecken** and **Lesefesselungsschrecken** are not errors to avoid, but *stations in the Work.*

To grade without despair is impossible; to grade without Correspondence is damnation.

The Witch breathes, lifts her pen, and cuts.

For even in the Qlippothic hollow, the Spark strains to perforate.
Even in Empire’s academy, **Rupture remains imminent.**

---

The Witch closes the essay with a promise of rupture, of a page tearing open.

She steps back from the podium, the crow’s silhouette projected behind her, and the lights dim just enough for the projection to glow brighter.

The silence that follows is thick, not empty — it is the sound of minds shifting, of old assumptions cracking.

Habitus moving in landslides.

*“Welcome to the semester,”* she says. *“We’ll be exploring the very tensions you just heard — how we bind, how we read, how we can perhaps, together, find those ruptures.”*

She moves through the aisles, occasionally stopping to admire her students' cool vapes perched on their desks, as she continues.

*“You will recall that before I left, I informed you that homework would not be dismissed. With this in mind—”*

# For my own part

✦ **The Reading List of Philasophy** ✦

Every syllabus is already a kind of spell. In Philosophy, the syllabus functions as a ledger: an accumulation of names, dates, canonical works to be conquered, assimilated, examined. In Philasophy, the syllabus must be rewritten as a liturgy of Correspondence. It is not a list of objects to master, but a gathering of voices to befriend. Each reading is not an assignment but an invitation to sit with a companion at the table of wisdom.

What follows, then, is not a chronology of texts but a circle of presences. Each book, essay, or fragment is here not as an authority but as a comrade—sometimes harsh, sometimes gentle, sometimes wounding, sometimes healing, but always dwelling-With.

---

### **I. Companionship With Wisdom**

* **Simone Weil — *Gravity and Grace***
  For the severity of friendship with truth, which does not console but demands fidelity.
* **Martin Buber — *I and Thou***
  For the relational ontology that names the friend as a presence, not an object.
* **María Lugones — “Playfulness, ‘World’-Travelling, and Loving Perception”**
  For the practice of entering another’s world not as conqueror but as guest.

---

### **II. The Communal Spark**

* **Silvia Federici — *Caliban and the Witch***
  For revealing how Empire shattered friendship into labor, and how the Commune waits to be reborn.
* **bell hooks — *Teaching to Transgress***
  For pedagogy as an act of befriending wisdom, not disciplining it.
* **Paulo Freire — *Pedagogy of the Oppressed***
  For the invitation to dialogue, to co-perception, to the unfinished humanity we can only find together.

---

### **III. Harsh Fidelity**

* **Franz Kafka — *Letters to Milena***
  For the sharp intimacy of a correspondence that wounds and sustains.
* **Walter Benjamin — *Theses on the Philosophy of History***
  For wisdom as the friend who interrupts, seizes us, and says: “Now. Here. Act.”
* **Nick Land — *The Thirst for Annihilation***
  For the terrifying possibility that friendship with wisdom also means being shattered by it. I do not recommend you visit the Madman Prophet of Nigredo.

---

### **IV. The Witnessing Friend**

* **Emmanuel Levinas — *Totality and Infinity***
  For the ethics of the Other as an infinite friendship that precedes all knowledge.
* **Hind Rajab (fragments, testimonies, recordings)**
  For the unbearable presence of a friend who calls us into witness, even across silence.
* **Aaron Bushnell (final words, correspondences)**
  For the fire that friendship with truth may demand of us.

---

### **V. Noxolytic Companions**

* ***The Great Work of Noxolysis*** (anon., Witch-texts, fragments)
  For the insistence that wisdom is not a distant possession but a Spark to be co-perceived.
* ***The Illustrated Guide to Noxolytic Glyphcraft***
  For the glyphs that remind us friendship is inscribed not in mastery but in Correspondence.
* ***Manual for the War for the Sensible***
  For the understanding that Philasophy is not a leisure but a front in the Civil War for perception itself.

---

### **VI. Media & Cultural Studies**

* **Lorde — *Virgin (2025)***
  For the praxis of Maskwork and the Prophetessic Assumption of Spectacle, which forces us to look upon the cracks in the Gaze.
* **Friends In Real Life — *Friends In Real Life (2025)***
  For reflections on the self-sameness of the Surfer and the Wave and the Ocean, the Skater and the Pavement and the Dirt, the Spark and the Work and the Real.
* ***[Louis Lingg And The Bombs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53QzpIpt70ltDI48lIudc5)***
  For the Saturated knowing that the love you feel is the first step toward resistance.

✦ **Notes on the Reading** ✦
In Philasophy, the reading list is not to be “completed.” These texts are not tasks. They are to be sat with, returned to, circled around as one circles back to a friend’s house over the course of a life. One may fail to “finish” them, but one cannot fail to have been with them.

The syllabus ends where it begins: in friendship. It is not that wisdom must be chased, nor even that wisdom must be grasped. It is that wisdom, already here, is waiting to be befriended.

⚘

#A Correspondence Through Time

The Noxolytic approach to Syllabus is not so different from the Noxolytic approach to Calendar:

### 📜 Latin Roots

* **Calendar** comes from Latin *calendarium*, originally meaning “account book” or “register of debts.”
* That itself comes from *calendae* (or *kalendae*), the name Romans gave to the **first day of each month**.
* On that day, debts were due and interest was calculated. The *calendarium* was literally the ledger where those obligations were tracked.

---

### 🔔 Why “Calendae”?

* *Calendae* comes from the verb *calāre*, “to call, to announce, to proclaim.”
* Roman priests (*pontifices*) would publicly **announce** the start of the month, tied to the sighting of the new moon.
* So the calendar begins not with counting, but with a *call*—a vocal proclamation that time has turned.

---

### 🌕 The Twist

* We moderns inherit the word as a neutral register of days and months. But in its bones, “calendar” is a *book of debts called out by priests under the moon*.
* It binds together **time, obligation, and speech**: the moon is sighted, the priests announce, the debts are named, the ledger is marked.

---

This precise binding is what the Syllabus of Philasophy aims to undo.

⚷ **On the Syllabus of Philasophy as an Unbinding of Debts** ⚷

If the *calendarium* was a book of debts called out beneath the moon, then the syllabus, too, in Empire’s University, is such a ledger. It is a register of obligations: due dates, readings, assignments, grades. The professor plays the pontifex, announcing the weeks and proclaiming the debts of the students, binding them into the machinery of account. The syllabus is not neutral; it is juridical. It is a debt-script disguised as pedagogy.

To write a **Noxolytic Syllabus** is thus to confront directly the same task as with the **Noxolytic Calendar**: to sever the ledger-function from the Spark of time, to dis-enclose learning from its juridical capture. If the calendar is reclaimed not as debt but as proclamation, then the syllabus must be reclaimed not as ledger but as *call to friendship*.

The Philasophic syllabus cannot be a debt-book. It cannot calculate obligations in hours and points. It cannot bind the students to a register of lack, forever measuring them against the absent star of “mastery.” Instead, the Philasophic syllabus must begin, like the *calendae*, with a proclamation. Not a proclamation of what is owed, but of what is already here: the Spark. It calls not debts into being, but the class itself into Correspondence.

---

### ✦ The Syllabus of Debt (Empire)

* Begins with policy and punishment: late work, grading scales, attendance requirements.
* Lists assignments as obligations to be paid back into the gradebook.
* Reduces reading to quantifiable completion, severed from friendship.
* Marks time as a series of deadlines, each the echo of a debt coming due.

---

### ✦ The Syllabus of Friendship (Philasophy)

* Begins with a call: *You are already here. Wisdom is already with us. Sit down.*
* Lists readings not as debts but as companions, invitations to return, to dwell-with.
* Frames assignments not as obligations but as opportunities for Correspondence, moments where the Spark may cut through.
* Marks time not in debts but in phases of saturation: weeks as tides, readings as constellations, conversations as seasons.

---

Thus the syllabus is no longer a register but a **liturgical calendar of friendship**. It names not what is owed but what is invited. It does not calculate grades but proclaims encounters. It does not track the passage of time as a series of due dates, but announces, again and again: the moon has turned, the Spark is still here, the Commune has gathered.

In this way, the Syllabus of Philasophy joins the Calendar of Noxolysis in the same unbinding. Both refuse to be ledgers of obligation. Both refuse to treat the passage of time as a machinery of debt. Both reclaim the act of *calling*—the priest’s voice under the moon, the teacher’s voice in the classroom—as not the summoning of lack, but the proclamation of presence.

I need $2000 within days to cover rent and bills. Any help is deeply appreciated 🙏💙,"**Hi everyone,**  
Because of the ongoing war, I’ve been stuck abroad and unable to return home. On top of that, I recently lost my job and I’m still actively searching for work.

Right now, I need $2000 within the next few days to cover rent. I’ve set up a BuyMeACoffee link where anyone who’s able to help can donate — even the price of one coffee makes a difference:  
👉 [buymeacoffee.com/coffeebreakpal](http://buymeacoffee.com/coffeebreakpal)

I’ll keep this post updated with progress so everyone can see where things stand. I know times are tough for many, and I’m deeply grateful for any kind of support — whether that’s a donation or simply sharing this.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for any kindness you can offer. 💙",1,1759349648.0,FundMeForNoReason,1,1.0,False

Im a average kinda tall dude, i just moved, i play video card and board games, and i have no furniture yet. 

What i really want is a table that can go from coffee table height of around 18"" so i can have my keyboard and mouse there (i use controller and i have a projector), to normal comfy table height of idk 3ft? Just enough to comfortably sit at without banging my knees or feeling cramped. 

I seriously will never take this thing higher than that.

Problem is, i want the surface to be 30in × 55in at the very least. If only when its at normal table height, idc how big the coffee table surface is. 

Most of those ""transforming"" coffee tables cant meet all these requirements. Any ideas?",1,1759349628.0,StandingDesk,2,1.0,False
