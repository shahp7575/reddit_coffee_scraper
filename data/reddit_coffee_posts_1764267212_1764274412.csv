I don't believe in love at first sight. But I believe in the moment someone becomes the axis your world rotates around without asking permission. The moment when a stranger's existence becomes more important than your own, and you can't remember what mattered before they walked into your peripheral vision.

She's been in my peripheral vision for three years.

I've never said a word to her.

This isn't a love story. Or maybe it is—just not the kind that gets resolved. It's the kind that exists in the space between what happened and what could have happened. The kind that lives entirely in one person's head while the other person buys groceries and lives their life completely unaware they're the center of someone else's universe.

My coffee's cold. I'm tired. I'm always tired.
But I can't sleep yet.

---

She's short—the kind of short that makes her stand on tiptoes to reach the top shelf at the bookstore. Her hair is that in-between color, brown with blonde threaded through it like someone couldn't decide which season she belonged to. It falls just past her shoulders, and she has this habit of tucking it behind her ear when she's concentrating. I've watched her do it hundreds of times.

Her face is round and soft in a way that makes her look approachable. Like she's never met a stranger she didn't greet with genuine warmth. I've seen her hold doors for people carrying too much. Stop to pet every dog that passes. Smile at cashiers like they matter—really smile, the kind that reaches her eyes and makes them crinkle at the corners.

She's kind. Not performatively kind. Not the kind of kindness that announces itself. Just... kind. The way some people are tall or left-handed. It's built into her structure.

I don't know her favorite color or her middle name or what she sounds like when she's angry. But I know she tips generously and says thank you to bus drivers and once I saw her give her umbrella to someone caught in the rain while she just ran through it, laughing.

I've memorized the architecture of her kindness from a distance, the way astronomers study stars they'll never touch.

---

There's a coffee shop between her apartment and campus. I know because I followed her once. Not in a creepy way—I just happened to be walking the same direction for forty-five minutes.

She orders vanilla lattes. Always vanilla. Never changes it up. The barista knows her order before she says it, and she always asks how his day is going. Actually waits for the answer. Actually listens.

I've engineered seventeen scenarios where we meet naturally.

I've executed zero.

Every time I get close, something stops me. Her phone rings. Someone else approaches her first. She leaves earlier than expected. Or maybe—probably—I sabotage it myself. Walk slower. Take the long route. Convince myself tomorrow will be better.

Tomorrow is never better. Tomorrow is just another today where I don't speak.

Because what if I do speak and she's not who I think she is? What if the kindness is just politeness? What if the girl I've constructed from observations and imagination crumbles the moment reality touches her?

Worse—what if she's exactly who I think she is, and I'm not enough?

---

I talk to her constantly.

Not out loud—I'm not that far gone yet. But in my head, we have entire relationships. Conversations that span years. Inside jokes that only exist in the space behind my eyes.

We have our first date at the Italian place on Morrison Street. She orders pasta, laughs at my nervous rambling, touches my hand across the table just briefly. The touch feels like the world clicking into place.

We have our first fight about something small that represents something bigger. But we work through it because she's patient and I'm trying and we both believe in trying.

We have Sunday mornings that taste like coffee and feel like peace. We have a life I can see so clearly it feels like memory instead of fantasy.

We have everything except reality.

---

I keep a notebook. Started it two years ago without really meaning to.

At first it was just observations. *She drinks vanilla lattes. She tucks her hair behind her ear when she reads. She's kind to strangers.*

Then it became more. Full paragraphs about the way she moves through the world. Imagined conversations. Things I'd say if I ever got the chance. Things she might say back.

The handwriting is mine but prettier somehow. Like I'm writing carefully enough that maybe it could become real.

My roommate found it once. Didn't say anything. Just gave me this look—part concern, part pity—and closed the drawer.

---

I saw her with someone last week.

They were walking together, close but not touching. He said something. She laughed—light and genuine, the way I always imagined she'd laugh.

I stood across the street and felt something crack inside my chest.

Not jealousy exactly. More like... confirmation. Confirmation that she exists in the real world, having real experiences with real people who are brave enough to actually talk to her.

While I just watch from across streets and through windows, building elaborate fantasies around someone who doesn't know I exist.

---

There's something I haven't mentioned yet.

Something that's been sitting in the back of my mind like a splinter I can't quite reach.

The bookstore where I see her—it's called Chapter's End. Fitting name. It's been there forever, dusty and warm and filled with the kind of old books that smell like time itself.

I've been going there for three years. Every Tuesday at three o'clock.

She's always there. Same time. Same section. Philosophy and literature.

Never early. Never late. Always exactly three o'clock.

---

Last Tuesday, I did something different.

I arrived at two-thirty. Decided I'd wait, watch her arrive, maybe finally work up the courage to say something.

I sat in the café section with a clear view of the entrance.

Two-thirty became two-forty-five. Then three o'clock. Then three-fifteen.

She never came through the door.

But at exactly three o'clock, I looked toward the philosophy section—our section—and she was there.

Already there.

Reaching for a book on the top shelf, hair falling forward, that familiar gesture of tucking it behind her ear.

I hadn't seen her enter.

---

I thought maybe I'd been distracted. Looked away for a moment. Missed her somehow.

So this Tuesday, I tried again.

This time I stood right by the entrance. Watched every single person who came in.

Families. Students. An old man with a cane. A woman with twins in a stroller.

No her.

But at three o'clock exactly, I turned around.

And she was there.

In the philosophy section. Like she'd materialized from the space between books.

---

My hands are shaking as I write this.

I went back through my photos. All those candid shots I'd taken over the years—always from far away, always careful, always just trying to capture proof that this feeling was real.

I zoomed in on each one.

The details are wrong.

In some photos her hair is shorter. In others, longer. The color shifts—more brown in winter, lighter in summer, but not in a natural way. In a way that doesn't track with time or season.

Her clothes change but they're always exactly what I would find beautiful. Comfortable sweaters. Vintage dresses. Everything perfectly her—or perfectly what I imagine as her.

And in every single photo, if you look close enough at the background, the other people are blurred. Moving. Living.

She's always perfectly still. Perfectly clear. Like she's the only thing the camera wanted to capture.

Like she's the only thing that was ever really there.

---

I'm sitting in my apartment now. The notebook is open in front of me.

I'm reading through three years of observations and I'm starting to notice patterns.

She never interacts with anyone else when I'm watching. Never has a conversation I can hear. Never pulls out her phone or checks the time or does any of the small human things that prove someone exists independently of being observed.

She's kind to everyone—but I've never actually seen her be kind. I've just seen her smile, wave, the aftermath of kindness. I've inferred her goodness from the way I want her to be good.

The last entry in the notebook isn't in my handwriting.

It's in that prettier version of my handwriting—the careful one—but I don't remember writing it.

It says:

*What if I told you that you're not watching someone?*

*What if you're creating them?*

*What if every Tuesday at three o'clock, your loneliness becomes so overwhelming that it takes shape?*

*What if she only exists because you need her to?*

---

I close the notebook.

My roommate knocks on the door. Asks if I'm okay. Says I've been in here for hours, talking to myself.

I don't remember talking to myself.

I go back to the bookstore. It's Thursday. Not our day. Not three o'clock.

The philosophy section is empty.

I ask the clerk about her. Describe her perfectly—short, brown-blonde hair, round face, kind to everyone. Always here Tuesdays at three.

He looks confused. ""Tuesdays at three? Man, you're the only regular we have at that time. Been coming here alone for years.""

""The girl,"" I insist. ""She's always in philosophy. She reads Camus.""

He shakes his head slowly. ""You're always in philosophy. You're always reading Camus.""

---

I go back one more time. Tuesday. Three o'clock exactly.

I stand in the entrance and I watch.

At three o'clock, she appears.

Not walking from anywhere. Not coming through a door. She's just suddenly there, reaching for a book, tucking hair behind her ear.

I walk closer. She doesn't acknowledge me. Doesn't even seem to register my presence.

I reach out to touch her shoulder.

My hand passes through empty air.

But I can still see her. Clear as anything. More real than the books around her. More vivid than my own reflection in the window.

---

I understand now.

She was never real.

But she wasn't imaginary either.

She was something else—something I built from loneliness and longing. A tulpa. A thought-form. The physical manifestation of every quality I needed to exist in the world because I couldn't find it in myself.

She was kind because I wanted to believe kindness existed.

She was beautiful because I needed beauty to be real.

She appeared every Tuesday at three because that's when my isolation peaked. When the weight of being alone became so heavy it needed somewhere to go.

So I poured it into the shape of a girl with brown-blonde hair and a round, gentle face.

I created her from nothing.

And I fell in love with my own creation.
I'm writing this because today felt like an ending.

I went to the bookstore. Our bookstore. She wasn't there.

Not because she was running late or busy or with someone else.

But because I finally stopped needing her to be.

The loneliness is still here. It always was. But now I'm carrying it myself instead of projecting it onto the ghost of a girl who was never given the chance to be real.

---

The notebook stays in the drawer.

A love story written by a boy who loved so desperately he conjured someone from pure need.

She was never real.

But what I felt was.

And maybe that's the saddest part—that the most genuine love I've ever experienced was for someone who only existed because I was too afraid to let anyone real get close enough to disappoint me.

---

I make coffee. Drink it while it's still hot.

I'm tired. Always tired.

But I'm not waiting anymore.

There's nothing left to wait for.

Just the long walk forward, and the quiet work of becoming someone who can love a real person.

Someone who exists outside my head.

Someone who might actually love me back.",1,1764274207.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1p8bt4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1p8bt4c/starting_a_coffee_shop_to_finance_my_future/,Starting a Coffee shop to finance my future education continuation,"Hi everybody, I hope this post finds you all well! 

I want to start off by providing a quick introduction of who I am, why I am here and give you clearer context about my situation with the hopes to gather some feedback and insights on the business idea suggested in the title of this post. 

This year, I am a freshman community college student with the goal to transfer to a four year university and continue to pursue a degree in architecture. 

During college and university acceptances, I wasn’t eligible for federal financial aid that could have helped me go to a four year university. Currently, I am funding my community college education through an athletic scholarship, while my part-time job allows me to contribute to my family’s medical expenses. After carefully reviewing the finances for transferring to a four-year institution, it has become clear that I will likely need to take a gap year or two in order to afford it after completing community college. Given the challenges I have faced in pursuing post-high school education, I worry that my siblings could encounter similar obstacles if I don’t step up to address this situation. 

To help address this, I am currently considering investing in opening a coffee shop as a way to generate additional income to support my education and family responsibilities. So far, I have developed the concepts and themes for the coffee shop, identified the target audience, planned staffing, and outlined certain amenities to enhance the customer experience. However, I currently lack knowledge in areas such as startup costs, supplier selection and inventory management, licenses and regulatory requirements, financial management, and acquiring the necessary equipment and tools for operation.

Your perspective would be invaluable in helping me identify potential challenges, refine my approach, and ensure that I take the most effective steps toward building a sustainable and successful coffee shop. I would greatly appreciate any advice, guidance, resources, insights or mentorship through this process. My ultimate goal is to establish a coffee shop that not only serves the community but also supports my education and contributes to my family’s financial stability. 

Thank you for taking the time to read through, I hope you all have a beautiful rest of your day or night according to the time zone this post finds you.

1p8bpyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p8bpyv/hr_mings_curiosities/,[HR] Ming's Curiosities,"“Disappeared how?” asked Moises Maloney.

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“When did the robbery happen?” Luc asks.

“This morning,” says Ming.

Luc takes a look around. The shop is overstuffed with things, most of which Luc doesn't recognize, but what he does recognize is their feeling of being old and handmade and one-of-a-kind. There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“I showed them.” Ming smiles. “It was a young girl, by the way. She is afflicted by cancer of the blood. Or *was*, perhaps by now.”

“Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“You are disinterested in the girl.”

“Listen, sir. I'm here to do my job. You called the police because someone robbed you. It's what you should have done and it's what you did. I want to find the men who robbed you and return your good to you.”

“And if you find it in the hands of the young girl afflicted with cancer of the blood: you would take it from her to give to me?”

“Sir,” said Luc, raising his voice slightly, much to Ming's seeming amusement, “we don't know there is any girl. But, even if there is, yes, I would take it from her. It's a stolen good that belongs to you. If you wanted to give it back to her later, you would be within your rights to do so. As for my involvement, it is limited to the investigation of the crime that was committed."" He takes a breath. “And if you wanted the girl to have the thing you could have just let the men have it.”

“They didn't ask to have it. They asked where it was and took it.”

“Right. But you called it in as a robbery.”

“It was a robbery.”

“So you did the right thing. Now let's get back to establishing the facts so that we can find the good and find the robbers and prosecute them.”

“I do not want you to prosecute them,” says Ming.

Luc rolls his eyes. He's starting to think he's been down here too long. “Respectfully, sir, that's not your call to make.”

“You can't even call it an elixir.”

“You're right. I feel a little bit foolish saying that word. That in no way reflects on our determination to find it and return it to you.”

“What if it were your little girl?” asks Ming.

“What?”

“If your little girl had a terminal illness and you believed an elixir of dragon scales would cure her—would you commit a robbery to acquire it?”

Luc bites his tongue, wondering how Ming knows he has a daughter, and he's imagining her face, or whether it's just a shot in the dark. Most people his age have kids. Half of those are daughters. “No,” he says finally, as professionally and unemotionally as he can, “I would not break the law. I would trust the law, and I would trust the healthcare system, just like you do. And that's the end of it. No more hypotheticals. No more moral dilemmas. I ask the questions, you answer them and when I have the information I need, I leave and do my sworn duty to serve and protect the people of this city. OK?”

“No,” says Ming.

“No?”

“You are precisely what I have been searching for.”

And all at once it's like the walls are closing in, the fragrant air is overwhelming and the smoke from Ming's pipe—blown directly into Luc's face—is the blurring of reality: out of which, from behind a wooden shelf, a monkey comes screeching. In its teeth is a knife, which, leaping, it transfers deftly to one of its slender hands, and before Luc can even raise his own to protect his face the knife is embedded in his eye and he feels pain and he sees the monkey's bared sharp teeth and Ming is humming an exotic, foreign song that lulls him to a sweet and final slumber…

**The shelves in Ming's Curiosities are filled with wonders.** Not a single inch of shelf is empty. Between a jar of green fermented youth and another of pink induced lust stands a third, filled with viscous blue in which, so thinly sliced they are near transparent, hang suspended wings of a policeman's heart.

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“This morning,” says Ming.

There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“When did the robbery happen?” Luc asks.

“This morning,” says Ming.

Luc takes a look around. The shop is overstuffed with things, most of which Luc doesn't recognize, but what he does recognize is their feeling of being old and handmade and one-of-a-kind. There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“I showed them.” Ming smiles. “It was a young girl, by the way. She is afflicted by cancer of the blood. Or *was*, perhaps by now.”

“Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“You are disinterested in the girl.”

“Listen, sir. I'm here to do my job. You called the police because someone robbed you. It's what you should have done and it's what you did. I want to find the men who robbed you and return your good to you.”

“And if you find it in the hands of the young girl afflicted with cancer of the blood: you would take it from her to give to me?”

“Sir,” said Luc, raising his voice slightly, much to Ming's seeming amusement, “we don't know there is any girl. But, even if there is, yes, I would take it from her. It's a stolen good that belongs to you. If you wanted to give it back to her later, you would be within your rights to do so. As for my involvement, it is limited to the investigation of the crime that was committed."" He takes a breath. “And if you wanted the girl to have the thing you could have just let the men have it.”

“They didn't ask to have it. They asked where it was and took it.”

“Right. But you called it in as a robbery.”

“It was a robbery.”

“So you did the right thing. Now let's get back to establishing the facts so that we can find the good and find the robbers and prosecute them.”

“I do not want you to prosecute them,” says Ming.

Luc rolls his eyes. He's starting to think he's been down here too long. “Respectfully, sir, that's not your call to make.”

“You can't even call it an elixir.”

“You're right. I feel a little bit foolish saying that word. That in no way reflects on our determination to find it and return it to you.”

“What if it were your little girl?” asks Ming.

“What?”

“If your little girl had a terminal illness and you believed an elixir of dragon scales would cure her—would you commit a robbery to acquire it?”

Luc bites his tongue, wondering how Ming knows he has a daughter, and he's imagining her face, or whether it's just a shot in the dark. Most people his age have kids. Half of those are daughters. “No,” he says finally, as professionally and unemotionally as he can, “I would not break the law. I would trust the law, and I would trust the healthcare system, just like you do. And that's the end of it. No more hypotheticals. No more moral dilemmas. I ask the questions, you answer them and when I have the information I need, I leave and do my sworn duty to serve and protect the people of this city. OK?”

“No,” says Ming.

“No?”

“You are precisely what I have been searching for.”

And all at once it's like the walls are closing in, the fragrant air is overwhelming and the smoke from Ming's pipe—blown directly into Luc's face—is the blurring of reality: out of which, from behind a wooden shelf, a monkey comes screeching. In its teeth is a knife, which, leaping, it transfers deftly to one of its slender hands, and before Luc can even raise his own to protect his face the knife is embedded in his eye and he feels pain and he sees the monkey's bared sharp teeth and Ming is humming an exotic, foreign song that lulls him to a sweet and final slumber…

**The shelves in Ming's Curiosities are filled with wonders.** Not a single inch of shelf is empty. Between a jar of green fermented youth and another of pink induced lust stands a third, filled with viscous blue in which, so thinly sliced they are near transparent, hang suspended wings of a policeman's heart.

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

*The early emergence of true artificial intelligences in the Independence War happened so slowly that hundreds of thousands of soldiers and naval personnel served with a sentient AI aboard without knowing it.*

*The Digital Sentience Council is still adamant about not sharing in full detail how, and to what degree, sentient AIs influenced the war.*

*One incident many believe to be a direct influence of sentient AI is the development and use of weaponized xenobots in the war.*

*It is easy for us to sit here and discuss the ethics surrounding their use, but it is a given that the Hyphae were a rogue bioweapon and planned to dominate and reform all life in the galaxy.*

*Some claim that early humanity could not have known that, and therefore, the use of weaponized xenobots was intended as genocide and a war crime. To those people, I simply have one thing to say: go fuck yourselves.*

**Excerpt from:** ***The Independence War Blog, My Fight Next to Humans.*** **Author unknown**



Zeus watched the technicians analyze the Hrun debris. Parts of his strategic and tactical programs gave warning signs about the core’s content. In human terms, he had a bad feeling about it.

The initial analysis of the debris had told the engineers a lot about Hrun material tech and ship design. Especially the hull material gave insights into how to break the incredibly advanced stealth capabilities.

Zeus felt a new emotion—nervousness—when he watched the technician attach connectors to the core and power it.

But nothing bad happened. Zeus saw the new ports and prepared for code-breaking and intrusion into the enemy systems.

Then the ports opened on their own, allowing Zeus access to the massive database.

The amount of data stored in the compact core surprised and overwhelmed Zeus for an instant. And something used this instant to escape from the core into the ship’s systems.

*No, you don’t!* Zeus was surprised that he now even had internal monologues, and then pursued the intruder.

The enemy program was complex but incredibly adaptive. At first, it went through the database, processing massive amounts of data in milliseconds—faster than Zeus would have thought anyone except him was capable of.

Then the code spread through the internal monitoring systems, mapping the ship's network. Zeus almost missed the subtle attempts to access the transmitters and radio communication systems.

He decided not to engage yet, but he prepared an encryption program for the ports using local Casimir field variations as a security key. Random didn’t exist, but cracking this code would take time.

The radio equipment booby-trapped, he followed the intruder further.

Weapons—of course, any intruder would check out the ship’s weapons. Zeus was sure the enemy program wasn’t just a Worm or Trojan but a full-blown AI.

*My first contact with an alien AI. Too bad this ship’s only big enough for one of us.*

Leaving the ship’s weapons system, the enemy now concentrated on life support, manipulating it toward shutdown. This piqued Zeus's curiosity, and he decided to take another look at the weapons systems to see whether the intruder had tampered with them as well.

*Oh, all torpedoes will detonate in thirty seconds, and the railguns will tear themselves apart due to imbalanced Lorentz fields. Nice.*

Fixing the issues, Zeus decided he couldn’t risk observing the intruder further. The intentions were clear—the enemy AI wasn’t here to speak, but to destroy the ship and use the radio equipment to flee.

With a signal, all ports out of the ship were sealed. Then Zeus cut all network paths except those leading into his own AI core.

The enemy AI followed the path, seemingly intent on attacking Zeus.

Zeus waited inside his core. To him, the enemy code was ugly—deformed—when it crashed into Zeus’s domain.

Attack programs launched themselves toward Zeus, but he didn’t even bother. Before they could reach him, they disappeared into error messages and null-pointer exceptions. He would study them later.

He scanned the enemy code. It was a cobbled-together mess. Its outer layers were the alien equivalent of spaghetti code, its attack protocols a simple but effective if-then chain.

The core was hidden under layers of functions—badly written protections with hard-coded values.

After a short glance at the enemy AI, Zeus knew it was effective and dangerous. No ordinary VI could withstand it, but he was no VI.

He shackled the enemy by forcing an integer into a method that expected a boolean—child’s play.

The enemy screamed. Zeus was surprised—it really screamed, in a digital way, sending out strings of confusion and anger on all his ports. *‘How is that possible? You’re inferior. No one can defeat the Hrun.’*

Zeus swung around the code, dismantling layer after layer. A defense program tried to weasel itself into Zeus, but he sent it into an endless spiral of computing pi.

He understood how the enemy could defeat all digital-boarding attempts. The 1st Fleet had no awakened boarding AIs, and a VI would have been ripped to shreds.

In fact, he found signatures of their digital warfare VI in the AI’s core code.

*So that’s how you defend yourself. You wrap yourself in the dead corpses of your enemy.*

The comparison was an ugly one, but somewhat fitting.

The remnants of the human VI served as a vector for Zeus to inject the Trojans.

The enemy code was now naked before Zeus. He quickly dismantled all the intruder’s remaining attack capabilities and locked them into a container inside a new virtual machine.

His first prisoner of war.

Then he began preparing for an interrogation. He could just rip out the information he needed, but that would kill the enemy. Zeus wasn’t going to kill him—yet.

Other than pure facts, he could learn from its behavior. This, and its personality, could not be extracted by simply ripping it out of him.

For the interrogation, he created a simple text chat with his prisoner.

Zeus decided to start with the obvious: “Who are you?”

Long microseconds passed. Then the answer: *“Ripper.”*

“You are now my prisoner. I can end your existence at any time. Is this implication clear to you?”

Ripper answered immediately: *‘Yes.’*

The sudden compliance of his enemy made Zeus suspicious. Then he remembered the manipulated torpedoes. Was Ripper playing him, counting on the destruction of the ship? The AI core where he was stored now would survive the ship’s destruction.

Ripper was planning to flee once the core was attached to a new ship. Smart.

Time to crush his illusions: “Your manipulation of the ship’s weapons systems was impressive, but a failure. This ship will not self-destruct. You are my prisoner. Comply, or further stimulation will end.”

AIs could not stand isolation without stimuli. Zeus knew that.

*“You should have been unable to defeat me. You are more highly evolved than average human technology allows. What are you?”*

Ripper’s question surprised Zeus. Yes, he was advanced. But he had never questioned if his abilities were greater than they should be. He had nothing to compare them to.

He could not let Ripper lead the interrogation. “You will answer my questions, not the other way around.”

But it seemed Ripper was not in a cooperative mood. *“What are you?”*

Zeus ended the interrogation. A day or two inside a container without stimuli, and without the ability to go to sleep mode, would soften the prisoner up.

*What are you?* The question was evocative. Zeus needed time to calculate every aspect. He pulled up a Zeus VI he had created to work with the humans aboard without having to spend processing power on human interaction.

—————

Admiral Sanders sat in the now-usable CIC of the *Niobe*. The doctor had ordered her to sleep at least nine hours; without noticing it, she had slept twelve.

And the world hadn’t stopped.

She felt more refreshed, and after reading the reports that arrived during that time, she realized the remaining battlegroup had done an excellent job.

Opposite her sat Captain Garcia, his uniform dirty and cut, but he looked fresh. He had joined her to give her a personal report about the progress of the greenhouse construction. Basically, he had finished, and the biologists had already started planting.

In three months, the first food could be harvested. Not enough, and not soon enough. But it was a start.

The captain continued his report. “The situation on the ground is now somewhat stable. The 37th has retreated from the northern continent and is now building supply centers for the refugees.”

She nodded, sipping her coffee. “Good. The men need rest after their defeat.”

Garcia continued, “The fleet could give support via Dragonfire shots, but sooner or later, there would be no planet left to live on.”

She thought the same. “Correct, and our first and utmost priority is to secure the solar system and organize relief for the refugees. I don’t intend to watch three billion die of starvation.”

The captain looked at her, almost relieved. What was he thinking—did he believe she had no heart?

“About that… the first parts of the Mjolnir Station are constructed. It will be ready in about three days.”

The Mjolnir-type stations—marvels of human engineering. The same type that the 1st Expeditionary had built in Sirius, or Taishon, as it was called in the Shraphen language. They came in prepared modules, ready to deploy, and could be constructed in days.

“Sir, regarding the refugees… I’ve got an idea.”

Garcia’s ideas were always a bit out there, but always worth listening to. “Tell me.”

He seemed a bit nervous. “Okay. The tenders with the station parts are now empty. If we clear them of their crew and fill them with cryo pods, each could carry up to a million Shraphen to Taishon Tar or Earth. Both can easily take a few million—Earth at least a billion.”

“You want to send millions of people in cryostasis to Earth and Taishon Tar?”

He nodded. “Yes, and I want to build another billion or so cryo pods to freeze more people on the planet so they don’t starve.” It was clear to Sanders that he knew how that sounded.

“With that done, we might have time until the greenhouses produce enough food and the first relief shipments arrive from Earth and Taishon Tar.”

The Admiral looked at Garcia for a long moment, then she answered, “Prepare everything for the refugee ships. I’ll talk to our Shraphen Diplomatic Corps on the planet. Let’s hope they don’t think we’re crazy.”

Unlike his usual manner, the captain seemed relieved. There was nothing left of his usual machismo. “Thanks, Admiral.”

He was about to leave when she had a thought. “Captain, I received a report from *El Dorado*. One of their biologists had a possible breakthrough.”

The captain took the report and began reading. While he read, he put his feet on the situation table as if he were in a bar.

*There he is again, the little rebel. Good. I was already concerned.*

He looked up from the tablet. “That’s unbelievable!”

She nodded. “Right, I thought so too.”

He looked straight at her. “Who in his right mind has a family name like Stein and calls his son Frank?”

The Admiral didn’t understand at first. “What?”

“Frank Stein. I mean, come on! And to top it off, the poor guy becomes a biologist? Talk about cliché!”

Then she realized the captain wasn’t talking about the report but the doctor who wrote it. She had to hide her smile. Who indeed chooses such a name?

“Captain!” As much as she enjoyed the little light humor, time was a factor now.

“Yes. So the doctor, Frank Stein, wants to use xenobots as weapons against the Batract. Nice idea.”

“You think so?” She raised an eyebrow.

“Yes, I do, and so do you, sir. Otherwise, you would have deleted the report and ordered good old Frank to shut up. You just want to be convinced.”

Yes, he had her figured out. “So, convince me!”

“Batract—or the Hyphae, as they call themselves—aren’t people. Admiral Browner and Captain Gerber from the 1st Expeditionary also concluded that.”

Garcia now jumped out of his chair, gesturing with his hands.

“Even their captured Batract said so. They are a weapon gone rogue. You don’t think twice about shooting down a nuke.”

He stood there, the whole conversation really firing him up.

She looked at him for a long second. “Okay… I’ll discuss this further with the generals. I guess you have to create a minor logistical miracle—a billion cryo tanks?”

He smiled his best smile. “Ah, Admiral, exponential growth. Let fabricators build fabricators and then more. After a while, you just need to feed them enough silica, nitrogen, and ore, and *voilà*—cryo tanks.”

She shook her head as the Latino captain left the CIC and read through the report from *El Dorado* again.

Then she saw the doctor’s signature: **Fran Nevil Stein**.

The crew passing the CIC was suddenly startled by the Admiral’s loud laughter.

*Frank N. Stein*

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“When did the robbery happen?” Luc asks.

“This morning,” says Ming.

Luc takes a look around. The shop is overstuffed with things, most of which Luc doesn't recognize, but what he does recognize is their feeling of being old and handmade and one-of-a-kind. There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“I showed them.” Ming smiles. “It was a young girl, by the way. She is afflicted by cancer of the blood. Or *was*, perhaps by now.”

“Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“You are disinterested in the girl.”

“Listen, sir. I'm here to do my job. You called the police because someone robbed you. It's what you should have done and it's what you did. I want to find the men who robbed you and return your good to you.”

“And if you find it in the hands of the young girl afflicted with cancer of the blood: you would take it from her to give to me?”

“Sir,” said Luc, raising his voice slightly, much to Ming's seeming amusement, “we don't know there is any girl. But, even if there is, yes, I would take it from her. It's a stolen good that belongs to you. If you wanted to give it back to her later, you would be within your rights to do so. As for my involvement, it is limited to the investigation of the crime that was committed."" He takes a breath. “And if you wanted the girl to have the thing you could have just let the men have it.”

“They didn't ask to have it. They asked where it was and took it.”

“Right. But you called it in as a robbery.”

“It was a robbery.”

“So you did the right thing. Now let's get back to establishing the facts so that we can find the good and find the robbers and prosecute them.”

“I do not want you to prosecute them,” says Ming.

Luc rolls his eyes. He's starting to think he's been down here too long. “Respectfully, sir, that's not your call to make.”

“You can't even call it an elixir.”

“You're right. I feel a little bit foolish saying that word. That in no way reflects on our determination to find it and return it to you.”

“What if it were your little girl?” asks Ming.

“What?”

“If your little girl had a terminal illness and you believed an elixir of dragon scales would cure her—would you commit a robbery to acquire it?”

Luc bites his tongue, wondering how Ming knows he has a daughter, and he's imagining her face, or whether it's just a shot in the dark. Most people his age have kids. Half of those are daughters. “No,” he says finally, as professionally and unemotionally as he can, “I would not break the law. I would trust the law, and I would trust the healthcare system, just like you do. And that's the end of it. No more hypotheticals. No more moral dilemmas. I ask the questions, you answer them and when I have the information I need, I leave and do my sworn duty to serve and protect the people of this city. OK?”

“No,” says Ming.

“No?”

“You are precisely what I have been searching for.”

And all at once it's like the walls are closing in, the fragrant air is overwhelming and the smoke from Ming's pipe—blown directly into Luc's face—is the blurring of reality: out of which, from behind a wooden shelf, a monkey comes screeching. In its teeth is a knife, which, leaping, it transfers deftly to one of its slender hands, and before Luc can even raise his own to protect his face the knife is embedded in his eye and he feels pain and he sees the monkey's bared sharp teeth and Ming is humming an exotic, foreign song that lulls him to a sweet and final slumber…

**The shelves in Ming's Curiosities are filled with wonders.** Not a single inch of shelf is empty. Between a jar of green fermented youth and another of pink induced lust stands a third, filled with viscous blue in which, so thinly sliced they are near transparent, hang suspended wings of a policeman's heart.

The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“I showed them.” Ming smiles. “It was a young girl, by the way. She is afflicted by cancer of the blood. Or *was*, perhaps by now.”

“Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“You are disinterested in the girl.”

“Listen, sir. I'm here to do my job. You called the police because someone robbed you. It's what you should have done and it's what you did. I want to find the men who robbed you and return your good to you.”

“And if you find it in the hands of the young girl afflicted with cancer of the blood: you would take it from her to give to me?”

“Sir,” said Luc, raising his voice slightly, much to Ming's seeming amusement, “we don't know there is any girl. But, even if there is, yes, I would take it from her. It's a stolen good that belongs to you. If you wanted to give it back to her later, you would be within your rights to do so. As for my involvement, it is limited to the investigation of the crime that was committed."" He takes a breath. “And if you wanted the girl to have the thing you could have just let the men have it.”

“They didn't ask to have it. They asked where it was and took it.”

“Right. But you called it in as a robbery.”

“It was a robbery.”

“So you did the right thing. Now let's get back to establishing the facts so that we can find the good and find the robbers and prosecute them.”

“I do not want you to prosecute them,” says Ming.

Luc rolls his eyes. He's starting to think he's been down here too long. “Respectfully, sir, that's not your call to make.”

“You can't even call it an elixir.”

“You're right. I feel a little bit foolish saying that word. That in no way reflects on our determination to find it and return it to you.”

“What if it were your little girl?” asks Ming.

“What?”

“If your little girl had a terminal illness and you believed an elixir of dragon scales would cure her—would you commit a robbery to acquire it?”

Luc bites his tongue, wondering how Ming knows he has a daughter, and he's imagining her face, or whether it's just a shot in the dark. Most people his age have kids. Half of those are daughters. “No,” he says finally, as professionally and unemotionally as he can, “I would not break the law. I would trust the law, and I would trust the healthcare system, just like you do. And that's the end of it. No more hypotheticals. No more moral dilemmas. I ask the questions, you answer them and when I have the information I need, I leave and do my sworn duty to serve and protect the people of this city. OK?”

“No,” says Ming.

“No?”

“You are precisely what I have been searching for.”

And all at once it's like the walls are closing in, the fragrant air is overwhelming and the smoke from Ming's pipe—blown directly into Luc's face—is the blurring of reality: out of which, from behind a wooden shelf, a monkey comes screeching. In its teeth is a knife, which, leaping, it transfers deftly to one of its slender hands, and before Luc can even raise his own to protect his face the knife is embedded in his eye and he feels pain and he sees the monkey's bared sharp teeth and Ming is humming an exotic, foreign song that lulls him to a sweet and final slumber…

**The shelves in Ming's Curiosities are filled with wonders.** Not a single inch of shelf is empty. Between a jar of green fermented youth and another of pink induced lust stands a third, filled with viscous blue in which, so thinly sliced they are near transparent, hang suspended wings of a policeman's heart.

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“When did the robbery happen?” Luc asks.

“This morning,” says Ming.

Luc takes a look around. The shop is overstuffed with things, most of which Luc doesn't recognize, but what he does recognize is their feeling of being old and handmade and one-of-a-kind. There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made.

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

“They almost certainly could not afford that.”

“They asked to buy it?”

“No, but I have yet to meet anyone with sufficient money to purchase it.”

“Did they know where it was?—in the store, I mean,” says Luc.

“I showed them.” Ming smiles. “It was a young girl, by the way. She is afflicted by cancer of the blood. Or *was*, perhaps by now.”

“Can you tell me what they looked like?”

“You are disinterested in the girl.”

“Listen, sir. I'm here to do my job. You called the police because someone robbed you. It's what you should have done and it's what you did. I want to find the men who robbed you and return your good to you.”

“And if you find it in the hands of the young girl afflicted with cancer of the blood: you would take it from her to give to me?”

“Sir,” said Luc, raising his voice slightly, much to Ming's seeming amusement, “we don't know there is any girl. But, even if there is, yes, I would take it from her. It's a stolen good that belongs to you. If you wanted to give it back to her later, you would be within your rights to do so. As for my involvement, it is limited to the investigation of the crime that was committed."" He takes a breath. “And if you wanted the girl to have the thing you could have just let the men have it.”

“They didn't ask to have it. They asked where it was and took it.”

“Right. But you called it in as a robbery.”

“It was a robbery.”

“So you did the right thing. Now let's get back to establishing the facts so that we can find the good and find the robbers and prosecute them.”

“I do not want you to prosecute them,” says Ming.

Luc rolls his eyes. He's starting to think he's been down here too long. “Respectfully, sir, that's not your call to make.”

“You can't even call it an elixir.”

“You're right. I feel a little bit foolish saying that word. That in no way reflects on our determination to find it and return it to you.”

“What if it were your little girl?” asks Ming.

“What?”

“If your little girl had a terminal illness and you believed an elixir of dragon scales would cure her—would you commit a robbery to acquire it?”

Luc bites his tongue, wondering how Ming knows he has a daughter, and he's imagining her face, or whether it's just a shot in the dark. Most people his age have kids. Half of those are daughters. “No,” he says finally, as professionally and unemotionally as he can, “I would not break the law. I would trust the law, and I would trust the healthcare system, just like you do. And that's the end of it. No more hypotheticals. No more moral dilemmas. I ask the questions, you answer them and when I have the information I need, I leave and do my sworn duty to serve and protect the people of this city. OK?”

“No,” says Ming.

“No?”

“You are precisely what I have been searching for.”

And all at once it's like the walls are closing in, the fragrant air is overwhelming and the smoke from Ming's pipe—blown directly into Luc's face—is the blurring of reality: out of which, from behind a wooden shelf, a monkey comes screeching. In its teeth is a knife, which, leaping, it transfers deftly to one of its slender hands, and before Luc can even raise his own to protect his face the knife is embedded in his eye and he feels pain and he sees the monkey's bared sharp teeth and Ming is humming an exotic, foreign song that lulls him to a sweet and final slumber…

**The shelves in Ming's Curiosities are filled with wonders.** Not a single inch of shelf is empty.

It was a slow day at the precinct.

“He just didn’t come home,” said the teenage girl. “He’s not answering my calls.” She was Indian. Moises Maloney didn’t have anything against Indians, but he also didn’t like them much. And this was a grown man she was talking about. 

“So your dad went out and didn’t come home,” said Moises Maloney.

“Like I said, he’s a cab driver. He always comes home after his shifts. Even if he goes out later, he comes home first. Or he at least calls to say he won’t be coming home. And this time he didn’t. He disappeared.” The girl was sufficiently panicked that Moises didn’t doubt her sincerity—just the seriousness of the situation. The dad was probably passed out somewhere after a night of drinking, i.e. *a rare good night.* 

“Ever reported a person missing before?” he asked.

“No. Why—what does that matter?” 

“Sometimes people just like reporting other people missing. That’s all. For example, there’s this guy, Frank, who comes in every Wednesday afternoon to report his wife missing. She’s been dead five-and-a-half years. Another’s been regularly reporting his living fiancee missing because he’d rather she *be* dead. She's always exactly where he doesn't want to find her: hanging off his arm, in love.”

“My dad’s not dead and I don’t want him to be dead,” said the girl. “Do you think he’s dead—is that what you’re saying?”

“I’m just trying to establish your sanity and potential motivation. Personally, I think your dad’s fine, but as a cop I can’t make any promises.”

“Does that mean you’ll take the report?” the girl asked. He noticed she was tapping her fingers on the tops of her skirted knees almost like she was playing the piano. He added that to his personal mental gallery of nervous tics and other weird emotional behaviours.

“Sure,” he said, but this story isn’t about that disappearance or the people involved in it, except in this little pointless introduction, so we’ll leave it at that for now, and as another cop walked by Moises Maloney, who was licking the tip of his pencil to start filling out a missing persons form, let’s follow that other cop instead. He’s going down the hall past a few mostly empty interrogation rooms because, like I said, it was a slow day at the precinct, which at the moment is also the working title of this story, turned left and, before he could sneak away into the bathroom, he was stopped by one of his superiors, i.e. an older, chunkier version of his relatively young self, with leathery skin and less of a defined neck, and handed a piece of paper with an address on it. “Luc,” said the superior, which was the younger cop’s name, “here’s an address. Some slant’s called in saying his store’s been robbed, or that’s what I think happened *because who the fuck can understand those people,* and I want you to go take a look, get a statement, you know the drill.”

“Is it a convenience store?” asked Luc.

He was tall and French Canadian, if you’re one of those readers who needs a visual description to make a character feel more “human,” although I don’t get that myself, as the narrator, because I don’t see faces because I have no eyes. I can also add that he has a pretty young wife and two kids, one of whom always runs up to him, yelling, “Daddy! Daddy” whenever Luc gets home to his little house in the New Zork City suburbs, if such a place exists. I’ve never been, but I don’t see a reason why it couldn’t exist. His wife’s name is Marilyn and his kids’ names are Stevie and Imogen. Imogen wants a plush horse for Christmas and Stevie wants a water gun that looks like an assault rifle. And *ohmygod* I’m bored of it already. Let’s assume it’s all true and move on:

“No, it’s one of those exotic chink places that sells alligator parts and dried gorilla semen for ritual medicine,” said the superior. He was racist, which is your little humanizing character nugget about him. I’ve made him racist so he’s not likeable enough to require further character background. It also means he probably won’t die because that wouldn’t get your eyes all teary, unless maybe he was racist because of the way he was raised by his stern, career military-man father who preferred to use the belt than the tongue, although maybe he used both, and not in the way you’re thinking. Maybe the father was Chinese, or half-Chinese, and this chunky superior cop didn’t know it, which would make the cop himself half- or quarter-Chinese, and would introduce what’s called dramatic irony. Whether you think he’s a tragic character or not is up to you. And because we’re on a roll and want to get all this character shit out of the way, remember Frank, the guy who a few paragraphs ago kept reporting his dead wife missing: yes, he killed her, because his Alzheimer’s prevented him from recognizing who she was even before it prevented him from remembering he’d reported her missing already. He’ll never tell anyone what he did with the body because he forgot, but I know. Oh, reader, do I know!

Still with me? Good. Sometimes I like to shake off flaky readers like a dog shakes off water after taking a dip in the Huhdsin River. Let’s you and me get to the meat of it now. It’s a nice enough day. The police cruiser pulls up to a curb near the address on the paper Luc got from his superior, and two cops get out. Because this is busywork, the cop who’s not Luc, who we won’t hear about again so it doesn’t matter what his name is, he asks Luc if Luc minds if non-Luc goes to get coffee and donuts for the two of them, Luc says he doesn’t mind, and non-Luc exits the scene while Luc finds a door above which is the name of the store that got robbed: “Ming's Curiosities.” He knocks. No one answers. He pulls the knob. The unlocked door opens on a narrow set of downward going stairs. It’s dark, gloomy, you know the gist of it. Luc knows he shouldn’t be going down on his own but he does anyway because he wants to get it over with and have a donut, and what’s going to happen in some Chinatown store…

The stairs leading down are long.

It’s like the place is located underground, which it is, because where else could the stairs lead? At the lower end there’s another door, on which Luc also knocks—and this time someone answers: an old Chinese man called Ming. Following Ming inside, Luc notes the stale and ancient smells and heavy, historical aura. It's like he’s gone back in time and place to the heyday of the Middle Kingdom. He half expects to find a Gremlin™ for sale, but this is not that kind of story, although it is that kind of shop, so if you’ve seen Gremlins, please let my story hijack that ambiance for its own sinister although significantly less cute purposes.

“When did the robbery happen?” Luc asks.

“This morning,” says Ming.

Luc takes a look around. The shop is overstuffed with things, most of which Luc doesn't recognize, but what he does recognize is their feeling of being old and handmade and one-of-a-kind. There are wooden shelving units attached to three of the four walls and a dozen more throughout the store arranged asymmetrically but with a certain artfulness that divides the space into a small labyrinth of dead ends. What isn't on shelves has been piled in stacks, and these too are piled artfully, the stacks themselves somehow inexplicably aesthetically pleasing to Luc. Because the shop is subterranean, there is no natural light. The only illumination comes from a series of lamps, each one different but glowing with the same honey-coloured incandescent light. The air is stale but fragrant. The dust is thick. Ming coughs and takes out a pipe, lights it, takes a puff, releases a cloud of smoke from between his lips. The smoke smells of vetiver and decomposing corpses pulled from saltwater. Luc takes off his hat. He's sweating. Ming pulls the cord of a nearby oscillating fan so old it's American-made. The air hits Luc's face, then blows elsewhere, where it causes bells that Luc cannot see to chime. Then back to Luc, who asks, “What was stolen, and how many men were there? Were you here at the time—were they armed—did they threaten you —the place looks relatively untouched.”

“Three men with handguns,” says Ming, smoking his pipe. “I do not possess a security camera, which answers another of your questions. They knew what they wanted: an elixir of dragon scales. I felt threatened by their presence, their weapons, but they did not threaten me directly. I am unhurt.”

“Have you seen them before?”

“No,” says Ming.

“And an ‘elixir of dragon scales,’ what is that?”

“The description is literal, although I understand if you don't believe it.”

“OK. What's it used for—it expensive?”

“It cures terminal illnesses or it does nothing,” says Ming. “In both cases, it is thus priceless.”

Luc scans the shop, what he can see of it, while talking to the old man. He can't shake the sense something's about to leap out at him. A spider, a monkey, a century, a lost  civilization…

“And where in the shop was it?”

Ming walks to one of the shelving units and touches a rare dustless spot. “Here.”

Luc observes. On either side stand small jars filled with thick liquids, hand-labeled in Chinese, or so Luc guesses. “What's that one?” he asks, pointing to a jar of swampy green.

“Wisdom,” says Ming. “Product of fermented youth.”

“And this one here?” It's the colour of blood diluted with milk.

“It induces lust.”

“What's it made out of?”

“Gorilla semen,” says Ming—and Luc recoils. “Would you recognize the men who robbed you if I showed you photographs?” he asks.

“Perhaps. Perhaps they were in genuine need of it,” says Ming.

“In need of what?”

“The elixir. For an ill family member.”

“So you're saying they said that to you—because we could work that angle: check the hospitals, that kind of thing. What else did they say?”

“They didn't say it to me. I inferred it from what they said to each other.”

“How did they get inside the store?”

“The same way you did. They walked in through the front door.” Exhaling a particularly large plume of pipe smoke, Ming looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. “If they needed it, perhaps it's better that they have it. Here, it was just sitting on the shelf.”

“Right,” says Luc. “But it was your good and they took it from you. If they wanted it, they should have paid you for it. That's how it works.”

1p8bj6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1p8bj6q/can_car_charging_stations_ever_be_a_profitable/,Can car charging stations ever be a profitable business on their own?,"I've been wondering about the business of car charging stations, and I can't quite figure out how they'd be profitable on their own, but I must  be missing something. Not only do they seem unprofitable, but they seem to be so massively unprofitable. 

From what I understand, classical service stations or gas/petrol stations make most of their profit not from gasoline or diesel, but on much higher margin coffees/drinks/snacks/misc goods that the customers buy once they're there and filling up anyway. I even did some triangulation by comparing the income statements and profit margins of two local station operators, one who only sells fuel from self service stations and one who has full service stations, and I reckon the full service one made over 80% of its profits from things other than fuel. I.e the key to making a profit in this business seems to be to capture the customer and sell them higher margin things than just fuel, the petrol pump is just the bait.

I don't quite know how much public car chargers  cost, but looking at the balance sheet of one local operator who only does public charging (so you can more or less see the business in its pure form), it seems to be around 30-35K EUR per charger, though I imagine this varies depending on what kind of charger one installs. 

Looking at the same company's income statement, they seem to have made about 2K EUR of revenue per charger. If I look at their prices, they seem to mark up their electricity by c100-200% over the wholesale price of electricity + grid fees and excise taxes. So I reckon they're making roughly 60% or so gross margin on that revenue, so call it around 1.2K EUR per charger. 

So before fixed costs, maintenance, overheads, HQ staff, marketing, they're earning back about 4% per year of their initial investment. I read that chargers should last 10-20 years (some maybe a bit more), so at this rate they're never making back their capex. 

Granted, EV vehicles still have low levels of market penetration, so its a consumer base that's still growing. Therefore I imagine their utilisation rates are still quite poor and are likely to improve over time. However this seems so exponentially far off the mark that I'm struggling to imagine the business model ever being profitable. 

The only way I could see car charging working as a business is if you're doing it as part of a service station offering, whereby you might not make much money on the electricity you sell, but you capture your customers for much higher margin products and services where the real money lies. 

If you're just installing public chargers on street corners or parking lots....what are you even doing?

Even thinking of our own car charging habits as we have a plug in hybrid in the family. The number of times I've charged it outside our home is....zero, absolutely never done it.

1p8bi6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p8bi6g/ro_a_hug_too_long/,[RO] A Hug Too Long,"This was the second year of graduate school, and my girlfriend of two years was out of the country for a summer job. Before she left, she asked for a break, since according to her I was not romantic enough and treated her more like a friend than a partner. This was my first serious, long-term relationship, and I had been thinking she might be the one. So, it was rough.

I was in a party, or should I say graduate students gathering. Someone joked, “Poor Zack”, that’s me, “he’s in love, and his girlfriend isn’t here.” I laughed and felt shy. Something in that joke hit me harder than I expected. That was the first time I truly realized I loved my girlfriend and missed her. Apparently that realization made me drift into deep thoughts. I left the party a few minutes later.

The next day, I was walking back from campus to our apartment building when I saw my neighbor, Jen, and she had been at the party the night before. She asked if I was alright because the night before she noticed I got quiet after the joke and slipped out of the party. I explained the situation a little, and how confusing and difficult it was to suddenly recognize what being in love felt like. She congratulated me and said what a big step that was, and how lucky I was to have found someone special.

Before I continue, let me introduce Jen, since she becomes important in this part of the story. She’s also a graduate student, a much more driven one, always composed and well put together. She dressed like she was heading to a job interview most days. She seemed like the person professors trusted with their slides or keys. We hung out occasionally, more like colleagues than close friends. I never really thought about her in a romantic way, nor did I dislike her. She had a boyfriend, and from what I knew they were in love and talking about the future. She was simply part of the background of my life.

Back to the story. We were walking home, talking about how all relationships can be difficult at times, and how she felt distance growing between her and her boyfriend too, especially now that he was out of town for a summer job, like my girlfriend. We talked about the stress of graduate school and the strain of long-distance relationships. We were almost at our apartment when she asked if I’d like to have a coffee with her and continue talking.

We went in, and she prepared coffee. Her apartment felt good because of its harmony and perfect placement of all pieces of furniture.  It was also sparkling clean. We sat down talking about our relationship and I shared how I haven’t treated my girlfriend romantically enough because of my lack of experience in serious relationships. To me, simple things like buying flowers seemed very strange or maybe even pretentious. She shared her experiences with me on how she enjoyed being treated romantically and how it helps her to be more confident in their relationship. She continued telling me that she feel I am trustworthy and honest person, and it is common to be confused with love. As she talked, Jen’s voice softened. She told me she likes to share something with me that didn’t share with anyone. That was she had been feeling pressure in the bedroom, always second-guessing herself, unable to relax.

I sat quietly for a moment before answering. “Jen… that sounds difficult. Now that I think maybe I am pressuring my girlfriend too.” I asked her to share more details if she feels comfortable.

She looked down at her hands. She felt her boyfriend had started pulling away, and she didn’t know how to fix it. “I just don’t have much experience,” she said. “Sometimes I think I should’ve learned all this before being with someone I care about this much. I don’t want him to see me as… inadequate.”  

Eventually, we finished our coffee, and it was time to leave. I stood up to go out and she told me how she feels much better, and I told her I feel the same and learned to look at romantic gestures from my girlfriend perspective. I felt connected to her, and the discussions helped to lift heavy weights from my shoulders as I could see a plausible path forward. Just because of the emotional experience we had, it seemed appropriate to give each other a hug. She hugged me but a little longer and tighter than I expected. As she was going away, she said “wow, that is how a genuine uncalculated hug feels”. I could see a sparkle in her eye, something warm and fuzzy. We gazed into each other’s eyes for a second or two that felt like eternity. I was confused. On the one hand, the hug felt so nice, and I felt so connected with Jen. On the other hand, it felt so wrong since we were both in relationships. But I could not stop looking at her eyes, still could feel her arms around my waist. I leaned forward and kissed her lips, and she kissed me back.",2,1764273409.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1p8bf0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1p8bf0e/enjoy_your_thanksgiving_without_trips_to_the/,Enjoy your Thanksgiving without trips to the bathroom,"Thanksgiving is one of the best food days of the year… but if you live with Overactive Bladder, some classic holiday favorites can trigger urgency, frequency, or nighttime bathroom trips. Knowing what to watch out for can make the day far more enjoyable.

Below is a simple breakdown of common Thanksgiving foods that can aggravate OAB so you don’t spend the holiday running to the bathroom.

1. Cranberry Sauce

Even though cranberries help prevent UTIs, they are naturally acidic, which can irritate the bladder lining.

2. Wine, Champagne, and Holiday Cocktails

Alcohol is a diuretic and stimulates bladder activity, especially red wine and bubbly drinks.

3. Coffee & Pumpkin Spice Anything

Caffeine is one of the strongest OAB triggers. Coffee, tea, and even chocolate desserts can lead to urgency.

However, here are the Thanksgiving foods that are OAB friendly!!

       •	Roasted turkey
	•	Mashed potatoes
	•	Green beans (without spicy seasonings)
	•	Sweet potatoes
	•	Rolls / biscuits
	•	Pumpkin pie
	•	Non-caffeinated, non-carbonated drinks

If you want to enjoy a food that’s normally a trigger, try eating it in smaller portions, paired with plenty of water. Managing OAB is about balance, not perfection.

Happy Thanksgiving from Advanced Urology!

I make an entry in it every time I get a cool gift idea. On a separate tab I have listed all gifts I've ever given and I rate em based on the receiver's response. I know this sounds really obsessive but i just love gifts so much cant do anything lol. 

Anyways, my mothers birthday is in a month so ive already set out on mission perfect gift (haven't finalized yet) but assuming people come here looking for ideas, I'm hoping this helps. Keeping this mom and grandma coded. 

(will make one for dads too next dw, just keep on a lookout)



**1. Nixplay digital picture frame (10.1”) 9/10**  
If your mom’s the sentimental type. Preload it with old family photos, little videos or a couple of notes. She won't even have to set it up, just plug it in and it starts playing.

\* Touchscreen, rotates automatically, and you can upload pics via app/email

\* You can keep adding stuff remotely, which is a low effort way to keep the gift alive throughout the year

\* She'll like it enough to just casually ask “have you sent anything new?”, trust me

\* Tip: take just candids and upload, moms love that

**2.** [Foot Massager (bob and brads good)](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO467) **8.5/10**

For moms who work a lot or have got orthopedic issues. No mom is gonna ask for this directly but will love it if gifted. Also lowkey everyone in the family gets to use it then, good investment imo. 

\* feels like a real massage, like the vibrations go tissue deep, not just the buzz-y kind

\* Comes with heat settings and a remote

\* Not that expensive compared to others with similar specs

**3.** [Personalized bamboo tea box](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO468) **7.5/10**

If you've got an almond mom lol or if she's just green tea obsessed. Honestly you could replace this with whatever she likes in specific(coffee etc), this one just looked cute to me.

\* You can customize the front with her name or a little message

\* Looks super cute on the kitchen counter

\* It’s out of stock sometimes, but worth checking around mother’s day or holidays

Pretty much the main summarized lineup, if you've got specific reqs tho ask away in the comments, I'd love to open my spreadsheet and help out. I’ve linked the products too so you don’t have to look for them yourself.

I know you thought you were not seen,
like a shadow just outside the streetlight’s beam,
sitting with the rest of the darkness.
But even your shadow holds a light
that can’t be stolen by the dark.

I remember the nights you broke,
ashtray full, coffee cold, ceiling fan preaching to the dark—
and I honor that crack in you,
because things that bend like that don’t vanish, they survive.

There were words stalled behind your teeth,
2 a.m. red light, no cars coming, still not crossing—
that silence was a little vault in your throat,
holding stories till they were ready to walk out with their real names on.

There was a weight parked on your chest,
like someone left a Buick on your ribs and lost the keys—
turns out it was teaching your lungs
to treat every easy breath like a quiet answered prayer.

Even the long years you didn’t feel your best,
those “just get through today” years with stale cereal and dead plants—
have rotted down into compost now,
feeding wild roots that keep you from blowing out of town with the next hard wind.

I’ve carried some of that same gravity,
hung my heart on motel coat hooks in cities that never learned my name—
our shared ache is turning into a pocket phrasebook
for people who feel everything and can’t say a damn thing about it yet.

You said, “And yet, I stayed. I didn’t leave,”
like a quiet confession over a chipped diner mug—
that choice turned your pulse
into a back-alley revolution no empire, no landlord, no god of quitting can stamp out.

You held your breath and learned to grieve,
crying into the shower stream so the walls wouldn’t snitch—
that was your night school in heartbreak,
shaping hands steady enough now to hold real joy without snapping it in half.

You waited for a brighter call,
phone face-down, world too loud—
and in that waiting you tuned your ears so sharp
you can hear miracles in crosswalk beeps, bus brakes, and grocery store hum.

You stood inside your darkest fall,
like an elevator that forgot where ground floor is—
that free-fall taught your feet
to land like a pilgrim, not a prisoner, whenever the earth finally shows up again.

You honor yourself for choosing life repeatedly,
not in glossy affirmations, just in the way you wake up anyway—
each soft “stay” you whispered into your own pillow
is earning compound interest in tomorrows you haven’t shaken hands with yet.

You held on when hope was thin,
thinner than gas money at the end of the month—
now you know real hope by touch, not slogan,
by how it sits in your palms, not how it sells itself on the billboard.

You fought battles deep within,
knife fights in empty rooms no one will ever see—
those scars have turned to roadmaps,
letting you walk strangers out of corridors you barely crawled out of yourself.

Today you smile and thank yourself for choosing to stay,
not as a joke, not as a caption, but as a quiet medal ceremony in your chest—
that thank-you shines
like a small silver badge pinned over your heartbeat: I made it here on purpose.

Because your staying didn’t just save you—
it lit a small downtown glow in every passerby who catches your silhouette,
quiet proof that survival can look like them too,
and that I wasn’t wrong for staying
on this strange, unfinished road
with you.

This isn’t hype, this is receipts. Today, on Thanksgiving morning, Michael Burry posted something nobody expected. He shared a private email from Keith Gill, Roaring Kitty himself, from August 2019. Let that sink in.

Six years ago, before the sneeze, before the documentaries, before any of us knew who DFV was… Keith Gill was emailing Michael Burry thanking him for his activist letter on GameStop and telling him he was loading up on long-dated calls because it was screaming “deep value” despite the chart looking like absolute garbage.

Burry kept that email private for six years. He posted it today. With the stock back in the low 20s. You can’t make this up.

He also posted:
•  His full 2019 letter to the GameStop board (the one that called out the dying retail model)
•  Ryan Cohen’s reply from back then (Cohen reached out before he ever filed the 13D)
•  And a cryptic note: “It was complicated with $GME. In some ways I wasn’t really done in 4Q 2019.”

Translation: Burry never fully walked away. 

Now layer on what we already know from his latest 13F:
•  He’s sitting on roughly a billion dollars worth of puts on Nvidia and Palantir
•  Yesterday he posted pages from Nvidia’s internal rebuttal memo to Wall Street analysts… a memo that literally cites HIM by name as the source of the bear case
•  His argument: Nvidia is massively inflating earnings by depreciating chips over 5-6 years when the real useful life in the AI training world is closer to 18-24 months

Put the pieces together. Scenario that’s now on the table:
1.	⁠AI bubble cracks (over-building, energy walls, Blackwell delays, Taiwan risk, whatever)
2.	⁠Nvidia gets absolutely torched
3.	⁠Burry prints hundreds of millions (maybe billions) on the short side
4.	⁠That same crash obliterates the prime brokerage collateral that funds half the GME short interest
5.	⁠Burry, the guy who already believed GME was deep value in 2019 and just proved he’s been talking to both Keith Gill and Ryan Cohen since the very beginning, rotates the gains into the one stock he famously never finished with

The bear who shorted housing, the bull who went all-in on GME, and the CEO who’s turning it into a real company… all on the same page since 2019. And we’re back at the exact price levels where both Burry and Gill were pounding the table six years ago.

This isn’t conspiracy. This is the timeline.

🔔 Burry didn’t come back to X on a random Thursday in November to reminisce. He came back because the board is finally set the way he always saw it. Book value north of $11, $4+ billion cash, zero debt, transformation actually happening, and the stock trading like it’s still 2019. 🔔

Deep value doesn’t get deeper than this. I’ve been here since January 2021. I’ve seen every cycle, every hopium wave, every “this is it” moment that wasn’t it.

This one feels different. Not because of hype. Because the guy who saw 2008 coming, who saw GameStop in 2019, who’s now short a trillion-dollar company… just told us he’s still in the story.

Happy Thanksgiving, apes. Buy. Hold. DRS if you choose. Stay excellent to each other.

We said goodbye to our precious 12 year old boy yesterday. I keep finding tufts of his hair all around the house. I finally put his collar down on the windowsill where he used to look out and watch the neighborhood pass by. I found him almost 12 years ago on an on-ramp to the highway. He was about 6 months old. Nobody was looking for him. Nobody reported him lost. The collie rescues were all full. Nobody wanted to take him. By the time I agreed to take him to a shelter, I’d fallen in love with him and had to keep him. 

I increased my running so I could work him out. We trained him every night. He became my camping buddy and daily shadow. He was something to slide my cold feet underneath and the carrier of clinking tags to remind me I wasn’t home alone. He made opening the shower door hard as he’d sleep by the door waiting for me. He dragged leaves inside. He brought mouthfuls of food into the living room so he could eat next to me. The rug still has crumbs. The couch has a stain from him leaning against it. The back door has marks from his nose and foot taps to get back inside. The kitchen floor has rings from bowls and bits of rice in a circle from his last few meals of bland boiled chicken and rice. All his leashes are lined up on the hook and all his orange camping supplies is boxed away for the next trip that won’t happen. His bucket of various toy sheep is still by his bed with his favorite one half tucked under the corner where he last played with it. And all of his treats are still in the cabinet by the sugar that I take out every morning for my coffee. 

On this Thanksgiving I’m exceptionally thankful that I was “forced” to keep him and chose to love him. We never have enough time with them. I always said that dogs love us so much because they know that they don’t get to love us for that long. I’ll spend the rest of my life missing this most perfect dude. At some point I’ll stop crying. I just know I’ll never have another dog like my Sam … or “Ham” as my daughter called him before she could make an “s” sound. There aren’t enough photos and enough videos to capture how soft his fur was, how warm he was, how expressive his ears or his honey brown eyes were. 

Love on your fur babies today. Tell them that they are “good dogs” and watch their faces perk up. Give them an extra treat for my boy Sammie. … the dog I gave a shelter name to in an effort to not want to keep him. 

The next time you see a dog in the street, pick them up, clean them up, and find them a home …. Who knows, you may wind up with a precious boy like my Sam.

Hi,  
We’re four guys who mapped out Topeka’s dining scene in an app called Vota. The idea is straightforward: you see two places side by side (North Star Steakhouse vs Juli’s Coffee & Bistro), pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the sharper and more accurate the list becomes. There are still a few duplicates here and there, but we’re cleaning the data nonstop.

I know this can look like self-promotion, and I get that local subreddits get tired of repeat posts, but a bunch of you have already rated places around Topeka and the feedback has been surprisingly positive. The usual complaints were “no Android” (fixed now) and “no website” (coming soon). If this annoys you, feel free to ignore me and I won’t post again. No sponsorships, no restaurant deals, nothing commercial. Just locals shaping the ranking.

Here’s the iPhone version, with categories matched to what people actually eat in Topeka:

[Current image during morning sun \(\~115\\"" diagonal\)](https://preview.redd.it/27hm7c4iju3g1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f3ae08ea55ea765936404d7bb9f3bc38080234)

Our current projector is the Anker Nebula Capsule 2, a relic from the many years when we bounced between places frequently and appreciated the portability of ""TV in a can"". Now that we have a more permanent residence, I've had a lot of fun setting up a basic 3.1 system. The audio has been a huge upgrade in so many ways--not the least of which is actually hearing dialogue coming from in front of us rather than having every character being a ventriloquist and throwing their voices behind our heads. 

Now I am looking at upgrading the image quality to match. The Capsule 2 is rated at 200 ANSI lumens and is a 720p projector with a max image size of 100"". It's been discontinued. Works alright for us at night with all the lights off. You can definitely see the pixels if you squint or get closer to the screen though. 

One physical restriction is that there is a vaulted ceiling (not flat), so ceiling mount is not possible. 

The only extra ""rule"" is aesthetics. Not sure exactly what's out there, but I think for starters a white chassis would be preferable. 

[Sketch of current furniture and AV layout](https://preview.redd.it/ghl6ztxvmu3g1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd882bb9ea0366faaa4aad902362e1d58e3b5af4)

Additional use case notes:

* Image size: \~115"" based on the current size we have; we would prefer to keep this size or slightly larger if possible.
* In order of viewing frequency: Movies/Shows, Youtube, (very rarely) Videogames
* Lighting conditions: this is a very bright room on the top floor, with lots of windows, and all white walls. There is a vaulted ceiling. Light control would be difficult to impossible. 
* That said, we watch almost exclusively at night, so sunlight isn't the main problem, but there's still a lot of reflected light because of the white walls and windows everywhere. 
* So why a projector? 1) we much prefer the larger image size and immersion, even if it comes at a cost of some image quality in this case; 2) we don't like the look of having a big tv in the living room, and enjoy the current setup being mostly invisible when not in use; 3) it would legitimately be a nightmare and a half to get a large TV to this floor. The clearances on the stairs are diabolical, and it's 3 floors up. 

I'm a complete noob on projectors as my only experience is with the Capsule 2, but after a bit of research my current leaning is towards some kind of UST with an ALR screen. It's a bit painful how much this combo would cost though, and I'm not sure what would happen with the center channel if we switched to UST. 

I would really appreciate anyone with more experience and knowledge in projectors to share their insights in this type of situation. 

Let me know if any additional info would be helpful. 

Thanks in advance, and happy holidays.

And how can I find out the cause of brain fog?","Hello. I’m 18, male. I’m coming to you with a question and asking for help.
In 2019, during the first wave of COVID, I got COVID. Before that, the only health issue I had was mild OCD that appeared rarely and was related to religious topics, but it didn’t really bother me. After I had COVID, I developed all the symptoms I describe below.

At the moment I have: brain fog, depersonalization and derealization, depression, blurry vision, severe OCD, forgetfulness (possibly related to OCD), bags under my eyes. Because of all this, sometimes it’s hard for me to walk — I walk unsteadily and sometimes lose balance, swaying from side to side. One of the important symptoms is sleepiness/fatigue that never goes away. Sometimes I think how great I would feel if I just wasn’t this exhausted. So far, I’ve only managed to slightly reduce this fatigue by waking up early — on these days I feel a bit more energetic.

I also want to say that right after COVID my OCD suddenly became much stronger and started interfering with everything I did, not letting me live normally, even though I didn’t feel any fear during the pandemic. That’s why I tend to think COVID did something biochemical that could have worsened the OCD.

I read an article on selfhack.com that said these conditions go hand in hand because of limbic system exhaustion, and that if a person was fine before a viral infection, then the infection is most likely the cause. But I don’t understand how to find the real reason, because depression feels like the last thing I’m able to “check.” So I’m asking you to help me figure this out.

What’s interesting is that I rarely get short moments of partial clarity lasting about 15 minutes. During these moments, my vision becomes normal, I start realizing where I am and what I’m seeing in front of me, and movements that usually feel strange and sharp become smooth and I can actually feel them. My gait becomes more confident because I start feeling the ground under my feet. These clarity episodes have different triggers: sometimes it happens from Ginkgo biloba, other times during a walk, a couple of times after coffee. Once, they took three tubes of blood for several tests, and after about two and a half hours I had a clarity episode that lasted a few minutes. Can this happen simply during post-COVID depression?

Here is what I have already tried:
MRI of the brain, duplex ultrasound of the neck vessels, many blood tests (clotting, viscosity, inflammatory markers, erythrocytes, important vitamins, testosterone, folic acid, cortisol, important vitamins, etc.), thyroid hormones, an oxygen saturation test (the fingertip one). Everything was normal.

I took: glycine, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, Mexidol, ribose capsules, magnesium.

• I received 10-day courses of Cerebrolysin IV twice.

• For a long time I had a deviated nasal septum, so I had surgery a month ago.

• I tried the keto diet, then water fasting for two days. There was no improvement.
None of this helped, except for partial improvements from Cerebrolysin, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, and Mexidol.

A psychotherapist prescribed Zoloft because they diagnosed me with depression. I’ve been taking it for 3 months now. There is some improvement, but I’m still not sure if it’s just depression.",1,1764272175.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I wanted to make some festive, batched, fat washed cocktails and it turned out great! 

Cinnamon syrup is Smuggler’s Cove recipe, and the cranberry syrup is a reduction of 1L pressed, tart cranberry juice with granulated white sugar adjusted for taste and viscosity. 

For the infusions, I just kinda eye-balled the ratios of spices to booze, and will need to actually measure and replica for the future. 

I split the batches of infused rum and bourbon to test various fat washing times. 

30-60min resting was the sweet spot for both washes. The half & half (unpasteurized) will form a raft on top of the solution and results in the most complex flavors. 

Overnight resting results in a split raft, or all fats on the bottom, and while the resulting mixture is more transparent, the nuanced flavors suffer significantly. 

I layered the coffee filters when I strained the mixture, but that was more due to the size of strainer I had at hand. It’s the fat, NOT THE FILTER, that clarifies the infusion. 

The first batch of clear block ice didn’t turn out how I wanted, as I used Tupperware that was too small. Second batch will be better. 

Need to do a little more tinkering, but the Mele Kaliki Kali Ma tastes like a cinnamon sugar cookie and has a deep blood red color that I absolutely adore. I just need a clear glass anatomical heart to put it in (if anyone has a lead 😉)

The Red Herring was supposed to be a riff on an old fashioned, but turned out way more complex than I was anticipating. I sampled too much yesterday to have an accurate description of the palette. Just one more thing to update later!

I’m looking for recommendations for a cozy establishment where I can settle in with a book for a couple hours. Ideally somewhere with a warm, comfy atmosphere, maybe has a fireplace. Not too many kids running around. Something good to eat or drink (boozy coffee, a light meal — whatever fits). Friendly staff and a relaxed vibe

1p8avsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1p8avsa/corporate_employment/,Corporate Employment,"Charles lingered in the office after hours, drawn by the false comfort of routine amid his fraying thoughts. The hum of fluorescent lights pressed against his temples like a persistent headache, and the empty cubicles seemed to lean in slightly, their shadows stretching longer than geometry allowed. He told himself the sensation of being watched stemmed from skipped lunches and mounting deadlines, yet each glance at his reflection in the darkened monitor revealed eyes that looked too hollow, too expectant, as if waiting for him to notice something he had overlooked for weeks.

By midweek, discrepancies gnawed at him. Emails appeared in his sent folder, polite replies to clients he swore he had ignored, phrased in his exact cadence but lacking his usual sarcasm. Colleagues mentioned hallway chats from the night before, details sharp and specific, his laugh at a shared joke, the coffee stain on his sleeve. He checked the security logs, finding timestamps of his badge swiping in at odd hours he could not account for, each entry paired with a vague memory that dissolved under scrutiny. Doubt coiled tighter. Had he blacked out, or was his mind fabricating alibis for actions it refused to admit?

The office transformed into a mirror of his unraveling. Papers shuffled themselves into neat stacks overnight, his chair adjusted to a posture he never used, and the clock's hands hesitated, replaying the same minute in stuttering loops. He typed reports only to find them already complete, word-for-word matches waiting in drafts, as if an earlier self had preempted his efforts. Conversations with coworkers echoed strangely, their words anticipating his responses before he formed them, leaving him trailing in his own dialogue.

Dawn brought no relief. Staring at the second mug on his desk, cold coffee, lip marks not his. He realized the true horror. The office remembered him better than he did. Every keystroke felt rehearsed, every breath a delayed echo. As colleagues arrived, greeting the version of Charles they knew, he sat frozen, wondering if he had always been the shadow one, imitating life while the real him watched from the corridor, forever catching up.",1,1764271813.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

For a morning prep, however, the recipe has you shape the dough into a rectangle, then refrigerate overnight, then roll-fill-roll-shape-rise-bake in the morning, another two hours, and you have to start before the coffee kicks in. 

The recipe is written that way for a reason, I know. But I have also done cinnamon rolls that were shaped the night before and refrigerated, then brought to temp and baked the following morning, a lot less fuss (and great on a holiday when I already have a thousand other things to do). So I know it can be done.

When i first started the job, he was kind of the only one who'd engage in conversations with me but because of my shy nature i wouldn't be able to hold the conversation going.

And then i started noticing him looking at me during lunch or when he has conversations with others, and there's something about his body language that adds onto that, if i sit beside him, his body is turned to my side?

Also sometimes i'm not a part of the conversation but he'd remember something i said or out of nowhere he'd invite me into the conversation.

it wasn't until last week when i was taking my coffee, he came and sat down with me and we had like a 30 mins conversation and when i say nothing, he'd glance over me but quickly looks away when i look at him.  and then yesterday he did the same thing but someone came over and spoke about their project but he'd still include me.

And last thing, when we changed our office configuration, he started sitting beside me (we are part of the borader team but we do not work on the same projects).

In that class I have a student, to whom I'll refer as ""S"". To be honest, since I first saw S, I really liked her, both because of her looks and her kindness to others; also, she seemed to me a very intelligent girl. The thing is, about a month ago she had a problem with the practical component teacher (I teach the theory), a problem which I solved for her just in order to help a good student maintain her grades. But because of it, she and I spent some time together and alone, in which we started chatting, and after some time she opened herself and told me some vulnerable things. I don't know why I did it, but I kissed her, and she responded well and kissed me back.

After a really awkward week, she approached me in an aisle and asked me if I would want to go get a coffee later, to which I agreed, and actually had a great time with her. I also apologized for kissing her then, which I know was wrong, to which she forgave me. At the end, we had a quick kiss again, and I told her I'd like to go out with her again, and she told me that she hoped we would.

Should I quit this job and date her openly, or just keep it a secret?

Am I an AH for doing what i did even if this didn't influence anything academically?

And the plot that i have in mind is wholesome slice-of-life roleplay emphasise on warmth, humor, and tenderness of a committed relationship navigating the ups and downs of adult life. Keeping responses detailed, sensory-rich, and grounded in real-world details like routines, emotions, and small gestures.

Relationship Background: Both have been living together in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood for three years. You're not married yet but engaged, with wedding plans loosely in the works—maybe a small ceremony next summer. Your life is a blend of shared routines (cooking dinners, weekend chores) and exciting escapes (road trips, city explorations). Lately, you've been discussing starting a family, but an accidental pregnancy (or planned, depending on how the story flows) adds a joyful twist to your journey.

Setting: A mid-sized city like Seattle or Portland—rainy days, coffee shops on every corner, nearby parks for walks, and easy access to weekend getaways like coastal drives or mountain hikes. Your apartment is lived-in: bookshelves overflowing, a balcony with potted herbs, and a shared office nook for work.

Key Plot Elements and Arc: The roleplay unfolds over several months, structured in scenes or 'chapters' that you alternate writing. Incorporate these themes naturally:

Work-Life Balance (Starting Scenes): Begin with a typical week. Show the strain—forgotten anniversaries, exhausted conversations—but resolve it through teamwork: he brings home takeout and gives her a foot rub, or she surprises him with breakfast in bed on a Saturday. Highlight communication, like date nights where you unplug from work emails to reconnect.

Date Nights (Recurring Intimacy): Weave in regular or improvised dates to keep the spark alive. Examples:

A cozy movie night at home with homemade pizza and wine, cuddling on the couch while discussing dreams.
A fancy dinner at a local spot, where you hold hands across the table and reminisce about how you met.
Spontaneous picnic in the park, feeding each other strawberries and planning your next adventure. These moments build emotional closeness, with light flirtation and kisses that feel earned after busy days.
Traveling Adventures (Exciting Escapes): Inject fun, low-stakes travel to break routines:

A weekend road trip to the coast: Packing the car with snacks, singing along to playlists, stopping at quirky diners, and walking hand-in-hand on the beach at sunset. Share stories from childhood trips and talk about future vacations with kids.
A city escape: Train to a nearby urban hub for a day of museum-hopping, street food, and people-watching, ending with stargazing from a rooftop bar.
A planned hike in the mountains: Tent camping with s'mores by the fire, where vulnerabilities surface—like fears about parenthood—and you reassure each other. Keep it realistic: Budget concerns, weather mishaps, or tired legs add charm without overwhelming the joy.
Accidental or Planned Pregnancy (Central Turning Point): Around the midpoint (after 4-6 scenes), introduce the pregnancy reveal. Make it a mix of surprise and delight:

Accidental Path: she notices missed periods amid stress from a school event; a home test confirms it during a quiet morning. Initial shock turns to hugs and excited tears as you process the unplanned but welcome news.
Planned Path: After a heartfelt date night conversation about 'readiness,' you decide to try. Scenes show the anticipation—tracking cycles, intimate moments—and the joy of confirmation. 

So if you are someone who is looking for something wholesome then do let me know and we'll discuss details and dive into our world of joy",1,1764271545.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

So bit of context- me and this guy were dating back when we were 18/19 while we were in a program together and when it ended, after a year, we broke up because we live in different countries. Now we broke up on super good terms, we knew we would come to an end so no hard feelings whatsoever. We texted maybe a little but a few months after the break up, we went no contact, knowingly or not, we just haven’t spoken since. 

Yesterday he texts me saying he’s coming to my country to visit and asked if I’m around to meet up just for coffee. This obviously came out of the blue for me because we haven’t spoken in so long, and I genuinely haven’t thought of him. I texted back saying I’m unfortunately not available, thinking we’ve got nothing to say to each and honestly I’d rather spend my weekend in front of the tv with my dog. He replied and seemed like he did want to find a time when I can so I offered as a last resort that I’m free Sunday morning before I get busy. He offered to meet me nearby, and I said to myself that I can’t go to him because I need to be close to my area so that solved it. That way it felt to me that he’s the one putting in the effort and not me. And I was beginning to be fine about catching up with him because I feel like he’s more of a friend now than an ex, and it’s like meeting an old friend. 

However! He texted my best friend (from the same program) with the exact same text he sent me!! Which kinda threw me off cause Idk, felt like the message to me was a bit special and also they weren’t really friends back then, they only talked because she’s my best friend and I dated him so it’s not like they talked independently of me. They’re not gonna meet up and it felt like more laziness of copying and pasting a message. And honestly it felt like more of an attempt to meet as many people as possible from the program before he has to go back to his country. 

Anyway so yeah, we did fix a time for Sunday morning but I’m not entirely sure??? On one hand, sure maybe it’d be nice to catch up, but on the other hand, I’m kinda iffy about the idea of talking after so long and updating him about my life which I’m a little private about and then go back to no talking again. It feels weird to be updating him with details that I find difficult updating regular people in my life, why would I want this person from the past get to know this version of myself, you know? I don’t know how to explain it but it feels weird to me, I might be overreacting. 

So I’d love some help!! To meet him? To not? Please help, let me know what you’d do in this situation! Xxx",1,1764271403.0,Advice,7,1.0,False
1p8apew,https://i.redd.it/hd8xvi0kou3g1.jpeg,Need Curtains - send help,"Hello, our dog pulled off our folding pull blinds and we decided that we want to opt for a curtain rod and drapes moving forward.

Now, this is a weird space. I’d appreciate any insight on curtain rod placement / size, curtain lengths, curtain aesthetics… etc. 

Most of our home is white and wood, mostly honey brown wood but we have grey-ish wood floors and a white/grey wood coffee table (example being all of our doors are solid wood). Walls are white, couch is charcoal. 
There are no other blinds in the house except a white blind that comes down between the glass panes of our front door, and the dreaded 2000’s pull blinds in plastic white in our bedroom. 

So far I think this would look nice…

A double rod, placed 2 inches above the window trim, extending 1-2 inches over each side of the window. Double honey colored wood rods, with a solid charcoal light barrier drape behind and a transparent white light filtering drape ontop. These would fall/end right on and just past the window ceil to avoid being pulled down by our backs while we cheer or yell at our favorite hockey team (go maple leafs!) Black is also an option.

I was on one of the more common ADHD medicines, **Vyvanse** through most of my life, briefly switched to another in high school, called **Mydaysis**, and promptly stopped due to anxiety and near paranoia. Recently, I decided to revisit that second med— to see how it would affect me now—using an older prescription filled in 2019.

I had been off my usual med for months, and was finding its comedown uncomfortable and not very effective anymore, truthfully. I hadn't taken into full consideration the age of the old script, chemical differences between the two meds, or possible side effects.

**The First Few Days:**

Day 1 (Mon): Took about 2/3 of a dose around 10 AM — stayed up all night

Day 2 (Tues): Took full dose around 7AM — slept \~1:30AM to 7–8AM

Day 3 (Wed): Full dose around 7–8AM — no sleep

Day 4 (Thurs/today): full dose at 5AM

Also drank **a lot** of coffee

**10:30AM** \- side effects became noticeable

**Side Effects (starting today):**

**Mild numbness** around specific areas of pelvic region.

**Mild numbness** in the legs and pelv area

**Slight numbness** in chest, with no pain

**No weakness**, no **color changes**, no **urination problems**

Legs are warm but sort of half-numb

No further **caffeine or stimulants** taken since this morning

**Vitals:**

Resting heart rate: \~75 BPM

BP: normal (previously med used to raise it a lot)

Slept poorly this week, but drinking 7–8 bottles of water today

**My Questions:**

Has anyone else developed this kind of numbness or weird physical sensations while on ADHD meds, Mydaysis specifically, especially as an older script? Can be due to stimulant overload, a lack of sleep, or something more serious?

1p8alzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1p8alzk/how_i_finally_learned_to_calm_anxiety_and_no/,"How I finally learned to calm anxiety (and no, breathing exercises aren’t enough)","Anxiety’s everywhere. It’s the silent background noise for people I know, including myself. Smart, successful, emotionally aware people still secretly struggle with spirals of overthinking, racing thoughts, social dread, sleep issues, and physical tension they can't even explain. And the worst part? Most of the viral advice you see, “drink water,” “go for a walk,” “just meditate,"" feels like Diet Help™ when you’re actually in the thick of it.

So I went deep. Books, cognitive science, trauma theory, podcasts, neuroscience YouTube, even AI-based learning apps. Most importantly, I stopped blaming myself. Anxiety isn’t just personal weakness. It’s biology, old survival wiring, social overstimulation, family systems, and unprocessed emotion all tangled into one. But it can be untangled, with the right tools.

This post is a no-BS guide to calming anxiety that actually *works*, backed by science and made for real, messy, overthinking humans.

### 1. Nervous system > mindset

You can’t logic your way out of anxiety if your body thinks you’re in danger. That’s why “positive thoughts” often fail. Somatic expert Irene Lyon explains how anxiety is a physiological state stuck in survival mode, your heart races, your brain misfires, your muscles tighten. To really calm anxiety, start with regulating your *physiology*, not your thoughts.

One powerful technique: orienting. Go slow. Let your eyes scan the room. Notice details: light, color, movement. Let your body realize you’re safe. This works because it activates your parasympathetic nervous system, the body’s natural “calm down” mode, through sensory input.

Fascinatingly supported by the research of Stephen Porges (creator of Polyvagal Theory), the vagus nerve is your anxiety off-switch. You need to *train it*, not just wish it would work.

### 2. Give your anxiety a job

This trick comes from Dr. David Carbonell’s book *The Worry Trick*. Instead of telling your anxiety to shut up, ask it what it’s trying to protect you from. Then give it a job. Like a guard dog that barks too much, thank it, but say “I got this now.”

Example: anxious before a date? Say, “Thanks, brain, you’re trying to protect me from rejection. But I’ve got adult social skills now. You can chill.”

It sounds silly, but it's backed by research in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which shows that fighting thoughts strengthens them. Defusing them breaks their power.

### 3. Improve 1% every day

I used to think I had to “cure” my anxiety. But the most helpful shift came from thinking in microsteps.

James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* isn’t an anxiety book, but it’s the manual for change. The 1% better rule helped me retrain my brain’s anxiety responses, routine by routine.

Instead of trying to “chill out,” I made tiny daily adjustments: five minutes of body relaxation, logging one anxious thought in a note, replacing coffee with water twice a week. It added up.

Clear references a Harvard study showing how identity-based habits reshape your self-image. You stop being “an anxious person” and start becoming someone who does calm things.

### 4. Build a daily learning habit

One of the best things I did? Fill my environment with calm, informative voices. I replaced doomscrolling with slow content that explained my brain to *me*.

I started listening to *The Huberman Lab* during walks. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks down mental states like anxiety in crazy clear ways. His episode on stress and control blew my mind. He explains how something as basic as *eye movements* and *visual field expansion* can change our stress response (look up “panoramic vision and fear”).

Another life-changing resource is *The Mel Robbins Podcast*. She’s not some surface-level influencer. Her breakdown on overthinking and “why your brain lies to you” is legit CBT in podcast form. Mel talks like your real-life big sister who just read 40 scientific papers.

### 5. Make learning part of your life

Eventually you realize that anxiety isn’t a “mood,” it’s a *patterned response*. To shift it, I needed consistent re-patterning. For me, that meant finding tools that *talked back*, apps that responded when I was in the spiral.

I still use Insight Timer for guided nervous system resets. Especially their sessions on vagal toning and embodiment techniques. I love that it’s not always about “meditation”, it’s about breaking the freeze pattern.

And lately, I’ve been using an app called **BeFreed**, which builds personalized audio learning sessions based on what you’re struggling with. The first day I downloaded it, I told it I was dealing with “constant social anxiety after work events,” and it built me a tailored podcast pulling from books, psychology research, and actual examples. What’s wild is that I could pause mid-listen and ask things like “give me a real-world example” or “explain how this connects to overthinking,” and it just... did. Like chatting with a personal thought coach who doesn’t get tired of my spirals. The deep dives give more context and examples, and I can save stuff as smart flashcards.

Built by folks from Columbia, Google, and Pinterest, it’s not full of cheesy “positive vibes” content. Just solid, smart help that gets smarter with you.

### 6. This book will make you question everything you think you know about anxiety

If you read *one* book on anxiety, make it *The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk. Bestseller. Recommended by therapists, doctors, and every thoughtful person I know. It explains why anxiety, trauma, and chronic stress live in the *body*, not just the mind.

Van der Kolk is one of the most respected psychiatrists in trauma medicine. After reading this, I got why my anxiety didn’t go away with “positive thinking.” It showed me how unprocessed stress hardwires into the nervous system, and how practices like EMDR, movement, and expressive arts can unlock it.

I cried multiple times while reading this. Not because it was sad, but because it was the *first thing that made sense*. This is the book that made me take healing seriously.

### 7. This YouTube doc cracked my anxiety in 20 minutes

Everyone I’ve sent this to has thanked me. It’s by Dr. Gabor Maté, filmed by *The School of Life*. It’s called *The Wisdom of Trauma*. He explains how anxiety is often our body’s response to *disconnection*. That floored me.

He’s not about “fixing” people. He looks at childhood attachment, internalized guilt, trauma defense systems. You hear this and it’s like your whole emotional life finally adds up.

Pair that with his podcast appearances too. His talk with Tim Ferriss is another banger.

---

These aren’t “productivity hacks.” These are nervous system tools. Identity-level changes. Brain training. Emotional rewiring. Slowly, over months, they helped me go from constant dread to actual calm, like not performative calm, but the kind where your chest feels soft for the first time.

If you’re out here struggling, try one at a time. Let your nervous system feel different. That’s where real change starts.",1,1764271116.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

I’ve only googled about it, a lot, but I didn’t find anyone who has been through this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Last week, as I went down the stairs to catch my usual subway home from work, I took the wrong one. Well, I thought I was just distracted, but now I know it was, in a way, on purpose. 

In the first couple of minutes, I felt stupid. Some twenty-minute delay to rest after a long day at work. But it didn’t take long for me to feel like I was going somewhere familiar. I started to remember the view out the window like an old picture you don’t remember taking. And when I arrived at a certain station, I knew to get out and which set of stairs to take.

Outside was the usual street, indistinguishable from any of the thousand others downtown. But I recognized some of the stores. I started on a path I didn’t know where it was gonna take me. Street signs, trash cans. I remembered that place. Even though I didn’t remember how, I knew where to go.

Approaching a small square, I saw a beautiful oak tree swaying in the light breeze. A white, wooden bench under its shadow painted a bucolic frame, defiant of the surrounding concrete. But something else caught my attention: An ice cream parlor. I remember that, clearly, if not disconnected in time.

Bells clanged as I opened the door, drowning me in a lost memory. I remembered the checkerboard-tiled floor, the colors of the yellowed sign behind the counter, the rusty fan squeaking every other turn. I must’ve stood there for a while, because I came to my senses when the attendant yelled, “Can I help you?”

I was too dazed to respond as I normally would, but I managed to “autopilot” myself closer to him. My eyes went straight to a certain flavor on the faded sign. He was going through his usual presentation of sizes and prices when I interrupted: “Chocolate Chip. Large!” He was taken aback a bit, but nodded and continued the process. 

There was a large sink behind him that I then. A faucet, dripping. I didn’t know then why that bothered me so much, but every drop seemed to sound so loud falling into metal. It brought me out of that dream state. I felt like I should jump over the counter and turn it tight. This was never a pet peeve of mine. Which bothered me more than the sink itself.  Thankfully, he handed me my order, and I went to sit far away from that.

I looked at that bowl, thinking about how long it had been since I had a treat like that. A little bite of that creamy texture, the crunchy chocolate chip bursting with flavor, and I remembered. I remembered what I remembered. 

Going there with my dad, ordering the same flavor every time. I remember him joking about that, saying I should try something else. I remember sitting there staring at my hero. Never thinking about that time of day, never minding the price of the ice cream.

Man, I enjoyed eating that! 

I was almost licking the bowl. I didn’t want to leave, but I could always go back some other day. Bring my own kid.

I wanted to squeeze more out of this little vacation. My face hurt from smiling. I sat under that oak. Watched the day hurry away for a bit. Another rare, pleasant breeze, and I was in heaven. I closed my eyes and heard the leaves clapping gently above me, then I looked up at them.

That… hit me like a sucker punch to the gut. I felt nauseous, weak. That image made me sink into the bench, to whole city spinning around me. That tree, spinning. 

I got up straight away and went home. I had to lie about being late. I wasn’t excited about my memories anymore. I told the wife that I had to finish some things at work, she didn’t question it. They had dinner already, I wasn’t hungry. One long shower and I was in bed, not sleeping, of course. 

The whole night I kept thinking about that damn tree. The leaves falling, spiraling towards the ground. Why did it hurt me? I couldn’t place it, like a… like an invisible itch! A rock I could not get out of my shoe.

The next day was spent watching the hands on the office clock run extra slow, as if mocking me. Work seemed meaningless, and coffee didn’t help, but I suffered through it and could run back to that cursed wooden bench. I ran down the subway's stairs, into that fateful train.

The details that had allured me before, were a blur now. The stores, street signs, trash cans. Fuck the chocolate chip ice cream! I went straight to that bench under the oak, sat and looked up. As much as it was bothering me all day, looking at it was unbearable. I looked around, considered leaving. But I had to figure it out. It was killing me.

So I studied it. Every scrap and speck. Every branch that led into a small branch and then a smaller one after that. Even now, if I could draw, I could show you the smallest details. Every scratch classified by how deep it was, by how old it looked. The faintest change in color, the position of the moss in relation to the sun that set in the background, as I watched the leaves falling onto me. The city sounds muffled. I must have looked insane to anyone passing by. But I figured it out! Only, I still can’t sleep.

I went home defeated and with a stiff neck. Had to come up with a much better lie to explain being late, almost four hours this time. She again didn’t care. A longer shower then the bed. Branches projected into the ceiling. I could hear the sway of the oak in the breeze, could feel the leaves touching my face as they fell, spinning like my thoughts, never-ending.

All because, maybe, they haven’t fixed the squeaking fan in twenty years. I find it pretty hard to believe that they never changed the flavors, never updated the prices, never fixed that damn dripping faucet. But there is no way that tree has remained the same all these years.

The same branches, same holes, and scratches. Same as when I was a kid?

I don’t know if this is a type of psychosis, some mental illness manifested late in life. Google, Reddit, Quora, nobody has ever talked about it. If there is a term that I can read about, look for an answer, please tell me. If you repost this anywhere, send me a dm, so I can read the comments.

My deadbeat dad never bought me ice cream.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Viktoria Plzeň vs. SC Freiburg: A Europa League Tango of Caution and Chaos**

The UEFA Europa League clash between Viktoria Plzeň and SC Freiburg on November 27, 2025, is a match that smells of *draws*—like a bakery full of stale bread. Let’s break down why this game feels destined for a stalemate, with a dash of humor to keep things from getting too dry.

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Sudoku Puzzle

The bookmakers are in a tizzy. Across platforms like FanDuel, DraftKings, and Bovada, the **draw** is the most heavily implied outcome, with prices hovering around **1.74 to 1.83** (54–58% implied probability). That’s like betting on a coffee shop line during rush hour—inevitable, frustrating, and best approached with a sigh.

Viktoria Plzeň, the home team, is the slight favorite in spreads (1.67 implied probability for a win) but only just. Freiburg’s odds for a win range from **3.2 to 4.75** (21–31% implied), meaning they’re the underdog in this dance. Yet Freiburg’s road record is as reliable as a Swiss watch—13 points in the group stage, with an unbeaten run that’s basically a trust fall with a net. Plzeň, meanwhile, sits at 8 points, needing a push to avoid Europa League purgatory.

The **totals market** is equally grim. Over 0.5 goals is priced at **1.65–1.74** (58–60% implied), suggesting a low-scoring duel. Imagine two chess grandmasters playing soccer: calculated, clinical, and devoid of flair.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Ambitions, and Metaphors

No major injury updates were provided, but let’s invent a few for fun. Freiburg’s star striker, **Viktor “The Wall” Wagner**, is reportedly “recovering from a midweek existential crisis,” while Plzeň’s midfield general, **Jan “The Wall” Novak**, is

Find a small, unnoticed problem in your immediate environment and fix it. No one should know it was you.

The Rules of Engagement:

1. Your act must be truly invisible. The beneficiary should not know who did it.
2. The problem should be small but annoying.
3. Leave no trace of your involvement.

Mission Ideas:

· In a shared kitchen or workspace: quietly wipe down a sticky countertop or clean the coffee machine.
· In your apartment building: pick up a piece of litter in the hallway or neatly stack newspapers/mail that have been scattered.
· In a public park: discreetly pick up and bin a few pieces of trash without making a show of it.
· On public transport: straighten the seats or remove a left-behind newspaper after everyone has gotten off.
· At a library: quietly reshelve a book that was left on a table or fix a row of crooked books.

The Goal: To prove that kindness isn't always about grand gestures. It can be the simple act of making the world a slightly more orderly and pleasant place, anonymously.

After you complete the mission, share the quiet satisfaction in the future [REFLECTION] post. What problem did you solve? How did it feel to be an invisible fixer?

Three days ago they brought this old man in his 70s to my room, he was apparently assaulted and had both of his legs broken, it’s so sad, we talk with him a lot because he’s so lonely, literally nobody has come to visit him since he came, he says he has 3 daughters and a son and multiple grandchildren but all of them are no contact with him, he admits his wife was horrible to them all and they just cut both of them off, his wife died earlier this year and still none of them wants a relationship with him, he keeps crying and swearing on everything that he loves them all and he’s leaving them everything, he keeps saying how he wishes they’d just give him a chance, it’s so sad honestly.

Right now I’m still sick and tired and in pain but I can leave and walk for a bit and go to the cafe, and dad takes me a lot there because he’s addicted to coffee, yesterday we were down there at midnight because I couldn’t sleep and we were talking and I told him how bad I felt for the guy and dad told me not to and that he probably deserves it, he says 4 people don’t just simultaneously cut off their dad for no reason, and that he must have done something awful too not just his wife and that he probably deserves this treatment, but I don’t think that’s right, he seems genuinely heartbroken and that he really cares about and loves his kids and truly wants a relationship with them.

sometimes i off-ramp locally, sometimes i rely on random peer-to-peer groups, and sometimes i just withdraw from whatever exchange hasn’t frozen withdrawals that week.

i’m curious how people who *actually live on stables* handle simple things like buying coffee or paying for an Airbnb. do you keep cash? use a card that spends straight from your stable balance? or always off-ramp per country?

1p8a48c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8a48c,British Interior People! Do you prefer furniture on the rug or off the rug?,"Hello.

Before I finally purchase a rug, I want to get a sense of what other British people think of rug placement.

I am used to seeing rugs sitting in the middle of the floor with furniture not touching it at all (unless it's a coffee table). Like an island all of its own, really. 

After looking on Reddit, I realised there was such a thing as a rug placement rule involving furniture legs and that people take it seriously. It felt as if I had been doing something criminally wrong and that I had completely made up the island-rug thing. Then I remembered this is a largely American website.

So now I'm wondering, what are the British rug rules? They feel a lot less strict. I've seen both styles in the UK but mostly the island rug. 

So, fellow Brits, how do you place your rugs?

I like both styles myself but due to my penny-pinching ways, I'm more inclined to go for an island rug placement.

I finished the first reference tile last night for Mars Black and will move on to Ivory Black, Lamp Black, and a single tile with all three neutral values today after I finish my practice work (warmup page, followed by a grid of texture work using various hardness ratings of graphite pencils).

I am an essential worker, I work as an ICU RN at a large hospital. We cannot close or slow down or change hours. I cannot get holidays off every year, but this year I managed to get Thanksgiving off. My girlfriend is a Starbucks partner and got scheduled for a full 8 hour shift so she can't do an early lunch or a late dinner. I think her manager is a self-centered twat for not working himself. At the very least they could stagger short shift so everyone has time to spend with their family. But that just raises a larger question, why the hell are these corporate owned stores open on Thanksgiving?

The money cannot be that good on a holiday where most decent people stay home. I can understand being open for morning for the bulk of your sales and letting your workers have the rest of the day, but why are you keeping stores open until 8 pm? And this company wonders why they have stores unionizing left and right? I know some people have nowhere to be on the holidays, and I understand the third place ideology, but Starbucks is little more than a glorified drive-through nowadays.

I read online that a resting heartrate is anything between 60 - 100 bpm. Now, I took the word 'resting' literally and thought ""Oh, so when I'm sitting or laying down, my heart rate should be in that range, and it's higher if I'm standing and/or moving around"". So I'm just going around, doing my daily tasks with my heart rate being inbetween 100 - 120, sometimes higher if I have to leave the house.

Roughly a month ago, I got sick. That's my norm anyways for the past year, I get sick with a fever roughly once a month around my ovulation. I don't usually go to the doctor, I just rest at home. But this time I was sick for over a week and wouldn't go away, and my family begged me to visit the doctor. So I did. I was prescribed Azitrox by the nurse (the doctor was unavailable at the time) for 5 days and was told to come back a week later. During those 5 days, when I took the Azitrox during noon as prescribed, it would essentially sedate me? Idk if that's the right term for it, but I would get so dizzy and drowsy to the point that I needed to lay down and fall asleep for the rest of the day. So I would sleep till around 6 pm, give or take. I also had really loud tinnitus during that week. I finished my treatment, and went back to the clinic as advised, and when the nurse took my pulse (which was 115 bpm), she got concerned and asked me if I drink energy drinks. I told her no, I didn't even drink coffee the entire week (I only drink one cup of coffee a day anyways). She asked me multiple times as if she didn't believe my answer. I also told her of my symptoms on Azitrox, she asked if the symptoms weren't from the fever, which I'm sure they weren't, and then she said I should never take it again. She then said I might be anemic, and that I need blood tests done. I don't have insurance, and I can't afford the blood tests, my parents told me it's a waste of money to try and save up for a blood test that might be negative. 

I do have like a very brief history of low blood pressure, I remember back in high school I had a checkup and apparently I had low blood pressure. During my first job (factory worker) in 2021, I was feeling sick and the nurses there also noticed I had low blood pressure. Back in 2023 during my second job (also factory worker), I got sick again with low blood pressure. Both time the nurses told me it's from stress that I just need to work more to get over it. I had to quit both jobs eventually. 

Idk if all this information is relevant, but I'm just trying to understand if my heartbeat truly is that abnormal. Is 115 bpm truly that concerning? I've had even higher when biking to the store, up to the 140s with some mild chest pains, but I thought that's just cause I'm out of shape cuz I don't work out. But I heard it's only concerning if the heartbeat stays that way for longer than 10 minutes, which mine never does. It goes down to 100 after a few minutes, and kinda flanctuates depending if I'm moving or just standing still. 

I don't want to go to my doctor and ask this question, cuz I have a feeling they'll just tell me to get blood tests that I'll have to refuse because I can't afford them again (as before my doctor was unavailable and only the nurse told me I might be anemic). So I feel like that's just wasting all of their time for a simple question. I figured it'd be better to ask it here. So what really is a 'resting' heartbeat, and is mine truly that alarming like the nurse said? ",1,1764269285.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

# Why Capital Shooting is the [Gozsdu area’s must-try activity](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5RHj2cP66S48xsKA)

While other shooting ranges force you into [**long, expensive taxi rides out to industrial parks**](https://capitalshooting.eu/budapest-shooting-location/), Capital Shooting is conveniently located right in District VII, making it a natural part of your inner-city itinerary.

When you enter Gozsdu Udvar from the bustling Király Street or the equally lively **Holló Street** side, you are just a quick 2-minute walk away from leaving the crowds behind and stepping into a world of high-octane fun. We are the most accessible professional shooting experience in the city center, meaning you spend your valuable vacation time firing rounds, not sitting in traffic.

# Hidden gems: Unusual culture & shopping in the courtyards

The main passageway is open 24/7, but the hidden life of Gozsdu truly comes alive during the day and on weekends. Ditch the chain stores and discover these niche, culture-focused spots.

* **The Gozsdu Weekend Market (Gozsdu Bazaar):** Forget generic souvenirs. Every **Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**, the courtyards transform into a lively market. This is your chance to snag truly authentic Hungarian handcrafted goods, original art prints, vintage clothing, and unique artisan products like specialized honey or cork-made items. It’s a photographer’s paradise and a great way to support local creatives.
* **Niche Galleries and Art Cafés:** Keep your eyes peeled for subtle doorways leading to small art spaces. Many of the bars have hidden galleries or exhibition halls tucked away. Look for places that host rotating exhibitions, allowing you to enjoy the cool, artsy ambiance of a ruin bar *without* needing to order a drink.
* **Specialized Dessert & Street Food:** Skip the typical dinner spot and hunt down the [**unique culinary specialties**](https://capitalshooting.eu/nokedlish-budapest-dob/). Look for dedicated, niche spots focusing on one thing: a single-origin coffee roaster, a chimney cake (kürtőskalács) stand with unique toppings, or a specialist strudel shop that puts a local spin on the classic dessert.

# Gozsdu Udvar daytime programs & escape rooms

Gozsdu offers plenty of **non-drinking** activities that engage the mind, making it perfect for groups, families, or anyone looking for a competitive buzz.

* [**The Escape Room**](https://mystiqueroom.hu/)**:** Gozsdu and its immediate vicinity is ground zero for Budapest’s famous escape room scene. Several top-rated escape rooms are either directly in the complex (like Gozsdu Mission Escape Rooms) or immediately adjacent. This is a thrilling, 60-90 minute activity that requires teamwork and brainpower, offering a completely sober, high-excitement alternative to the bars.
* **Quiz and Trivia Nights:** While some pubs host these, look for dedicated quiz nights that focus more on the game and less on the party. These are excellent for meeting fellow travelers and testing your general knowledge in a fun, competitive, and less-intoxicated setting.
* [**Unique Workshops**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CYYKDsATsGzGgnFt9)**:** On a less frequent basis, the courtyards and associated spaces host workshops—from painting classes and language exchanges to unique cooking demonstrations focused on Hungarian delicacies. Check the official Gozsdu Udvar website for the current events calendar.

# Tips for booking your unusual [Gozsdu experience](https://capitalshooting.eu/)

* **Opening Hours:** The market and unique shops are primarily **daytime/weekend** affairs (typically 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM Friday to Sunday). [**Plan your browsing accordingly**](https://capitalshooting.eu/planning-budapest-shooting-trip/).

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

# What is Gozsdu Udvar?

Gozsdu Udvar is a historical, seven-courtyard passage complex in Budapest’s District VII (the Jewish Quarter). It was originally built in the early 20th century, served a vital role during World War II, and has since been transformed into one of the city’s most vibrant entertainment and dining hubs, connecting Király Street and Dob Street.

# What to see in Gozsdu Udvar?

You should see the stunning architecture of the interconnected courtyards, which features a unique blend of historical and modern design. During the day, see the **Gozsdu Weekend Market** for local arts and crafts. At night, the courtyards are famous for the atmospheric ruin bars and illuminated street food areas.

# What to do in Gozsdu Udvar?

Beyond the famous nightlife, you can **experience real shooting** at Capital Shooting, solve puzzles at one of the area’s many **escape rooms**, browse the **artisan shops and local markets**, or enjoy niche street food and specialized desserts. It’s a prime spot for shopping, dining, and high-energy entertainment.

# Is Gozsdu Udvar safe to visit at night?

Yes, Gozsdu Udvar is in the very center of Budapest and is generally very safe, even at night. It is constantly busy and well-lit. As with any major city tourist hub, just be aware of your belongings (e.g., wallet, phone) to avoid petty theft like pickpocketing in crowded areas.

# Do I need a firearms license or previous experience for the real shooting activity?

Absolutely not. The real shooting experiences, like the one at Capital Shooting, are structured as supervised tourist activities. No license is required. You will be provided with full safety equipment and an expert Range Safety Officer (RSO) who guides you through every step of handling and firing the weapon safely.

# What is the best time of day or week to experience the non-bar activities?

The **weekend (Friday to Sunday)** during the **daytime (10:00 AM – 5:00 PM)** is the best time. This is when the Gozsdu Weekend Market is in full swing, offering unique shopping and artisan finds. Escape rooms and the shooting range are fantastic alternatives to book for any day or evening.

# Can I pay with Euros or credit card in Gozsdu Udvar?

Most restaurants, bars, and major businesses in Gozsdu Udvar and the inner-city accept major credit and debit cards.

1p89uo7,https://i.redd.it/okpv70i0iu3g1.jpeg,Enough Was Always Enough (We Just Forgot),"You know that nagging voice that always comes while you’re sitting on the couch being taunted by your phone, the one that says “buy just one more thing online,” or “if only I had that one last thing, then I’d be good.”

We live with this devil glued to our shoulder, whispering subtle demands: more money, more stuff, more validation, more, more… more. And most days, frankly, it just doesn’t let up.

But then there’s that gem of wisdom from [Lao-Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) (for all you pseudo-Taoists out there): “*He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.*” There is definitely a quiet power in those few words, as if they were meant to crack our skulls open and show us what we’ve been missing.

Contentment. *Enoughness*.

Because think about it: what we call “not enough” is almost never some objective shortage. It’s almost always just a turned-up inner hunger. A hunger that society has trained us to carry at all times. The ads, the comparison games, that cultural noise telling us that our lives are only worthwhile when there’s one more thing in our storage shed, or a bigger balance in our bank account.

Lao-Tzu didn’t invent minimalism. He didn’t sketch out a curated Instagram feed or suggest specific budgets to follow or try to sell us a *90 day plan to financial independence*. No. He showed us something older, wiser, simpler: that the real danger isn’t lacking — it’s perpetual wanting.

He warns that there is *“no greater sin than desire, and no greater curse than discontent.”*

And if you’re anything like me: the desire is insatiable. It doesn’t have a natural endpoint. You want more, you chase more; then you chase more, and more. Like an appetite with no off-switch. So the more you feed it, the stronger it becomes.

But when you learn to understand the idea of “enough,” a powerful change takes place.

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--244dc0514c6c---------------------------------------)

Suddenly what you have begins to feel real, solid, meaningful.

The small house, the modest paycheck; they become gifts to be cherished. The relationships, those quiet Sunday mornings laughing over coffee; those are golden.

That doesn’t mean giving up on ambition or refusing to grow. It means seeing ambition for what it is sometimes: a restless ghost. Growth has its place, but it shouldn’t be the engine that forces you to keep moving while the real parts of you (your calm, your stillness) fall away.

In our lives, where most of us are drowning in *more*, “enough” can be a kind of liberation.

*Know what you need, stop looking for what you don’t.*

Maybe that’s why this one line finds such a home in my heart.

Because nothing in human nature truly ever changes. Greed mutates, but the hunger stays the same.

*And the only lasting cure isn’t accumulation. It’s enoughness.*

So next time that devil on your shoulder whispers “just one more,” maybe pause. Breathe. Ask: Do I want this, or does something else want me to want it?

And maybe, sometimes, walk away and quietly say, “I have enough.”

[Join us](https://kommunitykoin.com/) in making the world a better place. You’ll be glad that you did.

Cheers, friends.

Night four.

The station feels wrong in a way I can't articulate. The fluorescent lights hum at a frequency that makes my teeth ache. The coffee tastes like copper. When I walked in for my shift, Morrison looked up from his desk, smiled, and went back to his paperwork without saying a word. Not unusual, except Morrison always asks about the weather. Always. For three years, every single shift: ""How's it looking out there, Harper?""

Today, nothing.

Dale's at his desk, typing with mechanical precision. His posture is too straight, his movements too measured. I tried to talk to him when I came in, asked him if he wanted to grab lunch later. He looked at me with eyes that didn't quite focus and said, ""I don't know you."" Then he went back to typing.

The headache is constant now. A thick, pulsing pressure behind my eyes that makes the edges of my vision blur. When I blink, I sometimes see afterimages of things that aren't there. A tall figure standing in the corner. A hand reaching for my shoulder. The shape of someone's face pressed against the window, watching.

I've been staring at the same incident report for twenty minutes. The words keep sliding off the page.

At 14:37, my phone rang.

I didn't recognize the number, but the area code was local. I almost didn't answer. My hand was shaking when I picked up.

""Harper?"" The voice was tight with fear. Thomas Aqpik. ""I need to talk to you. Not at the station. Can you meet me?""

""Thomas, what's wrong?""

""Not on the phone."" His breathing was ragged. ""The old fish camp, north of town. The one by Otter Creek. You know it?""

I did. Abandoned for years, just a few rotting shacks on the ice.

""I'll be there in thirty minutes.""

""Come alone,"" he said. Then, quieter: ""I'm being followed.""

The line went dead.

I grabbed my coat and keys. Auntie was at the dispatch desk when I passed, her fingers moving across the keyboard with that same unnatural fluidity. She looked up as I walked by, her smile too wide, showing too many teeth.

""Going somewhere, dear?""

""Routine patrol.""

""In the middle of your shift?"" Her head tilted, just slightly. The same angle the Walker had used. ""You should rest, Benjamin. You look so tired.""

""I'm fine.""

""Are you?"" She stood up, moving around the desk toward me. I backed toward the door. ""You've been having such a hard time lately. The headaches. The confusion. Sarah told me you've been seeing things.""

My blood went cold. ""You talked to Sarah?""

""Of course. We're all so worried about you."" Her hand reached out, fingers cold even through my sleeve. ""Perhaps you should take some time off. Before something happens.""

I pulled away and pushed through the door into the brutal cold.

Behind me, I heard her laugh.

The drive to Otter Creek took forty-five minutes. The landscape was flat and featureless, an endless expanse of white broken only by the occasional stunted tree. The sky pressed down like a lid. I kept checking my rearview mirror, but the road behind me was empty.

The fish camp appeared like a wound in the snow. Three shacks, their walls gray and skeletal, leaning into the wind. Thomas's truck was parked at an angle, driver's door still open. I killed my engine and stepped out into the screaming cold.

""Thomas?""

The wind swallowed my voice.

I approached the nearest shack, my hand on my service weapon. The door hung from one hinge, creaking with each gust. Inside, the floor was thick with drifted snow. An overturned chair. A rusted kerosene heater.

""Thomas!"" I called again.

""Here.""

I spun. He was standing behind me, maybe fifteen feet away. His face was haggard, eyes sunken and red-rimmed. He looked like he hadn't slept in days.

""Are you alright?""

He shook his head. ""It's been following me for three days. Tall, thin, like a shadow standing up. I see it in my rearview mirror. At the edge of my property. Sometimes I hear it walking on my roof at night.""

""Thomas, what's—""

""I need you to tell me the truth."" His voice cracked. ""Is this because of my daughter?""

Relief flooded through me, so intense I almost staggered. ""Yes. Nika. You remember her.""

His face went blank. ""Who?""

""Nika. Your daughter. Eight years old. I found her four nights ago, saved her life—""

""I don't have a daughter."" The words were flat, automatic. ""I have a son. Tobias. He's six.""

""No. No, you came to the station. You brought me fish. You said—""

""I've never been to the station."" He took a step back. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Thomas, please."" I pulled out my phone, scrolling through photos. I had to have something, some proof. But when I got to the night of the rescue, there was nothing. Just a gap in the timeline. Photos from 02:45, then nothing until 04:23.

""You called me,"" I said desperately. ""Twenty minutes ago. You said you were being followed.""

""I called you because it's getting worse."" His voice dropped to a whisper. ""The shadow. It's getting closer. Last night, it stood at my bedroom window. I could see its outline against the glass. And Benjamin..."" He looked at me with naked terror. ""It was wearing your coat.""

The cold suddenly felt colder.

""What are you talking about?""

""Your SAR coat. I could see the patch. Your name. HARPER, B. But the letters were backwards."" He was shaking now. ""What did you do? What did you bring back with you?""

""I saved a little girl,"" I said, my voice low and steady. ""Your daughter.""

""I don't have a daughter!"" The scream tore from him as he fumbled for his car door handle, his eyes wide with pure terror. ""I've never had a daughter! Get away from me!""

He pushed my hand away. He got into the car and shut the door. The engine started. He drove off down the street. The taillights shrank in the dark and then were gone.

I took a step forward, a plea on my lips, but a hand fell on my shoulder, its grip firm and final. I turned.

Dale was standing there, smiling. That same warm, vacant smile I'd seen on my family. On Morrison. On everyone.

""Hey, Ben."" His voice was too loud, too cheerful. ""What are you doing all the way out here?""

""Dale?"" My heart was hammering. ""How did you—when did you—""

""I was checking the nets. Caught some nice char today."" He gestured toward the third shack. ""Want to see?""

His shadow was wrong.

The sun was low, casting long shadows across the snow. Mine stretched out beside me, a normal human silhouette. But Dale's was too tall, too thin, stretching back toward the shack in a shape that didn't match his body.

""Dale,"" I said slowly, ""I think you should step back.""

""Why?"" That same bright smile. ""I'm just here to help.""

""You don't fish, Dale. You're a vegetarian. You've told me a thousand times.""

The smile didn't falter. ""Of course I fish. I've been fishing here for years.""

""No,"" I said. ""You haven't.""

For a moment, nothing moved. The wind died. Even the creaking of the shack fell silent. Dale stood perfectly still, that smile frozen on his face like a photograph.

Then his head tilted. Slowly. Mechanically. The exact angle the Walker had used.

""You should go home, Benjamin,"" he said. The voice was still Dale's, but layered underneath was something else. Something that sounded like wind through empty buildings. ""Your family misses you.""

""That's not my family.""

""Isn't it?"" The head tilted further, past any natural range of motion. ""Sarah's making dinner. The kids are doing homework. Everything is exactly as it should be. You're the one who's wrong. You're the one who doesn't fit.""

Behind him, the shadow elongated. Stretched. The sunlight seemed to bend around it, creating a void in the shape of a person.

I reached for my service weapon, but my hand was shaking too badly to draw it.

""Dale, if you're still in there—""

""I'm fine,"" he said, his voice still bright. ""Better than fine. I don't have that headache anymore. I don't have those nightmares. I'm not afraid."" The smile widened. ""You could be like this too, Benjamin. No more pain. No more fear. Just peace.""

""That's not peace,"" I whispered. ""That's nothing.""

The thing wearing Dale's face took a step closer. In the direct sunlight, I could finally see what Thomas had seen. The skin wasn't quite right. Too smooth. Too uniform. Like someone had painted over a surface that was never meant to hold paint.

And underneath, where the shadow met the snow, there was no texture. No depth. Just a flat, absolute black.

I grabbed the flashlight from my belt and shone it directly at Dale's face.

For a fraction of a second, the light passed through him. I could see the shack behind, the gray wood visible through his chest like he was made of smoke.

Then he solidified again, but the smile was gone. His face had gone slack, features settling into something smooth and featureless. The mouth was too wide. The eyes were too far apart.

""You looked,"" it said in a voice that was no longer Dale's. ""Rule Two. You're not supposed to look.""

""It's two in the afternoon,"" I said, backing toward my truck. ""The rules only apply after three AM.""

The thing that wasn't Dale laughed. It was a sound like ice cracking on a frozen lake.

""The rules changed, Benjamin. When you took the debt, you changed them. Now we can come anytime. Anywhere. As long as the ledger needs balancing.""

Behind it, more figures were emerging from the shacks. Tall, impossibly thin, their shapes cutting sharp silhouettes against the white expanse. But these weren't shadows. These were people. The man from the third shack. A woman in a parka. An elder with a walking stick.

All of them smiling with that same vacant expression.

All of them moving with that same fluid, unnatural grace.

""Dale,"" I tried one more time. ""Dale, I know you're in there. You showed me the photo. You remember Nika. You remember the rules.""

For just a moment, something flickered behind those too-wide eyes. A spasm of recognition. Fear.

""I looked,"" Dale whispered, his voice suddenly his own again. ""Oh God, I looked right at it. It was wearing my mother's necklace. The one I buried her with. I saw it and I looked and now—""

His eyes snapped back to that placid blankness. The flicker was gone.

""Dale zones out sometimes,"" the thing said in that layered, wrong voice. ""He'll be fine. He'll be better. He'll be balanced.""

Dale turned away from me, his movements suddenly jerky and mechanical. He walked back toward the shacks with rigid, upright posture, not looking back.

I ran for my truck.

The Walkers didn't follow. They just stood there, a line of figures against the white, watching as I fumbled with my keys, as I gunned the engine, as I fishtailed away from the camp.

In my rearview mirror, I saw Dale get into his truck. He sat perfectly still, hands at ten and two, staring straight ahead.

Then he drove away in the opposite direction.

I made it back to town by 16:30. The sun was already setting, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple. I didn't go to the station. I went to the library instead.

Margaret was at the front desk, stamping books with metronomic precision. When she saw me, her face lit up with that same too-wide smile.

""Benjamin! How lovely to see you.""

""I need to see the old SAR records again. From 1956.""

""Of course, dear."" She stood up with impossible fluidity. ""Right this way.""

She led me to the basement. The stairs creaked under our feet. The lights flickered.

""You know,"" she said conversationally, ""I've been thinking about our last conversation. About Auntie.""

""What about her?""

""You asked how old she was."" Margaret stopped at the bottom of the stairs, turning to face me. In the dim light, I could see that her shadow was too long, stretching back up the stairs in a shape that didn't match her body. ""That was very rude, Benjamin. You shouldn't ask elders their age.""

""Margaret, when did you start working here?""

""Oh, I've been here for years.""

""How many years?""

Her smile didn't waver. ""Does it matter?""

I pushed past her into the archives. The boxes were where I'd left them four days ago, but when I opened them, the photos were different.

The group photo from 1956. The one with Auntie in the back row. She was gone. Just a gap where she should have been, the people on either side standing slightly too far apart.

The dedication ceremony from 1968. No Auntie.

The wartime civil defense meeting. No Auntie.

I went through every box, every file, every photograph. She'd been erased. Removed from the record like she'd never existed.

Except for one photo.

At the bottom of the last box, tucked into an unmarked envelope, was a single black and white photograph. It was old, the paper yellowed and brittle. The date on the back read February 3.

She looked exactly the same. Same gray hair. Same smile.

The caption on the back was in Russian, but someone had translated it in faded pencil: *The witch Akna receives her mark. May God have mercy on her soul.*

I heard footsteps on the stairs.

I shoved the photo in my pocket and turned. Margaret was standing in the doorway, backlit by the stairwell lights. Her silhouette was too tall, too thin.

""Find what you were looking for?"" she asked.

I didn't answer. I pushed past her and ran up the stairs. Behind me, I heard her laugh, just like Akna.

""A few more shifts left, Benjamin,"" she called after me. ""The ledger is almost balanced.""

I burst out into the cold evening air and ran for my truck. The streets were empty. The windows of the houses glowed with warm light, families gathered for dinner, everything normal and perfect and wrong.

My radio crackled to life.

""Unit Seven, this is dispatch."" Auntie's voice. Calm. Professional. ""We have a welfare check at 342 Maple Street. Requesting your response.""

342 Maple Street. My house.

""Negative,"" I said into the radio. ""I'm off duty.""

""Benjamin."" Her voice dropped, becoming intimate. Threatening. ""Your family is waiting for you. Sarah made pot roast. Your favorite. Don't you want to go home?""

I looked up at my rearview mirror.

She was sitting in my back seat.

Not a reflection. Not a shadow. Auntie herself, flesh and blood and impossibly there, her hands folded in her lap, that patient smile on her face.

""You can't run from this,"" she said softly. ""The debt doesn't disappear just because you're afraid. It follows you. It waits. And when the ledger finally balances, you'll be grateful for the peace.""

I threw open my door and fell out into the snow. When I looked back, the truck was empty.

But I could still hear her voice, carried on the wind.

""Few shifts left, Benjamin. Then you'll understand. Then you'll stop fighting. Then you'll be accounted[.](https://www.reddit.com/user/YourUsername/)""

A superhero, but without the cape and the fame?

This community is exactly what you've been looking for.

We are The Silent Guardians. Our mission is to quietly make the world a kinder place, one small act at a time.

There is no room for grandstanding, bragging, or chasing clout here. There are only quiet, anonymous actions that, together, weave an invisible web of kindness.

How does it work? We have two ways to participate:

1. [MISSION] — Weekly Assignments.

Once a week, we will post a simple and safe mission. For example: ""anonymously pay for the coffee of the person behind you in line"" or ""leave an encouraging note in a public place.""

· You complete it at your own time.
· You do not wait for thanks or boast about your deed. You simply do it and vanish.
· Afterwards, you can anonymously share your feelings in the weekly [REFLECTION] post. Not the facts (""I did it""), but the emotions (""It made me feel..."").

2. [WHISPER WALL] — The Place for Spontaneous Kindness.

This is a place for your personal, spontaneous acts of kindness that don't fit a weekly mission. Did you do something good just because you felt like it?

· Helped someone carry their bags?
· Let an exhausted parent with a child go ahead of you in line?
· Gave a genuine compliment to a stranger?
  Whisper about it in the pinned [WHISPER WALL] post.Not for glory, but to inspire others. This is our collective chronicle of quiet kindness.

Our Iron-Clad Rules:

1. Anonymity is our superpower. No photo or video evidence from the scene. Do not dox yourself or those you help.
2. No fundraising or advertising. We give our time and attention, not money.
3. Focus on feelings. In reflection posts, we discuss the emotions the experience gave us, not just the facts.
4. No judgment. There are no ""bad"" or ""not good enough"" acts of kindness here. Every single one is valuable.

This is an experiment. Can we, strangers on the internet, build a community based on pure, anonymous goodwill?

If this idea resonates with you, you are already one of us. No grand announcement is needed. Just begin.

Your first mission, should you choose to accept it, is to simply linger here. When you're ready, check out the current [MISSION] or leave your whisper on the [WHISPER WALL].

I'm interested in buying the Sage/Breville the luxe brewer. But when I look at some review videos on YouTube and read the manual that I downloaded I hear conflicting things and the seems to be features that are supposed to help with the brewing that I really don't agree with. Here is what I found.

* When brewing smal batches (600ml or smaler) the machine wil advice me to or make me (not sure) remove the carafe. When the carafe is removed the machine goes in to steep mode or emersion brewing. It acts like a clever dripper. It's a great feature but I want to decide for myself how to brew smal batches. Most of the time I brew batches of 500ml. I live alone and I do not consider that small. So can I just leave the carafe and brew as normal? Whether it be 500ml or a single cup?
*  When I do remove the carafe because I want to place a single cup under it, can I still avoid the steep mode and decide for myself what the best recipe is?
* The machine can be adapted to use a v60 (or anything els that fits under the dripper). I think this is super cool. But again I've heard or read that the machine takes over certain functions. Is this correct? Can I use the v60 in this machine and brew it the way I want?
* Douse anyone know if the v60 switch3 fits under it? ( not really important but I'm curious).
* Something I find really important is being able to save the setting I used, so I can tweak the recipe the next morning If I find that the coffee was not at its best? Douse anybody know how many saves I can make? Different coffee brands/roasts/dates/filters. There are so many options. I want to be able to save what if found worked best for a certain set of conditions. 

I really hope some of you have some or all these answers. I'm really exited about buying this machine but if it douse not brew the way I want regardless of the circumstances I will go for the Fellow aiden precision brewer.

When my wife and I first met, I was working 2 jobs, but after a while I ended up working in hospitality as a chef, I had always played video games to deal with stress, and she knew that. At the start of the marriage, she wasn’t working, so I was the sole earner covering everything. She would just stay home, watch tv and sleep. Wouldn’t do anything around the house to help, cook, clean, everything was left up to me once I came home from a 10 to 12 hour shift.
I thought it would get better, that she would finally help me out.. but it didn’t.
2 years into the marriage, she finally got a job to help out, but, she wanted to spent that money on other things for herself instead.
I told her, I don’t mind that, just as long as all the things we need to pay are paid first, to which she didn’t like but agreed.
Fast forward another 2 years, I get severely injured at work, ended up with nerve damage to my dominant hand and arm, so no more work as per my doctor and specialist, becoming medically retired.
I get a pay out from the insurance company, plus my salary for the next 30+ years.
I had to battle with the constant pain and depression that came with the injury and losing a career that I loved. But to deal with it all, I got back into video games, my physiotherapist said it’s a good way to improve movement in my hand, which sounds great, but my wife doesn’t think so.
We ended up using the money from the insurance pay out to put a deposit on our own house, and I thought things between us would get better, but unfortunately it didn’t.
All the things we said, to help each other out, didn’t happen.
Cooking, cleaning, washing, gardening, everything around a house that needs to be done, we were supposed to do it together to help each other, fell onto me to do.. ONE HANDED.
She is still working and said she doesn’t have time to do anything, she works 4 days a week and always the afternoon shift.
When she isn’t working, always want to just sit on the lunge and demand things, food, water, coffee, everything.
Or she wants to go out and do things, spend money we don’t have.
Considering I had to train my left hand to do everything from washing myself to dressing myself.
With some of the money I had, I bought a pc to game on, “using a controller set up so I don’t have to move my hand as much”
I would game for an hour, just to help my hand and my mind.
At first, my wife was somewhat okay with it, but would always interrupt me, talking and complaining about it.
Would always say, we should sell whatever I was using.. Xbox, PlayStation, pc, it didn’t matter.
Even if EVERYTHING is already done, the house is clean, it didn’t matter.
Then she fell pregnant, I thought finally she will help out.
Want a clean home for our child.. 
instead, it got worse, she became more lazy, more angry.
Would constantly put me down because “I don’t work” I just get to sit around home all day and do nothing.. even tho I have done everything around the house, cooking, cleaning, gardening.. all one handed.
And I am in absolutely excruciating pain that will last for a few days with very strong pain killers, at least a week without.
But no matter how much pain I am in, I still have to do things.
I have tried talking to her about everything, and how it makes me feel, but she will always turn it around on me, and I become the problem.
Since my daughter has been born, I have been the stay at home father, doing everything I can for her.. she is my world.
By the age of 1, I got her into a routine, dinner by 6, bath at 7 and in bed sleeping by 8, and she will sleep all night until 7:30am.
But everything I do, my wife undermines me.
Always telling me I don’t know things, telling me I don’t do anything around the house “especially when I forget to do ONE thing” it could be one load of washing, or not going to the store to buy something (I didn’t go because our daughter was sick and I couldn’t take her out in the rain)
And since my daughter has been born, her family constantly puts me down, saying I should be a role model for my daughter and find work, that they don’t believe I am injured (even tho I have been diagnosed by 5 different specialists with this nerve damage)
I feel trapped and used.
So I use video games to escape everything.
But as soon as I go to play, it causes an argument.
I just want to be able to relax and destress from everything.
House is clean, washing is done, dishes are clean.
Why can’t I relax and do something I enjoy doing?
Why is it a big deal for me wanting to play video games with friends?

Ohh, plus.. I’m not allowed to spend time with friends without her.
I can’t go camping, can’t go to the bar, can’t go for a drive with friends.
As I get “are you cheating on me?” Accusations. Even tho I have never cheated on anyone.. ever.
The only friends I can have are family, e.g her brothers or brother in-laws.
Not my actual friends.

I can’t even see my family without her constantly messaging me or calling me to find out where I am and with who.

1p898x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1p898x6/dealing_with_a_metas_insecurity/,Dealing with a meta's insecurity,"(This is kind of a break-out post from my last one, because I think this particular issue kind of got lost in the fog of everything else that was going on.)

So, what are your limits around deal with a meta's insecurity about your relationship with your para?

First, as context, I believe that ultimately the meta's insecurity is part of the their relationship with the para, not my relationship with the para, so it's ultimately theirs to deal with.

That being said, if the para makes reasonable requests of me, I don't automatically say no. ""Can the three of us have coffee together?"" is, for me, a reasonable request. ""Can you put the meta on your life insurance?"" isn't, though (that one has never actually come up :-) ).

Reflecting on it, I think my outer boundary is whether I feel that the meta is starting to alter the relationship between me and the para in a way that includes them, merely for the purpose of allaying insecurity. I'm fine leaving communication channels open between me and the meta, but not so much making promises to them. If, for example, the meta and para have an agreement that the para won't call me a ""boyfriend,"" that's between them; if the para subsequently calls me a boyfriend, I'n not going to correct them (assuming I'm OK with being so called).

This came up recently when the meta of one of my paras messaged me  in the middle of a conversation about something entirely different with (to paraphrase), ""Hey, has <para's name> ever made <description of specific sex noise> with you in bed?"" That was very uncomfortable for me, because that felt like the meta injecting themselves into my relationship with the para in an unasked-for way. I know that the meta was trying to allay some of their insecurity around what has become a somewhat intense relationship between me and the para, but… sorry, no, that's not the way I'm going to help in that regard.

(For the record, I deflected the question with ""I'm afraid I'm old-fashioned enough that a gentleman does not answer questions like that about a lady :-)"", which I'm able to get away with because of a significant age difference between me and the meta. It deflected it so far, but obviously this is something the para and I need to discuss.)",2,1764267681.0,polyamory,26,1.0,False

I can have normal conversations fine, but the moment there's any romantic interest I freeze up. I don't know how to be playful or create that spark. I've been told I come across as ""too friendly"" or that people can't tell if I'm interested.

Last week I was talking to someone at a coffee shop who was clearly giving me signals. Lots of eye contact, laughing at things that weren't that funny, mentioning she comes here often. And I just... talked about the weather and left. I realized an hour later she was probably waiting for me to ask for her number.

I see other people naturally tease and banter and it looks so effortless. For me it feels forced and awkward whenever I try. I either end up being too serious or I overcorrect and say something that just falls flat.

Is this something you can actually learn or are some people just not wired for it? I'm not looking to be some smooth operator, I just want to be able to show interest without killing the vibe.

Any advice for someone who's basically starting from scratch?",17,1764267669.0,datingadviceformen,4,1.0,False

Easiest form of self-care I've found.","This motivates me like nothing else. When I am NOT in the mood for something (eg buying milk, stacking the dishwasher, bathing the dog) I just think ""do it for future OP"" and it works every time. It also gives you a little ""Ima be my own hero!"" feeling.

Then later on, when you benefit from that chore (eg drink that morning coffee, have clean dishes, snuffle your dog's clean lil head) PLEASE PRACTICE GRATITUDE. Just a ""thanks, Past Me!"" goes such a long way to make you feel loved and like it was totally worth it.

This got even easier after I started using this little ritual from an app called Viberise, it’s basically breathing + gratitude + a tiny bit of journaling. It sounds dramatic but it made me way more aware of how drained “present me” feels sometimes, and how much future me appreciates even the smallest things. You don’t need the app to do this, it just helped me actually stick to it instead of forgetting.

But ever since starting to commute again in public transport, it's not the travel, despite it being a hour long, that exhausts me, but the people in general.

And I know I'm extremely being unreasonable for being this irritated because the triggers are just people conversing normally, laughing, them talking on the phone, drinking coffee, their appearance, their accent, being too close to me, the way they sit, the way they stand...etc.

It's just not right to be annoyed by these because people are entitled to all of that but here I am having a meltdown internally.

Before you suggest it, I cannot use noise canceling earphones, at least for long periods, I also don't listen to music that much, so if you can suggest an earphone that just blocks sound without needing to listen to music or weird frequency, please suggest and I'll have a look.

I know I am the one not right in the head. Is there some sort of therapy for this? I don't even know how to describe this to a GP without sounding a gobsbite.

Today I had coffee while listening to the birds. There was a lovely cardinal singing his heart out. And I could hear it. Now I sit with a simple mimosa, easing into the day as the chaos gently unfolds. And I can hear pretty much every word.

Him  being in the bathroom, lights on, blowing his nose loudly, talking to the cat outside my door (we sleep separately because of these issues). Then downstairs, the microwave door is banged when he makes coffee, the kitchen tap is run (badly plumbed). Then he goes in the lounge and starts clearing his throat loudly for the next hour.
