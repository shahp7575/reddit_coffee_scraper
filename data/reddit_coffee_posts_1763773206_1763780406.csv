Doing laundry is exhausting, holding anything “heavy” like a pot of water makes me heart rate high, or walking after eating. I get very sleepy after eating anything or drinking a smoothie. i don’t drink coffee or soda. rarely when i need energy i’ll get half decaf. i do love matcha but try to get it when i know i’ll be resting at home and not walking. 

HISTORY/MEDS: I was sick for 4 months with a respiratory infection (never covid) end of 2021 before getting my diagnosis. i originally was on metoprolol in 2022 for a few months but stopped because i would get sweaty bad nightmares waking up with my hair/head wet. i went a few months without medications. in 2023 i moved out of state for school and had to walk a short distance to school and my heart rate walking normally went to 200s, out of breath, and chest pain. then the cardiologist put me on atenolol. i was on it for 2 years and just titrated off this september. as of last month i have not been taking any medications. i stopped the medication because my blood pressure was severely dropping and my HDL labs were low. along with slow metabolism and weight gain. 

I been trying to get medical help since being off my meds. I went to the ER this week because my heart rate at work walking was 175s and I could not sit down because I am in the medical field and have over 20+ patients to take care of.  I was having chest pain for a long time. The ER just discharged me to follow up with PCP. My chest x-ray, labs and EKG were normal. Previously my 2 EKGs have shown short PR intervals. 

Every morning I wake up and my heart rate is 130s with palpitations. At work it’s 150+ walking or just walking outside it’s also 150+. If I try walking after eating or try gym machines it’s 170-180s. I stopped cardio, gym, hiking, pilates and hot yoga. Those were all things I loved but I can barely walk without being out of breath. I don’t know what to do other than wait to be seen by a cardiologist again. It’s tiring living each day out of breath and extremely fatigued. 

Has anyone received treatment that actually helps or other ways to reduce heart rate without adverse side effects? Any help or advice helps, thank you!",2,1763780022.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

**The Moment Everything Clicked**  
Every now and then, a project gives you a gentle reminder that nobody is immune to miscommunication, no matter how many years you’ve been doing this. I had one of those reminders this week, and it cost me twelve hours of coding that produced something technically correct, but practically wrong.

The client explained what they wanted. I listened. I nodded. I even repeated parts of it back to myself. Then I built exactly what they described. The only issue was that what they described wasn’t quite the thing they were actually envisioning. And here’s the important part: I didn’t ask enough clarifying questions to uncover that gap.

**Why Misunderstandings Happen**  
It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing you understand something because the explanation sounds straightforward. But in reality, most people are explaining the picture they see in their mind, not the one you need in order to build perfectly.

That’s where the process comes in. Requirement validation. Examples. Mockups. The annoying but essential back-and-forth that prevents assumptions from sneaking past both sides.

If I had slowed down and pushed for more detail or asked the right follow-up questions, I probably would have caught the mismatch. Instead, I trusted the description at face value. The client trusted that they had explained it clearly. And somewhere between those two good intentions, the actual requirement slipped through a crack.

**Owning My Role in the Mix-Up**  
This wasn’t a case of a difficult client or a messy requirement. It was a case of me not digging deep enough, and both of us thinking we were aligned when we weren’t. That’s why the project management process exists in the first place. It protects the timeline, the budget, the relationship, and your sanity. It forces clarity before code, which is always cheaper than clarity after code.

**The Takeaway**  
Ask more questions. Ask better questions. Ask the questions that feel obvious. Ask the ones that feel repetitive. Ask the ones your brain tries to skip because you think you already understand.

Because it’s a lot easier to spend ten extra minutes clarifying than twelve extra hours rebuilding.

And make sure your coffee is still warm before you start rewriting everything. - or in my case, a frosty white Monster Zero.

42M from the UK here, looking for some honest advice on where to live in Dubai. I did a 1-month trial in Dubai Hills last year and, while it’s nice, I actually felt a bit isolated there.

What I’m looking for:

* Good gym/fitness options (ideally walkable or very close)
* A bit of community / social vibe – somewhere I can actually meet people
* Healthy activities nearby (walking, classes, yoga, sports, etc.)
* Cafés/coffee shops where I can work or just hang out
* I’m 42, single, not a party animal, more into a chilled but social lifestyle
* Budget around 90k-100k for 1 bed

I keep seeing a lot of negativity about living in Dubai on Reddit – loneliness, superficiality, cost of living, etc. It would be really helpful to hear from people who actually *enjoy* living there:

* Which areas would you recommend for someone like me? (JLT, Marina, JVC, Greens, etc. – would love specifics)
* Any gym + neighbourhood combos you’d recommend?
* Anything you wish you’d known before choosing your area?

Honest pros and cons are welcome. I’m trying to figure out whether I should give Dubai a proper shot and, if so, where to start.

Thanks in advance for any advice 🙏",1,1763779821.0,dubai,1,1.0,False

I'm on the lookout for some new folks to RP with and as the title says, it would be based off of Greek Mythology. 18+ characters/RPers only, please!

About myself...Been at this for years, I've done a lot of writing, playing and running TTG and gaming in general. Depending on the scene I can write Novella to just a few lines, like if our OCs are sitting down to talk and have coffee, you could expect from me, mostly dialogue. I'm EST and we'll be moving to Discord.

What I'm looking for in terms Era could be from Wild West to Modern, that I leave up to you. I've already got a character in mind, great! If you wanna come up with one, great! I already have one ready to go. What I would like to do is a Demigod Mentor/Student RP, though I'm open to other ideas. This would be kind of along the lines of Percy Jackson, though you dont get a camp to go to you do get your own Mentor.

Not looking for anything super long term, something shorter would be a little better for me as I tend to work 6-7 days a week. I dont need immediate replies and I will get back you quickly, as is my own etiquette. 

Anyhoo, break time is over. I don't care how you identify, this RP can be for *anyone*, so if youre interested, reach out!

My (24M) female best friend (25)  is getting married in February, it's a dream destination wedding and I'm really excited cause we used to speak about how her wedding is gonna be and now it's happening!!! The guy is very calm, mature, well paying job, rarely drinks, doesn't smoke. I've met him a few times and we vibed on movies and Fifa really well! Even my friend has a well paying job and she is excited about the power couple image. This is an arranged marriage for context.

Now, our friendship has crossed over 10 years and I know every minute detail about her life. Her first bf, her first kiss, and even when she lost her virginity cause we are crazy close to each other and just share things (not in details of course).

Now, this friend, let's call her D has had multiple partners in relationships, situationships, flings etc. A rough count will be around 15-17 that I know of.

Yesterday, I was just talking to her about the travel plans and all cause we are planning to take a trip with our childhood friends before the wedding. She told me she wants a 'closure' from all the guys before she steps into her new life and my mind went 'WHHHAAATTTTT???'. Then I thought I'm misinterpreting and overreacting and so I clarified her with 'Closure means a coffee date closure, right?' and she said 'Nahiiii, I mean a last time together closure so I can have fun for the last time before beginning my new life'

My mind went numb, thoughtless, I didn't know what to speak!! The guy she is marrying is genuine amazing, good height, decent build, chill in nature, their family also seems pretty forward from what I've heard...

I don't kmow what to say or do, is this right? Does everyone do it? Am I just overreacting?

They are yet to exchange rings, should I tell him? The ring exchange ceremony is in 2nd week of December.

I tried telling her 'Are you sure? It might ruin your wedding if he comes to know, do you really want it?'

She said 'Dekh bhai, tu toh batayega nahi usse, nor am I gonna say anything, itne saalon mein mummy papa ko nahi pata chala, how'd he figure it?'

I just changed the conversation as it was too much load on my mind... But this thought has been disturbing me, what to do? Also this conversation has ruined my trust on marriage, I don't wanna get married now, this is too fu*ked up and I ain't ready for this, might as well stay single and happy",2,1763779087.0,TwentiesIndia,8,0.75,False

1p3hxjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1p3hxjx/new_job_growing_pains/,New Job Growing Pains.,"Started a new job at a coffee/breakfast place a couple of weeks ago after getting laid off from the fine dining sushi place I had been at for two years (it’s closing down for reconstruction). Before that I was at a more casual sushi spot for a decade where I was also in management towards the last few years of my employment there, but I digress.  

Anywho, after a couple months of searching (I live in a college town and got laid off RIGHT after the college kids came back so the job market was competitive), I found a job at a breakfast joint. It wasn’t my first choice, but I am just grateful I found a job and could finally get off of unemployment. 

This job is different than what I’m used to, that’s for sure. I’m so used to going up to tables, taking an order, and having a computer that prints tickets out to BOH. At this place, you have to write out tickets to give to the BOH but you have to write VERY SPECIFIC abbreviations. No problem, I’ve done that before. But you have to do it in a VERY SPECIFIC way; so gotta get used to that. I’m also used to going around and bussing. Like if you see an empty plate: remove it, if you see a dirty table, wipe it; both immediately so the next party can be sat. That’s usually the cardinal rule. But here, you take an order at the counter, make their coffee drinks and call the drink orders out instead of bringing them to the table, and this is the same with pastries. The only time you deliver food to a table is for entrees.

Being 32 and a student, I’ve noticed how much older I am than my coworkers as well. The FOH girls are all between the ages of 19-23, and it’s becoming clear to me I am not very welcome there as I replaced someone they loved who just quit. A few of them even have a clique-y vibe as well; the other day I was brewing coffee and one of the chamber baskets got stuck. I was struggling to pull it out and two girls who were talking just stared at me after falling silent. When I finally pulled it out, it came out with such force that it struck me in the face and had my nose bleeding everywhere. They saw it all transpire and instead of offering to at least let me go clean myself up, one of them just says, “So ANYWAY….” and they continued their conversation. I went to the back to wipe my face, then one of the girls goes back there telling me to finish my coffee-making task when she literally JUST saw me get domed and had blood going everywhere.

1p3hvyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p3hvyi/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Hi everyone. I need unbiased advice. My boyfriend thinks I cheated. 

I’ll get straight to the point. About five months ago in May, an old peer (let’s call him Z, whom I shared Gr. 5 with) reached out to me over Instagram to congratulate me on running for Valedictorian.  

At the time, I was knees deep appealing to everyone to get their vote — replying to everyone in DMs, trying to be on everyone’s best side. Note that Z and I had only shared Gr. 5 together. He was not in the school I was running for Val in. 

A close friend of mine (Lets call her K, whom I have known since Gr. 5) had been talking to me about Z. I vaguely remembered him, but again it was Gr. 5 and honestly we never interacted. She was talking to me about how she thinks he was Gay/queer now, after all these years. I checked out Z’s profile and honestly, it added up. I made a bunch of stereotypical assumptions based on how decorated his profile was relative to other guys— from painted nails to playing guitar, loving ice cream and such. Her claim added up in my mind. 

It was around 1-2AM when I received the message. I happened to have been awake, so I replied. Our chat was really short, but if I recall correctly it went along the lines of:

Z: omg congrats on running for Valedictorian! Tbh I would vote for you 

Me: thanks! Means a lot to me.

Z: Yeah honestly your application seems slighter more unique compared to K’s. Using the word X instead of Y sounds more interesting. 

(note: K knew Z much better than I, and they talked a lot too. K also happened to be running for Val). 

Me: Really? Wow! Somehow I hope I get Sal haha, Val is so much pressure 

Z: No you got this !! 

Me: anyways, how are you? It’s been a long time!

Z: I’m good. I swear I’ve been so worried about exams and stressed about next year

Me: Omg don’t you’re too sexy to be worried 😍😍

Later on I say something like “wow I like you” in response to something cool he did/said. 

That’s about how much I remember (it didn’t go exactly like that but very similar). The conversation ended about three minutes later. I went to sleep. Woke up and forgot about it the next day. 

Yes, I escalated WAY too fast, and my tone/timing was absolutely wrong. Yes I shouldn’t have assumed he was Gay. No, I absolutely have no romantic intentions or interest or feelings with this Z. Yes, regardless of what I thought/intended, it was completely inappropriate. But cheating? 

I am head over heels for my boyfriend. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We talk about our future together, kids, marriage. There hasn’t been a single time I have thought of us not being together. 

However, he was very clear about trust and loyalty. He has been from the start (December 2024). And I recognize that, yet I still texted what I texted.

It’s true I am a relatively friendly person. I ended up getting the position as Val, if that proves my point. My friendliness doesn’t work in my favour at times — especially when I’m trying to find my way out of an uncomfortable situation without making the other person feel bad (i.e., rejecting a guy nicely when they ask me out)

Since the middle of the summer, I’ve let my boyfriend have my Instagram account, location, phone password, and schedule through google calendar. I never saw a reason not to be transparent. If I’m truly fully committed to him, why not?

Anyways… three or so months passed and university rolls around. K is talking to me saying something like “did you know Z is also at your university?” I didn’t, but I check out his profile again and Lo and behold. I never reach out to him, kinda forgot about it and keep going about my university duties. 

At some point Z reaches out to me again, asking if I want to meet up with him to get coffee. The conversation went something like:

Z: hey I totally forgot you were at this university until I saw your post. Did you want to meet up and get coffee or something?

Me: Oh haha yeah, sure I’d love to! Do you know of anyone else from Gr. 5 who should come with us? 

(Note; I was well aware that a coffee meetup with just two people would be weird. I wanted to invite someone else at least.)

Z: yeah I know one guy but I feel like he doesn’t really like me. 

Me: Oh… he’s usually never like that. Let me go ask him. 

(Note: let’s call this guy D. D is fully gay and I’ve known him since Gr. 5. No qualms. Very neutral opinions about each other)

The conversation ended there as I never followed up. 

My birthday passed last weekend. My boyfriend took me out for the best celebration I have ever had. At the end of the night, when we’d gone our separate ways, he texted me asking about the message the Z sent me about coffee (again he has access to my DMs). 

I go back to that and I scroll up for more context so I can let him know about who Z is. I see the old message “you’re too sexy 😍😍.”  My heart drops. 

I immediately go back to my boyfriend and tell him that I sent very sketchy messages. He reads them.

Okay now cut scene. 

He gets very upset. I drive over immediately. It’s about 1AM. I’m so overwhelmed with emotion, scared about what he thinks/consequences. I try to talk and explain but I feel like vomitting and I’m shaking so much because I truly love him and I hate that I hurted him. 

His arguments:
- You said that shit while saying you wanted to marry me
- I’ve told you about how I feel about the way you talk to other guys
- Actions speak louder than words. 
- You know how I feel about loyalty. I’ve had to repeat myself so many times. 

Right now he’s giving me a second chance — to prove to him that my words (“I love you”) are real, and that none of what he had was fake. 

I’m so lost right now. We’re relatively long distance at this point as he’s taking a gap year. 

Extra notes:
- Met each other families. 
- Hung out almost every day during the summer. 
- Both were in previous relationships that didn’t workout
- what I’ve written here is the major incident/tipping point. There is so much nuance and detail and depth that I can’t even begin to describe. But above are the facts. 

What I’ve done so far to “prove” that  fully committed is:
1. Unfollowed all guys and deleted DMs 
2. Deleted Instagram
3. Been sending daily updates/pictures throughout my day and calling around twice a day so he can know I’m not “meeting up” with anyone

In terms of communication I’m so afraid to speak my mind because he said he’s sick of repeating himself. I’m so afraid of saying “I don’t think I cheated” because that is exactly what his argument is based off of right now. I really don’t want to break up. Please, if anyone has advice. 

I’m trying to change for him. I recognize I’m friendly, and I have been changing for sure. Don’t get me wrong. He is the most loyal, talented, and caring man I’ve ever met. I will honestly do anything. 

At the very beginning of our relationship I had a healthy amount of skepticism but over time, I learned to trust him. But I broke his trust. And I deeply regret sending what I sent. Of course I wanted to show him as soon as I had the mind to understand what I wrote. I still don’t know why i said what I said to this day. 

But did I cheat?

Apologies I can’t make a TLDR. Just too much info. 
Apologies as this is quite lengthy and not very organized. Thank you for reading all of this if you made it haha.

1p3hvs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1p3hvs0/feeling_kinda_stupid_and_need_to_vent/,Feeling kinda stupid and need to vent,"So I'm sick right now, some kind of cold or flu, hell maybe even COVID who knows.  Doesn't matter really.  But I'm sick and I'm tired, which is just making me emotionally dysregulated and I need to just lay this all out somewhere semi anonymously. 

So I've been doing the streaming thing on Growlr recently, while I'm working or cooking, just sort of a thing to keep me company and I find the guys on Growlr to be friendlier then on any other app.  

So the other day I'm streaming, and this guy pops on my stream.  I say hello, and he just kinda lurks, and says nothing.  But he looks kinda familiar, but I can't place him, because of the way the Growlr Live thing works though, his full picture is cut off.  

So I sent him a quick chat to say hi, said he looked familiar, but couldn't see his full pic on the live.  Mainly so I could go back afterwards and look at his full profile.  

Over ten years ago, I used to chat with this guy who lived in another province from me.  I lived near Toronto at the time.  And we talked a lot, first on the app, then through text and on phone, even FaceTime chat.  We literally talked everyday, often all day every day.  I grew very close to him, and honestly had a massive crush on him.  But I was going through some really heavy treatment/therapy at the time which stopped me from trying to take things further, even to go visit him. Which wouldn't have been hard since I actually have quite a few friends where he lived.  

We chatted for a long time, and then came a time when he was actually going to be in my area, and I thought hey we should go grab coffee or something, since he'd really just be passing through and it would be low pressure. 

He said that he couldn't, he was going to be really busy with family stuff, so it couldn't happen.  I was disappointed but such is life.  

A few days pass, and then when he was actually back home I noticed he has posted how he had a day alone in Toronto while he was waiting for his train, and wish he had something to do, or someone to do it with.  It would have taken me less then an hour to get to downtown Toronto, so the fact that he didn't message me kinda hurt. 

I tried to let it go, because it seemed like a silly thing to be upset about.  He didn't really owe me anything.  But I was still hurt that he didn't contact me, we could have hung out.  

But my feelings were starting to get a bit too big here, not just about how I was hurt, but how I felt about him.  And I needed to talk to him about it, just to clear the air.  So I was honest, direct and mindful about what I said to him, expressing that I had no expectations and that he didn't really owe me anything.  But I needed him to know this, so I could either let it go, so we could remain friends, or take next steps.  And that I was fine with either, but needed to get this out in the open. 

And as someone who told me he always respected honest and direct communication, I figured we could have this conversation. 

I never heard from him again.   And I was pretty angry about that, but again that was his decision and I couldn't force a conversation on him he didn't want to have.  But thought it was pretty shitty of him to just ghost me. 

That is, until he showed up to lurk in my stream this week.  Just enough to remind me he existed and then he didn't say a god damn thing to me.  

And I feel so stupid, because a decade later all those feelings of hurt, anger and abandonment from someone I trusted, someone I actually really cared about.  Despite it just being online.  Just all came flooding back. 
.
I hate the fact that it's over a decade later and he can still evoke those feelings in me.  

I know this will pass, I know it just triggered me and I'm flashbacking to my emotional responses of the time, because I'm vulnerable right now because I'm sick so my emotional regulation is not the best .  Rationally I know this is all long past.  

But emotionally, I'm right in that moment again and it sucks. 

Anyway, not really looking for advice, I just wanted to share.  Hopefully somone can relate.   Hope everyone has a good weekend ",5,1763778865.0,gaybros,0,0.86,False
1p3hvh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jibreal_Khan/comments/1p3hvh1/porn_makes_you_anxious_depressed_here_is_how_to/,Porn makes you ANXIOUS & DEPRESSED… Here is how to fix it.,"# Short term impact - Below Baseline Dopamine

The thing about porn consumption is that: Yes, it does release large quantities of dopamine into your system, and it does make you feel good in the short term. For a brief moment, all your troubles seem to fade away.

However, each time you get this massive hit of dopamine from porn, it is well above your baseline levels of dopamine, and once you are done watching it, your dopamine levels don’t just return back to the baseline again, they actually fall well below baseline level. In short, you feel worse than you felt before you actually indulged in watching porn.

# Long term impact - Desensitization

Additionally, in the long term, the neurological impact of chronic overstimulation is devastating. It leads to reduced activity in the brain's natural reward centers. This creates a state called ""anhedonia,"" where previously enjoyable activities lose their appeal because they can't compete with artificial stimulation levels.

This sort of desensitization effect compounds the problem, requiring even more intense stimulation to achieve the same dopamine response. What began as an occasional session of watching ‘vanilla’ porn for a few minutes, has now evolved into browsing ‘absurd fetishes’ for hours.

# Solution

The good news is that: you can go from a person with a disrupted reward system back to person with a normal healthy reward system. Natural dopamine regulation depends on maintaining appropriate baseline levels whilst preserving the system's ability to respond to genuinely rewarding experiences.

This requires both eliminating artificial overstimulation (in the form of porn, weed, alcohol, fast food etc.) and actively supporting healthy dopamine production and receptor sensitivity through lifestyle interventions. In this post, I am going to discuss a few of these lifestyle interventions that you can start applying to your life and heal your depressed and anxious brain.

# Intervention 1: Get your workouts in.

This intervention is going to sound very cliche, but the truth is that it is incredibly effective and this post would be incomplete without it. This effective protocol is “exercise”. When most people think about exercise, they tend to think about how exercise alters their outwardly appearance: you get leaner, you grow muscles etc. However, there is much more that is happening internally when you exercise. Exercise provides one of the most powerful natural dopamine interventions available.

Moderate aerobic activity, things like going for a slow-paced jog, or cycling at steady pace, or brisk walking, they increase dopamine production for several hours post-exercise, whilst simultaneously improving receptor sensitivity and reducing tolerance to artificial stimulation.

Additionally, High-intensity exercise, such as High Intensity Interval Training or HIIT workouts, have been specifically linked to increases in dopamine receptor density and dopamine transporter function.

What I would recommend is that you create an exercise regimen for yourself that incorporates a bit of both. Slow paced aerobic activities & HIIT, this way you are going to get the best out of both worlds. You can get all these benefits by scheduling 3 - 4 such workouts in a week.

# Intervention 2: Get your sleep in.

This intervention, too, is going to sound quite cliche, yet it is just another very powerful tool to have in your tool kit. This is your “sleep quality”.

Sleep quality has a profound impact on dopamine function, with research showing that optimal sleep can restore dopamine receptor sensitivity by approximately 15-25% overnight. Specifically, studies in animal models demonstrate that sleep deprivation significantly reduces dopamine D1 receptor density by around 15%, while recovery sleep can increase dopamine D2 receptor density by about 25%, indicating receptor sensitivity restoration during sleep.

There are several stages to your sleep. The deep sleep stages facilitate the clearance of metabolic waste products that interfere with neurotransmitter function, whilst REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep consolidates the neural pathways that support healthy reward processing.

There is bunch of other research done on sleep quality and how it impact your memory, your impulse control, your perception of things. Sleep quality, quite literally, plays a major role in every single bodily function that you have. It is absolutely essential for healing your reward system and building the impulse control to overcome porn addiction.

What I would recommend is that, the most important thing you could do to improve your sleep quality is fix a bed time and then go to bed at that same time every single day, including the weekends. There are numerous studies that show irregular sleeping patterns mess up your circadian rhythm, hormone secretion, your mood, your energy levels etc.

My second recommendation for sleep quality would be to get plenty of sunlight especially during the earlier parts of the day. Sunlight exposure, especially in the morning, is strongly associated with improved sleep quality by regulating the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) and enhancing melatonin and serotonin production. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that positively affects mood and melatonin is the hormone that induces and maintains sleep at night. Daytime exposure to sunlight also leads you to fall asleep earlier, have longer sleep duration, and better sleep quality compared to minimal sun exposure.

# Intervention 3: Get your cold showers in.

Immersion in cold water (as little as 1–3 minutes) has been shown in studies to elevate dopamine output by up to 250%, with long lasting effects on mood and energy.

Additionally, enhanced alertness and a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression have been reported following regular cold-water immersion or cold showers. Lastly, cold immersion releases other ""feel-good"" chemicals, such as beta-endorphin and norepinephrine, alongside dopamine, which further contributes to the mental health benefits.

In short, cold showers are like natures antidepressants and they should be part of your routine, especially if you are trying to avoid porn and you are facing void of pleasure in your life. What I would recommend is that you get a total of around 11 minutes per week of deliberate cold exposure, broken into sessions of 1 to 5 minutes each. So, you could be doing like 4 cold showers a week, each of the showers is 3 minutes long and that gives you 12 minutes of cold exposure.

Also, if you are feeling brave ;), I recommend taking the cold shower first thing in the morning. It works better than coffee, in my opinion, and just gets you fired up for the day.

# Intervention 4: Get your meditation in.

Meditation is associated with increased gray matter volume (GMV) in brain regions related to self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reward processing, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex etc.

Long-term meditation enhances neuroplasticity, which is the brains ability to rewire itself, and this is crucial in restoring your brain back to its factory settings and undoing the damage caused by porn. Additionally, meditation promotes neurogenesis (the creation of new brain cells), particularly in the hippocampus where our memories are stored.

In some sense, meditation is being in the complete opposite state than you are when you watch porn. When you watch porn, you are in a hyper stimulated state. When you meditate, you are deprived off all nearly all stimulation. This is probably why it has such a positive healing effect on your brain. Porn rewires your brain and makes you impulsive and out of control. Whereas meditation rewires you brain and get you feeling like you are in control. Porn erodes gray matter, whereas meditation helps in the creation of new cells.

There are various form of meditation practices that are available, each offer different benefits, what I would recommend is that you start making one of these practices as part of your daily routine. Start with a very little amount, just a couple of minutes and the gradually increase the duration of your practice over time.

(21F -> 21M),"TL;DR - Met a great guy through mutuals, my first ""relationship"". He had lots of things I liked, but also things I didn't like. Went on about 5 dates before breaking things off due to something health-related + being on different timelines. He thought I was ""the one"", ""perfect"" and hasn't been able to move on for 7 months since. He brought me generous gifts early on as well - which I wasn't comfortable with (prefer small meaningful actions but obviously he didn't know ME at the time). Mutuals constantly tell me how great/sincere he is - making me SO confused about letting him go (for now - I don't want to date for a few years) vs feeling I was being love bombed/projected onto. Thoughts????!!!!



So earlier this year, I met a boy at a mutual friend's 21st. He was tall, decent-looking and a good conversationalist. We hit it off and pretty much got talking right away! First coffee ""date"" went okay from my perspective, but amazing according to him. I led most of the conversation - and while we had lots in common, I wasn't 100% feeling the chemistry.

He asked to see me again every week consistently after that, and I went with it because there were lots of things I liked about him - he was kind, respectful and had great family values + similar hobbies. Our mutual friends also spoke very highly of him e.g. the girls went to him for guy advice. Friends opinions definitely kept me hooked, despite not being completely sure. The things I didn't like? He often lacked confidence and had some people-pleasing tendencies, also, his method of planning dates was just whatever he THOUGHT I would like.

Fast forward a few dates, he tells me about a health-related issue. I freaked out since I'm a med student and I asked for a break to think. At the time, I was super busy in school (6-year degree), while he had graduated and was looking for roles in IT/tech. So I told him it was probably best to take an undefined pause/break things off there. I was honest - different career trajectories/timelines, needing to accept the health thing. I told him I wanted to intentionally stay single until I finished school and stable in my job. We agreed to trying friendship later.

Kicker? He told me he thought I was ""perfect"", that he wouldn't find anyone else like me. He told our mutuals that evening he thought I was ""the one"". This was crazy to me because it had just been 2 months and 5 dates!!! We went no contact but kept following each other - and he would continue to like my stories (""friends"" right).

Anyway, he suddenly unfollowed me recently, and our mutual told me he hadn't been able to move on. He kept thinking about me daily for the 7 months that passed!!! He also apparently brought me an expensive gift right after our 2nd date as a birthday surprise (my birthday wasn't for another 10 months lol)????

My intuition told me that he didn't know or like ME, rather he was just projecting his ""perfect"" person onto me. But my friend reassured me that he is a great and genuine guy, it was truly from his heart. UGH I'm so CONFUSED.

Did I screw up by letting such a good guy go??? When I'm finally ready to date/settle down am I going to regret this choice?",1,1763778595.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False
1p3hsd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1p3hsd4/1_year_married_resentful_about_cleaning/,"1 Year Married, Resentful About Cleaning","EDIT: I re-read this and can’t change the title, but this is more about cleaning. It’s more resentment about my husband’s inactivity with household tasks like cooking, future planning, and cleaning.

My husband and I just celebrated our one year wedding anniversary. He loves me and treats me well. I love him, but I also need to find more constructive ways to communicate my needs to him regarding division of household labor.

Some cases:

\- He recently came home from a conference trip and unpacked his bags (great!). However, the dirty laundry he washed from the conference trip is still sitting in the dryer 3 days later.

\- Not cleaning related, but when he asked me what I wanted for my birthday in September, I said a camping trip. Doesn’t have to be a whole national park thing - just a nice weekend trip in a local park would do. Camping and getting outside are very important to me and will be a cemented family value when we have kids. He brought me out to eat for my birthday and got me gifts. Honestly I don’t even remember what we did, but I’m sure it was lovely. However, I’m still reminding him 2 months later that I want to go camping. I don’t want to plan my own birthday camping trip.

\- He is spending more than he brings in. OK… I understand that spousal incomes are joint income. We’re in a great financial position because we live in a house that his parents bought him, so no mortgage payments, and I make over $170k/year. But he makes \~$35k/year. He has a JD that he could put to use, but decided before he met me to get a PhD in a niche subject that likely won’t lead to a professorship job, especially one that we’ll move for him to pursue. If he wants the PhD for the PhD, fine. But I need a more concrete timeline on when he’ll be done rather than his vague “I’m trying to be done by next year,” while we’re currently trying for a baby and need to save for our future family. He also needs to make his deadlines - he submitted his qualitative exams a week late and continually misses deadlines. It pisses me off. I don’t want the added pressure of an additional baby human on my payroll, the extra cleaning, and having to pay for cleaning people when we could just knock our the household tasks together.

\- HIs parents set us up for a 15-minute one-on-one with their financial advisor over a year ago. After outlining out finances to her, she said she would be happy to meet with us using the retainer she has under his parents. Music to my ears. Since she is my in-laws’ financial advisor, I asked him to set up that follow-up meeting series with her. I actually asked him four or five times. We have yet to meet with her again because he never got in touch.

\- He never initiates meals. He’ll often make coffee in the mornings, but will never think ahead or propose what we should make for dinner. If, on the off chance, he does cook, it’s the same thing every time: a veggie fried rice thing I made once that he decided to replicate again and again and again and again… I’m so bored of it. I love cooking new things, especially with my partner, but I haven’t been motivated lately because of what I’m perceiving as a relationship imbalance and working long hours in a challenging leadership position.

\- I have high standards for household cleanliness. I like the kitchen counters wiped down every day, the house vacuumed 3-4x/week (we have two pets and shedding can pile up), and the bathroom scrubbed once a week, so I don’t feel slimy grime under my feet when I step into the shower after a long day of work (I usually work 9-10 hour days). When I moved into his house, it was a total bachelor pad. It’s starting to feel like a home - friends and family have even commented on the different - and now we’re dealing with the challenges of balancing everyday maintenance between the two of us.

\- Don’t even get me started on the dusting. This man has more books than god and is dead set on displaying them on our open shelving in the living room. I’m the only one who dusts those shelves. When I met him and started staying over, I noticed the shelves had a few centimeters of dust buildup on them.

He can handle little one-off tasks here and there, but it feels like he can’t get anything past the finish line on a regular basis. Again, we’re trying for a baby -- instead of feeling safe and secure about starting a family, I’m anxious. On top of it all, he tells me he cleans and that I don’t notice it… This drives me nuts, breeds resentment, and makes me explode on him in toxic ways. I’ve tried to suggest cleaning sessions where we do it together a couple of times a week, but he isn’t interested in cleaning together. We’re also only sleeping together when I’m ovulating - the attraction has plummeted.

That’s a lot of venting, but I would welcome any feedback or advice. My job offers couples counseling for free and I’m tempted to sign us up, but then there I'll be again… doing the most while he’s along for the ride.

I can't escape this suspicion that a large part of why it was implemented was to sanitise our appearances not just by severely limiting our ability to express ourselves, but also by curtailing our ability to denote queer identities through our clothing. I really think they want to limit our visibility under the guise of ""professionalism.""

There's a stereotype/joke/meme that the quality of your Starbucks drink is directly proportional to the visible queerness of the barista, and I feel like that's something they're trying to fight with the Back To Starbucks plan. As a transgender man with similarly queer friends, we always viewed Starbucks as safe spots because of their policies and because there were so many employees like us who seemed comfortable in the environment the company created-- so much so that when we needed to travel, we would plan our routes by Starbucks locations because we knew we could stop there with minimal risk of harassment or assault. The representation mattered to us, particularly living in the Bible Belt where we don't get to let down our guard.

Now, as a partner, I go to my store with my similarly queer coworkers, where we all have to dress like we sling coffee aboard the Death Star or be sent home in humiliation. I have directly observed the dress code being disproportionately applied to queer and especially trans partners as opposed to cishet counterparts (for example, a cis woman being allowed to wear metallic hair tinsel and perfume, but a trans man being sent home because his pants were the wrong shade of khaki, or another trans man being told to remove his metal hair clip), and I feel disempowered to speak against it because, of course, they're just enforcing the rules. Initially, I thought it was specific to my store's management, but I feel like it would be foolish to assume that the code was not being exercised the same way in other stores.

I did manage to secure a first placement at a big bank, working as an analyst, even before finishing undergrad. But before even finishing, I knew I wanted to attend graduate school, seeing all my buddies going down the same path. The placement at the Bank ended up going pretty well, I got an offer after 6 months but decided not to take it... had my sights deadset on grad school.

I tried my hardest, really tried hard networking, saw some grad school buddies getting offers from big banks and top consulting companies. Had some grueling interviews, talking like 4 to 5 rounds, but so far unlucky. Knew some people who failed like 2 to 3 courses and had secured pretty freaking awesome positions but not me. The problem now arises, I failed getting an internship and I've been home for the last 4 months, because in all my infinite wisdom, I decided to take an academic break in this first semester. Before embarking on this my mom and dad told me that I would have grad school paid for. It was a pretty tacit verbal agreement, but now i feel the rug being proverbially pulled right beneath my feet. My mom decided to, and if I may be a little humorous, pull my financing. I was told I was ""Doing absolutely nothing for my future"". Meanwhile I've been sending around 1 to 2 CVs daily, but I kid you not, the call-backs for interviews have stopped since late September (those of you in the know of graduate employment schemes will understand). I was told I had to find a job and write my thesis. The thing is I'm not an executive Master's or an MBA student, so my university will NOT accommodate this. I'm pretty much stuck with dissertation seminars during business hours. To add to the clusterfuck, the guidelines for the dissertation semester prep seminar advised a total of 35 to 40 weekly hours devoted to writing the dissertation. Ive tried telling my mom that the landscape is harsh, right now getting a solid graduate position is tough as shit, but she won't have it. Got around 3,2k saved, and have 4k left to pay. I'm obviously not getting an internship now with the start of the next semester around the corner. I would have around 1K after all is said and done after going halfsies with my dad, but I feel like I'm at a point of no return with my mom. what would you guys do ? know I'm pretty fucking privileged and this really is a non-issue when compared to other folks' problems, but honestly what would you do? The way u see it I could, get a less demanding part-time gig, like restocking at a local grocery or at a coffee shop. Should I say fuck my savings and just keep grinding and do the dissertation full-time? I would say that my mom pretty much despises me, and sees me as a slouch that only aims to be a NEET, so talking to her could be a possibility, just not a very reliable one... 



Again pretty privileged problem to have, but any inputs would be nice, I fucking just hate my predicament... I feel that I worked my ass off just to be in a clusterfuck of a situation. 



***TLDR***: An MSc Finance student is struggling to land a job in a tough market. Despite a verbal agreement to pay for school, his mother has cut off funding for his final dissertation semester because she perceives him as lazy for not having secured a position yet.

1p3hp4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p3hp4v/we_finally_trusted_someone_to_watch_our_disabled/,"We finally trusted someone to watch our disabled daughter, and it turned into a nightmare","After our 7-week-old daughter finally stabilized from a horrible medical crisis that kept her in the pediatric intensive care unit for weeks, resulting in cerebral palsy, we were finally sent home. We didn’t dare let our baby out of our sight. We were terrified of her seizing or choking or not breathing again, we were constantly monitoring her. My wife Sally and I were already exhausted from the hospital experience; physically, emotionally and spiritually. Now, our hyper-vigilance was taking an intense toll on us.

Our family and friends could see that were not doing well, we were worn out and needed some respite. They all did the best they could, but caring for her could be a monumental task. So, after much persuading, we finally agreed to get some professional help.

Because of our daughter’s newly inflicted disability and our low income, Sally and I qualified for state sponsored respite care. This meant that we could have somebody from a state qualified agency, trained in caretaking and emergency medical procedures, take care of our baby girl for little to nothing, for about 20 hours a month.

When our first respite day came, we were beyond nervous. The thought of leaving her alone with somebody else, was overwhelming. Sally and I decided that there was no way we could be far away from our daughter, at least not on this first respite visit. So, we decided to just walk around the block several times, which was as far as we felt we could be from our child.

The respite caretaker arrived on time. She was a very large, rosy-cheeked lady. She seemed nice enough and sounded as if she knew what she was doing.

We talked with her for about 15 minutes, explaining everything she needed to know for the care of our daughter. Then, Sally handed the caretaker a baby sling to carry her around the house. At the time, it was the ultimate tool to keep our child comfortable and reduce her constant screaming. Sally asked the respite care lady if she knew how to use it, she said yes, and ushered us out the door.

Sally and I walked around the block several times, holding hands, occasionally sitting on the curb and talking. It was nice to get out, alone and be tender with each other. The sun was setting, the temperature was nice and cool, and this alone time was just what we needed. It was the first time in a while that we’d been outside, just the two of us, and I felt almost human again.

After about 30 minutes, we decided we’d been gone long enough. I was feeling a sense of rejuvenation, like the dark cloud had been lifted, even if just a bit, and I could handle another day of our new, complicated life.

As we got back home and walked in the front door, that nice feeling evaporated, instantaneously.

There, standing in our living room was the respite caretaker, her face was red, wet with sweat. I stood there staring at her, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Then I saw our daughter, or rather, I saw our daughter’s foot. It was sticking up from the top of the sling. The respite care provider had put our child into the sling upside down. After a moment, as I stood there dumbfounded, I could hear her muffled screams coming from inside of the sling.

Sally was the first to react. She ran over, pulled our baby girl out of the sling, feet first, and quickly rushed our baby away from the respite caretaker. Sally sat down, took her onesie off to cool her down. She was discolored and sweaty, from a lack of oxygen and the heat. God knows how long this lady had our baby stuffed ass-backwards into the sling. The caretaker was clearly flustered, became defensive, and blamed everything on the cloth device, rather than her lack of common sense.

Without saying a word to each other, Sally and I both knew that we wanted this human train wreck out of our home and lives, forever, as quickly as possible. Sally handed our child to me and rushed into our bedroom to get the checkbook. When Sally came back, she had the check filled out, with a generous tip included.

I felt a massive sense of relief when my wife handed this woman her pay, so she could get the hell out of our home and lives. But to my surprise, she didn’t get up off the couch. She leaned back, put one leg over the other, and started watching TV! Sally and I stood there flabbergasted, almost as if we had been transported into an episode of The Twilight Zone.

We all sat there for a few moments in silence, Sally and I nervously shifting our gaze from the TV to the lady, and back to the TV. Eventually, Sally got up, walked halfway to the front door and said, “Well, thanks for the help, we really appreciate it, I think we are going to rest now.” The respite caretaker slowly turned her gaze from the TV to Sally, with a surprised look on her face and said, “You’re supposed to feed me. I’m hungry, so you need to feed me before I go, it’s in the agreement.”

You could have heard a pin drop in my living room. The caretaker sat there intently staring at Sally, Sally stood there looking back at her, not saying a word, trying to absorb what this woman had just told her. I wanted to crawl under the coffee table with the baby, insert my thumb into my mouth, and curl up in the fetal position.

There was no agreement to feed anybody, none whatsoever. This lady just wanted to eat.

So, there we sat, Sally on a hard wooden rocking chair, cradling our child in her arms, me perched on a hand-me-down seat, while the caretaker lounged on our soft couch. She was slowly, and loudly, eating a hastily-put-together meal, on a TV tray, watching a sitcom, occasionally laughing. She was oblivious to our presence, much less, her impact on us. As I watched this oversized woman, all I could think about was [Mr. Creosote](https://youtu.be/rXH_12QWWg8) from the Monty Python movie “The Meaning of Life”.

In the scene, Mr. Creosote eats so much, he projectile vomits into a bucket, eats more, and finally explodes, after eating one last wafer. As I sat there waiting for this lady to explode, I had a sinking feeling as I realized that it would be a very-very-very long time, before either my wife or I could trust anybody again, to take care of our little angel.",0,1763778315.0,TrueOffMyChest,17,0.5,False
1p3hoq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p3hoq5/i_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_broke_friend_i_dont/,I don't know how to tell my broke friend I don't want to pay for him anymore.,"I (22f) have a friend (23m) who we'll call Conner. Conner and I have been friends for about a year and a half since he started working at my job. Conner is a genuinely cool person, and I enjoy his company. He's funny, smart, and we get along really well. Connor also has autism, and a few other medical issues that are worth noting. Connor owns a house, and with both of us working near minimum-wage jobs, most, if not all, of his money goes towards his mortgage, bills, etc. When our friend group wants to hang out outside of just going to someone's house, one of us will usually offer to help pay for him to go because we want him to be able to come with us. He has once or twice paid for one of us for something or other, like a dinner, etc. Connor also doesn't drive, so I sometimes drive him to work when I'm also working, or drive him home. I don't mind driving him, and often offer rides to my friends who don't have a car, can't drive, etc, to save money. Another friend of ours, Jake, lives in the direction I'm going anyway, so to pick him up really isn't that big of a deal.

I first noticed it one day when Conner was working a double-shift, and asked if I could bring him some coffee after I got off work. It was no issue for me, since the coffee shop was not even half a mile down the road. I got the coffee and brought it to him, he said thanks, and left. Another time, I got up early to bring him to work, I was only coming in an hour or two later, and figured I could take myself to breakfast. Conner asked what I would do with these two hours, and I told him. He asked if I would bring him some, and I told him I would, but again, after bringing him food, he didn't ask what it cost or offer to pay. Just recently, Jake and I were going over to Conners house, and Jake was taking me to go get food before we went over because I was starving after work. While we were discussing plans over the phone, Jake mentioned to Conner that we were picking me up some food and would then be over to his house. Conner asked if we could grab him some food too, and since I was already going, I agreed, feeling it would be rude not to bring him some since I was already going to that restaurant. But again, Conner never offered to pay me back. 

Jake and I have been talking, and Conner has done this a lot lately. Just recently, his partner spent a couple grand on a personal hobby, and they both went out to dinner together. In talking to Jake, I learned that Conner actually owes him a good chunk of change from helping him to pay for a couple of bills when he was in a bind. We're both kind of irritated, and Jake has confessed that while he loves Conner and loves hanging out with him, he's burnt out from still not being paid back. I kinda feel the same way. I want to bring this up to Conner, but I'm worried he won't take it well. Recently, his medical issues have been really bothering him, and he hasn't been in the greatest of moods. At work, he's irritable, and seems to be slowing down, which is understandable. But when Jake and even our boss brought it up to him, Conner has gotten really defensive, and I'm worried that if I bring up my struggles with him not offering to pay me back, he might not take it well. 

I genuinely value Conner as a friend, and don't want to stress him out even more with everything going on, but I'm struggling with feeling taken advantage of. I want to have an adult conversation with him, but I have no idea how to approach him about it. It's gotten to the point where Jake is struggling with wanting to spend time with him, because he's still not being paid back, and Conner has been talking about how 'mean' Jake has been recently. I want to stay friends, and hate saying no, especially if it's not really an issue picking him up some food, but we both work at the same job, and I don't have a lot of money either. How can I tell him I don't want to buy him food anymore?",1,1763778279.0,Advice,6,1.0,False
1p3ho34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1p3ho34/how_the_pratfall_effect_can_instantly_make_you/,"How the “Pratfall Effect” can instantly make you more likable AND respected (yes, even if you mess up)","If you’ve ever been told to be perfect to be respected, welcome to the lie most of us swallowed growing up. In classrooms, job interviews, social media, there's this pressure to never mess up, never show weakness, always be in control. But here's the wild part: trying to act flawless actually makes people like you *less*. What makes you more appealing? Surprisingly, it's showing just the right kind of flaw.

This post digs into one of the weirdest and most useful psychological effects you’ve probably never used to your advantage: the **Pratfall Effect**. The idea comes from real research, not some recycled TikTok advice. It’s backed by science, explained in books like *“Thinking, Fast and Slow”* by Daniel Kahneman and explored by top behavioral scientists like Dr. Elliot Aronson, who first discovered it.

Why this matters? Because being respected *and* relatable is a power combo. And we’re usually taught to pick one. But when used right, showing small imperfections can *raise* your status rather than ruin it.

Here’s how to make the Pratfall Effect work in real life, backed by science, podcasts, and the best psychological insights out there:

* **What is the Pratfall Effect exactly?**
  * Basically, the Pratfall Effect says that highly competent people become more likable when they make a small, harmless mistake.
  * This was discovered in a 1966 study by psychologist **Elliot Aronson**, where participants listened to recordings of people answering quiz questions. The ones who performed well but spilled coffee at the end were rated *more likable* than those who were competent but didn’t mess up.
  * But here's the key: it only works if people *already* think you're competent. If you screw up *without* proving you're capable first, it just confirms you're a mess.

* **Why does it work?**
  * People like humans, not robots. When you're really good at something but also show a flaw, it makes you feel “real” to others.
  * According to a meta-analysis published in the *Journal of Nonverbal Behavior* (2019), small admissions of harmless vulnerability increase trust and warmth in professional and social dynamics.
  * Think of it like smoothing off the sharp edges of perfection. It invites connection without threatening status.

* **How to use the Pratfall Effect without looking sloppy**
  * *Make the mistake small and harmless.* Forgetting a name, laughing at yourself, sharing a minor failure, not your biggest trauma or a career-ending error.
  * *Lead with competence.* Deliver great work, show your knowledge, or demonstrate skill *before* revealing the flaw.
  * *Use it strategically.* In job interviews, public talks, or team leadership moments, owning a minor stumble can make you more trustworthy. For example:
    * “Sorry, I get way too excited about spreadsheets. Yep, that’s my embarrassing confession of the week.”
    * “Of course I forgot my keys in a podcast studio… right after explaining my ‘morning routine mastery.’ Classic.”
    
* **Places where it’s working already (you just didn’t realize)**
  * **Podcast hosts** like Tim Ferriss, who often highlight their early failures while interviewing billionaires.
  * YouTubers like **Ali Abdaal** or **Thomas Frank** routinely share productivity fails to connect with their audience.
  * Even in politics, candidates gain points when they show awkwardness *after* proving they know what they’re doing. Obama’s self-deprecating humor? Peak Pratfall Effect.

* **Use it in personal life, too**
  * *Dating?* People are more attracted to someone who shows just a bit of authentic vulnerability. Not perfect, just real.
  * *Friendships?* Sharing mini failures (like messing up sourdough again) makes you more relatable and safe to open up to.
  * *Confidence building?* Once you learn that perfection isn’t the goal, your social anxiety drops fast. You stop trying to script every moment.

* **What NOT to do**
  * Don’t overshare or trauma dump. The Pratfall Effect is not the Sympathy Effect.
  * Don’t expose major incompetence. Do not use this trick if you haven’t proven your skill/value first.
  * Don’t fake it. People can smell a rehearsed vulnerability from a mile away.

* **Bonus insights from the experts**
  * In *“The Human Brand”* by Chris Malone and Susan Fiske (professor at Princeton), they found that brands and people that show both **warmth and competence** build the deepest loyalty. Overemphasizing just competence makes others feel threatened.
  * A 2022 study in *Harvard Business Review* found that leaders who occasionally admit mistakes in meetings retain higher trust and increase team performance by up to 19%.
  * The *Hidden Brain* podcast’s episode “You 2.0: Being Kind to Yourself” dives into why self-compassion and light vulnerability actually help people grow faster, not slower.

* **How to practice this in daily life**
  * Try adding a small, real self-own in the next group setting *after* you’ve offered value.
  * In your email signature or bio, include something slightly silly or unexpected, it signals confidence without arrogance.
  * When someone gives you a compliment, acknowledge it but add a little genuine imperfection: “Thanks! Though it took me three tries to get it right…”

Once you internalize this, something clicks. You stop trying to be the person who never messes up. You focus on being the person who’s *good and human*. You’re sharp, but soft around the edges. Turns out, that’s what makes people trust you more.

1p3hnfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p3hnfk/the_aftermath_of_dating_a_loser/,The aftermath of dating a loser,"I don’t hear about this enough but the aftermath of dating a loser is truly an interesting journey. For me, my self esteem was shattered after breaking things off with somebody who couldn’t even express true love. I felt like I was completely unloveable and not worthy of a relationship. It didn’t help that he was my first boyfriend.

For months, I was waiting for him to reach out, to finally take accountability. Maybe even catch up over coffee. But I knew him. He loved playing the victim in every single incident of his life — he could never do no wrong. And even if he did realize his wrongdoings, he will never openly admit it. I honestly like to say his ego got in the way of us having a fulfilling relationship. Yet, I still had hope he changed.

As for him being a “loser”. He wanted the easy route in everything he did. He cheated on almost every assignment all the way through graduation. He was 23 and hardly worked any jobs despite having plenty of free time. His parents gave him an allowance. We literally had to organize our dates or simple plans around the date of his “payday” but even then, he wasted his money on the dumbest things oh my goodness. There’s so much more but it’s laughable looking back. 

I was considering following him on instagram earlier this week because his friend follows me (I only accepted because I actually enjoyed the time I spent getting to know her) so I would not be surprised if he’s already up to date on my life. He requested to follow back in September a couple days after his friend did after I removed him in July but I declined because I thought it was such a pussy move. But then I got really sick recently and got flashbacks to when I was even more sick in the spring where he showed absolutely no concern whatsoever until I told him to. He was even aggressive when we were intimate around that time, knowing my body couldn’t handle it. That was honestly my second to final straw. I brought up his lack of concern during the breakup and even then, he still didn’t get my frustration. He deflected like his life depended on it. I just wanted him to actually show that he “loved” me. 

Now, I know I’m genuinely better off without ever seeing him again, truly. This isn’t relevant and might come off as conceited but I don’t think he could do better than me, at least while he’s still this way. He’s attracted to drama and chaos, from what I’ve learned about his lengthy past. He doesn’t take time to heal — he finds the next girl to occupy his time. I like to say dating is his favorite hobby. He will never admit it but he doesn’t respect himself. And I know I deserve so much better and I mean it. It’s been 5 months and my confidence has never been better. I’m single and relearning how to love being alone and it’s been amazing. I have a much better understanding of what I like and don’t like and that doesn’t just apply to dating but hobbies as well. I have a clearer view of what career path I want to take. I never imagined being this content with silence.

TL;DR: Breaking up with my ex was the best thing I’ve ever done and I’m grateful for dating a loser because now I think I’m the shit. And please do not follow your ex on social media or break no contact, it’s not worth it.",2,1763778169.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

again, the same actor, and wow.  they were great.  really true to the first movie.  what he captures so well is how, i would imagine, when you're going to kill someone face to face... you'd have to bridge that gap between 'this is a normal human interaction' and 'no, seriously, i'm right now about to kill you'.  it would be a surreal moment and i'm not sure the victim would even really take it seriously, unless you'd already been violent with them and they understood what was happening and what they knew you were already capable of.

i love that they have these moments, where the killer is clearly, straightforwardly telling his victim 'i'm about to kill you' and they don't take it seriously.  i love that there's no violence leading up to it, but instead the killer has been fucking with them psychologically and confusing them about whether or not he's dangerous, so even when he's saying it straight up, swinging the axe, they're still not fighting back or running until the actual moment that they're physically begin killed by him.  i think it's just a really original approach to a murder scene.

it's almost like how some predatory animals are said to hypnotize their prey, like 'kaa' from the jungle book.  i think the prey must just sort of be like 'what?' just unable to imagine what's about to happen when there's been no chase or violence already.  predatory animals are really messed up, they have disturbing psychology.  they *like* to terrorize, they *like* to play.  they're sadistic little fucks.  there are cases where, and it's usually a big cat, an animal will become a man-eater and terrorize people because it's fun.  there was this lion (not the man-eating lions of tsavo) that terrorized a village, killed a woman and then took her stuff out of her house and played with it.  it sent messages to other villagers like 'i know where you live' basically, and then became a ghost.

anyway, i was enjoying that tv show and relaxing around the house and ate kind of whatever i wanted today.  [breakfast](https://imgur.com/G5oB1z3) was eggs, toast, [cereal](https://imgur.com/A9rNvG6), coffee.  watching my show, i had [cheezies](https://imgur.com/3rr2VUu) from halloween and then [more](https://imgur.com/Bn3uyA2).  feels ridiculous eating all these little bags.  i also had some [nice cream](https://imgur.com/y5OMxYX) which is just frozen bananas blended with cocoa powder and some peanut butter on top (bonus points for sugar cone).  [dinner](https://imgur.com/aGm1QMH) was roasted vegetables and hummus and a flatbread with other roasted vegetables and salsa.  i wouldn't say i've 'blown it' but this is just a hungry day for me and i might still eat a bit more.",1,1763778056.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

How do you make it go away? 

Slowly, disciplined, treating yourself. 

Planned meals, thoughtfully cooked. Snack plans. 
All cooking done with gpt + monash. Yeast was a mistake at monash, which I took for way too long into carnivore and found out same time I dropped coffee. There was nothing else to drop. 

So, yeah. I hope this helps someone
Please reach out as I'm personally looking for help to start a fresh cycle and get back into keto and no carb. Not even for recovery. I will eat taters and whatever rice or other noice carbs when the time is right. But I'd really like to invite someone into a little more strict dietary plan and ease into ketosis, while prepping for deep autophagy and full recovery within weeks. 

I've got the plan and we can work on something more structured and common together.

With mutual friends connecting us, it was inevitable that we'd talk, so we ended up talking more and more as the weeks passed. To start, everything looks casual and normal, just two people getting well. But pretty quickly, I noticed there was chemistry. Nothing explicitly romantic, but that kind of vibe where the conversations flow easily, we laughed at everything and naturally we are attracted to each other when we are in the same group.

For chemistry, we started doing things together outside of class, not for dates, at least not officially, but we would drink coffee, study together, walk around campus, and talk about personal things. I really thought she was single and she never mentioned a boyfriend, and the way she acted with me didn’t suggest she was with anyone.

One day we were with some friends when suddenly her boyfriend arrived to pick her up, and that’s when I realized she had a boyfriend. I felt embarrassed and honestly a bit guilty, even if I hadn’t done anything intentionally wrong. After that, I decided to distance myself from her out of respect for her relationship and to avoid getting caught in something messy. But some days later, she called me and asked if I wanted to hang out again. She didn’t act weird or explain anything, she just acted like everything was normal, I wanted to tell her no, although I ended up saying yes. And since then, we’ve continued hanging out in the same “not dating but kind of chemistry” way as before.

Now I feel conflicted. I’m not trying to steal her or cross any lines, but the situation feel complicated and emotionally confusing. She has a boyfriend, yet she keeps reaching out to spend time with me in a way that definitely feels more than friendly. I don’t know if I should keep spending time with her, set clearer boundaries, or step back completely.

So now I’m wondering… am I the asshole for continuing to hang out with her even though she’s in a relationship?

1p3hgr5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3hgr5,Where should I put lamps?,"Its a basement apartment so the moodier the artificial lighting, the less Im reminded that I live in a dungeon. 

The only two ways to incorporate different light sources with reasonably easy cable management are: 
-floor lamp(s) on one or both sides of the couch
- led strips behind/ under the couch that can glow onto the wall behind the couch. 


The only lamp- accessible outlet is behind the fridge (to the left of the couch when sitting on it) so I have been considering running some type of extension cord under the rug and into the storage cabin thing in the coffee table. Then I can run a cord from a lamp that sits on the coffee table down into the table plugged into said extension cord. Like it would mean cutting a hole in my beautiful new rug and never moving my coffee table? Because I would want the cord traveling along a leg of the table, so if I moved the table then the cable would show/ need to be pushed back under the rug. Plus, I dont even know if that is something I should consider. It could be a fire hazard, or maybe cutting a hole in a rug doesnt last well unless I stitch it to keep it from ripping more. just dont like the sterile a** ceiling lighting.

This basement actually used to be my GF’s dad’s music studio, so as you can see, it has some infuriating windows between rooms. I am thinking Ill just put curtains over them, but Im also intrigued in other creative solutions. They definitely need to be covered up, my girlfriend doesnt talk much with her dad. Im open to any suggestions on how to creatively cover them up! 

TL:DR
I need lamps in my work in progress basement, but barely have outlets. Whether you have tips on how to discretely run cords into the middle of a room/ any insight on cordless, rechargeable lamps, please let me know! ",3,1763777621.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

They have just finished Dinner at Toni’s.

Dan points the Jeep towards Susan’s house. Unfortunately he has to pay attention to the road. Occasionally he catches glimpses in the rear view mirror. The dresses at this point were just getting in the way. Dan parks in the driveway, gets out and opens Susan’s door. The two lady’s are cuddled up, obviously very worked up. 

“I think she is ready Daddy.” Amy says with a wicked smile. 

“Baby Girl, we haven’t even been invited in by Susan yet.”

“After that wonderful date, I think we should spend some more time getting to know each other. I have coffee, wine or bourbon. A 21 year old bottle that I’ve been saving for a special occasion to open.” Susan steps out and kisses Dan on the cheek. “I think you two are special enough, Daddy.” As she grabs his cock through his trousers.

Amy slides through. “Remember you are mine. Forever and always.” She whispers in his ear. 

They walk into the house, arm in arm. This time Amy in the middle. Amy was expecting a perfectly kept house. It wasn’t. It was a house where a 7 year old boy and a working single mom lived. A blanket and pillow on the couch. A pair of soccer cleats and ball on the floor. A few unopened letters on the table and breakfast dishes in the sink. It was a home not a palace. 

“Freddy is at his Dad’s for a few days. He’s a fantastic father but was a horrible husband. Excuse the mess.”

Susan walks over and pulls a very nice bottle of bourbon out of the cupboard and pours 3 glasses. They pass them around. Dan takes Amy’s glass and swirls his finger in it and traces her lips. She then sucks his finger into her mouth. “You are such a good slut. I love you.” Amy drops to her knees and begins releasing him so she can give him a blow job. Dan waves Susan over and kisses her deeply. 

“I need to know your safe word my dear.”

“I never have needed a safe word before.” Susan admits. 

“Then you have never experienced great sex my poor little girl. Choose a word you don’t associate with sex but you will remember. Understand without that word, I will do everything and anything I want. You can scream no and protest. But till you utter the word I will do with your body as I please. The other option is tap my arm or leg or Amy’s 3 times.”

“What happens then?” Susan asks nervously. 

“All action stops. I will pull out, Amy will remove herself.  All toys will be removed and you will be cared for. You are also allowed to say yellow light. We won’t stop but won’t progress any further.”

“Soccer. That is my word.”

Dan smiles. “ Very good Susan, now on your knees and join Amy.”

Dan enjoys the view of two very beautiful women enjoying his manhood. He has to stop them before he explodes.  He stands Amy up and places her on the counter and kisses her deeply. Then turns to Susan. “Please  do to Amy what you did earlier. For my viewing pleasure.”

She proceeds to kiss Amy. The baby doll dress ends up on the counter. She then goes to work on her kitty. Dan stands back and enjoys the view. Amy mouths ‘I love you’ in between her moans as Susan explores her kitty. Dan comes up behind Susan and undoes the top of her dress and lets it fall.  Then slides it over hips till she too is nude. Except for their heels and plugs. He then stands behind her as she stands. He puts one hand on her throat and the other on her kitty. 

“Before I melt your brain, do you have any hard no’s when it comes to sex?” Dan’s fingers enter her pussy.  Finding the G spot. 

“No Daddy.”

 Dan’s fingers begin to work their magic. “Anything else you want me to know before we use your body for everyone’s pleasure.” His grip on her throat tightened and she moaned. 

“I paid for college by being a high dollar call girl, Daddy.”

“So you are a professional slut. This will be fun.”

“Was Daddy. Not anymore.”

“That is for Amy and I to decide. From what I can see you still love the taste of a beautiful woman.”

Susan moans louder as Dan’s fingers are working furiously. Amy comes over and starts kissing her nipples. As the intensity builds her breathing becomes ragged. His grip tightening on her throat, causes her to orgasm. She covers the floor with her juices. A smile covers Amy’s face. 

“On your hands and knees Susan.” Dan orders. Taking off his belt and using it as a collar, tightening it around her neck. “Take us to the bedroom my dear.” 

Susan crawls on her hands and knees to the bedroom.  She is placed on her back at the foot of the bed. “Amy dear would you go get the lube from your purse.” Amy slips away. Dan whispers in Susan’s ear.

“Last chance to call this off my dear slut.”

Susan smiles. “I’m not going to miss out on the best sex of my life, with two of the sexiest people I know.”

As Amy walks in, she hears this and goes and lies next to Susan. “This is three of the sexiest people I know.” Then kisses her deeply as Dan lines up and enters her valley. She is soaking wet but very tight it takes 5 or 6 strokes before she can take Daddy’s cock. 

“Oh Amy, my god!” Susan moans. As Dan begins to slowly move in and out. Putting her beautiful tan legs on his shoulders.

“Baby Girl, go sit on her, so she can enjoy you too.”

Amy doesn’t hesitate and gets herself in position. She faces Dan so she can enjoy the action. Lowering herself on Susan’s mouth, she slowly begins to grind.  

A moan followed by, “Fuck, don’t stop!” Is all Susan can say as she gets lost in the pleasure. 

Dan picks up the pace of his strokes. Amy is riding and squeezing her nipples, enjoying the action in front of her. Leaning forward they kiss patiently, loss in the moment.

Susan begins to scream. “I’m coming!” Amy rolls off and begins to suckle on her breast as Dan slams into her harder. The intensity is to much as Susan pulls away and rides the wave of pleasure. 

Dan goes to the kitchen and returns with water. Amy is in the middle of after care as the tremors keep coming. Slowly Susan’s breathing returns to normal.  

“Your turn Baby Girl.” Dan pulls Amy to the edge of the bed. Not giving her time to think as he drives into her soaked kitty. He kisses his way up her calf, ending at her arches.

“Oh fuck me Daddy!” Amy moans as Susan moves over and starts to make out with her. Once she’s about ready to loose it, Dan starts to nibble on her toes causing her to release a cascade on him and the bed. 

“I’m ready to finish!” Dan announces. As he moves Susan to the middle of the bed and places her with her hips up. Grabs the lube and begins to play with her plug. Pulling it out and replacing with two well lubed fingers. Amy positions herself in front of Susan. Two fingers become 3. Allowing plenty of time for her to get comfortable. He then lubes his penis and her hole and slowly enters her. With slight pressure the head pops in and gives her time to adjust. 

“Slide into me when you are ready. No need to rush.” 

Slowly Susan slides back. Then stops. Dan slides out, up to the tip, applies more lube and slides in a little more. She moans into Amy’s kitty out of pure pleasure, with a fist full sheets in each hand. This process continues until Dan is all the way in.

 “You are very tight my dear slut.” Dan moans.

“Because no one has ever been in there.” Susan says as she starts to orgasm. After things calm down, he picks up the pace. All 3 moaning in pleasure as Amy enjoys Susan’s kisses on her folds. As Dan’s pace quickens, Amy moves up to kiss her man.

Amy orders, “Fill her up Daddy!” Her words cause both of them to cum. Dan moans as Susan screams into the sheets.

When he has softened and begins to fall out, Amy slides a plug into the stretched hole. Then moves up to give Susan kisses and assure her she did amazing. Dan slides in as the big spoon behind her and strokes her hair, also complimenting her. 

As she starts to come around Susan whispered. “I’m sorry I lied, I was never a high dollar….”

Dan interupts. “I know my dear lady. It is alright.” Amy smiles, but gives Dan a look. He gives her a knowing wink. “You are much more than a boring mom. I can promise you that.”

After a little bit they take her to the shower to clean up. They then tuck her into bed. 

“Tomorrow night. Tacos and margaritas at our house. You can just plan on staying the night. We don’t want you on the road after one of Daddy’s masterpieces!” 

Susan smiles. “That is an offer a girl can’t refuse.” They both kiss her good night and slip out. 

Dan and Amy were soon on the road home. “How did you know she wasn’t a high dollar call girl?”

Dan smiles. “A hunch. Also didn’t have a safe word or sure how it worked. Also anal virgin.”

“Did you enjoy yourself?”

“Of course. But it wasn’t anything more than an act of physical pleasure. She didn’t make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Only 3 women have ever done that to me.”

“Who were they?” Amy asks. Her curiosity peaked. 

“The woman I married, the woman I’m going to marry and one more.”

“Jade.”

“No.”

Amy was shocked. “Then who.”

“Miss Thompson. My forth grade teacher. She was 22 and fresh out of college. I would of ran through a brick wall for that woman.”

“She doesn’t know what she missed out on!”

Dan laughed. “Oh she does! She also taught all 4 of my kids. After Kayla passed 4th grade, she pulled me aside and told me the universe is so cruel for making her  watch me, become the man that I am.”

“You lie Mr!” Amy says with a grin. 

“Only partially, what she said was, ‘I can’t believe a slacker like you could ever raise four kids like this!’ So basically the same thing.”

Amy laughed. “You do tell a fantastic story Daddy. But who is the third woman?”

“That is a story for another time my dear.” As they pull into the garage. “I do believe you have some reclaiming sex to attend to.”

I don't want anything too crazy – don't need some $1,500 top-of-the-line machine. And my wife doesn't drink coffee at all, so it would likely be just me using it, which works well since I have a relatively small kitchen so would be tight for space.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Golden Knights vs. Ducks: A Tale of Two Goaltenders (and One Pesky Overtime)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a hockey clash that’s like a Netflix thriller where the plot twists are as frequent as a Zamboni’s path—unpredictable, but with a suspiciously circular ending. The Vegas Golden Knights (10-4-6) face the Anaheim Ducks (13-7-1) in a Pacific Division showdown that’s part of the NHL’s new “Death Valley” gauntlet. Let’s break this down with the precision of a linesman and the humor of a Zamboni operator on a coffee buzz.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting markets are as clear as a glass shield after a Zamboni wax job. Vegas is the favorite at **-112** (decimal: 1.72), implying a **58.1% chance to win**, while Anaheim sits at **+238** (decimal: 2.38), suggesting bookmakers give them a **41.9% shot**. The spread favors Vegas by 1.5 goals, and the total is set at 6.5 goals—enough scoring to fill a popcorn machine at a midnight movie.

But here’s the catch: Vegas is just **1-2-1 in one-goal games** this season, while Anaheim is a sturdy **5-2-1** in such nail-biters. That’s not just a stat—it’s a sly wink from the universe, hinting that the Ducks might be the team to trust when games tighten up.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Can Overtime)

Let’s talk about the Ducks’ recent performance. They’ve lost their last game to the Ottawa Senators 3-2, which is about as shocking as a penguin in a sauna. But don’t count them out! Troy Terry is dishing out points like a Thanksgiving turkey vendor (6 goals, 17 assists), and Leo Carlsson, who scored twice in the first meeting against Vegas, is a scoring machine with 6 goals and 6 assists in 10 games. The Ducks also average **3.5 goals per game**—a number that would make a birthday balloon jealous.

Vegas, meanwhile, leans on Pavel Dorofeyev’s 11 goals and Ivan Barbashev’s 7-point streak. But here’s the rub: The Golden Knights are a dismal **1-2-1 when they take more penalties than their opponents**. Their power-play struggles are so legendary, they could star in a documentary titled \*Golden

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

After 3 weeks I got the same results. Tried brewing some again the other day now that it's been 4 weeks and got my first half-decent cup of coffee, but it was pretty muted, and the other roast I tried was barely better than those first cups.

The only decent cup I got was brewing with the Clever Dripper, ground a little finer than drip coffee, off boil water, 16:1 ratio, water first then coffee, brewed for 4 minutes with a little stir with 30 seconds to go. My grinder is a Baratza Encore. I can't get any Passenger to taste good using my drip coffee maker.

Had great results dialing in Onyx, Counter Culture, and a few bags from local roasters with the same setup. I'm new to specialty coffee and would love any advice. On paper some of these sound amazing, but I can't figure out what's going on. Any ideas?",1,1763777245.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1p3h9cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p3h9cd/rubber_ducky_youre_the_one/,"Rubber Ducky, You’re the one","I work on the twelfth floor, in a building that looks like every other glass box in the central city. When you are outside, all you see is your own reflection layered over strangers. When you are inside, all you see are partitions.

My partition is beige. Beige fabric, beige desk, beige drawers with keys no one bothers to use. I have been in this cube for six months now, long enough that the chair has moulded to the shape of my hips, not long enough for anyone on the floor to remember my surname without checking my email signature.

I am an account manager. That sounds more important than it is. Most days I move numbers from one place to another and smooth over the nerves of clients who think the world will end if their campaign does not launch by Friday. My life outside of work is quiet. I have a partner at home who knows me well and likes that I am not the sort of person who goes out drinking after work. At the office, I prefer to keep to myself. Fifty people on this floor, and I could not name more than ten of them without looking at the seating chart.

On the morning the duck appeared, nothing felt unusual. I arrived at eight twenty, same as every day, swiped my card at the gate, nodded at the receptionist whose name I never caught and now cannot ask, walked past the breakout area with its too-bright furniture and the smell of burnt toast. My cube waited where I left it, third row from the window, facing a corridor that leads to the bathrooms and the fire stairs.

I put my bag under the desk and woke the computer. Only when the monitor lit, did I see the yellow shape beneath it.

A rubber duck, the classic kind. Yellow body, orange beak, black dots for eyes. It sat neatly under the rim of the screen, facing me, as if it had always lived there and I had simply been too busy to see it.

For a long moment I did nothing. It is remarkable how a tiny object can pin you like an insect. I did not touch it. I examined the desk, the trash can, the floor. Everything else was as I had left it the previous night. Headphones coiled beside the keyboard. Graph pad, pen, coffee mug ring staining the top of an old media plan. No sign anyone had been through my things.

The duck did not look new. The plastic had a dullness to it, a faint scuff along one side where the colour had paled. 

I have a nephew who is obsessed with things like this. Car rides, bath time, visits to the doctor; he narrates them through the personality of whatever small object he can carry. My sister took him on one of those Disney cruises. She sent photos from the deck, him grinning with a rubber duck in each hand. Apparently people hide them all over the ship for kids to find. Prizes that no one has to earn. Harmless.

Looking at the duck on my desk, I decided that must be what had happened. The story wrote itself. One of the ducks had ended up in my bag. I had dropped it on the floor at some point. A cleaner or a coworker found it under the cube wall and set it in the most obvious place, under my screen, so someone would claim it.

It was a harmless story, and I needed a harmless story.

I picked the duck up. The plastic gave slightly under my fingers. There is a particular weight to objects like that, a hollow lightness that pretends to be solid. I turned it over. No name written on the bottom, no company logo, just a small circle where the moulding seam ended. 

No one commented on it. People passed my cube carrying folders and takeaway coffee. No one leaned in with a joke or an explanation. The duck sat where I had left it, guarding the entrance to my inbox, and by lunchtime I had almost convinced myself it was mine.

A few weeks went by. Deadlines, invoices, client calls. The duck became part of the static scenery, something my eyes slipped over when I stared through the screen too long. My partner teased me about it the one time I mentioned it.

“Office mascot,” she said. “Maybe it’s good luck.”

“Maybe,” I said, even though I do not believe in luck.

Then one Monday, I came in from a miserable commute, peeled my damp jacket off, and found that the duck was no longer alone.

Tucked beside it, nudging its flank, sat a smaller duck. This one was pale pink, the colour of old bubblegum. The beak was painted a softer orange, slightly smudged, as though whoever applied it had breathed too close before it dried. It faced the same direction as the first duck. Their sides touched.

For a moment I thought I was still half asleep. There is a particular quality to unreality on a Monday morning, when the weekend has not finished leaving your system. I blinked once, twice. The pink duck stayed.

The second story that formed was that someone on the floor had seen the yellow one and decided it needed company. Maybe they had found this one on their own desk first and passed it on like office chain mail.

I sat down. My chair creaked in the same tired way it always did, a sound as familiar as my own joints. I studied the two of them. The size difference was just enough to make the pairing feel deliberate. Not two random ducks, but a couple copied from a greeting card. The idea lodged somewhere in my chest that someone, somewhere, thought my duck should have a companion.

You might be thinking that this is where I should have been creeped out. A stranger playing with my desk, decorating my space while I was away. The truth is, my first response was not unease. It was something closer to warmth. I told myself it was harmless, someone being whimsical. I thought, with a kind of embarrassed fondness, that my duck had been given a girlfriend.

If you grew up here, you probably remember the old Englefield ads. Bathroom fixtures and bubbles and those tiny plastic ducks gliding through water that was always just opaque enough that you could not see anyone actually naked. There was a little jingle that went with it, something about rubber duckies making bath time fun. It stuck in your head whether you wanted it or not. Every child I knew at the time had a duck of their own, some direct brand cousin of the ones on television.

That memory came back to me as I looked at the pair under my monitor. The kind of childhood recall that feels less like memory and more like a commercial burned into your brain. I thought of my nephew singing in the bath, lining up his ducks on the edge and insisting they all had names.

Maybe that is why I smiled, just a little, at my desk. I imagine from the outside it looked like nothing at all, one more office worker amused by something on their screen. 

I did not mention the second duck to anyone. There was no one to mention it to, really and I didn’t want my partner to tease me about it. At morning teas, the younger staff gather around the high table near the windows, talking about shows I had not watched and people I did not know. I eat my muesli bar at my desk, the wrapper crinkling softly beneath my fingers, and go about my daily routines.

They had become part of the way I oriented myself to the day. I would arrive, sit, and check that they were where I had left them. It was a pointless ritual, but it made the first few minutes of the morning feel less empty. Two small shapes, bright against the surface of my desk, acknowledging my presence in a way that people did not.

Nothing about it felt frightening yet. That is important to understand. At the beginning, the horror is never in the object. It is in the fact that you talk yourself out of noticing what is strange.

September arrived with a change in the air. I caught what I thought was an ordinary cold. By the second day I could barely stand. Fever, shakes, an ache that burrowed behind my eyes. The kind of illness that confuses time. I spent most of that week drifting in and out of shallow sleep on the couch, sweating through clothes and sheets, grateful that my contract included two weeks of sick leave. The phone stayed off. Work could survive without me for a few days.

When I returned the following Monday, the first thing I noticed was the smell of someone else’s coffee in my bin. A dark ring at the bottom, recent enough that the sourness clung to the air. Someone had used my desk while I was away. It was not unusual; space was scarce on our floor and people borrowed whatever surface they could find.

I sat down and reached for my keyboard. Only then did I realise the ducks were not looking at me.

The yellow one and the pink one had been turned around. 

At first I assumed whoever borrowed the desk had simply found them strange and turned them away. A small gesture of discomfort. I almost laughed at the thought. They were toys, nothing more. But a small pulse of something uneasy went through me, a ripple that I smothered before it could grow.

Looking back now, I understand the truth was different. Someone had been angry.

I picked them up and turned them back, placing them in their usual positions. Yellow to the left, pink angled slightly inward. Restoring the small matching tableau I had become used to. Then I opened my inbox and forced myself to move on.

The following week, a third duck appeared.

This one was tiny, no larger than the tip of my thumb. A bright orange baby duck with a beak that had been painted on in a trembling hand. It sat tucked beside the pink duck. The trio looked like a little family, posed with deliberate care.

I stared at them for a long time. The cuteness of the first duck had been harmless. The addition of the second had been strange but still explained by whimsy. But the third one, this little offspring, felt different. Someone had escalated this. Someone had expectations.

The unease was sharp now. Not fear exactly, but intrusion.

I picked up the smallest duck. The plastic was rougher than the other two, grainy, with tiny ridges where the mould had not been sanded smooth. The paint smudged under my thumb. A little curl of orange flaked away.

I walked down to Jerry’s cubicle. He was one of the only people I spoke to. Younger than me by a decade, bookish, with a stack of sci-fi paperbacks always on the corner of his desk. He was fiddling with a small gear printed from resin.

“Hey,” I said. “Can I show you something?”

He looked up. “Sure.”

I placed the ducks on his desk. He leaned in immediately, adjusting his glasses.

“These are printed,” he said. “Definitely. This layer here is from a cheap printer. See the striations along the side. And the paint is hand applied. Someone used acrylic and didn’t wait for it to dry before adding the detail.” He scraped some from the pink duck with his nail. “Yeah. Handmade.”

My stomach sank.

“Why would someone do this?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “Maybe someone is messing with you. Or maybe it’s like a secret-santa-thing. People do weird things in offices. You might have an admirer.”

The idea of having a secret admirer made my skin prickle.

I thanked him, gathered the ducks, and walked back to my cube. They sat in my palm like warm little hearts. Too intimate. Too deliberate.

I dropped all three into my bin. The sound was louder than it should have been, plastic hitting plastic in thud. A small flicker of guilt followed, but I pushed it down. They were toys. Nothing more.

I worked late that night, trying to clear a backlog of emails. By the time I logged off, most of the floor was empty. I packed my bag, took the lift down, and crossed the car park under a sky that looked close enough to touch.

My car sat beneath a sodium lamp. I clicked the key fob. The hazards blinked once.

Then I saw them.

All three ducks sat on the center of my windshield, arranged in a neat line. Yellow, pink, orange. As if they had been waiting. A smear of lipstick had been drawn across the glass, the curve forming a crude heart around them.

The wind brushed against my sleeves, carrying a faint sweetness I could not place. Something familiar and wrong.

The ducks stared at me. Their painted eyes were black dots, fixed with an attention that felt almost human.

Someone had taken them from the bin.

And someone wanted me to see the heart.

I kept my distance from the windshield for several seconds, as if the arrangement might shift if I looked away. The lipstick heart caught the light in a greasy sheen, the smear thick along one side where the pressure had been uneven. I opened the back door of the car, reached for the container of wipes I kept in the side pocket, and tore one free. 

I wiped the glass slowly, pressing hard enough that the smear broke apart into pale streaks. The ducks watched me from where I had placed them on the bonnet, their tiny bodies tipped slightly forward. I cleaned until nothing remained but a faint oily patch. Then I gathered the ducks in one hand and walked to a rubbish bin near the kerb. I dropped them inside without ceremony. The lid fell closed with a soft, final click.

At home I told my partner everything, obviously. She listened while she heated leftovers in the microwave. Steam drifted up from the bowl, obscuring her face for a moment.

“A prank,” she stated. “A weird one, but still a prank. Someone on your floor must have too much time on their hands.”

The explanation was comforting in its ordinariness. I wanted to accept it.

The next morning I went to HR. 

A woman in a navy cardigan took my name and asked me to sit. I told her what had happened, the ducks, the windshield, the lipstick heart. She typed while I spoke, each keystroke a small interruption.

“There are no cameras inside the office area,” she resigned. “Only at the main entrance. The car park cameras have been faulty for months. We are working on that. If someone placed anything on your vehicle, there is no footage.”

I asked whether anyone had been on my floor after hours. She shrugged. “People come and go. Contractors. Late meetings. Hard to tell. We can note this down.”

Her tone made it clear that nothing more would come of it. She folded her hands and gave me a reassuring smile that felt like a dismissal. “If anything else unusual happens, let us know. I am sure this is all harmless.”

By lunch I had convinced myself it was finished. The ducks were gone. The prank had run its course. My desk looked clean, empty, ordinary. Nothing had been moved. My screen lit up with its usual calm blue at the start of the day. No toys. No lipstick hearts. No signs of intrusion.

Two days later my partner called me during a meeting.

Her voice was steady but held something underneath it, something tense. “I got an email at work,” she whispered. “From someone who claims to be in your office.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“That you have been flirting around. Touching women without asking. Being unprofessional. Strangely, it’s from one of those forwarding accounts you get when you don’t want to give your real email address.” 

Silence opened between us, I knew exactly who I was. I knew what I was capable of and what I was not.

“You know that’s not true,” I said.

“Of course,” she replied, and her certainty was immediate, almost fierce. “You would never do any of that. I told my manager to delete it. It is someone stirring trouble. It has to be.”

Her trust should have soothed me, but something in the back of my mind shifted, a small edge turning.

Someone knew her name. Someone knew where she worked. I had to find out who was doing this.

The email to my partner changed something fundamental in me. A quiet, steady panic began to take shape. I could not shake the feeling that someone on my floor was watching me, studying me, choosing moments to twist.

There were nine women working on my floor. I barely knew any of them. That made it worse. The anonymity created a vacuum my mind began to fill.

I started observing them. Not openly. I watched from my own cube, waiting for any of them to enter the bathrooms. It seemed my only choice, to find something strange in their patterns, to see if they came by my desk thinking I’m not there. Most of them worked on the other side of the floor and constantly walking around would make me seem suspicious. My notes were simple. Just names, or in some cases initials, with times beside them. A pattern refused to form.

The paranoia grew sharper. I ordered a novelty item from an online store, a stapler with a built-in camera meant for streaming pranks. It fed to a simple browser window through the company wifi, saving the footage on my hard drive. I placed it on my desk as if it were an ordinary office tool. The camera captured a wide view to the bathrooms and fire exit. I would catch them in the act, eventually.

Days passed. Nothing changed. Every time I checked the footage, there was never anything unusual. No one standing near my desk. No one reaching over the cube wall. 

By Thursday afternoon, HR sent an email requesting a meeting. My stomach lifted. I assumed they had found something, or that someone had confessed. The subject line simply said “Follow-up.”

The HR office held a different atmosphere this time. My manager sat beside the woman from HR, both of them staring at a single folder in front of them. A company lawyer stood in the corner with his hands clasped. No one smiled.

“Take a seat,” HR said.

I did.

“There have been complaints,” she continued. “Two women on your floor reported that you have been observing them entering and leaving the bathroom at specific times. They stated that you have stared at them in ways that made them uncomfortable.”

She opened the folder. Inside were the pages from my notebook. My handwriting. Names, initials, times, dates. 

“We searched your desk this morning,” she said. “We found these.”

My throat closed.

“We also discovered videos. IT accessed your computer. There is surveillance footage saved locally. You’ve filmed the view beside the women’s bathroom.”

“That is not why it was there,” I said. My voice wavered. “Someone has been tampering with my things. Leaving objects. Watching me. I was trying to protect myself!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the lawyer said. “You violated company policy on workplace surveillance and privacy, not to mention sexual harassment. This is grounds for immediate termination.”

“I was framed!” I yelled. The words sounded hoarse. “There were ducks on my car. Someone drew a heart on the glass. My partner got an email for Christ’s sake!”

HR shook her head. “None of that changes the fact that you kept notes on female staff and installed a camera. We take harassment very seriously.”

They slid a stack of paperwork toward me. Termination forms. A formal notice for security to escort me out. A document explaining that my access card would be deactivated within the hour.

I signed. My hand shook so hard the pen scratched the paper.

When I reached the car, the sky looked blurred, as if seen through water. I collapsed into the driver’s seat and began to cry. Not quiet tears, but a sharp, disorienting grief that left my vision swimming. I called my partner. She answered on the second ring.

“They fired me,” I cried. I kept talking even though my voice barely held shape. I told her about the notes, the camera, the complaints.

“I know you,” she said, but her tone had changed. Cautious. Thin. “But this is a lot. I think I should stay at my mother’s for a bit. Just until everything settles.”

When she came home, she packed quietly. A small overnight bag, the blue one she used on weekends. She avoided looking at the termination papers on the table. 

The door clicked shut behind her. The house felt emptied.

I wish it had ended there. I wish I could say that, truly. I wish I could say she came back a few days later, I found a new job, and everything settled into something ordinary. I wish I could say we laugh about it now. That would be a cleaner story, something with a neat moral edge. You survive something strange, you rebuild, the world rights itself. But that is not the story I am living.

I am sitting here now because our couples therapist suggested I write this down. She wanted a clear version of my side of the events, something I could hand over when the memories become tangled and I start losing track of what happened first. My partner and I have been attending sessions for a couple of months. We still live apart. She says she needs space to breathe. I cannot blame her. My emotional state after the firing was awful. I slept at odd hours. I forgot to eat. 

I still cannot find work. I have applied everywhere. Interviewers want confidence, brightness, energy. I do not have those things. I am living off savings and the numbers shrink each week. I try not to look at them too closely.

The house became something I avoided. Dishes stacked. Laundry sat in piles. I spent entire days in the same clothes. My partner visited once and stood in the doorway like a visitor in a stranger’s home. We talked about a reset. A clean slate. That was before the last thing happened. Before any hope of simple explanations disappeared entirely.

She had been away for a week, staying with her mother, when I found the bouquet.

It was on my doorstep early one morning, the sky still grey with the last of the night. Paper flowers, folded with meticulous care, arranged in a tight cluster. In the center sat a small red rubber duck. This one wore a tiny set of lingerie made from scraps of lace and ribbon, glued unevenly across its plastic body. The sight of it made something twist inside me, not fear but revulsion. A cold, crawling disgust that moved along my skin.

I took the bouquet inside, carried it straight to the fireplace, and set it on the grate. The paper curled as the flames caught, blackening at the edges. The duck melted in stages, its red surface turning soft, then glossy, then collapsing inward.

I started drinking that night. Not much at first, just enough to soften the sharpness of my thoughts. Then more. Days blurred. I wrote a letter and taped it to my own door. I didn’t know who the message was for. I only knew I needed to say something to whatever or whoever had been creeping into my life.

“I do not want you. I will never want you. If I find out who you are I will make your life miserable. I’d rather die than get to know you.”

I really thought then, they’d taken the hint. Nothing happened and I truly felt lighter.

Then came yesterday.

I woke early, a dull ache behind my eyes from too much wine. I stood under the bathroom light and turned the shower on.

When I pulled the curtain back, I saw it sitting in the corner of the tub.

A rubber duck. The size of the original one that appeared on my desk months ago. But this one was pitch black. Not dark yellow, not painted over, but a deep, consuming black that swallowed the light. Its eyes had been painted with white crosses, stark and crooked, the brushstrokes uneven. It faced the wall, its back turned to me.

I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My body moved on instinct. I packed a bag. I left the house without looking back. I checked into a small hotel near the motorway and paid for a week in advance. I sit here with the curtains closed and the door secured. Maybe I should call the police. My partner certainly thinks so. 

We had been talking about moving away before this. A fresh start. Somewhere far from the office, far from the city, far from anyone who it might be. Now it feels less like an idea and more like the only option left.

I only know I am tired. Tired in a way that goes past sleep. Tired in a way that makes the thought of leaving everything behind feel like relief.

Dan And Amy Part 34 Found a Third

Amy just admits to Dan she wants to marry him. 

XOXOXOXO 

“So do you have something to ask me?” Amy says with a big smile. 

“No.”

“Well, why not?” The disappointment is evident in Amy’s voice. 

“Because we are not some poorly written story on Reddit Erotic Literature! I want my proposal to be something you and I both will remember for the rest of our lives. Not  something that Armguy82 would write!”

That made Amy smile. This ment as much to him as it did her. “So something classy like from a Hallmark Christmas Movie!” Amy’s tone dripped with sarcasm. 

“Exactly! But I don’t want to wait till there is snow!” They both laugh and cuddle. “We have to go back to the real world tomorrow.”

“I know. This is going to be a busy week.”

“ Remember we have an appointment at the reproductive clinic tomorrow afternoon.”

“What’s this we stuff?” Amy teases. 

“This time around I’m not going to miss a thing. This is my second chance, to do fatherhood right.” Amy can feel herself getting turned on again. 

“You said something in your story that there was one condition to Jade getting back together with Wyatt. What was that?”

“She had a permanent hall pass with one person. That person’s name was put in an envelope and sealed. Charlie at work has the envelope. Wyatt doesn’t know who that person is. He is not allowed to ask questions about it. Anyone else is cheating.”

“I wonder who that person is?” 

Dan hesitates, and clears his throat. “It’s me.”

“Why you?”

“Because I could be Conner’s father.”

That one stops Amy’s heart. “How?”

“The pill is 99% effective but with human error is only 93% effective.  So within 10 days she was with both of us.”

“So Wyatt knows?!”

“Jade bragged about it. Let’s just say Wyatt wasn’t an innocent party in this. He just didn’t suffer the same consequences.”

“Wow! This is just about as screwed up as my family.”

“The two of them kept it private. Wyatt stepped up and took on being Dad.”

“So has she ever used the hall pass?”

“Once, well one weekend.”

“When was that?”

“Nine months before Katie was born.”

“Daniel what the fuck!”

“They had been trying with no luck and Jade thought well it worked last time.”

“ So what if this had all blown up?”

“We both would have gotten divorced and moved somewhere and started over.”

“Do you love her Dan?”

“Oh absolutely! But here’s the deal you can love something but that doesn’t mean it’s good for you. What you want is something or someone who you love, but also loves you back and together your better.”

“ Actually that makes sense.” 

“I hope you realize only 2 other people in the world know the whole truth. Your the third.”

XOXOXOXOXO

The alarm goes off at 6:00. The wonderful morning routine begins. Dan makes coffee. Amy makes the bed and lays out her clothes. It’s Monday so skirt and heels it is. Go win Monday. Amy starts the shower and Dan comes in with coffee. Amy is standing there nude waiting for him. Dan hands her a coffee. 

“The day this routine gets old shoot me. I have become such an idiot, that I don’t deserve to live.” Amy laughs. “We do need decide where we are going on vacation though, Baby Girl.”

“Where ever and when ever you want. As long as I’m with you.”

“Do you have a passport? No outstanding international warrants?”

“I’m good on both counts.” Amy smiled. He was in one of his playful moods today. 

Dan comes in from chores to an omelette and bacon. He smiles at Amy. 

“So do you want to help pick out a ring or do you trust me.”

“I would like to give you a couple of ideas on styles but I’ll trust your judgement.” Dan smiles at the trust Amy has in him. “Big and expensive are my two favorite styles.” Amy deadpans. 

Dan about chokes on his mouth full of food. He deposits it in a napkin. “Well looks like I’m going to marry a comedian! That was excellent my dear. I will be repeating that. Hey hold on.”

Dan disappears into the bedroom. In a minute he comes out with a ring. “Baby Girl this was Miss Karen’s favorite ring. She would be pleased if somebody would wear it and enjoy it.”

“I can’t take your mother’s ring!”

“Your not taking it, I’m loaning it to you. Just wear it on your right hand and enjoy it.”

“But the girls….”

“They have so much stuff from her they can’t wear it all.”

Amy examines the ring and it was obvious that Miss Karen liked nice things. It had a beautiful pearl with other stones around it. The fantastic thing was it fit. She knew this was a piece of Daddy’s heart. 

“I think that I love it as much as she did.”

They fly around getting ready to go to work. Finally they are both ready to go. Amy has come to enjoy the time they spend together on the commute. He holds her hand and talk about everything. 

“You are certainly in a good mood today.” Amy gushed as she admired the ring. 

“I guess it’s because you know the dark family secret and you are still here.”

“Well the fun isn’t over. I have to explain my family.  Although after hearing your story, we are going to sound white bread middle America.  Sort of.” They laugh and talk the rest of the way into work.

When they get to work Dan helps carry 4 boxes of cupcakes into the break room. The results of Jade and Amy’s efforts on Sunday afternoon.  Dan swipes a cupcake and heads for his office. He meets Charlie in the hall. 

“I have a young man coming in at 10 for a job interview. Twelve years military. Going to the guard and give civilian life a try. I’ll send him to you afterwards. You’re needing a new right hand man.”

“I’ll take any help I can get.  Good weekend?”

“The best my friend.”

Amy goes into her office and settles in for a busy day. A few minutes later a knock and in walks Sarah. Looking cute for a Monday. 

“Girl I don’t know how you do it. Dan bouncing around here like he is king of the world. Enough cupcakes in the break room to last a week and you sitting there all aglow. Do tell.”

“Well Dan bought himself a stand mixer. Said I could use it if I promised to be naughty. So I was.”

Sarah laughed. Amy got up and closed the door. 

“Personal question time Sarah. Just us girls. How’s your love life?”

“Sarah smiles. For once it’s on the rise. I met a new guy a couple of weeks ago and things are good. Why?”

“You are always supporting me. I just wanted to make sure all was good with you.”

“It’s awesome, big promotion and a new guy. You know these older men just hit different. Not quite Silver Fox level but definitely salt and pepper.”

Amy smiled. “They do hit differently.”

Sarah slips out the door. Amy thinks, ‘cross another one the list.”

At 10:00 Amy goes to Dan’s office to help interview Tom. He shows up in his dress uniform and wows Dan and Amy with his knowledge and witt. Dan steps out to take a phone call. 

Amy starts asking questions.  “So off the record, I hear you had a good time this weekend.”

“I did. Thank you again for your hospitality. You have a fun family.”

“Thank you for not taking advantage of Kayla right away.”

Tom smiles. “She pulled out all the stops. She is hard to resist. I think she understands after our talk this morning.”

“So will you still be coming around.”

“Yes, I will be.”

“Good, let me take you to meet Charlie.”

Amy returns to Dan’s office. Just as he is finishing the phone call.Good news Baby Girl! That was Larry. You know Tamera is his wife. Well the couple that was going on a cruise with them had to back out, because of health issues. So vacation plans are set. 

where and when?

Alaska in 10 days! You said anywhere and any time. 

Amy stands there shocked. They have a state room with a balcony and 2 bedrooms. All inclusive except for excursions. So we get back from the weekend repack and off we go!”

Amy shakes her head and realizes she is going to have to choose her words more carefully. 

XOXOXOXO

Dan sitting in the waiting room of a reproductive clinic, in Amy’s imagination was going to be hilarious. The man was finally going to be out of his element. She couldn’t be more wrong. 

After they had checked in, Dan was making small talk to mothers to be and holding babies. He even fed one a bottle while the mom used the restroom. He couldn’t have made her more horny if he wanted to. 

Finally they were in the exam room alone. “You do love babies don’t you Daddy.” Amy coos. 

Dan smiles. “They are the fountain of youth.”

There is a knock on the door and in walks the Dr. “I’m pleased to meet you Amy, I’m Dr Sue…Grandma Amy!”

“Freddy’s Mom!” Amy exclaims. 

“You were the talk of our house this weekend. Conner’s Grandma Amy this and Grandma Amy said that. Thank you. You gave my son confidence on the soccer field for the first time.”

Amy blushed. “Thank you. I hope it didn’t ruin you and your husband’s weekend.”

“Oh I’m not married. That was my ex husband. We try really hard to be good coparents. Haven’t had a man in my life…for a long time.” Dr Sue was embarrassed at the oversharing that just occurred. Amy was intrigued. 

Dr Sue was a beautiful woman, long black hair. Physically fit. Beautiful tan skin. Eyes that sparkled when she smiled. 

They went through the blood work they had just ran. Prescribed prenatal vitamins, discussed nutrition, exercise and other lifestyle choices. 

“Dr Sue, could we send Dan to the waiting room so I can ask some personal questions.”

“I think that is my clue to exit stage right.” Dan says getting up and heading out the door.

“Sue do you find Dan attractive?” Amy asks. 

“If you mean neither of us in a relationship, I would be all over him. In all honesty, we had actually flirted a little bit at soccer and school events. I even had gotten his number from Jade. She had told me he wasn’t seeing anyone at the time. I just never worked up the courage to call.”

“Our relationship is actually very new, but when you know, you know.”

“You two make a very sexy couple. The energy and vibe you two have is magical. A little May/September thing.”

“How old do you think Daniel is?”

“Well he looks 45, but probably closer to 50.”

“My dear he is 60 and looks 35 naked. Would you like to see that? We are looking for someone to share in the bedroom. We are all professionals so we know how to keep things private. None of us want or need drama.”

“Wow! I’m don’t know about this.”

Amy smiles. “Why don’t we go get a nice dinner tonight at Toni’s and get to know each other better. No pressure. Three friends having a meal together.”

Dr Sue lets out a long slow breath. “A nice dinner would be fun. No promises though.”

“Text me your address we will pick you up and go to Toni’s for supper tonight. Wear something sexy. I have a little babydoll dress that Dan loves. Pick you up at 7:00.” Amy gets up and walks out the door. Shocked at her boldness. 

She picks up Dan in the waiting and they head to the Jeep. They get in. 

“Daddy you need to make a reservation for 7:30 at Toni’s, for three.  We need to get chores done, clean up and get sexy because Dr Sue is going to be our third.” 

XOXOXOXO 

Dan was in a sport coat and slacks. Amy was in her baby doll dress and wedge heels. 

“What are we doing?” Dan asks. Reaching for Amy’s hand. “Is this crazy?”

“This is dinner. Nothing more. Nothing less. We see how we get along and go from there. Maybe tonight maybe never.”

They get out of the Jeep and go to the front door together. Sue comes to the door in a beautiful floral mini dress. The dress ties up tight around her neck. No clevage at all. Bare shoulders and bare back. The color pops against her skin.

Dan lets out a low whistle. Amy walks up and hugs her tight. “Sue you look stunning. Picture time Daddy.” Amy says handing Dan the phone. He takes several pictures from playful to sexy. He has to start thinking about the 1975 Red Sox again.  Amy and Sue look at the pictures. 

“Daddy every man in this city is going to envy you tonight. Out with 2 beautiful women.”

Dan opens the back door and Sue slides in. Amy is standing at the rear passenger and also slides in the back seat. Dan slides into the drivers seat. They head to Toni’s. The two recounted the soccer game from Saturday and make girl talk. Halfway there Dan sees they are holding hands. Back to thinking about the Red Sox again.

They park about two blocks from Toni’s. As they walk Dan has a beautiful woman on each arm. 

“I wonder what people are thinking?” Sue whispers.  

“That I have a big dick or a lot of money. Fortunately they are right on both counts!” 

Sue laughs out loud. Amy rolls her eyes at Dan and says;

“Always the funny guy aren’t you Daddy” and gives him a kiss.

“Amy, am I allowed to call him Daddy?” Sue asks. 

Amy smiles. “He also gets called Dad from one person. You are also allowed to kiss him too. There are only three things you’re not allowed to do. One is have slow romantic passionate sex with him that is for only me. I will literally scratch your eyes out. Two his back door is mine and three is never alone with him. I will always be there.” Sue smiles and says;

“Those are very reasonable and respectful rules.” She then steps over and kisses Amy. They both look at Dan.

“Did either of you know that Tony Gwen is considered the best hitter in modern baseball history?”

Amy laughs and Sue is totally baffled. 

“I’ll explain at dinner.” Laughing at Sue’s reaction. 

XOXOXOXO 

Dinner was going splendidly. After they ordered the ladies went to freshen up. In a few seconds Dan’s phone started to ping with text picture from Amy. A minute later a video was sent. Dan just sipped on his Old Fashion and thought about Grandpa and Grandma doing the nasty. Because baseball stats were not strong enough tonight. 

When Amy and Sue returned to the table Dan stood up and Sue slid something into his coat’s inside breast pocket. Dan didn’t flinch. 

“Did you enjoy your text messages Daddy?” Amy asked. 

Dan smiles. “Baby Girl, I didn’t need to.  You obviously had your first orgasm of the night courtesy of this beautiful lady.  Susan my dear, the thong you slid into my pocket smells divine and after the salad coarse you better go upsize your plug. You are going to need it. I’m not in a gentle mood tonight.” As he takes another sip of his Old Fashion. 

The color is gone from Sue’s face. Amy smiles. “I told you, he is like a sex god.”

The rest of dinner is lively conversation and laughs. Sue knew nothing about the baseball trick and laughed till her sides hurt. 

After dinner they returned to the Jeep.

“Susan, I neglected to tell you earlier this evening that you look stunning. The colors in that dress pop against your skin. The bare shoulders are incredibly sexy. Your bare back definitely shows a naughty side.”

Susan blushes. “You can call me Sue, Daddy.”

“My dear girl.  Sue is the name for a girl or a casual setting.  Susan is for a Lady. I’m only interested ladies.”

He kissed Susan deeply. Then opened the door and she got in. Dan opened the door for Amy. Amy got in. 

“So how do you like being romanced, by a true gentleman.” Amy asks. 

“Amy how can you….. My god, why are you letting me do this.”

“ You will understand in a couple of hours when he’s done with you.”

Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, and Sonic Robo Blast 2. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!

STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.

*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*

\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This led to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<

The high platform with short walls is the entry hall, den, and 1st floor bathroom, the lower platform with ridiculously high walls is the kitchen, and the box flat on the table is the cellar.

She had a job where she worked every other weekend from 7AM - 7PM. 

After a morning cup of coffee, I’d wander barefoot in the grass for several minutes.  Then go off for my barefoot adventures. 

Sometimes I would see how many random stores I had the courage to walk In shoeless.   My Saturday record: 7.  

Sometimes I would chill out in the public library, much to the chagrin of a never smiling, stern librarian.   Though she never said anything to me, if looks could kill…

My favorite Sunday excursion was a downtown plaza with cement, grass and rocks.  A Barefooters delight. 

There were several office buildings there reflecting my image in the mirror glassed windows.  That’s when I decided I look better barefoot than with shoes. 

Just a bit of sanity in my life, married to a wife who thought it was ridiculous I liked to go barefoot. 

I no longer plan such outings; I don’t have to.  Living alone with no girlfriend.  Just single.   Barefoot.  And happy. ",8,1763776781.0,barefoot,2,1.0,False

I’m driving from **Seattle to Las Vegas** over **three days**, stopping in **Bend** and **Reno** overnight. I’m offering **one free ride** to someone who’s responsible, respectful, and comfortable with a multi-day trip.

  
Leaving December 21st, 2025 at 8am

This is *not* commercial or paid rideshare — just helping someone out and sharing the road.



# 🗓️ Trip Plan

**Day 1:** Seattle → Bend  
**Day 2:** Bend → Reno  
**Day 3:** Reno → Las Vegas

Steady, reasonable pace. No all-night driving. Safety first.



# 🧳 Luggage & Space

The truck is a **1966 Ford F-100**, with a canopy on the back.  
Your gear rides **dry, secure, and out of the weather**.  
Please keep only a small personal bag with you in the cab.



# 🛌 Night Stops

I stay in motels for the two overnights.  
**You’ll need to get your own room** or make your own arrangements (camping, hostel, etc.).  
No shared rooms — keeps things easy and safe for both of us.



# 🛡️ Safety Requirements

This is important for both traveler and driver:

* Meet beforehand in a public place (coffee shop, etc.)
* I’ll ask to confirm your **ID** before we head out (driver shows theirs too)
* You must be sober, calm, and respectful
* No drugs / no heavy drinking / no drama
* No illegal items — the truck and the trip stay clean
* You should be comfortable with long highway stretches and small-town stops
* Must be okay with a slower, older classic truck — safe but not fast

This trip is meant to be relaxed, safe, and straightforward.



# 🚗 About the Drive

Classic truck, steady pace. I’m an experienced long-distance driver and I prefer:

* Safe speeds
* Plenty of rest breaks
* Clear communication
* Good road manners

We can chat, listen to music, or ride quietly — whatever feels natural.



# 📩 If you’re interested

Send me a message with:

1. Your first name
2. Why you’re heading to Vegas
3. Your luggage situation
4. A bit about your travel experience
5. Confirming you’re okay with the safety guidelines above

I’m easygoing, but I keep things organized and safe — makes the whole trip better for both of us.",1,1763776655.0,rideshare,0,1.0,False

Tl;dr: My mom doesn’t seem happy for me being in a supportive and loving relationship. She’s always comparing mine to her relationship with her husband. Part of me is so sad that I no longer have her to confide and tell her everything as I used to. It feels like I’m losing my mom. On the other hand, it makes me so sad how her husband treats her with no love or care. He does nothing or gives her no gifts not even on her birthday. 

I 25F have always been so close with my mom. I tell her everything and I consider her my best friend. I haven’t dated in 5ish years. I then started dating my boyfriend(31M) and as usual share all my moments and everything he does for me. He would take me to nice restaurants, plan cute date ideas and at first she seemed happy. We became official and all she has ever said as long as he is supportive of your school goals that’s important. I am currently taking college courses to get into a nursing program. Time goes on, my bf continuously plans dates, sends flowers to my house, and plans fun trips. He stops by to bring flowers when I’m feeling under the weather and comes visit me whenever he can. I tell her all about how attentive he is to me and things he says that are very supportive. I don’t know what to expect but you would think a mom who is happy that someone is treating their daughter well would say aww that’s sweet of him. I don’t know what a mom should say or feel but I don’t think it’s this. She just raises her brow and gives a serious face. When I mention how he is attentive, she immediately says ”Bryan does that for me too!”  (let’s call him Bryan (her husband now, my stepdad who we live with, who I don’t get along with). There’s rare times that she says, “aww I want you to stay with me forever.” And one day she said “ when you move out don’t forget a spare room for me to come visit.” She didn’t seem happy or sad when saying that. I just kind of froze and she left the room. 

Sometimes I come home with gifts he gives me and doesn’t say much. I don’t show her anymore but she comes in my room to talk and asks what I brought. She doesn’t seem too happy. She says weird comments like “oh to be young and beautiful.” I mention to my mom how my bf and I have talked about us both agreeing that marriage is something we are looking and agree on. One day my bf gave me his old laptop because he doesn’t touch it and has been sitting in his room only. It’s not brand new but she got so mad. She said, know your place and don’t accept such expensive gifts. Which I have no clue what she meant by that. 

I tell her my bf was planning an anniversary trip to go snowboard and stay somewhere and she immediately frowned and said “that’s too bad, I was planning for us to go there as a family” and left the room. Later did I find out she didn’t actually plan anything and she was just saying that. The conversation of weddings came about and I said I love how floral bouquets are used and big arches are placed where the bride and groom sit within a wedding venue. She looked at me and said “maybe you should think about a backyard wedding or something, maybe something simple.” I was taken aback and got quiet, I was serious with her the whole day and she noticed this and tried making conversation again. I felt very hurt, I don’t even know what to think anymore. 

A part of me, feels like I’m losing my best friend and I also feel sad that my mom is not in a relationship where she feels loved and cared for. Her husband, does nothing to show her love and feel cared for. He leaves beer bottles everywhere and leaves laundry and things for her to do around the house. I try my best to wake up early and turn on her car for her before she heads out to work or have her coffee ready for brewing. He guilts her for not putting gas in the family car. I just feel so overwhelmed and sad. I think, I should just not talk about my relationship at all anymore.

1p3h1yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/comments/1p3h1yd/has_anyone_graduated_from_mdd/,Has anyone… “graduated” from MDD,"For reference, like ten years ago I went through a year or two of serious depression (where I just isolated myself and lost all interest in anything but MDD). I had this universe that I lived in with cool roommates that shared my interests, were genuine, and I had emotional support/intimacy with. 

eventually, life got better and I started feeling better, so I think I just dropped MDD at some point? I don’t consciously remember it stopping (or what caused it to stop), but I didn’t MDD for years after that). 

Cue this year, it’s been a rough year and a high stress year as well, and I’ve been feeling like a lot of my friends aren’t genuine people or don’t really care that much about me on a deeper level (ex., they’ll say “let’s get coffee sometime!” And then they either ghost me when I text/invite them, or they just never follow up on it). Plus, my interests are niche as hell so I never have anyone to talk about them with (except… my MDD roommates lol).

So I started MDDing again, and it feels like the only thing that’s making me happy at this point. I know it’s not good, but I hope it’s just a temporary thing I slip out of and that it will go away at some point, whenever life gets good again. But I don’t remember if I actually made an effort to stop the first time, or whether I just slipped out of it as I stopped needing that coping mechanism. 

So… TLDR, can I just use this as a coping mechanism until I don’t need it anymore and it stops by itself? (Assuming I still make an effort to get to know people and make friends, get my work done, etc) 

Or should I actually make an effort to stop this (which will… hurt a lot lol)",1,1763776461.0,MaladaptiveDreaming,0,1.0,False

Not looking for anything super long term, something shorter would be a little better for me as I tend to work 6-7 days a week. I dont need immediate replies and I will get back you quickly, as is my own etiquette.

I'm curious what spots around the Valley you guys hit up when you need to properly reset. Not talking about the typical ""grab drinks at some loud bar"" situation - I mean places where you can actually sit back, breathe, and feel like life doesn't completely suck for a few hours.

For context, I'm in my early 30s, live in Tempe but willing to drive pretty much anywhere in the metro area if it's worth it. I've done the usual suspects - hiking Camelback at sunrise (great but my knees are screaming), hanging at coffee shops in downtown Phoenix (cool vibe but sometimes too hipster-intense), even tried that whole ""spa day"" thing once which felt weirdly stressful??

Lately I've been getting into the whole whiskey/bourbon scene and honestly it's been a game changer.

* Actually comfortable seating (I'm tired of those ""aesthetic"" chairs that destroy your back)
* Not insanely loud
* Won't completely wreck my wallet

Also down for unconventional suggestions. Like is there a random spot at Papago that hits different? A bar where the bartender actually remembers your order? A rooftop somewhere that doesn't cost $20 per drink?

My boyfriend (31M) has been struggling with psoriasis for ~13 years. His psoriasis is usually in uncomfortable areas (between buttocks, groin, etc). This has been confirmed by a dermatologist with a biopsy. He’s also been experiencing joint pain the last ~3 years that we have assumed is psoriatic arthritis (not confirmed by a rheumatologist). He went to a dermatologist and has had several failed treatments. He recently went to a new dermatologist and was given a shot called bimzelx. He has taken four doses (one per month). Around the first or second dose, he started experiencing cysts. The dermatologist said this was HS. Since the fourth dose (given 10/31/25), the cysts have become absolutely unbearable for him. He has not had a dose since then and recently started doxycycline. The dermatologist wanted to double down on the bimzelx but he’s convinced that it caused the cysts. They prescribed cosentyx as an alternative and he’s afraid to take it. The cysts are in the same locations the psoriasis typically presents. I ran the scenario by ChatGPT (I know, shame on me) and it thought that he may not have true HS, but rather could be having an IL-17–related inflammatory reaction. He describes the pain with the cysts as “deep nerve pain” and it’s so bad he can’t sleep. 

To make matters worse, he’s also had a sore throat for approximately the same amount of time as he’s been doing the bimzelx. He has given up coffee, tapered down alcohol consumption, and recently is trying the Mediterranean diet as a recommendation from the dermatologist. He saw an ENT for it and they prescribed both antibiotics and steroids (I think this was in September) and neither helped. 

He’s absolutely miserable and in constant pain. We’re waiting on a referral to a rheumatologist. I don’t know if an endocrinologist may be better? Is there a better specialist out there that can help him??? What kind of doctor would you direct your patients to see?

\-At approximately 04:00 hours on day 47 hours flying mechanical boars started to descend on my base en masse  
\-I had prepared for this sort of thing. Using the best tools at my disposal; hooks and lighters, I proceeded to systematically tie down all the hogs and burn them.  
\-I'd say about 12-20 hogs spawned before it started raining. Realizing I could no longer burn the rest, I left the remainders tied down and watched some TV. A hog or two had gotten into my base. I ran from them, and they seemingly self-destructed by damaging each other.  
\-After my first report earlier, it stopped raining. I resumed the fight.  
\-At some point after cleaning them out, I was ambushed by what I presume to be the undead deer. Never saw 'em, but it seemed to be this case.  
\-After burning 10-20 more hogs, suddenly a whole wave of them dropped. Approximately 10-15 hogs. I quickly got to pinning them while in a modest level of panic. Root Alpha had run low on Medkits at this point.  
\-I dropped my lighter in the panic and had to purchase two new ones. This was difficult as two more hogs had gotten into the base. I led them out after making the purchase.  
\-I heard a sound I did not want to hear. My regular Kerfur hopping despite being deactivated. I checked and there he was trying to get out of his cubical. I locked in in the locker.  
\-It starts raining again. I have to take a break before resuming the immolation  
\-Once the fort was cleared out, I saw one of the Gray's UFO's over by what seemed to be TR\_1. It disappeared shortly after and nothing happened  
\-I cremated the zombie deer's body it's tortured soul was tied to and sent it down river  
\-I checked the map and saw no more red dots near me asides the Obelisk. But they were allllll over the map. Just about everywhere, I'd say 10+ dots.  
\-I also noticed a shadowed but visible dot on the map. I knew exactly what that was. Now was REALLY not the time.  
\-Since the event was still going and I couldn't stomach to eat Coffee Chocolates anymore and had just had coffee earlier, I pushed my some of my money into the ATM to purchase WUG and other beer items.  
\-I systematically start hunting all the red dots on the map in an attempt to clear out the boars. They were everywhere. Really wish I took a photo of it. I found them, tied them up, and burned them. Flame Hyenard would be proud.  
\-I got startled by one of those Fossil Hounds while tying up a boar under Xray. Genuinely got my heart pounding with fear. It was so sudden. I didn't have a molotov, so I left the boar and made a break for it on the ATV back to base  
\-I stop by William to kill a boar near him and complain as to why he isn't doing his alleged job description according to the placard on his stand. He didn't answer  
\-After some combing of the map, I found that the Arirals were doing literally worse than F.A. and were making alien props. Those jerks, I take back every nice thing I've said about you.  
\-Back to base, check the map, head to dots, burn boars. Lather, rinse, repeat.  
\-I entered the garage to find the Arirals put those prop aliens to work and set them at the door. I repeat; massive jerks.  
\-I head to Tango to find some boars I thought were near there, when the actual worst happened. I got my ATV stuck in the hole. That hole. That hole is the worst spot in the map, it took me forever to get myself and the ATV out of there, it was awful.  
\-I couldn't get out, I was too tired, I cracked and decided to use the debug warp key to go back to base where I stocked up on more WUG products  
\-Ran back to the Tango hole, my ATV fell back in. I warped back to base, got my scuba gear, and ran allll the way back to get it out. Then I drove back to base to refuel my ATV  
\-I check the map and see one red dot I just couldn't find. It was so close to base, but I couldn't find what it was. I check one of my Radio Tower bound cameras to see if I could identify, and what do you know? The Antibreather decided to show up and was shockingly close to base which meant I had been on a wild goose chase for 3 minutes earlier.  
\-I head back towards Sierra and get more boars, Then back to Xray and get the boar there.  
\-On the way back to base I find the Abandoned Kerfur. He wasn't free yet, at least.  
\-At approximately 05:00 hours on day 48, I made the executive decision. The meta-paranoia was never ending, all the red dots except Anti Breather were gone, and I was tired. I used Debug Events to see there were apparently 2 Ariral Gunners supposedly somewhere. After deliberation, I decided to use Debug Scrape. Siege over, everyone back to your homes.

Final Failure Score:  
Kel Deaths: 1  
Lost Lighters: 4  
Medkits spent: I'll say 14  
Hooks lost: More than five  
Funds spent: I'll hazard it's in the 2000 range, maybe 2500  
Daily Tasks done: 0  
Time spent in water hole: Casino Nights Zone Barrel  
Boar Fatalities: Easily 50+, maybe even nearing 100  
Flame Tanks: MIA  
Abandoned Kerfur: Unaddressed

And that's the story.  
I'd be so happy if this event got fixed, but oh man alive am I glad I got to experience this. I really wish the Flame Tanks had shown up, I had enough molotov's to deal with them. And the fuel would have been nice. Now there's a surplus of gibs, flesh, Metal Scrap, and Electronic Scrap all over the base and map. Also the Abandoned Kerfur. I sure hope Debug Scrape didn't get rid of them, because I'd like to take 'em out and claim the loot.",6,1763775568.0,Voicesofthevoid,0,1.0,False

It used to, I used to have a lot of zest, optimism, and passion for life, but within the past year I just felt like I was trapped and going through work and life routines. 

Things got better when I took a three month trip abroad, and I got back in touch with one of my old interests while I was away. I felt passion for life again and I felt happy. 

I got back home two weeks ago, and my dissatisfaction with the city I live in, and just returning to the old pain I left behind, have been draining me. I wasn’t depressed before I left, just bored and trudging through, hoping to get to a point when life got better. 

Now, even the things that used to give me joy don’t anymore. Life feels empty and I don’t have the drive to do anything. I used to boulder and lift weights, I don’t anymore.

I’m lonely and dissatisfied with the friends I have since they don’t do anything new, and we never have deep conversations. So many people have seemed interested and told me “let’s get coffee some time!” Only to ghost me or fail to follow up on their invitation. I can’t make friends with ingenuine people and it seems like that’s nearly all I’m surrounded by. 

The only thing that interests me anymore is daydreaming about talking to people (characters) who actually do find me interesting, and do care about me. The people I daydream about talking to are genuine, easy to read, and interested in befriending me (and have some of my niche interests in common). I frequently daydream about talking to these people and sharing my interests with them. 

And then I stop daydreaming and I’m reminded that my reality is extremely lonely and nobody is genuine around me. 

When will my joy and zest for life return? Will I ever find people that care about me, share some of my interests, pursue my friendship, and are genuine? I guess I’ll see. ",2,1763775433.0,depression,0,1.0,False

They are the backbone of keeping your teeth, gums, and any cosmetic or implant work stable for the long term. If you only see a dentist when something hurts, you are already late. Hygiene visits are how you stay ahead of problems instead of reacting to them.

https://preview.redd.it/08ofv1zvpp2g1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a358e53b53c32a123a3327d84cbefceb05946ab

Let’s break down what those appointments actually do for you, how often you should go, what happens during a visit at a practice like Creative Smiles, and what tends to go wrong when people skip them.



# What a hygiene appointment really does

A hygiene appointment is more than a quick polish.

In a typical visit you get:

* A review of your medical and dental history
* A check of your gums and soft tissues
* Professional removal of plaque and tartar
* Cleaning below the gumline where your toothbrush never reaches
* Polishing to smooth the tooth surface and reduce future buildup
* Advice tailored to your mouth, not a generic list of instructions
* Often, periodic x rays to check between teeth and under fillings

At a modern practice like Creative Smiles, hygiene is tightly connected to the rest of your care. The hygienist is watching how your gums react, how your existing fillings or crowns are holding up, whether there is inflammation around implants, and whether your home care is working or needs adjustments. The dentist then uses that information to plan the next steps.

You are not just “getting a clean”. You are getting a status report on your mouth with real work done to stabilise it.



# Why brushing and flossing are not enough

Even if you brush twice a day and floss, plaque hardens into tartar in places you simply cannot clean fully on your own. Back molars, the inside surfaces of lower front teeth, and around crowded or rotated teeth are common trouble spots.

Once plaque hardens:

* Your toothbrush cannot remove it
* The rough surface irritates the gums
* Bacteria in that tartar trigger inflammation

The hygienist uses specialised instruments and training to break up and remove these deposits without damaging your teeth. This is called scaling. When that layer is gone, your gums can settle down and heal instead of being in a constant low level fight with bacteria.

If you miss hygiene appointments, tartar layers get thicker and start to creep under the gumline. At that point you are not just dealing with dirty teeth. You are dealing with early gum disease.



# Protecting your gums and the bone that holds your teeth

Gum disease usually starts quietly. Gums bleed when you brush. They look a bit puffy. Your breath is not as fresh as it used to be. Many people ignore that for months or years.

Regular hygiene appointments interrupt that progression.

During each visit, the team:

* Measures or at least checks the depth of the pockets around your teeth
* Looks for areas of localised bleeding or swelling
* Removes plaque and tartar from those pockets before they deepen
* Adjusts your home routine, for example adding interdental brushes or a different floss technique

When this is done regularly, early gingivitis can be reversed. The gums tighten back up, pockets do not deepen, and the bone that holds your teeth stays intact.

If you skip visits and gum disease advances, you may reach a stage where:

* Pockets deepen
* Bone levels drop
* Teeth become loose or drift
* You need deeper cleaning, sometimes with numbing, or even gum surgery

Hygiene appointments are there to stop you ever getting to that point.



# Looking after veneers, crowns, whitening and implants

Cosmetic and restorative treatments look great in photos, but they still live in a real mouth with real bacteria. If you have invested in your smile at Creative Smiles with veneers, crowns, whitening or implants, hygiene visits protect that investment.

**For veneers and crowns**

* Plaque along the edges can cause decay under the margins
* The junction between tooth and restoration needs to be kept very clean
* Polishing must be done with appropriate materials so the surface stays smooth and stain resistant

**For whitening**

* Staining from tea, coffee, red wine and smoking builds up again over time
* Hygienists can remove extrinsic stains and restore brightness without overusing whitening gels
* They can check for sensitivity or small cracks before you top up at home

**For implants**

Implants do not decay, but the bone and gums around them can become inflamed. Peri implant disease can lead to bone loss and even implant failure.

Hygiene visits help by:

* Removing plaque from implant surfaces and around implant crowns
* Using instruments designed for implants that do not scratch them
* Checking for early signs of bleeding or pocketing around implants

If you have had higher value treatments at Creative Smiles, skipping hygiene is one of the quickest ways to shorten their lifespan.



# Fresher breath and confidence in social situations

Bad breath is often caused by sulphur compounds produced by bacteria on the teeth, gums and tongue. Mouthwash can mask it for a short time, but the source is still there.

During a hygiene appointment the team can:

* Remove trapped food debris and plaque
* Clean around hard to reach areas such as wisdom teeth or crowded lower incisors
* Help you with techniques for cleaning the tongue and between teeth

This is not about chasing a “perfect” smile. It is about feeling comfortable talking, laughing, and being close to other people without worrying about odour.



# Early detection of problems that are easy to miss at home

Regular hygiene appointments are often combined with periodic examinations and sometimes x rays. Even if the dentist is not doing a full exam at every cleaning, the hygienist will notice things that are not obvious to you, such as:

* Tiny chips or hairline cracks in teeth
* Areas where the enamel looks softened
* Unusual wear patterns from grinding
* Red or white patches on the cheeks, tongue or palate

Small issues can then be flagged for the dentist to review. Catching problems at that stage usually means simpler treatment. A small filling instead of a root canal. Early advice on grinding instead of waiting until teeth are worn flat.



# How often should you book hygiene at Creative Smiles

There is no single rule for everyone, but a common pattern looks like this:

* Most healthy adults Often recommended: every 6 months for a clean and check
* Patients with a history of gum disease, smokers, diabetics, or those prone to heavy tartar buildup Often recommended: every 3 to 4 months for maintenance
* Patients in active orthodontic treatment such as Invisalign Sometimes recommended: more frequent hygiene to deal with increased plaque retention
* Patients with multiple implants or complex restorative work Often follow a customised schedule based on the dentist’s assessment

At a practice like Creative Smiles, the interval is not picked randomly. It is based on how your gums behave over time, how fast your plaque returns, and what treatments you have had. The team may adjust your recall interval after seeing how your mouth responds over the first year or two.

If you do not remember when your last hygiene appointment was, that is usually a sign it has been too long.



# What actually happens during a typical visit

People often imagine scraping and discomfort when they think about hygiene appointments. The reality, especially in a gentle, patient focused practice, is more structured and measured.

A typical session:

1. **Brief chat and medical update** Any changes in health, medications, pregnancy, diabetes, smoking status, or recent dental problems.
2. **Initial check of teeth and gums** The hygienist looks for visible plaque, tartar, inflammation, recession, and areas of concern.
3. **Scaling** Using hand instruments and sometimes an ultrasonic scaler, they remove hard deposits from the tooth surfaces and under the gum edge.
4. **Polishing** A polishing paste is used to smooth the tooth surfaces which helps slow new plaque buildup and removes surface stains.
5. **Targeted advice** Not a lecture. You should come away with one or two practical changes, for example a different brushing angle on a specific tooth, or a recommendation to use interdental brushes instead of floss in certain spaces.
6. **Planning next steps** If anything needs the dentist’s attention, it is noted. The recall time is confirmed. Any extra products such as fluoride varnish, sensitive toothpaste recommendations, or mouthwash advice are discussed.

The goal is that you walk out with cleaner teeth, calmer gums, and a clear idea of what to do before your next visit.



# Common mistakes people make with hygiene visits

A lot of dental problems come from the same patterns.

**Waiting until you feel pain**

By the time your tooth or gum is hurting enough to disrupt your day, the problem is usually advanced. Hygiene and regular checks aim to catch issues long before that stage.

**Thinking whitening replaces cleaning**

Whitening gels do not remove tartar. They do not treat gum disease. Whitening over inflamed gums can increase sensitivity and discomfort. Hygiene comes first, whitening is a cosmetic layer on top of a healthy foundation.

**Rushing brushing just before the appointment**

Some people brush extra hard right before their visit hoping to “impress” the hygienist. Over aggressive brushing once in a while does nothing useful and can damage enamel and gums. The focus should be on daily habits, not a last minute clean up.

**Not mentioning bleeding gums or bad breath**

People feel embarrassed and stay quiet. Yet those are exactly the symptoms the team needs to hear about. Hiding them delays proper treatment.

**Cancelling regularly because of mild anxiety**

Dental anxiety is common. Modern practices are used to working with nervous patients. Sedation, longer appointments, quieter rooms, or simply clear explanation of each step can make a big difference. Avoiding visits tends to make anxiety worse over time, because problems build up.



# What happens if you ignore regular hygiene care

If you stop attending hygiene appointments for long periods, the consequences usually arrive in stages.

Short term:

* More staining and visible plaque
* Gums bleed when brushing or flossing
* Mild bad breath

Medium term:

* Gums start to recede
* Pockets deepen around teeth
* Sensitivity to cold and brushing increases
* Early bone loss in some areas

Long term:

* Teeth become loose or drift out of position
* Chewing becomes uncomfortable
* Implants can lose supporting bone and fail
* Larger treatments are needed such as deep cleaning, gum surgery, root canals, extractions and replacement options

The cost difference between regular hygiene and catching up on years of neglect is significant. The time difference is as well. A one hour hygiene appointment twice a year is easier to fit into life than complex, multi visit treatment plans.



# Why regular hygiene at Creative Smiles is a practical choice, not a luxury

When you look at the whole picture, regular hygiene appointments are one of the simplest ways to:

* Maintain comfort when eating and drinking
* Protect cosmetic and restorative work
* Reduce the chance of painful emergencies
* Keep your breath and smile fresh in everyday life
* Spread dental costs out over time instead of facing big surprises

If you are already a patient at Creative Smiles, your records are there, your previous x rays and notes are there, and the team knows your history. That makes every hygiene visit more targeted. They are not starting from zero each time.

If you are not yet in a routine, the easiest next step is to book a hygiene visit and a check up together. Let the team see where you are now, then agree on a sensible recall schedule. No drama. Just a practical plan to keep your mouth healthy and your treatment needs predictable.",1,1763775428.0,u_creativesmilebelfast,1,1.0,False

She’d put on her school uniform and brush her teeth before grabbing her backpack and sprinting out the door. She’d hop the fence, and there was a little dark alley she had to walk through. They kept the front gate down, so she could only enter through the back door to the kitchen of Lee’s Donuts. Her parents had her help with the register early in the morning. Her mother would fry the dough and work the grill. Her father would sit at a desk in the back room, scribbling down numbers. She had tried to ask him what he was doing, but whenever she asked, he’d pull out a whiteboard and talk for hours. When he got started, he never stopped talking about SWOT analyses and value propositions. Oh, or index funds, never forget … uhhhh something about Roth IRAs and index funds. She’d zone out while she pretended to take notes. As her dad droned on and on, she drew little animals and flowers. 

Her parents bought the space 4 years ago when it was first put up for sale, between a 7-Eleven and a laundromat. Her parents snatched it up, signed a bank loan, and quickly began renting a “2 bed 1 bath” in the complex behind it. She thought it was stupid to call it that because they didn’t even have a bath, only a shower. She found it equally confusing that they named it “Lee’s Donuts” instead of “Li”.

“That’s not how you spell our name.”, she said to her dad.

He picked her up as they walked around the store when they had just started to get their signage in. 

He chuckled, “Jenny, there are a lot of things you’ll learn about the world one day, but today is not that day.” 

He smiled at her.

“Trust me! You’ll understand when you’re older.”

She climbed up onto the high chair she had to use while she checked people out. “Hi Paul!”, she said to the old man in front of her. Paul was their first customer every day and always ordered “the usual”, which was a Large Hot Black coffee and a powdered sugar donut. 

“Hey, little Jenny Li, how are you today?”

Jenny grabbed a recyclable sleeve and a paper cup, poured him a drip coffee with a little room at the top, and grabbed the powdered donut. A little powder would fall from the donut onto her school’s strictly enforced dress pants, something the kids from older grades would tease her about. Even the teachers would get on her about it when they were heavily coated with powder. That was usually on rainy days when people ordered donut holes to dip into a hot coffee. Her teachers would say, “Come on, Jenny. You’re in middle school now, you really should know better than to show up to school dirty”, before they’d send her to the bathroom with a wet rag to wipe them down. Other than that, she was the perfect student, a shy and quiet girl who always came home with straight A’s, gold star stickers, and notes about how she was “Always a joy to have in class”. These would only be skimmed to confirm they were identical to last quarter before they sat in the recycling bin she had to take out every Wednesday. 

Jenny traded the cup and bag to Paul for a 5-dollar bill, and he’d hold them with his shaky hands as they had their daily catch-up. Paul said a long time ago that he had something called “Parkinson’s Disease”, but he’d been a regular for so long she barely noticed it anymore.

“How goes it, Kid?”

Paul had lots of stories and moments of wisdom he’d share with Jenny every day. He’d tell her about Shakespeare and Woodstock, to make sure to keep a jar of all the loose change she found because it builds up over time, and about his younger days as a Theater Director in New York. Her parents kept a big map on the wall for the customers to put little pins into to mark where they were from. Every day, Paul would cover a part of it with his shaky fingers and say, “What’s that?”. They’d been through the countries and capitals and were now onto rivers. 

Today’s was easy.

“Come on, Paul. You asked me that last week. That’s the Euphrates River.”

“Kid, you’re a genius.” 

And then they talked about the weather or funny stories from school, or what was on the radio. Paul came in very sad on some days. He lived in his car down the road with no family and couldn’t get a job. Some days he’d look at the donut and say, “I know these things are gonna kill me if I keep eating them, but having to spend any more than $5 on breakfast will kill me first.” Paul was “on disability”. When he was quiet and down, Jenny would work extra hard to cheer him up and show him all the drawings she’d make on sticky notes and index cards she made while she waited for the bus to come get her. He couldn’t help but warm to a smile, and before he left, they’d be joking and faking voices for the people passing the shop’s glass door, walking to do their laundry.  

He’d say, “You know, kid, some days, this is the only thing I have to look forward to, and you know what? That’s more than enough.” He said when he could find a job, he’d buy her a nice pack of colored pencils or markers to repay her for being such a good friend. 

Paul pointed at the map again. “Christmas Island”. And again. “Norway”. A third time. “Algeria”. He asked her the capital of Jordan. They hadn’t done capitals since September. Something was up. 

“Ok, so. What’s with the pop quiz?” she asked. 

He smiled at her, reaching his hand, which was now extra shaky, into his jacket pocket. He pulled out a folded-up newspaper, turned to page three, and put his hands on his hips, grinning from ear to ear.

“Okay, it’s a newspaper.”

Paul rolled his eyes and poked his stubby finger at the title of an article that took up only a third of the page. His dirty fingernail went *thunk thunk* on the glass of the display below it. The National Geographic was holding its geography bee in Philadelphia this year, at a building just biking distance from the shop. Reading the fine print, her eyes passed over the words televised audience, 4:00 pm, and finally landed on “First Place - $5,000”. She quickly tried to think about all the things she’d ever wanted to buy, added them up, and it still didn’t come close. She thought about asking to go out to dinner before her parents told her it had been a slow month at the shop. She thought about the Canson Mixed Media book that sat on her art teacher’s desk, and how it was much nicer than anything they got in class.

“Well, kid, I told you I’d get you those markers someday.”

Two weeks later, she was pedaling as hard as she could to get to the building on Main Street, even though she was two hours early. 

Turns out most of what they call a geography bee is filling out forms and waiting in line. Her parents kept the shop running until dinner time, people usually filing in after work for a tuna salad on an everything bagel and no onions or a turkey sausage egg and cheese burrito but add avocado and green salsa. Jenny stared at the Yellow Enamel Nat Geo Pin next to a name tag that read “Miranda :D” on the blonde lady’s navy blazer. “And your dad’s gonna have to initial this part, honey”, she said, pushing the clipboard forward.

“Oh, um. He’s in the bathroom. I’ll be right back”.  She grabbed the clipboard and black ballpoint pen before rushing around the corner and flipping through and scribbling “T.L” on every line she could find with an X next to it. She handed it back with a ziplock that held 15 dollars in quarters for the entry fee. 

“Thank you, sweetie”, said Miranda before she crossed her red acrylic fingernails, crunched her eyes, and squealed “EEK! You’re gonna be on TV!” as she fake-jittered with excitement. The thought of hundreds of people seeing her on TV made Jenny nervous. She looked down at her dirty Keds and thrifted blue jeans, a little embarrassed by her sweaty and matted helmet hair. She figured it would be okay, only old people watched National Geographic. She grabbed a complimentary water bottle and sat in her section. 

The kids were separated into two age groups, middle and high school, and all the other middle schoolers were playing on their phones or quizzing each other on Mnemonics. She passed two identical twins with the numbers 101 and 102 hanging on their line-cards, which dangled down their necks, held in place with yarn and staples.  Jenny was number 238. The boy said to his sister while counting on his fingers for some reason, “And then Balls, which means… uh, balls is supposed to be…” Jenny rolled her eyes and sat down criss-cross applesauce. Who forgets the Baltic Sea? 

She didn’t recognize any of the kids in the big ballroom where they all waited. She almost tapped a girl on the shoulder before asking if they were in the same school district, but got embarrassed about her powdery t-shirt and sat back down. She grabbed the pen she had nabbed from the signup desk from her pocket and began to doodle on the back of her number card. She waited and waited and waited. Once she filled up the back side, she waited some more until she got bored again and started drawing little vines and leaves as a frame around her number. Just as she started coloring them in, the kids all began to stand up and make their way into a single file line. There was a big hush that made her a little nervous as they walked toward the stage onto the stage. She wished she could hear a pin drop, but all she could hear was the twins again, whispering something about the border of Nepal. The floor creaked before the crowd of middle schoolers settled. There were soft boxes on the left and right of the podium, and big headlights pointed right at the microphone. The soft hum of the cameras filled the stage, sitting on top of rigs and gimbals twice her size. Their red lights blinked at her rhythmically. She heard from past the curtains, “Ok, let’s give a huge round of applause for this year’s contestants”. The curtains parted, and she heard a thundering applause as she tried to squint to see the rows of old people. She started to freeze up a little when she noticed how many families were there. She blew out a little bit of air and thought about the Canson sketchbook again, thinking, “Well, here goes nothing.” The judges beckoned the first contestant forward, and the little boy’s slacks swished against themselves as he walked up to the microphone. He tapped the mic. The man in the center of the judges' table raised his hand and smiled before saying in a dramatic voice,

“Okay, young man. Which country… is shaped… like a boot?”

The rest of the competition seemed to fly by, and Jenny could hardly remember any of it. Even though she found the questions easy, she stammered nervously through her answers when it was her turn to speak. The early rounds had kids dropping out like flies, over questions Jenny thought were for babies, and she was a little disappointed that they were pulling their punches for middle schoolers. She blushed a deep red when the microphone feedback pinched her semi-finals answer.

“Gu-“ SCREEEEECH “Guatemala.” 

She rushed back to her spot, trying to forget that people were going to see this on TV.  She won with “Lithuania”, an answer to what seemed like more of a language question about which former Soviet Union country shared the most in common with Sanskrit. It had hardly even hit that she had won because that seemed like one of the easy ones. They handed her a big fake check and asked her to smile for the local papers. She felt stupid holding the check and thought about the guys who got paid to stand on a street corner twirling similarly sized signs around. In the middle of this thought, the cameras clicked and flashed, catching her in a half blink. Finally, the male judge, who got his own microphone, held it up to her and pointed right at the cameras. 

“Alriiiiight, Jenny, any words of advice to our viewers out there? Maybe for future contestants of the Nat Geo bee?”

Her thoughts raced as she tried to find an answer.

“Ummm.. always… believe in yourself and… and anything is possible?” 

The host looked right into the camera as he said, 

“Wow. Truly inspiring words from this year's winner of theeeee National Geographic Geography Bee. Let’s hear it for Jenny Li!”

There was one last round of thundering applause before the curtains closed again. After she walked off the now-empty stage, they took her big fake check and gave her a normal-sized one. The ballroom was empty since all the other contestants had no reason to be there. She pocketed the check and biked back home. 

When she lay in bed, she thought about everything she’d ever wanted to buy, but nothing seemed as fun now that she could afford it. She was more excited to tell Paul, to thank him, and tell him she couldn’t have done it without him. She rolled over to face the wall, examining the small scenes she had drawn with an off-brand permanent marker. She let herself have one small win. Paul would have to wait because tonight, she was going to sleep in.",2,1763775327.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I was thinking of also purchasing a cheap table top propane grill to grill steaks, chicken etc and use the stove for making sides and what not.

As the writer was plummeting towards earth he considered how he would have the most time to consider his story. ‘*I should pull my chute right under the red line’* he decided since he would be able to focus better with the chute open. He had his altimeter on his left wrist. It was backlit by dim red light. His earpiece would beep once when he hit the altitude where his chute would no longer register on local radar. It would beep twice 30 seconds before the *“window closed”*. ‘*Then I won’t have to worry about the story at all’.* The man pondered while he fell.

The writer hated advancements in radar dishes. ‘*I wish I had a way to put THAT in my story, but no one would care.’* He mulled over maybe a side character who was a “funny radar dish repairmen” or something along those lines. ‘***Maybe*** *he was secretly tampering with radar dishes’* He thought and chuckled. The sound was swept away by gail force wind as the writer neared maximum velocity. ‘*No, no one would like that at all.’* The writer thought and continued his descent.  

*Beep* 

The earpiece beeped and the writer pulled his ripcord. The chute had, apparently, been packed incorrectly; there was a difficult decision to make. He could either ‘*wait to see if it cleared itself or he could cut the lines and try the backup chute.’* He chose the latter. 

*Beep Beep.*

Two beeps from the earpiece as he pulled the second cord. The chute opened without any issue this time, and the writer lamented the extra minute he would never get to ‘*consider his tale.’* 

As the writer stared into the glassy darkness, he drifted downwards. He thought ‘*Color!…****What*** *could I do with color?.’* He mulled over how nice it would be to have infrared vision ‘*Like a cat’* instead of having to carry around his big, clunky Night Vision Goggles. 

He considered whether or not cats could actually see infrared. ‘*They might just have* *better* *night vision than we have…* *I know* ***some*** *animals have more color cones…’* he couldn't remember. ‘*By the time I can search it, it won’t matter anymore’*

Color cones are the part of the eye that allow animals to see color. Humans generally have three cones, but some “colorblind” people have two or less cones. In some very rare cases people are born with four cones. Only women get this fourth cone, a fact which struck the writer as unfair. 

The writer had done some research into the subject during his MEPS physical. He understood that colorblindness was disqualifying for certain positions ‘*all the good ones’* and he didn’t want to join if he couldn’t get a job that he wanted. 

Back then, the writer thought he might be happy jumping out of airplanes. Nowadays, he found he preferred his laptop and a cup of coffee. In his wilder daydreams he also had a warm fire and his dog curled by his feet, keeping him company. This was not actually what writing looked like for him. In fact, he rarely found the time to write at all anymore. 

The ground met the writer's feet, and he managed to get both arms out from under the straps and landed without ever touching his ass to the dirt. This was a feat he initially found difficult, but it was getting much easier; he may need to complicate the task again soon. 

The supply drop landed two-hundred or so meters off course, so the writer and the other commandos were armed only with silenced pistols until they could reach it.

In reality, which was unlike the media the writer usually consumed, silencers were heard by anyone who was ANYWHERE nearby. ‘*This is why I can’t write a war story, people wouldn’t believe it.’* The writer thought as he crawled on his stomach through the mud. 

Luckily the men didn’t see anyone between the drop and the crate. As an added bonus, no one seemed to have noticed the drop crate yet. This is how things normally went if the supply drop missed the landing zone, but they had been trained for what to do if things became ‘*complicated’.* 

“Best thing to do is to convince ‘em that you belong there!” one of the Denied Area instructors had told him. “That’s absolutely the best case scenario though.” 

As if the writer would be able to convince a guard that he was ACTUALLY a Russian soldier, whom they just hadn’t seen around before. ‘*Oh me and my twelve friends are just crawling around in the mud for… the glorious motherland! Oh also sorry I only speak English, but Toly speaks Russian, just talk to him!* ***Yea right!’***  the writer thought moving into a crouch and picking up speed.

Daron opened the combination lock on the supply crate first try, and the men loaded up. The writer grabbed his long gun, they had switched the maker last year and even though he took this one apart and cleaned it almost everyday he couldn’t remember what it was called for some reason. 

The writer made his way to the closest of the designated “Long Gun Initial Strike Zones”. Which happened to be Tower Two. For all the money Uncle Sam spent on mission reconnaissance the writer found it funny the plans named the  “Long gun initial strike zones at Tower One, Tower Two, Tower Three and” most inexplicably of all, “The roof of the Target Building.” Yes, that’s the building the strike team would be entering.

*‘Even if I* ***were*** *to get up there, how would I see the guys?’* The writer shook his head as he climbed the stairs to Tower Two in his military issue black New Balance sneakers. It was one of the quietest military issue footwear options in his opinion, and his job was best suited to stealth. He neared the door. 'Now *comes the hard part.’*

The door was unlocked. Doors on bases aren’t generally supposed to be unlocked, but most soldiers do things out of ease, and it looks like the unlucky fellow in Tower Two was no exception to this particular generalization. He started to turn around as the writer stalked in crouching at waist height. The writer took two quick steps and stabbed him under the left side of his ribcage with his Gerber. 

“Shit.” the writer whispered. The guard took a sharp breath in, and the writer shoved the side of his left hand into the bearded man's mouth. The man bit down hard, which hurt, but it didn’t break through the leather glove. 

The writer removed his knife from the man's lung and plunged it into his esophagus. He yanked his hand from the man's mouth, seeing as he was no longer capable of screaming and shook it quickly to ease the pain. Then, he pushed the knife handle counter clockwise. The sharp side of his blade cut a rough ninety degree arc out of the man's neck and his movement became more erratic and then slowed as the blood loss caught up to him.

“Sorry.” The writer whispered and frowned down at the poor dying guard. He went unconscious pretty quickly, and the writer knew that the guard would be *‘all the way dead soon.’* So he looked down his 4x magnification thermal scope and saw the guards in Towers One and Three were generally fucking off, and the strike team was still setting up at Doors Two and Three. 

“Another few seconds” The writer whispered as he ducked his head down out of sight and waited for a signal in his earpiece or any loud noise to spur him into action. 

*‘Something with color*... the *mantis shrimp is able to see the most color of any animal that’s been discovered..’*  The writer remembered. He had listened to a podcast about it around the time he was doing his basic training. He remembered that, in the podcast, the host had said something about them being a “Horrifyingly aggressive species”. The writer wondered if those things might be correlated. 

*‘Maybe they're so angry because they can* ***literally*** *see more than we can!’* This was a huge revelation, the writer was sure of it! Before he could wrap all the way around the idea he was interrupted by his earpiece buzzing. 

“We’re gonna go in thirty” Daron whispered, which was a good sign. At least the writer thought it was a good sign. He could’ve communicated in beeps, and he generally would’ve if he wasn’t **very** certain that there was no one nearby to hear him. 

Then, a gunshot rang out unsilenced. The writer went to work. He shot toward Tower Three, this was his cold shot, and got a direct hit. The soldier wasn’t wearing a helmet so the thermal registered the brains flying out before the writer turned towards Tower One. He connected with the right arm on the first shot, the soldier was stretching it out grabbing for his weapon. The writer thought he likely blew the arm ‘*all the way off’* given the bullet’s caliber. ‘*Is it the DM or was that the one they were talking about getting?’* The writer swung his weapon towards the doors and there was a warm body shaped slump outside of Door Two. It was on the right side of the door, which was Daron’s position. 

The writer thought maybe it was a Ruski, but he saw the still glowing foot of another body inside. He played through the likely scene as he scanned for any targets trying to provide enemy assistance from the other structures. ‘*Probably they heard him whisper, opened the door and shot.’* The writer was trying to remember if he had heard a second shot while he was grabbing his weapon. He didn’t think so ‘*maybe one of the guys got him with a knife. Either way, everything’s tits up now.’*

It had been twelve missions since they had lost a teammate. It happened, but it was going to be a rough night for all of them. ‘*Daron had a wife and a kid, a really young one I think.’* flitted through the writer's mind, but he pushed it away.  

“Not gonna get my 6 hours tonight.” The writer whispered to himself as he shot a soldier through the groin. He cringed at the shot and was still uncomfortable even after he had fired several more into the soldier, hoping he didn’t suffer too much from his missing genitals. 

About six minutes after the first shot was fired the writer's earpiece crackled. “Need you inside.. And can you check Evans.. see if he has a pulse… I think we lost him.” It was Daron's voice on the other side. The writer noticed his eyes were running and wondered if it was relief, fear or exhilaration coaxing the tear down his cheek. 

“Roger. I’m on my way.” The writer responded and he tried to think about how many Ruski’s he had picked off  ‘*Seven’*  which seemed like a lot, but this **was** a well fortified facility. There would probably be a few still alive, and they would be radioing for help. This was another unfortunate reality.

Evans' body was folded back at the knees and his blood pooled out from his helmet. He was the newest member of the team. The writer didn’t check for a pulse he didn’t have to. There was a chunk of Evans skull missing right above his left eye. ‘*I could check for a pulse in his brain’*  thought the writer as he entered the Target Building.

*‘Evans probably had a family too.’* Considered the writer, he had just never met them. He carried on to where the target had already been tied up. He had been hit hard a few times and he was bleeding a small torrent from a gash above his left eyebrow. The symbolism wasn’t lost on the writer. ‘*If only I could put THIS in a story’* he thought watching Toly bat haphazardly at the target's head while he yelled at him in Russian.

“Heeee.. not give us anything, we need your help.” Toly’s thick Ukrainian accent permeated each word as he gave the writer a conciliatory frown. It reminded the writer of Rocky 4. ‘*If he dies he dies’.* The writer got his toolkit.

“How much time?” The writer asked what felt like dead air, with a calmness he did not feel. 

“Let’s assume less than 6 minutes.” Daron responded between hushed comms with the Exfil team. 

There was a device somewhere in this facility and his team needed it. Every member of the team was well aware of potential risks that would come with not completing their mission. Although they weren’t completely clear what those risks were. They were assured national security and “the **security** of their **families”** was on the line, but the brass wasn’t very expositional about the whole thing. All the same, the team understood that the task at hand was a… gruesome necessity. 

With his shears, the writer cut and removed the thick uniform pant leg from the tied up man, anatomical left. He nodded at Toly to give the man a last chance to talk. Toly said something in Russian, and when the target spit in his direction instead of answering, the writer began.

Silently steeling himself, the writer took his scalpel and cut down each side of the patellar tendon from the kneecap down. The man's screaming was loud, not yet deafening, and the subject was angrier than scared. This would not last long. The writer grabbed his chisel and positioned it touching the skin above the man's  patellar tendon. This time above the kneecap. He considered giving the man another chance to talk, decided against it and batted the palm of his hand on the butt of his chisel in what his brain had deemed ‘*The Spank’* . This separated the tendon into two parts. In a practiced movement he pushed the chisel under the patella, following the line of the tendon and pried it outward. The motion broke the skin on each side simultaneously causing the tendon and patella to peel away from the leg and flop around frenetically. 

Rarely did a subject of this procedure require any further coaxing to give up necessary information. It was a method the writer himself had developed whilst attending his medic program. ‘*How do you torture a potential asset?’* was the question the writer asked himself. Torture was just a harsh reality to the writer, and there were plenty of people in his government who were happy to capatilize on what they considered to be his “loose morals”.

Morality was actually of the highest concern to the writer, he wondered how long anyone else's morals would last if **they** had been put into the situations **he** had been in. *‘Ryan and Daron struggled with their morality much more than I ever do’*  the writer knew.

Things were happening around the writer, but he wasn’t needed by his team right now. They knew this and he knew this. The team would even be able to wrap the wound the way the writer had taught them if the writer happened to be “too far gone.” This happened to the writer when he did the procedure, or anything like it. Daron called it ‘*meditating’* but, when he called it that he was always holding his eyebrows in a way that implied he meant something else entirely. 

In the writer's head they were in Argentina. It was two nights after a raid and the team had gone out for beers. Daron was the only member from the current team who had been around that long. Ryan (who died, not Ryan the current team member) had hired a whore and it had gone badly. He never said what actually happened, but the whore wasn’t wearing underwear and the writer saw what Ryan probably thought was wrong with the ‘girl’.

She was still breathing, or trying to, through wet garbles. Her head was turned halfway into ground beef, but the writer thought she was probably pretty before Ryan had happened to her. Daron grabbed Ryan and took him outside on the balcony. 

The writer ran to his room and grabbed his field bag. Then, he ran back to the girl. He did a cricothyrotomy, then he shot the girl up with enough fentanyl to put her to sleep. Her whimpers before she went out still haunted his nightmares. Her one good eye stared deep and pleadingly at the writer before she drifted away into the drug sleep.

Another team member, who was still alive to the writer's best knowledge, helped the writer get the girl to a local Emergency Department. The writer couldn’t remember this man’s name anymore, but the boys had called him Skeletor because he was tall and rail thin, despite eating more mayonnaise (straight from the Heinz packet) than anyone could fathom. 

A gunshot brought the writer back into the room. “Not an asset.” Toly drawled looking at the writer. The writer noted the subject's blood was splattered on the floor and walls. 

“It’ll be a relatively safe run to the west gate now, exfil is almost here.” Daron announced. 

The men acted like well trained soldiers and made their way to the exfiltration site where a local bus driven by a ‘Foreign Asset Driver’ opened the doors. The men all piled in. 

“Nobody wants to sit next to me? What do I stink or something?” Living Ryan yelled, even though all the soldiers were sitting in their own seats.

“Yes.” Toly responded, and some laughs scattered around the bus. This part was always the same. A person drove the team to a plane, boat or other vehicle. They swapped rides and went to the nearest base. There, they decompressed at the O-Club, E-Club or Chiefs mess (always left unlocked for them) until they slept. When they woke up, they did the full debrief and met the CISM team. 

There was some chatter from the back of the bus, but the writer wanted to think about his story. ‘*Something with color’*  he tried to think, but it was beyond his grasp now. He was back in Argentina, walking back to the hotel with Skeletor in complete silence. The girl's blood was all over him. He was back in the room where Dead Ryan was in from the balcony. Dead Ryan was yelling ‘*Did you dump that thing in the trash?’* and before the writer knew it he was throwing a punch at him. Dead Ryan was ducking and the writer was connecting with just one knuckle to his forehead and the writers strike was glancing off. ‘*What the fuck!’* Dead Ryan was yelling and Daron was dragging the writer away from him. The writer could see he managed to split the skin where his fist connected with Dead Ryan's head and there deep red blood was running into the piece of shit’s eyes .

‘*Good’* the writer thought, trying to force himself back into the present. 

*‘Something with COLOR, lets see, something with color’* the writer reminded himself. ‘*What if we were able to put all the color cones from a Mantis Shrimp into a person? Would the person become more violent? If so, why?’* The writer liked this train of thought so he followed it for the rest of the bus ride. When they were getting on the plane he thought ‘*What if each new color cone they put in gave the man some sort of new power? He would get heat vision from one of them, for sure, but what else?’*

When the men had reached the base and poured their first drink; The writer was running out of ideas for ‘*new powers*’ that could come from vision, and had already utilized the somewhat ‘*far fetched’* idea of being able to see ghosts. The ghost plotline lasted an entire chapter of this imaginary book and he realised he was treading water. “It’d drive you mad!” The writer said aloud, as he was starting to reconsider the ghost idea altogether. ‘*Maybe, it could be the last power the man got before he was driven to suicide*’ He reached.

“Only if you let it, Boss.” Living Ryan said, apparently the writer had said his last loud enough for him to hear it. The writer tried not to let his embarrassment show. 

The men toasted their drinks and Daron shouted “To Evans!”. The men all echoed it back. 

“Who knew his first name?” Living Ryan polled the room loudly.

“Mike.” said Toly. 

“Mike Jones!” yelled one of the men and the whole scene started to blend together for the writer. 



“Who? Mike Jones!” Echoed for a bit and then the question of whether Mike Evans was a brand of whiskey was brought up. “Clearly not *his* brand, he wouldn’t have been out here with us!” said one “or dead”  frowned another. The whiskey was decided to actually be called “Evan Williams”. One of the men didn’t believe this and started digging through the bottles behind the bar. He found a bottle of Evan Williams and started yelling “Mandela Effect! Mandela Effect!” and the rest of the men roared with drunken laughter. The writer wasn’t sure he understood what the declaration meant in this context, but his people were laughing; so he laughed along. 

The writer eventually stumbled to his bed ‘*Maybe the man becomes a murderer? Maybe the real hero of the story is the government who has to stop him?’* It didn’t seem realistic to the writer. He fell asleep with the room gently spinning and his right foot on the floor. 

The debrief was relatively uncomplicated for the writer. He wasn’t sure whether or not to bring up Daron *lightly* breaking protocol unprompted, but he decided to simply tell the truth to the best of his ability. They couldn’t do anything to Daron even if he had done something incredibly wrong, at least, not really. Other people weren’t able to do what the writer and his friends did. The brass needed them a lot more than the other way around, and everyone knew it.

The tall, bespoke suited, bespectacled man left the room and the CISM team started to make their round. The counselor whom the writer was assigned was young, pretty and brunette. 

“I’m Abby,” She began “and I understand you just had a traumatic experience Mr. Springfield.” 

This was more or less how all of the Critical Incident Stress Management teams started their spiels. ‘*Introduce yourself, establish common ground and get to the point. Might as well be their whole training course’* thought the writer. “Yes. It's always a tragedy to lose one of our own.” He responded, whilst considering how best to end a story about *‘a crazed government test subject who could see ghosts.’* He ran through ending after ending, but none of them seemed to fit.

“Mr. Springfield?” Abby interrupted his thought “You look distraught. Is everything alright?”



The writer hadn’t realized that his frustration had reached his face. He thought about it for a moment and said “I’m sorry. I’m just writing a story and I can’t figure it out. I don’t know how it ends.” He sighed with dejection and finished “I think I might have to throw the whole idea away.” 

Abby looked interested in a way the writer wasn’t sure he appreciated. He didn’t particularly enjoy being analyzed, especially not this openly, or by “Mental Health Professionals”. “Can you not think of any endings? Or is the problem that you can’t accept any of the endings you’ve thought of?” She asked with a slightly raised eyebrow. 

“I just can’t find one that fits.” responded the writer.

“Well, why don’t you just give it an ending? Any ending has to be better than no ending right?” The woman asked politely.

“It wouldn’t connect with people.” The writer shrugged.

“Is that something you worry about? Connecting with people?” The counselor asked latching on to the statement in the way only mental health workers could.

The writer realized that he had gone off script. He also realized  that he was about three *‘strange’* answers away from losing his special pay for ‘*medical reasons’* and right before a two week break*.* So, the writer returned to the unofficial script. “No, Abby. I’m sorry I got sidetracked, let's discuss the matter at hand. Mike is dead, and it is always hard to lose a fellow soldier. Especially a team member as integral as Mr. Evans.” Springfield declared and the writer receded back into his mind.

Abby cocked an eyebrow, but she returned to the script as well. ‘*What if I wrote something about a doctor? Something on a train maybe, or in space? It could be a comedy, everybody* ***loves*** *a comedy.’* The writer pondered as the conversation trucked along.

I just want to know if this sounds like something a person’s brain can go through and still work afterward.

I already did the boring rational checklist.
Gas leak. Mold. Not enough sleep. Too much stress. Memory screw-ups. I actually wrote them all out in a notes app and tried to make each one fit.

None of them explain what I remember. None of them explain what’s missing now.

I remember what I saw. I remember what I heard. And I remember a person who was right next to me for hours.

You can say I’m misreading it. Fine.

Just don’t tell me it was all in my head.

It started with a screenshot.

My friend Liam dropped it in our group chat around two in the morning. It was low-res, all blocky pixels. Concrete hallway. Green paint on the walls. Doors down both sides. The doors didn’t have handles. Above each one, there was a black number stenciled onto the wall.

Under the screenshot, someone had written:

“South annex, Building D. Stairs go down three more floors than the blueprints say. Do NOT go past the second landing. You’ll know why.”

The username in the screenshot was blurred out. The image came from some dead urbex forum. When I tried to find the original thread, every link I clicked led to a broken archive page or a scraped copy missing half the posts. I never found where that caption was first posted.

This is exactly Liam’s thing.

He spends weekends in abandoned hospitals and parking structures and service tunnels. If a place is empty, off-limits, and smells old, he wants to walk around in it. I’m usually the one warning him about trespassing and rotten floors and security cameras.

That night, I didn’t say no.

I told myself it was because the place was close. About a forty-five minute drive from town, just off the highway, near an industrial park that never filled properly. Most of the buildings out there turned into storage or stayed “For Lease” until the banners faded.

Liam did his usual digging beforehand.

“Used to be a research lab,” he said in the car. He was in the passenger seat scrolling, I was driving. “Spin-off from a defense contractor. Closed sometime in the eighties. Official paperwork says ‘materials testing.’ Old posts say ‘human factors.’ Sleep trials, sensory stuff, that kind of thing.”

I kept my attention on the road. “Old posts where?”

“Forum nobody moderates anymore,” he said. “Half the threads are bots. Screenshots look like they were taken on a potato. That’s how you know it’s good.”

He sounded relaxed. Too relaxed, honestly.

The sky was just a flat gray slab that day. When we pulled into the industrial park, the whole place felt wrong in a way I didn’t have a neat word for. Big rectangles of concrete and brick, too many parking spaces, not enough people or vehicles. It looked like the tail end of a half-built future.

Building D didn’t have a nameplate.

Just a two-story brick block with dark windows and a sagging chain-link fence around the front. A rusted padlock hung on the gate. The link right next to it had been cut, and somebody had looped the loose chain back through the lock so it looked sealed at a glance.

Liam saw that and smiled. When he looked over and saw my face, the smile faded a little.

“We can still bail,” he said. “Walk the outside, peek in, get food. No big deal.”

“Let’s at least see the first floor,” I heard myself say.

That answer didn’t match how I actually felt.

Inside, the air felt dead. No draft, no movement. Dust lay on every surface. The lobby looked like generic late-70s office space: square tan tiles, glass doors in metal frames, a long front desk with an old CRT monitor sitting dark on top.

There was a black spray-painted smiley face on one wall. Nothing else. No tags.

We went through a door behind the front desk and stepped into a corridor. Most of the rooms off it had been stripped. Ceiling grids open, tiles missing, wires hanging down. The carpet was stained in big irregular patches. A couple of those stains still had darker edges that looked too fresh for a place that had been empty for decades.

“Do you smell that?” Liam asked.

Under the dust, there was a sharp metallic scent and something chemical that didn’t match mildew or old building smell.

“This is probably where they did the tests,” he said, leaning into a room that had a one-way mirror built into the far wall. “Observers on one side, subjects on the other.”

“Great,” I said. “So, south annex?”

He checked his phone again. “If the blueprint I found is right, the annex should be that way.” He pointed deeper into the building.

We kept going.

Some of the doors had room numbers stenciled above the frame. 112. 114. 116. Then a jump to 120. Then 126. Then one door with no number at all. The next one after that had 118, which didn’t line up with the sequence at all.

I decided they must’ve remodeled the floor at some point and changed the layout without updating everything.

At the end of the corridor was a plain metal door with an EXIT sign above it. The plastic on the sign was faded. The light inside it was off.

Liam pushed the door open.

The hallway from the screenshot was on the other side.

Concrete floor with a narrow strip of worn material down the center. Green painted walls. Doors on both sides spaced exactly the same distance apart. Above each door, a black number.

All of them were 0.

First door: 0.

Second door: 0.

Third door: 0.

Our footsteps landed on the floor and stopped. No echo.

“This is it,” I said.

Liam stepped up close to one of the zeros. “They painted over the real numbers,” he said. “Look close.”

He was right. Up close, you could see faint outlines under the zeros. Shapes like 101, 103, 105, just a little off-center. The new black 0s sat on top of them.

At the far end of the hallway, another EXIT sign glowed red.

“There’s no power in this building,” I said. “We didn’t see any other lights on.”

“Emergency line,” he said. “Separate wiring. Or some old battery that should’ve been dead years ago and isn’t.”

His voice didn’t carry the way it should have. It seemed to just stop a few feet away.

Halfway down the hall, I noticed I was breathing harder. The air felt heavier in my chest. Not warmer. Just dense.

We stopped at one of the doors with a 0 above it.

No handle, no lock, no hinges on our side. Just a door with a narrow vertical slot at eye level.

Liam bent forward to look through the slot.

“Don’t,” I said.

He stayed there. “It’s just black,” he said. “Can’t see anything.”

He turned on his phone flashlight and angled the beam at the slot.

The light hit the opening and didn’t go anywhere beyond it. No reflection, no faint surface, nothing. Just the beam cutting off.

Liam’s face tightened. “Yeah, that’s not how this should work,” he muttered.

A sound came from further down the hall.

Something dragging. Dry. Slow.

We both froze.

“Probably a raccoon,” he said. It didn’t sound like he believed it.

The sound came again.

Same volume, same distance. There was no echo, no way to tell direction. The hallway might as well have absorbed it in place.

“Let’s just find the stairs,” I said. “We see them, then we leave. That’s it.”

He hesitated, then nodded once. “Okay. Stairs, then gone.”

We moved on.

The EXIT sign at the end of the hallway didn’t seem to get closer. My body said we were walking. My eyes said we were staying in the same spot. I checked my watch. We walked for about a minute and the sign looked exactly the same.

“Wait,” I said. “This—”

The EXIT sign flicked off.

When it came back on, it was right above the door in front of us.

We hadn’t crossed that distance.

Liam let out a short, shaky laugh. “All right,” he said. “That’s… something. Old construction messing with perspective.”

That dragging noise came again. One drawn-out pull and then a single, clear tap on the floor.

“I’m done,” I said. “Stairs, then out. I mean it this time.”

He opened the door.

The stairwell looked ordinary at first glance.

Square landings, concrete steps, metal railings. Black stenciled numbers on the walls at each landing.

The level we were on had a 1.

One flight down was marked 0.

Another flight down was marked -1.

The first -1 we saw had a line scratched through it, like someone had dug a key or a nail across it.

There were no stairs going higher than 1. No roof door.

“You read the caption,” Liam said. “Stairs go lower than they should. Don’t go past the second landing. That’s the warning.”

He put his hand on the rail.

“Second landing and we’re out,” he said. “For real. I just want to see how far it goes.”

“You always say that,” I said.

“Yeah, and sometimes I mean it,” he said.

We started down.

The air grew colder with each flight. By the time we reached the landing with 0, my fingers were numb on the rail. There was a door there. Metal, blank, no window.

“Leave it alone,” I said.

He did, which surprised me.

“One more,” he said. “We hit -1, confirm the pattern, then we’re done.”

The next landing down had -1 on the wall again. This stencil didn’t have a scratch through it. The door here had a black 0 above it, just like the hallway doors.

“We saw it,” I said. “That’s the second landing. Your little rule is met. Time to go back up.”

The stairwell lights shut off.

It wasn’t dramatic. No popping glass. Just a tiny electrical noise and then only our flashlights.

His phone beam and my headlamp made two small islands of light. Beyond those, nothing.

“Tell me that was a timer,” I said. “Please say there’s some stupid motion sensor.”

“That wasn’t me,” he said, and I believed him.

Something moved below us.

Not footsteps. Not any animal noise I recognized. It was a slow, steady shift, like a heavy coil of something being rearranged.

Liam aimed his light downward.

We didn’t see the familiar pattern of stairs fading into a darker distance. The light hit a gray space that refused to show depth or shape.

My eyes started to sting again.

“We’re going now,” I said. “Up.”

He nodded.

We climbed.

We went up one full flight.

The landing number said -1.

He stopped.

“No,” he said. “That’s not right.”

“We started at 1,” I said. “Then 0. Then -1. We came down to this one. We just went up one. This should be 0. It’s not.”

As we looked at it, the number changed.

The paint didn’t smear. The wall didn’t shift. It was the same marks. My brain just suddenly read them as -1 again instead of 0. No transition. Just a new fact.

Liam’s breathing went uneven. “We misread it before,” he said quickly. “It’s fine. We’re just panicking. That’s all.”

He climbed three more steps.

There was no landing up there.

The stairs continued in the same downward direction in front of him. When he turned and looked behind, those also went down. The landing we thought we were leaving didn’t exist on either side.

He stared at me.

“Stop moving,” I said. “Stay right where you are.”

We stood in that same section of stairwell for several seconds.

A new sound started.

Short, hard taps. Not random. In groups. Tap tap tap. Pause. Tap. Longer pause. Tap tap.

It took me a few cycles to notice it matched my breathing.

Every time I inhaled, there was a quick cluster. When I held my breath, it stopped. When I exhaled, it picked back up a moment later.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Liam didn’t answer.

He was staring at the wall where the -1 was painted.

New marks had appeared above the number. Thin vertical strokes grouped together. Tallies.

Two groups. A narrow gap under the second group, where one more line could have fit.

He reached out and pressed his fingers against the blank space under that gap.

Gray dust stuck to his skin.

“Stop touching it,” I snapped. “Seriously. Don’t do that.”

“It’s a count,” he said. “There’s one missing.”

He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

The gray didn’t fully rub off. You could still see it on his skin.

I needed something that was ours, something I could verify.

I pulled a black Sharpie out of my pocket. Same one I’d used that morning for paperwork. I went to the nearest clear bit of wall and drew a thick arrow pointing toward the direction I still believed was “up.”

“If we see this again, we’ll know we looped,” I said. “No more guessing. No more trusting our sense of direction. If we pass this arrow twice, we stop and figure it out.”

He gave me a small, tight nod.

We started climbing again.

I kept my hand on the rail the whole time. The tapping kept matching our breathing. It didn’t grow louder or softer, just adjusted as we did.

We passed another landing.

The stencil here read -2.

My thighs burned. My chest hurt. The air stayed thin and cold.

The arrow never reappeared.

After several more flights, my legs started to shake so badly I couldn’t trust my footing.

“I need a second,” I said. “Just one second.”

Liam stopped above me.

The wall at this landing had changed again.

The tallies above the number now had no gap. The missing line was there.

“There,” he said quietly. “Now it’s all there.”

His voice broke on the last word.

“‘All’ what?” I asked.

He looked down at me like he was trying to line up my face with something in his head.

“Ever feel like a place is keeping track of you?” he asked. “Not just visitors. You. Personally.”

I didn’t answer.

The tapping stopped.

Silence in that stairwell wasn’t clean. Under it, a slow, steady rasp came in. It sounded like air being moved through a long, narrow space. It didn’t come from above or below. It came from the walls.

My teeth hurt. My fingers cramped around the rail.

My body moved before I finished thinking about it.

I grabbed his wrist again and ran.

I honestly couldn’t tell you which way we went. Up, down, sideways—none of it meant anything. My feet kept hitting concrete. Landings flashed past. -3. Blank. Another -1. A 0 in the wrong place. Numbers that didn’t connect to each other.

The rasping noise stayed at the same volume the whole time, no matter how fast or slow we moved.

At one landing, my heel sank just enough into the surface to feel it. The concrete gave under my weight briefly and then firmed again. The wall beside us pushed inward once, then relaxed.

“Don’t stop,” I said. “Just keep going.”

We didn’t.

Eventually, a different kind of light showed up above us.

Pale, gray daylight seeped through a doorway at the top of yet another run. Not the harsh stairwell bulbs. Real outside light.

“There,” I said. “That has to be the way out.”

We sprinted.

One last landing with no number. A door hanging open. A short corridor. Broken safety glass in window frames. Grass and cracked asphalt beyond.

We went through and out.

The outside air hit hard. Real wind, real street noise, real world. My knees gave out and I ended up on the pavement, leaning on my hands, breathing like I’d just finished a sprint.

For a while there was only that. Our breathing. Distant cars. Wind.

Then I realized I only heard myself.

I turned.

Liam was still standing in the doorway.

He was halfway in shadow, one hand braced on the frame, the other hanging at his side. His body faced me. His feet were still partly on the indoor flooring.

“Come on,” I said. “We’re out. Get over here.”

He tilted his head a few degrees. Slow. Controlled.

His fingers flexed once and then went still again.

The hair on my arms stood up.

“Liam,” I said.

He stepped out.

His body moved the way a body is supposed to move, but the timing was off. His joints seemed to catch and then continue. No casual shift of weight, no little adjustments you don’t usually notice. Every step was deliberate.

He stopped in front of me.

Up close, his face looked washed out. Pupils wide. His eyes were locked on mine and didn’t flick around to anything else.

Then he smiled.

His smile has always been a little crooked on one side. This one wasn’t. Both corners of his mouth went up the same amount.

I felt my stomach drop.

“You okay?” I asked. The words came out too loud.

He blinked once. The blink lasted a fraction longer than normal.

“We made it out,” he said.

The words were right. The pronunciation was right. The spacing between the words was just slightly wrong, like he was repeating a line he’d practiced.

Behind him, the stairwell door swung toward the frame on its own. It didn’t latch. It just moved until it almost touched and then stopped.

Near the hem of his shirt, I saw a tiny strip of white.

It sat flush under the fabric. Not lint, not dust. A thin band pressed against his skin, the way a hospital wristband hides under a sleeve.

Without thinking, I reached toward it.

He jerked back so fast it didn’t look natural.

“Don’t,” he said.

That single word sounded completely normal.

We stood there, just looking at each other.

“Okay,” I said finally. “I won’t. Let’s just go home.”

On the way back, he didn’t touch his phone. No music, no scrolling, no complaining about my driving. He stared out the passenger window the whole ride.

At one red light, I glanced down at his hands.

The same faint gray dust clung around his fingers. It hadn’t rubbed off.

When we pulled up outside his building, he turned toward me.

“You should delete the photos,” he said.

“We didn’t take any,” I said.

He looked at me for a second, then nodded slowly.

“Right,” he said. “Good.”

He got out and went inside.

I stayed in the car for a while with my hands still on the steering wheel and the engine off, just staring at the windshield. It felt like a scene was missing somewhere between the stairwell and dropping him off.

When I finally went inside my own place, I locked the door, checked the deadbolt twice, then took a shower until the hot water ran out. I still couldn’t shake the feeling of the stairwell air sitting in my lungs.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The second night I lay in bed with the lights on, watching the ceiling.

By the third night, I gave in and tried to call him.

The call didn’t ring. An automated voice said the number wasn’t in service.

I texted him anyway.

The message failed instantly.

I opened our group chat.

All the old messages were still there. The memes, the photos, the plans, everything. At the top, where his name should’ve been, there was just a gray “Unknown.” No profile picture. No contact info.

I checked my phone’s contact list.

There was an entry sitting there with no name and no number. Every time I tried to edit it, the app spun and then flipped me back to the list.

I checked social media.

No profile. No posts. No old photos. Comments people had clearly written to him were still there, but now they looked like one-sided arguments with nobody.

I called our friend Jenna.

“Hey,” I said. “Stupid question. When’s the last time you talked to Liam?”

“Who?” she asked.

“Liam,” I said. “Tall, dark hair. He came with us to that flea market in July. You bought that ugly lamp? He kept roasting you for it.”

“I went with you,” she said slowly. “There wasn’t a third person.”

I hung up.

I know exactly how that sounds reading it back.

I sat on the couch staring at my phone, trying to rearrange names and faces in my head. Nothing lined up.

Then I heard something at my front door.

A soft scrape across the floor, like something thin sliding under the gap. No knock. No footsteps.

I watched the bottom of the door for a while, then forced myself to get up.

The hallway outside was empty. No one at the elevator. No doors closing. Just the usual building hum.

On the floor inside my door was a narrow strip of plastic.

It was the size of an old label. The surface was off-white and a little glossy. The edges curled up slightly. One side felt faintly sticky, as if it had already gone on and off a few things.

I picked it up.

One side had tallies on it, drawn in neat, thin black lines.

Five lines, a small gap, five more, and so on. At the end of the last group the ink had dragged a little.

Underneath the tallies, in very small block letters, was a name:

LIAM

The lines of the letters were clean, with a bit of bleed into the plastic.

I turned it over.

The other side had a symbol.

Three short horizontal lines stacked with equal spacing. A single vertical line went straight down through all three. The ink was dark and solid. It didn’t match any logo or alphabet I recognized, but it looked deliberate.

Staring at it gave me the same pressure in my head I’d felt in the stairwell when the number shifted meaning.

Below the symbol, the rest of the space was crowded with very small marks. Too tight to make out clearly. My eyes kept trying to turn them into letters and failing.

At the bottom, in a less steady hand, was a short sentence:

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE.

The T in “to” had a faint extra line starting in the wrong direction.

My hand shook enough that I almost dropped the strip.

I opened the door again.

The hallway was still empty.

I shut the door, locked it, then locked it again even though I knew that didn’t do anything extra. I sat down with my back against it and put the label on the coffee table where I could see it.

I know the normal checklist of what I’m supposed to do.

Burn it. Throw it away. Call the cops and sound insane. Book a therapist. Ask a doctor if I’m having a break with reality. Hand the label to someone else and see if they feel anything staring at it.

I haven’t done any of that.

The label is in the top drawer of my nightstand. Every time I think about taking it out and getting rid of it, I hear that old tapping pattern in my head, matching my breathing, and I close the drawer again.

I haven’t gone back to Building D.

I pulled it up on satellite imagery instead. The industrial park is there. The footprint of Building D is there. The section where the south annex should be is just a little smeared on every set of images, like the file glitched.

One afternoon I got in the car and started driving toward the highway exit that would take me there.

As I approached it, my hands locked on the wheel. My chest tightened. I couldn’t move my foot to hit the turn signal. I took the next exit to a gas station, parked, and sat there until it was dark, then drove home using a different route.

I think about the tallies on that stairwell wall all the time.

Two groups. A gap. One missing. Later, no gap. Everything filled.

Whatever that place is, it was tracking something. It knew there was an empty line.

It let me walk out anyway.

I don’t know why.

Maybe it needed someone to remember its layout. Maybe this is how it stays open—by sitting in the back of someone’s mind and then getting written down like this. Maybe the label is just its way of marking that I still belong on that count.

I’m not writing this because I think it’s a cool story.

I’m writing it because I can’t stop counting now. Breaths. Steps in the hallway. Heater clicks. The little green flash from the router. Whenever anything repeats, my brain tracks it automatically.

I keep waiting for something external to line up perfectly with it.

Sometimes around three in the morning, I wake up with my hand clenched like I’m holding a cold rail. My arm muscles feel tired. My lungs feel like they’ve been working harder than they should for someone lying still.

For a few seconds, my bedroom feels thin and the memory of those stairs feels solid.

On nights when the building is quiet and there’s no traffic outside and the heater stops, I hear something else in the background of my thoughts.

Not tapping. Not scraping.

Just a calm, steady sense of something keeping count, floor by floor, and never running out of numbers to say.",6,1763775058.0,nosleep,2,0.87,False

Faintly, a beeping dims into Mr. Alwight’s ears. It continues rhythmically, the backdrop to a grey set of ceiling panels. Blurry, but still recognizable, Mrs. Alwight hurries into frame. Gathering around, Bart and his wife join in. They mumble incoherently, their words falling on muffled ears. 

As they talk, and Mr. Alwight begins to gather his senses, another figure appears. One long and slender, pale and sleek, her features skinny and full of curve. Her eyes are bright white, shining like spotlights, and her hair a perfect pink. It flows far, much out of Mr. Alwight’s sight, down to the floor. After a few blinks, she’s gone. 

“Honey, honey can you hear me?”

Mrs. Alwight, still dressed in her overalls, is on the verge of shaking her husband. Bart waves, starts to hold his fingers in front of his eyes, and snaps.

“Shove… off.”

The room was delighted to hear him speak, Mr. Alwight’s words causing a collective sigh of relief. Mr. Alwight rubs his eyes, yawning and stretching.

“What happened?”

“You fainted, Mr. Alwight.""

Joining the group, a woman dressed in blue. Her hair is done in a bun, and she looks extraordinarily tired.

“You’ve been out for five hours. We’ll have to keep you here for a little while longer, but you should be home by morning time.” 

“Do you know what it was?”

“You're very hydrated, perfectly healthy, so we’re thinking about something mental. Have you been stressed recently? Impactful events, arguments, something like that?”

Mr. Alwight’s attention is drawn to the back of the room where Allen sleeps on his chair. Next to him, on a large potted plant, the Pink Dove rests, watching peacefully. In response to the nurse's words, Mr. Alwight simply points, the room following his finger.

“Um… just one of our plants, sir?”

“You don’t…?”

Mr. Alwight looks to his friends and family, concern strewn over their faces. 

“I just… I like how it looks.”

“Okay sir, I just need to know if there’s been any sort of stress permeating your life.”

“I don’t believe so.”

Mr. Alwight stares deeply at the bird, its watchful gaze hovering over Allen. 

“And what’s the last thing you remember?”

“My coworker, Evelyn, startled me in my office.”

“That checks out, sir. I’ll be back with some vitamins, and I want that whole bottle of water gone by the time I’m back.”

The nurse gives Mr. Alwight a playful smile, but her childish bedside manner only serves to make him feel small. His family continues their blabbering, how he scared them so and what not, but Mr. Alwight’s eyes are fixed on the beast. From the small shadow it casts on the wall, something breaks from its side. A wing, contorting and shifting into an arm. The shadow reaches its palm for Allen’s head, soothingly rubbing his shadow’s scalp.

“Can you take Allen home?”

Mr. Alwight’s words interrupt the group, a conversation he had no intention of coming into. The intrusion startles his wife, who stutters for a moment before speaking.

“I… um, are you sure? The nurse said it’d only be a few hours.”

“Please, get him home.”

Allen, still dressed in the Danny costume, snoozes soundly in the cushioned chair. The patting stops, the shadow-arm reaching for something, and pulling back the shape of a noose. Allen jolts as the rope around his shadow’s neck tightens, bursting awake and coughing up a storm. 

“Allen!” 

Mrs. Alwight rushes to the boy’s side, the bottle of water the nurse left in her hand. He drinks, confusion crossed over his newly-awakened eyes.

“Just a… bad dream. I’m okay.”

Allen receives a large hug from his mother, her strong arms lifting him into the air. 

“I’ll be back, okay?” Mrs. Alwight starts for the door.

“No! Just go home…”

Bart and his family cringe at Mr. Alwight’s forceful shout, which stops the room entirely. Mr. Alwight quakes, his lip quivering and his heart pounding. The Pink Dove has flown to his bedside, perched on the grey plastic bedframe. 

“I’ll find a ride. Please…”

Mrs. Alwight nods her head, taking herself and the boy into the hallway. Bart stays at his friend's side as his wife and child follow suit.

“Dean. What’s going on, man?”

“I don’t know, Bart. But I saw it, the Dove. Right before I went out.”

“And don’t you think you should’ve told the nurse?”

“What? That I’m seeing shit? That the new Chief of Police is some kind of schizo?""

“Listen to yourself, I saw it too! You’re not crazy, Dean. It’s just… weird is all.”

“Oh yeah? Look at the end of the bed.”

Bart, worry for his friend consuming his mind, follows the command. 

“See it?” Mr. Alwight nods. 

“See what?”

“Take a guess.”

Bart looks back, the man he’d known his entire life almost looking like a stranger. His hair a mess, eyes dark with bags, and the look of a madman strewn over his face.

“I don’t know how to help, Dean. Can I… get the nurse, or maybe start looking for some kind of professional?”

“No, how you help is keeping it to yourself. Give me time, Bart. I’ll figure it out.”

Bart nods, joining his wife outside.

  
  


Shutting the door, the uber speeds off quickly. Mr. Alwight stands in his driveway, the sky above dark and grey. The grass is dead, brown and orange before the maroon-sided house. It’s one story, with a large backyard and several glass panel windows across the side. At the center of the lawn, a stone bird bath finds one occupant, the Pink Dove. 

Allen storms the yard, not knowing his wife is watching from the living room windows. He kicks the bird bath over, its old stone shattering into a dozen pieces and the bird flying away. Walking back, Mr. Alwight’s angered eyes meet his wife’s concerned ones. 

Mr. Alwight steps through his door, not knowing if his wife saw the bird or not. She stands before him, a green blanket over her shoulders and a cup of coffee in her hands. He happily accepts, Mr. Alwight’s headache easing as the caffeine hits. 

“Re-decorating?” She asks warmly. 

“I need some time alone.”

Mr. Alwight breaks past his love, heading towards his office.

“Allen’s at school, and I’ll be leaving for work soon!” Mrs. Alwight yells as her husband shuts the door.

Inside Mr. Alwight’s home office, posters cover the walls, popular horror movies, a few early 2000’s bands, and some scattered family portraits. Every inch of the wall is taken up, and at the center of the room, littered with unopened cardboard boxes and stacks of paper, is Mr. Alwight’s small desk. 

Opening the laptop, he frantically hurls search after search into his browser. “Pink Dove”, “pink birds”, “list of pink birds”, “pink birds found in Colorado”, but nothing comes besides a few drawings and some images of dyed birds. Scratching his head, Mr. Alwight starts again. “Types of schizophrenia”, “signs of hallucinations”, ""remedies for hallucinations”. Piles upon piles of information, most of which Mr. Alwight is too lazy to read.

He decides to give up for today, devoting the time to reading work emails and settling into the new position. Hours later, Mr. Alwight finds himself drained. His final email, one approving the new image for the cover of the police station’s website, a picture he partook in about a week prior. 

Opening the file, he observes everyone’s smiling face as they line a staircase. He accounts for everything, where their eyes should be, how they’re smiling, where they’re positioned. The only one out of place is Evelyn, whose eyes are drawn to Mr. Alwight just a few rows down. Mr. Alwight leans back, resting his face in the palms of his hands, when he notices another oddity with the image. 

There, in the corner, sitting neatly in an open window, the Pink Dove. Mr. Alwight forgets Evelyn, staring hard at the few pink pixels that make up its form. He darts his head around the room, back and forth between the posters and the window, but he finds nothing out of place. His trance is broken by a knock at the door, one light and gentle but still hard enough to hear.

Mr. Alwight moves swiftly to the front door, his mind deciding whether it’s illusion or reality. He cracks the handle slowly, anticipation at its peak, but still, not enough for what he finds. 

Much taller than him, by at least three feet, one of the party-goers stands before him. They’re dressed in the pink robe, one so thick and fluttery it hides all shape from the body. It covers their head, the pink masquerade mask donned with dozens of pink feathers. There is a layer of black mesh in the eye-holes, allowing visibility but no view of the eyes behind. 

It says nothing, Mr. Alwight taken aback by the encounter. Methodically, it reaches a pink-gloved hand in front of the man. Opening the palm, a tiny silver key sits inside. Mr. Alwight thinks for a moment, before shaking his head, rejecting the offer. 

In a great stride, it steps forward. Mr. Alwight stumbles back, the length of his legs unable to match the steps of the party-goer. Its hand still extended, the tiny key glimmering and begging to be taken. Eventually, Mr. Alwight is backed into a wall, raising his arms in defense. 

“BARTENDER. KEEPER. GUARDIAN.”

Its words shake the room, the vibrations making glasses jitter in cabinets and wooden chairs grind against the floor. Mr. Alwight can't help but cower in its wake.

“Chief! Dean! Dean!”

Standing before him, door open in the background, Evelyn’s worried face stands in place of the party-goer. She’s dressed sparsely, as per the norm. The fur coat around her doing little as the front is wide open, exposed and exposing. 

“Evelyn? What are you doing here?”

“I just wanted to see how you were doing. You started freaking out… are you okay?”

“Yes, fine. Get out.”

Mr. Alwight stand, recuperating himself. Evelyn clings to his side like a hungry dog.

“Are you sure? I could stay…”

“*Get out!*” Mr. Alwight yells, pushing the woman off.

“Okay. I’m sorry, sir.” 

Mr. Alwight catches his breath, watching closely as his coworker leaves. She gives him one more long look before leaving, he senses simple rejection won’t do. 

Retreating to the kitchen, he pushes a chair back into place and re-arranges the glasses in the cabinets. Did the party-goer’s booming voice really move these objects, or was it all still in his mind? These questions split his head further, causing the making of another cup of coffee. As he sips, gazing out the panel windows, he notices the bird bath, reformed and upright. The Pink Dove stares back. 

Overhead, looming and growing ever closer, a wicked storm. A much darker grey than the sky, it sticks out. Thunder rumbles across the mountain range, reaching the Alwight household. From within the clouds, Mr. Alwight observes streaks of light splintering back and forth. Strokes of lightning, flashing bright. One pink bolt stands out from the rest, only appearing for a second. 

Mr. Alwight reaches deep into the fridge, pulling a non-alcoholic bottle of yellow liquid. He winces as he takes a sip, it isn’t what he wants. 

Back to the office, the worn couch welcoming his bottom. Across the room, the largest poster, a custom made enlargement of the Alwight family Christmas. Allen, dressed in a furry green sweater, Mr. and Mrs. Alwight happily stuck to each other behind him. The tree looms in the background, decorated with dozens of peculiar ornaments, surely from all over the country. At the top, where the star once was, the Pink Dove sits. 

Mr. Alwight hurls the glass into the wall, striking the stagnant image, the Pink Dove vanishing from its place and replaced with the star. Mrs. Alwight enters, dressed in her work clothes and tired from the day. She’s stunned, but not surprised. 

“Honey, what’s wrong?”

She sits neatly next to him on the couch, her presence radiating newfound warmth. Mr. Alwight’s stubbornness forces a nonchalant response, silence and void-staring. 

“Honey. Talk to me.”

Mr. Alwight sighs, breaking for his wife. He looks at her with glossy eyes and puckered lips.

“I keep seeing it, Sam. That damn Dove. Ever since the hike, It’s everywhere. I think I’m going crazy.”

Mrs. Alwight just smiles, nothing her husband can say will stop her love. She grabs the sides of his face with her hands, looking deep into his eyes and delivering a caring kiss. As they lean in, Mrs. Alwight supporting her husband’s weight, Mr. Alwight releases a soft cry. 

They go on for minutes, peaceful and together. Mr. Alwight’s tears stain her back, but she doesn’t mind. Finally pulling away, Mr. Alwight looks solemnly to his wife. 

“Thank y-”

Mr. Alwight’s relaxed face shifts instantly, and the arms that cradle his wife stiffen into steel poles. Her hair has shifted shades, becoming a poignant pink. Even the color is enough to freeze the man.

“Honey…?”

Mr. Alwight catches his composure, releasing the woman. His shocked look surely disturbing her greatly.

“Dad, come quick!”

Allen’s shout startles them both, and with a quick look back, Mrs. Alwight’s hair has shifted back to normal. 

Mr. Alwight runs from his office and into his son’s room, finding him glued to the window. Rain pummels the glass, but the Pink Dove pays no mind. From behind the window, it holds a stare with Allen.

“Look, dad, see? It’s that bird you got a picture of!”

Mr. Alwight creeps forward, joining his son in the stare.

“Allen, step back.”

Sensing the tone of his father’s voice, Allen steps away, watching as his father lifts the window. Through the screen, they sit inches from each other. 

“Freezer! Freezer! Freezer!” The bird squawks. 

Mr. Alwight hurls a devastating blow through the thin metal screen, the Pink Dove taking its full force. It flies back, raindrops shooting from its wings as it struggles on the ground. Allen watches in fear as Mr. Alwight slams the window shut, lowering the blinds. They join side-by-side on the bed, Allen staring down at his feet.

“Did that bird… talk?”

“Must have been… the storm. It’s time for bed, non-negotiable.”

“Will you stay with me?”

Mr. Alwight smiles happily, as he would love nothing more. They curl together on the tiny twin, Mr. Alwight barely fitting but still comfortable.

  


Back to the storm, the snowy push that encases the surrounding visage. The mansion, still and stoic, stands firm before Mr. Alwight. No music emanates from the thick walls, and hardly any light shines from the windows. Leaning against the wood, the Doorman waits.

“Mr. Alwight. So good to see you again.” 

The Doorman’s iced face seems less so, the snow only beginning to pile up on his shoulders. Mr. Alwight looks at his attire, the same blood-orange suit fitting his body. It’s worn, tattered and torn, as if he’d been wearing it for months on end without a wash or even a change. But preserved pristinely, paying no mind to the storm, a pink rose ejects from his breast pocket. 

“Just couldn’t stay away, could you?”

“I suppose not, sir.” 

“Most can’t, I sure couldn’t.”

The Doorman takes his frozen hands from his pockets, pushing the door open. Instead of staying out, the Doorman follows Mr. Alwight inside.

“Ballroom, Mr. Alwight. The others are waiting.”

Mr. Alwight nods, the pair journeying through the pink lobby. Down the halls, passed the paintings, and into the ballroom. The sight is much different, no guests, banners ripped from their spots on the walls, and tables stacked atop each other in corners. 

The stage is empty, the Singer and her flowing silver hair sitting pretty against the bar. The Bartender remains in his spot, washing that very same cup. They’re both as delighted as the Doorman to see Mr. Alwight, the same perky, knowing smile across their lips. 

“Attractive and social, a good fit.”

The Singer steps from her place, extending a bony arm for a shake. Her pink dress dazzles in the light, as if the material itself was made from glitter. 

“Been a while, but I’m back. I see you’re cleaning?”

“Very true, sir. The party is over, *our* party is over.” 

The Bartender looks around the room, his face earnest and old. 

“The last song sung.” The Singer says.

“The last guest let in.” The Doorman ads. 

“And the final drink served.” The Bartender finishes. 

The Bartender looks to Mr. Alwight, reaching into his pocket.

“If you’d be so kind as to leave us alone for a moment, Mr. Alwight and I must have a chat.”

The Singer and the Doorman happily oblige and exit the ballroom. Mr. Alwight takes his spot against the bar, the Bartender forcing a more serious look onto his face. He opens his palm, the silver key resting against his skin. 

“We have carried this for a long time, Mr. Alwight. You will be the one to finally see it off.” 

“I don’t believe I can, I still have a family.”

“To befit the key, one must lose everything.”

Mr. Alwight glances down, the key glancing back. Such a simple thing, tiny and miniscule to the grandness of the ballroom. Yet, it holds a weight much greater than a simple key. Mr. Alwight thinks, and he thinks hard, eventually settling. He reaches his tanned hand forward, his fingers getting their first feel of the silver key. It’s ice cold, alien and out of place. 

“I have to ask, what does it unlock?”

The Bartender pauses, his hand still open. After a sigh, he shuts his palm and looks to the man.

“The freezer, Mr. Alwight.”

“And what’s in the freezer?”

1p3ggir,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1p3ggir/i_upgraded_to_turborepo_and_cut_my_vercel_build/,I upgraded to Turborepo and cut my Vercel build time by 47.6% - here's what I learned,"I started working on this because my Next.js builds were killing my productivity. Waiting 2+ minutes for each deploy meant I was losing my flow state constantly. Every code change meant a coffee break, and it was frustrating.

I'd heard about Turborepo in the community, but honestly wasn't sure if it was worth the migration effort. The potential for breaking things during the switch held me back initially. But after some research, I realized the pain was bigger than the risk.

**Here's what I built (or rather, migrated):**

I upgraded my entire Next.js project to use Turborepo with Turbopack and set up proper build caching. The result: **build times dropped from 2m 1s to 1m 22s** - a **47.6% reduction**.

But the numbers don't tell the whole story. Let me walk you through the process and what I actually learned.

**The process I followed:**

1. **Initial Setup**: Switched to Turborepo for smarter task orchestration (only rebuilds what changed)
2. **Caching Strategy**: Enabled Turbopack's incremental builds and configured proper cache invalidation
3. **Testing**: Verified builds weren't deploying stale artifacts

**Challenges I encountered:**

This is where things got interesting. I hit two major blockers that took some debugging:

**Challenge #1: MDX Build Failures**

My MDX pages started failing during the build. After some investigation, I found the issue was version incompatibility. The solution was straightforward - upgrading `@next/mdx` to version 16.0.3 made Turbopack happy.

**Challenge #2: TypeScript Import Extensions (The Tricky One)**

This one stumped me for a bit. I had a codebase pattern where imports used `.js` extensions but actually pointed to `.ts` files. Turbopack was throwing errors because it couldn't resolve these.

Rather than refactoring thousands of imports, I took a different approach: I created a **custom Turbopack loader** to handle this at build time:

The next.js config:

```javascript
turbopack: {
  rules: {
    '*.ts': [
      {
        loaders: ['./lib/integrations/Nextjs/turbopack/resolveJsExtensions.js'],
      },
    ],
    '*.tsx': [
      {
        loaders: ['./lib/integrations/Nextjs/turbopack/resolveJsExtensions.js'],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

The loader implementation:

```javascript
// allows importing .ts files with .js extension
export default function resolveJsExtension(source) {
  return source.replaceAll(/(from\s+[""'].*?)(\.js)(['""];?)$/gm, '$1$3')
}
```

**How this works:** The loader intercepts TypeScript files at build time and strips `.js` extensions from imports, allowing Turbopack to resolve the actual `.ts` files. It's a small hack, but it saved me from a massive refactor.

**What I learned:**

1. **Turbopack has strict compatibility requirements** - it won't silently fall back like webpack does. This forced me to clean up some technical debt (the MDX upgrade was overdue anyway).

2. **Build tooling maturity matters** - Even with its strictness, Turbopack is faster and smarter about what to rebuild. The tradeoff is worth it.

3. **Sometimes custom loaders are better than refactoring** - I could've renamed 1000+ imports, or I could write 5 lines of JavaScript. The loader approach bought me time to do the refactor properly later.

**Current status:**

- Build times: 2m 1s → 1m 22s (47.6% improvement)
- All builds are stable and passing
- Deployment cycle is noticeably faster
- Next: Planning to refactor those import extensions properly

**Why this matters to my workflow:**

The 40-second improvement might not sound huge in isolation, but it compounds. That's roughly 3 minutes saved per hour of development. Over a week, that's an hour of productivity back. But more importantly, it kills the context-switching penalty - I can stay in flow now.

**What I'm looking for from the community:**

1. **Have you upgraded to Turbopack?** What was your experience with the migration?
2. **Any creative solutions to import compatibility issues?** I'm curious if there are better patterns than custom loaders.
3. **What metrics do you track for build performance?** The time is great, but I'm wondering if there are other KPIs worth monitoring.

Would love to hear about your build time improvements and any Turbopack gotchas you've hit. Every project is different, so community feedback would help others going through this migration too.

1p3gg0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeHereNow/comments/1p3gg0h/ram_dass_a_reluctant_explorers_appreciation/,Ram Dass: A Reluctant Explorer’s Appreciation,"Hello Satsang, Hello Friends,

I want to start by saying I’m writing not as a teacher, or as anyone with any particular wisdom. I’m writing in the spirit of sharing a part of my journey, having found so much comfort in Ram Dass’s teachings and in the community that grew around him and Maharaji.

In other words, I’m approaching this as the Roman philosopher Seneca once wrote, “not as a doctor prescribing a cure. But as a patient in the bed next to you, describing his symptoms.”

I’m curious, too, to know if folks here have experienced something similar to what I’m going to share.

I’d been interested in Buddhism since I was a teenager. When I got to college at eighteen, I had the opportunity to try psilocybin. But the day I was to have my experience, I picked up a book on yogic practice from our community coffee table. The line that stood out to me was “You can’t pull the skin off a snake.” 

Reading that, I realized I wanted the psilocybin experience too much. I wasn’t ready. So I dropped out of the evening, and I didn’t think about psychedelics for a while.

In the time between then and now, I got deeper into meditation, discovered Ram Dass’s books and talks, got married, and started a family. One of the joys of my life has been learning about my wife’s religion and practicing with her. She’s Hindu, was born in India, and we’re raising our daughters in a HindJew family. Ram Dass’s own relationship with the religion of his birth and the religion he arrived at deeply influenced the openness we’re imparting to our daughters.

Then two years ago, at thirty-eight, I had another opportunity to take psilocybin. This time, I didn’t feel like I needed to try it; instead, I felt curious. There wasn’t a craving, only interest.

So I talked it over with my wife, set aside a weekend when she and the girls would be elsewhere (visiting family in India), invited a trusted friend over to mind me, and experimented.

I don’t think I have the eloquence to describe the experience itself. I also suspect that such descriptions can be tiring to read to those who haven’t taken hallucinogens and can feel obvious to those who have. What I will share, if you’ve been kind enough to stick with me so far, are three realizations I had while on my trip.

The first two were figure-ground reversals.

First, I had the overwhelming feeling that I was giving permission for everything to exist exactly the way it was. And that’s a real ego trip, right? To think I’ve control over that. Then, the feeling reversed itself. I understood that if I was giving permission for everything to be exactly as it was, then everything was giving me permission to be exactly as I was. It was a moment of unconditional acceptance. It moved me to tears.

Second, although I knew what I was seeing and experiencing was an illusion, it felt very, very real. If that were the case, then my everyday, waking experience, which felt very, very real, was as much a hallucination. Only, it was the only illusion I’d known up until that point.

Third, and finally, the notion that I was just a wave being temporarily expressed by the ocean moved from something I understood intellectually to something I felt experientially. It migrated from my head to my heart. So there was no need to fear embarrassment, isolation, or death. I wouldn’t seek these things out, but when it’s time for my wave to break against the shore, I now know that it’s okay. Everything’s unfolding as it should, and I’m not going anywhere, even though “I” won’t be around.   

When I came down, and tested myself by boiling a pot of chai (Jivraj-9 with masala) for me and my friend, I felt incredibly grateful for the experience. And yet even today, two years on, I’ve no desire to take another trip. Maybe that’ll change, but for now I don’t feel hooked. It’s like Alan Watts said, I got the message, so I could hang up the phone. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’m curious to read any experiences from the community or thoughts on this. And I’m deeply grateful to Ram Dass and this satsang for providing a framework and space to voice my experience.

Appreciatively,

I have agoraphobia and severe social anxiety, and it’s held me back completely in life. I’m really trying hard to break out of my shell and recover now after getting out of an emotionally abusive relationship I was in for eight years. But it’s been so incredibly hard doing this without a support system. I slowly lost all my friends over the years due to my anxiety isolating me. 

I tried bumble BFF, I got along quickly with people but it ended up being too so dofficult for me to explain my diagnoses when it came to the question “can we meet for a coffee”. I build friendships slowly at the moment, and I understand why that’s not for everyone. Texts, then voice messages, then voice chats when/if we’re feeling bold. I just want friends who match this pacing and energy. Supportive people who’re in similar positions to me, so we can break out of our shells together in a safe environment. 

Anyway, if you relate to my issues and want to be friends, I’d love to try. 

A bit about me: 

I am an awkward house gremlin with sometimes equally awkward social skills hahah. I have too many hobbies and leap wildly between them. Crochet, painting, drawing, digital art, crafts, I love to make things. Anything! The only crafty hobby I’ve yet to try is knitting at this point. 

I game! I only have a switch atm (I have a Mac, please don’t judge me 🥹), and I’m into anything cozy. Animal crossing, Stardew, Minecraft (debate me on whether minecraft is cozy), hello kitty island adventure was a banger. I also play triple A’s on occasion, but need a system to do this on. 

I have meme hoards for days on Pinterest, and I will send them to you endlessly if we share the same sense of humour. 

So if anyone reads this and is interested, please shoot me a dm and we’ll see where it goes. I’d love for you to bully me into reading your favourite book or watching your favourite series 🥹 ",0,1763774702.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.33,False

**After a lot of sleepless coffee-fueled nights, we’ve finally set December 1st as the official release date. Yay, and just in time for the holiday season!**

As fans of both card games and fighting games, the idea for Sheva started with one of those simple “what if a fighting game were turn-based?” We’re not the first to tackle this concept, but still like to think we’re bringing something very much authentic and fresh to the roguelite buffet table.

In Sheva, you and your AI opponent both choose an action (Attack, Block, or Draw) at the same time each turn. Here’s the fun part: you can always see all the move cards in each other's hands, so the pressure comes from not knowing which card they’ll use next turn (and in what order). It turns every battle into a mix of bluffing, prediction, more bluffing, and strategy.

After each run, you unlock seven chakras, each tied to a theme, to a specific enemy behavior, and to a particular reward. The order you choose them in changes how the run unfolds, making every attempt feel distinctly different, and what would a run be without a boss at the end?

We also have a demo on Steam right now and as a tiny team, we'd be thrilled if you gave it a try and told us what you think. 

Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us as we continue to develop the game and push it into early access :)",37,1763774653.0,roguelites,6,1.0,False

We found out we were flying out same day for work trips. I asked him if we were on the same flight multiple times and he didn’t let me know. When I asked him to check online, he rolled his eyes at me.

He got off the train to go to his gate at the airport and just said “bye” and walked out. I didn’t know he was getting off at that gate. No hug or kiss. Just walked off and said “bye.” His co-workers were like wtf.

He goes to happy hour work events or dinners and doesn’t invite me. I thought it was just work stuff but recently found out other peoples spouses go but I’ve never been invited.

He’s never posted me on any social media. Others have commented to me about this and asked why he seems to be hiding me.

I invited him to Thanksgiving with my family and all expenses were covered besides his flight. He complained the whole time about this flight “taking all of his airline points.”

When I come back from a trip, he doesn’t hug me or kiss me. He just looks at me after I walk in and keeps doing what he’s doing. No excitement at all to see me.

He doesn’t do small things like bring surprise flowers or get me something from the store that he thinks I’d like. I bring wine or his favorite cake to him here and there just to show love but he does not do the same in return.

He doesn’t touch me at all and people have noticed this. No hand holding, no hugging. When we are out at dinner or out and about in general, he doesn’t really look at or touch me and has very closed off body language.

When I ask for small things such as an allergy pill, toothpaste, or a coffee/energy drink at his house, he reminds me to replace them. Keep in mind, he is financially just fine.

I sent him a video about what I do in my career that I thought was interesting. He texted me back about how cool it was. When the conversation later came up, he admitted that he never actually listened to it.

We have been together 2.5 years and I still park in the street in front of his house and do not have a drawer or any closet space although I stay with him almost every night.

When I mentioned I was Christmas shopping/asking what he wanted, he began rambling to me about all his financial responsibilities coming up. I think this was his way of beating around the bush about me not expecting to get much from him.

He will not wait on me. For example, if we are leaving the gym together, he will walk outside and shut the door as I’m putting my weights up. I have to essentially chase him out.

He also rarely opens or holds the door for me. He also walks in front of me a lot which is beyond maddening.

When I had surgery and needed someone to drive me home, I asked him to and he agreed. He then held over my head that he took time off work to take me and that he shouldn’t have to use his car or gas and he should be able to drive my car.

I try to make fun conversations at dinners and he seems beyond uninterested. He will sit there like a brick wall and when I ask questions, he seems irritated and says I’m “quizzing him.”

In general, he seems to be irritated and short with me often.

Agh. Everyone sees it and for so long, I didn’t want to. Just looking for encouragement and hoping it opens space for the right person in my life.",13,1763774190.0,offmychest,31,0.93,False

Jenny Li woke up at 4 am every day. She’d put on her school uniform and brush her teeth before grabbing her backpack and sprinting out the door. She’d hop the fence, and there was a little dark alley she had to walk through. They kept the front gate down, so she could only enter through the back door to the kitchen of Lee’s Donuts. Her parents had her help with the register early in the morning. Her mother would fry the dough and work the grill. Her father would sit at a desk in the back room, scribbling down numbers. She had tried to ask him what he was doing, but whenever she asked, he’d pull out a whiteboard and talk for hours. When he got started, he never stopped talking about SWOT analyses and value propositions. Oh, or index funds, never forget … uhhhh something about Roth IRAs and index funds. She’d zone out while she pretended to take notes. As her dad droned on and on, she drew little animals and flowers. 

  


Her parents bought the space 4 years ago when it was first put up for sale, between a 7-Eleven and a laundromat. Her parents snatched it up, signed a bank loan, and quickly began renting a “2 bed 1 bath” in the complex behind it. She thought it was stupid to call it that because they didn’t even have a bath, only a shower. She found it equally confusing that they named it “Lee’s Donuts” instead of “Li”.

  


“That’s not how you spell our name.”, she said to her dad.

He picked her up as they walked around the store when they had just started to get their signage in. 



He chuckled, “Jenny, there are a lot of things you’ll learn about the world one day, but today is not that day.” 



He smiled at her.



“Trust me! You’ll understand when you’re older.”

  


She climbed up onto the high chair she had to use while she checked people out. “Hi Paul!”, she said to the old man in front of her. Paul was their first customer every day and always ordered “the usual”, which was a Large Hot Black coffee and a powdered sugar donut. 

“Hey, little Jenny Li, how are you today?”

  


Jenny grabbed a recyclable sleeve and a paper cup, poured him a drip coffee with a little room at the top, and grabbed the powdered donut. A little powder would fall from the donut onto her school’s strictly enforced dress pants, something the kids from older grades would tease her about. Even the teachers would get on her about it when they were heavily coated with powder. That was usually on rainy days when people ordered donut holes to dip into a hot coffee. Her teachers would say, “Come on, Jenny. You’re in middle school now, you really should know better than to show up to school dirty”, before they’d send her to the bathroom with a wet rag to wipe them down. Other than that, she was the perfect student, a shy and quiet girl who always came home with straight A’s, gold star stickers, and notes about how she was “Always a joy to have in class”. These would only be skimmed to confirm they were identical to last quarter before they sat in the recycling bin she had to take out every Wednesday. 

  


Jenny traded the cup and bag to Paul for a 5-dollar bill, and he’d hold them with his shaky hands as they had their daily catch-up. Paul said a long time ago that he had something called “Parkinson’s Disease”, but he’d been a regular for so long she barely noticed it anymore.



“How goes it, Kid?”



Paul had lots of stories and moments of wisdom he’d share with Jenny every day. He’d tell her about Shakespeare and Woodstock, to make sure to keep a jar of all the loose change she found because it builds up over time, and about his younger days as a Theater Director in New York. Her parents kept a big map on the wall for the customers to put little pins into to mark where they were from. Every day, Paul would cover a part of it with his shaky fingers and say, “What’s that?”. They’d been through the countries and capitals and were now onto rivers. 



Today’s was easy.



“Come on, Paul. You asked me that last week. That’s the Euphrates River.”



“Kid, you’re a genius.” 

  


And then they talked about the weather or funny stories from school, or what was on the radio. Paul came in very sad on some days. He lived in his car down the road with no family and couldn’t get a job. Some days he’d look at the donut and say, “I know these things are gonna kill me if I keep eating them, but having to spend any more than $5 on breakfast will kill me first.” Paul was “on disability”. When he was quiet and down, Jenny would work extra hard to cheer him up and show him all the drawings she’d make on sticky notes and index cards she made while she waited for the bus to come get her. He couldn’t help but warm to a smile, and before he left, they’d be joking and faking voices for the people passing the shop’s glass door, walking to do their laundry.  



He’d say, “You know, kid, some days, this is the only thing I have to look forward to, and you know what? That’s more than enough.” He said when he could find a job, he’d buy her a nice pack of colored pencils or markers to repay her for being such a good friend. 

  


Paul pointed at the map again. “Christmas Island”. And again. “Norway”. A third time. “Algeria”. He asked her the capital of Jordan. They hadn’t done capitals since September. Something was up. 



“Ok, so. What’s with the pop quiz?” she asked. 



He smiled at her, reaching his hand, which was now extra shaky, into his jacket pocket. He pulled out a folded-up newspaper, turned to page three, and put his hands on his hips, grinning from ear to ear.



“Okay, it’s a newspaper.”



Paul rolled his eyes and poked his stubby finger at the title of an article that took up only a third of the page. His dirty fingernail went *thunk thunk* on the glass of the display below it. The National Geographic was holding its geography bee in Philadelphia this year, at a building just biking distance from the shop. Reading the fine print, her eyes passed over the words televised audience, 4:00 pm, and finally landed on “First Place - $5,000”. She quickly tried to think about all the things she’d ever wanted to buy, added them up, and it still didn’t come close. She thought about asking to go out to dinner before her parents told her it had been a slow month at the shop. She thought about the Canson Mixed Media book that sat on her art teacher’s desk, and how it was much nicer than anything they got in class.



“Well, kid, I told you I’d get you those markers someday.”



Two weeks later, she was pedaling as hard as she could to get to the building on Main Street, even though she was two hours early. 

  


Turns out most of what they call a geography bee is filling out forms and waiting in line. Her parents kept the shop running until dinner time, people usually filing in after work for a tuna salad on an everything bagel and no onions or a turkey sausage egg and cheese burrito but add avocado and green salsa. Jenny stared at the Yellow Enamel Nat Geo Pin next to a name tag that read “Miranda :D” on the blonde lady’s navy blazer. “And your dad’s gonna have to initial this part, honey”, she said, pushing the clipboard forward.



“Oh, um. He’s in the bathroom. I’ll be right back”.  She grabbed the clipboard and black ballpoint pen before rushing around the corner and flipping through and scribbling “T.L” on every line she could find with an X next to it. She handed it back with a ziplock that held 15 dollars in quarters for the entry fee. 



“Thank you, sweetie”, said Miranda before she crossed her red acrylic fingernails, crunched her eyes, and squealed “EEK! You’re gonna be on TV!” as she fake-jittered with excitement. The thought of hundreds of people seeing her on TV made Jenny nervous. She looked down at her dirty Keds and thrifted blue jeans, a little embarrassed by her sweaty and matted helmet hair. She figured it would be okay, only old people watched National Geographic. She grabbed a complimentary water bottle and sat in her section. 

  


The kids were separated into two age groups, middle and high school, and all the other middle schoolers were playing on their phones or quizzing each other on Mnemonics. She passed two identical twins with the numbers 101 and 102 hanging on their line-cards, which dangled down their necks, held in place with yarn and staples.  Jenny was number 238. The boy said to his sister while counting on his fingers for some reason, “And then Balls, which means… uh, balls is supposed to be…” Jenny rolled her eyes and sat down criss-cross applesauce. Who forgets the Baltic Sea? 



She didn’t recognize any of the kids in the big ballroom where they all waited. She almost tapped a girl on the shoulder before asking if they were in the same school district, but got embarrassed about her powdery t-shirt and sat back down. She grabbed the pen she had nabbed from the signup desk from her pocket and began to doodle on the back of her number card. She waited and waited and waited. Once she filled up the back side, she waited some more until she got bored again and started drawing little vines and leaves as a frame around her number. Just as she started coloring them in, the kids all began to stand up and make their way into a single file line. There was a big hush that made her a little nervous as they walked toward the stage onto the stage. She wished she could hear a pin drop, but all she could hear was the twins again, whispering something about the border of Nepal. The floor creaked before the crowd of middle schoolers settled. There were soft boxes on the left and right of the podium, and big headlights pointed right at the microphone. The soft hum of the cameras filled the stage, sitting on top of rigs and gimbals twice her size. Their red lights blinked at her rhythmically. She heard from past the curtains, “Ok, let’s give a huge round of applause for this year’s contestants”. The curtains parted, and she heard a thundering applause as she tried to squint to see the rows of old people. She started to freeze up a little when she noticed how many families were there. She blew out a little bit of air and thought about the Canson sketchbook again, thinking, “Well, here goes nothing.” The judges beckoned the first contestant forward, and the little boy’s slacks swished against themselves as he walked up to the microphone. He tapped the mic. The man in the center of the judges' table raised his hand and smiled before saying in a dramatic voice,



“Okay, young man. Which country… is shaped… like a boot?”



The rest of the competition seemed to fly by, and Jenny could hardly remember any of it. Even though she found the questions easy, she stammered nervously through her answers when it was her turn to speak. The early rounds had kids dropping out like flies, over questions Jenny thought were for babies, and she was a little disappointed that they were pulling their punches for middle schoolers. She blushed a deep red when the microphone feedback pinched her semi-finals answer.



“Gu-“ SCREEEEECH “Guatemala.” 



She rushed back to her spot, trying to forget that people were going to see this on TV.  She won with “Lithuania”, an answer to what seemed like more of a language question about which former Soviet Union country shared the most in common with Sanskrit. It had hardly even hit that she had won because that seemed like one of the easy ones. They handed her a big fake check and asked her to smile for the local papers. She felt stupid holding the check and thought about the guys who got paid to stand on a street corner twirling similarly sized signs around. In the middle of this thought, the cameras clicked and flashed, catching her in a half blink. Finally, the male judge, who got his own microphone, held it up to her and pointed right at the cameras. 

  


“Alriiiiight, Jenny, any words of advice to our viewers out there? Maybe for future contestants of the Nat Geo bee?”



Her thoughts raced as she tried to find an answer.



“Ummm.. always… believe in yourself and… and anything is possible?” 



The host looked right into the camera as he said, 



“Wow. Truly inspiring words from this year's winner of theeeee National Geographic Geography Bee. Let’s hear it for Jenny Li!”



There was one last round of thundering applause before the curtains closed again. After she walked off the now-empty stage, they took her big fake check and gave her a normal-sized one. The ballroom was empty since all the other contestants had no reason to be there. She pocketed the check and biked back home. 

  
  
  


When she lay in bed, she thought about everything she’d ever wanted to buy, but nothing seemed as fun now that she could afford it. She was more excited to tell Paul, to thank him, and tell him she couldn’t have done it without him. She rolled over to face the wall, examining the small scenes she had drawn with an off-brand permanent marker. She let herself have one small win. Paul would have to wait because tonight, she was going to sleep in.",1,1763774098.0,u_fangs444,0,1.0,False

Recently our relationship has hit the rocks, although i love her dearly there has been situations which i can’t look past. In recent arguments, she has turned aggressive, to the point she becomes abusive, in the beginning it was just something i looked past, but now it’s becoming bigger & something that has been playing on my mind for a while. Recently we went out to the mall & spent some time together, the same day in the evening i was seeing friends so i wanted to get home for a certain time to accommodate them. We argued over where the toilet was & me being honest, i got frustrated as i wished she’d just follow my lead, as i was the one going to the toilet (i wanted to go near the exit & head out) - on the escalators down, i spoke to her out of frustration, which she started reacting with threats, getting aggressive all of a sudden; i stayed silent, went toilet & she asked if we could just check out this place, i was frustrated that she had threatened me again, and i said nope, i want to go home, you’re being too much. She started verbally abusing me, calling me a bitch, and saying that she hates me, i was quiet and kept walking, she had a coffee in her hand, then outside she told me to stand here and talk to her, i knew she was fiery and i just knew that coffee was going to land on me, which it eventually did, she asked me why do you treat me this way? - I said to her i find you stupid. That was the pinnacle, she threw the coffee all over me, and i headed home. I did in fact find her stupid, because she has these power moments of where she has the extreme need to be right, there is no need to argue where the toilet is, i’m leading the way, she should follow suit. In the moment she was adamant this is where we were, but in fact it wasn’t when we entered, so i did find that stupid. I find arguing over a toilet stupid. In her defence, i get overwhelmed in public spaces, so i can acknowledge i spoke to her badly, and after the threats i was once again frustrated, so i said that you’re too much. I lost my patience when she stopped me in the middle of the mall, and kept questioning me, as if i was a dog being scolded. So i told her you’re stupid, which led her to throw coffee all over me. 

I found that really disrespectful, although i love her a lot, this has been a cycle that’s getting bigger and bigger - it was first a slap, clothes being ripped, hit & verbally abused, and now it’s getting bigger, she makes jokes of pushing me on the road, and i’m afraid she will cause physical harm to me, as i tend to hang out at her place a lot. I actually startle a lot when she moves her hands, she may be touching my face and i’ll move back. There have been 4 events like this. She says that she’s losing patience because i become disrespectful, and dismissive which leads her to this. So technically it’s my fault. I know she says that to avoid guilt. 

As much as i want to understand her, and be radically accountable, i told her abuse is off the cards, it’s a complete disregard of boundaries & a violation. I’m willing to work on my flaws and the cycle that brings us to this point. She had an abusive mother, and i had an abusive father. So maybe something is playing out, i’d love to hear the psychological aspect to this. 

My main issue is that she’s not willing to see her flaws, and even worse later that night she harmed herself, saying that i’ve emotionally abused her, which is something i just didn’t understand. She threatened to come to my place, i told her off and said i’d call the police. I just don’t understand how she can think that she can harm me, then herself & make it my fault. I know it’s a cry for help, but it’s not a easy actualisation to face you’re abusive, she has low self esteem, so the blow to her identity must be heavy. She’s not willing to admit her flaws, neither give an meaningful apology, she just says you change & i’ll change myself. Now i’m sat here, fighting for this relationship but i’m feeling disheartened, maybe i’m waiting for something that will never come, i’m tired of feeling disheartened & upset. I love her and she helped and stuck it out with me a lot, but i was never physical with her, physical abuse is genuinely off the cards & i don’t know how i feel being with someone startles me when they touch me. 

I’ve also expressed this multiple times to her and said when you feel that way, let’s choose silence or some space, maybe take a walk & come express yourself after, as she’s very passionate and fiery with her emotions - i told her that these matters don’t and shouldn’t constitute to abuse, we can handle them better. 

I believe in love & liberation, it heals all, but i just don’t know what to do anymore, i sense a deep level of apathy towards her and the relationship, my capacity has been maxed. I understand her too, but if she’s not willing to accept that she’s abusive & potentially work on it, then it’s time to call it a day. 

I’m very introspective and self aware, i wouldn’t risk an abusive parent, i’m young, doing well financially and have a lot of potential, i don’t want to waste it on a relationship where i’m abused. But i want to hear your advice, did they ever change? Is it worth waiting around? - i know people rarely ever change, but i love growth, so i have to have some sense of belief of change in my woman, i hope i’ve bet on the right one. Is there any smart way to reach her? 

Thanks a lot.

I have a good working relationship with my boss but I notice she can be controlling/micro managing at times. Which is weirding me out.

For example, this one day I had to do on-boarding, she randomly messaged me to let me know she’ll pop in for the beginning of the orientation. I was like okay cool. It was kinda awkward cuz she’s just watching me the whole time. 

We had a discussion today about orientation and she wants me to buy the new hires dohnuts every time there is an orientation I have to do. She also told me I need to show them where the coffee machine is and ask them if I want to make them a coffee. Am I the only one that finds this over excessive? My colleague suggested we should get some company wear for the new hires (which I thought was a great idea) but she turned it down. I felt slightly annoyed but just agreed to what she was saying since she is my boss.

1p3g505,https://i.redd.it/fywdlul7lp2g1.jpeg,Career advice for freelancers,"Here’s practical, battle-tested career advice specifically for freelancers who blog from home (writers, niche bloggers, newsletter creators, content creators, etc.). This is what actually moves the needle after years of doing it full-time.
1. Treat Blogging Like a Real Business (Because It Is)
•  Get an LLC or equivalent in your country the moment you earn more than pocket money. It saves taxes and protects you.
•  Track every expense (home office %, software, internet, coffee shops). You’ll be shocked how much is deductible.
•  Have separate bank accounts and credit cards for business. Makes taxes painless.
•  Raise your rates every 12–18 months. The clients who balk weren’t your real clients.
2. Build Multiple Income Streams (Never Depend on One Platform or Client)
Typical stack for six-figure home bloggers:
•  Sponsored posts / brand deals (30–50% of income)
•  Affiliate marketing (the real passive money — Amazon, software, courses)
•  Digital products (eBooks, templates, Notion packs, mini-courses)
•  Your own paid newsletter or membership (Substack, Patreon, Ghost)
•  Consulting / coaching calls (highest hourly rate)
•  Freelance writing for bigger outlets or companies (steady paycheck)
Aim for no single stream >40% of total income.
3. Master the “Home Office Game”
•  Fixed working hours (e.g., 7 am–1 pm) — treat it like an office job or you’ll burn out or procrastinate forever.
•  A door you can close. If you don’t have a dedicated room, use a room divider or bookshelf to create a visual boundary.
•  Walk or exercise at lunch. Cabin fever is real.
•  Overcommunicate with family/friends about your schedule. “I’m at work” means the same as if you were in an office downtown.
4. Grow an Owned Audience Ruthlessly
•  Platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter) can change algorithms or ban you overnight.
•  Your email list is the only asset you 100% control. Obsess over growing it.
•  Offer multiple lead magnets (checklists, templates, 5-email courses) so people with different pain points can join.
•  Send a weekly email even if you have nothing to sell. Staying top-of-mind is half the battle.
5. Pitch Like Your Mortgage Depends on It (Because It Does)
•  Cold email > waiting for inbound.
•  Personalize the first line, show you read their stuff, propose 3 specific ideas, include relevant samples.
•  Follow up 3–7 days later if no reply. 30–50% of gigs come from the follow-up.
•  Build a “swipe file” of collabs you want: dream publications, dream sponsors, dream affiliate partners. Pitch one per week.
6. Pricing & Negotiation
•  Never quote first. Ask their budget.
•  When they say “budget is tight,” reply: “No problem, what’s the budget and I’ll tell you what’s possible.”
•  Charge per project, not per hour or per word (once you’re past beginner stage). A $2,000 article and a $200 article often take the same effort.
•  Add a rush fee (50–100%) for last-minute work. Train clients to respect your time.
7. Avoid Burnout & Isolation
•  Join at least one paid mastermind or small group of peers earning similar money. Free Facebook groups are mostly noise.
•  Co-working once a week (library, café, actual co-working space) breaks the monotony.
•  Quarterly “unplugged” days — no laptop, no phone notifications. Your brain needs it to stay creative.
8. Systems That Save Your Life
•  Editorial calendar (Notion, Airtable, or even Google Sheets)
•  Standard operating procedures for recurring tasks (guest post outreach template, invoice template, etc.)
•  Automate affiliate disclosures, email footnotes, etc., with TextExpander or similar
•  Batch content: write 4–8 posts in one week, schedule them over the next month
9. Long-Term Wealth Play
•  Once you cross $100k–$150k/year, hire a bookkeeper and consider a solo-401(k) or SEP-IRA (US). You can put away $69k+ pre-tax in 2025.
•  Reinvest 20–30% of profit into your own growth (courses, coaching, ads to grow your list, better tools).
10. Mindset Shift That Separates $30k Freelancers from $300k Ones
Amateurs wait for inspiration or perfect conditions.
Professionals sit down at 8 am and ship — good or bad — because shipping compounds.

Hey strangers of the internet! I’m officially on the hunt for some new people to chat with before my stressful, soul-chewing job finishes me off and leaves my body slumped over a keyboard like a forgotten NPC.

I’m high-energy, sarcastic, and 97% powered by coffee. No, seriously if caffeine ever disappears, so do I.

When I’m not pretending to be functional, I’m:
☕ Reading books like my life depends on escaping reality;
🎮 Playing games (I will absolutely panic-sprint into danger instead of playing smart);
💪 Working out to keep from screaming into the void;
🍿 Watching horror movies and judging the characters’ terrible decisions;
🍜 Being a foodie because eating new things is cheaper than therapy (usually)!

If you wanna chat about books, games, weird foods, horror flicks, life rants, workout fails, or why we’re all just surviving on vibes slide into my messages.

Bonus points if you also run on caffeine and sarcasm.",1,1763773743.0,R4R30Plus,1,1.0,False
1p3g2t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DissociativeIDisorder/comments/1p3g2t2/frustrated_with_pattern_in_therapy/,Frustrated with Pattern in Therapy,"I spent most of my adolescence misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and institutionalized. I was run through the community mental health system as a young adult. It took a lot for me to even consider going back to therapy.

Had a few duds initially. Then I found a therapist I like. He does somatic experiencing and brainspotting, which are both very client-led and anti-oppressive / depathologizing which I love. 

I appreciate that he shows up as his authentic self and is very knowledgeable. He's funny and insightful, too.

However, a few things are really bothering me (and I plan to address this with him the next time we meet): He is consistently 5-10 minutes late to every session. He's often going to make coffee or tea while talk, or cram a few bites of food in because he didn't have lunch.

If I was a therapist, I would budget my time so that I'm not needing to eat or make coffee or use the bathroom during a session. And I expect doctors and therapists to be late sometimes, but not every single time.

It feeds into old relational wounds of feeling like I'm only being tolerated and that I'm a waste of time.

The other thing is lately, I've not been able to stay focused or feel like I am getting anything from brainspotting. I pretty much go into a dorsal vagal shutdown. I think I overwhelm him when we just talk. And he doesn't seem receptive to me writing things out in a document.

I feel kind of at a loss. I don't want to quit therapy. It is so hard finding a decent therapist, but this space that we share no longer feels healing.

Part of me wants to deep dive into all of this, and part of me wants to take a few weeks off to figure out what it is I need right now. 

Looking for gentle advice, shared experience, encouraging words, and questions that help me figure this out.

Thank you. ",1,1763773683.0,DissociativeIDisorder,0,1.0,False

Anyway, let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety**: I will be posting a DOWNLOAD link for some of my (SFW) pictures here. Just so you really know what I look like and that you can trust me. So if you still want me based on those pictures, just simply DM me. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover

See you soon! :D

“AI agents are magic! Just plug them in and watch your revenue quadruple while you nap!”

No, my young grasshopper.

Sit down. Grab a juice box. Let me tell you what actually happens in the **murder trenches.**

**1. Your existing software hates you and wants you dead.**

This is the part nobody warns you about.

Big companies? They are running their backend on a graphing calculator from 1997 and a prayer.

Small companies? Their database is just a stack of wet napkins.

Customer data spread across three dimensions… …one named *DONT\_TOUCH\_THIS\_FINAL\_FINAL\_v2.csv* …one that is just a JPEG of a thumb …and one that is literally haunted by a ghost from the Victorian era.

The AI wasn’t the problem. The fact that your server room is powered by a hamster named ""Greg"" is the problem.

**2. The demo is cute… until your agent tastes human fear.**

Everyone loves that clean, polished demo where the bot books a flight.

But in production? The first time the agent sees a request it doesn't understand, it panics and confidently orders 40,000 metric tons of creamed corn to your CEO’s house.

That’s when the fun begins:

* **Guardrails**
* **Electric Fences**
* **Holy Water**
* **Exorcisms**
* **“If confused, DO NOT LAUNCH NUKES” rules**

Autonomous? Buddy, these things need a babysitter with a taser.

**3. Most companies don’t have “data.” They have a crime scene.**

We’ve seen:

* PDFs scanned through a dirty aquarium
* Notes written entirely in Wingdings
* Customer IDs like “¯\\*(ツ)*/¯”
* Files named ""TheBigSad.xls""

If humans can’t find the right info because it’s written in invisible ink on a banana, your AI never will.

The model isn’t magic. It just reads your garbage at the speed of light.

**4. Everyone wants to become Skynet on Day 1.**

“Can we make the AI handle all legal negotiations?!”

No. No you cannot. Not with the dumpster fire behind the curtain.

Every success we’ve had—and we’ve had a lot (trust me, I am very important)—started embarrassingly small:

* Check if the computer is plugged in
* Don’t insult the customer’s mother
* Breathe
* Exist without screaming

Small wins = Survival. Big, flashy goals = Prison time.

**So… should you even bother with agents?**

Yes. Absolutely. But only if you enjoy pain:

* Start with a task a golden retriever could do
* Assume your data is poisonous until proven otherwise
* Build guardrails like you’re keeping a velociraptor in a petting zoo
* Expect a very needy “AI employee” who drinks all the virtual coffee
* Prepare for your legacy software to physically fight you in the parking lot

Agents can be incredible. But only after you accept that your business infrastructure is held together by chewing gum and denial.

Anyone else actually deploying this stuff seeing the same apocalypse? Or is it just us wrestling with digital demons every week?
