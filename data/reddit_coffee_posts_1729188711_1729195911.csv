I was probably around 40 years old at the time and was driving to work after having dropped off my kids at school, so this would have been around 7:30 in the morning. At one point in the drive I was stopped behind a school bus containing students who looked like they were in middle school. There were three or four teenaged boys who decided to mess around with the 40ish looking woman driving her minivan behind their bus. They began gesturing seductively towards me and I could tell by the reactions of the teenaged girls at the rear of the bus that they were enjoying the show as they were laughing and encouraging the boys to continue. I considered simply ignoring them, after all they were not hurting me, however, the morning traffic became backed up so we were stuck with each other. 

After sitting in the traffic jam for a while and much to the horror of the boys I began smiling and winking at them. Nothing creepy, just two or three innocent winks. The looks on the boy‚Äôs faces were priceless! The girls immediately switched from laughing at me to laughing at the boys. At this point I blew the boys a single kiss. The girls became hysterical and the boys went back to their seats. As the traffic began moving the boys were nowhere to be seen. I smiled all the way to the office!

We're looking for players, ideally somewhat experienced to start a new bi-weekly group to play on Friday evenings.

We're both experienced DM's but would also be happy to play. We don't have a location to play yet.

Things that are important to me (Tom) when it comes to RPG's:

Playing as a group, elevating each other's characters
Creating a character deeply integrated in a setting
Immersion into the setting and characters
Players that have a good understanding of their own abilities
Complicated/difficult combat scenario's

For meeting, let's start with getting to meet each other for coffee/tea.

I would also really love to play PF2e, so if you're experienced in DM'ing that, that would be amazing!

Shoot me a DM (or comment on this post) if you're interested.

1g602ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1g602ej/shitty_life_syndrome_part_2/,Shitty Life Syndrome part 2,"The weirdest day at work today and, ironically, the most functional. Which isn't saying much, but it is true.

The great irony is having thought up some ancient trauma about crazy adults asserting their dominance over children doing nothing but existing in public spaces like stores, treating them like things to be moved with force. Well, I walked to the front of the store to where the cart corral is. There was some old crone bent over a cart next to the stack of idle ones, hobbling toward the entrance. Now, keep in mind, there were lots of other people going in or out, too. I went around behind her and pulled out a cart, then went back past her. She says, ""by all means, go ahead."" I smile and keep walking, then hear her say something about ""another asshole."" I shrug. Truly baffled. Not the first time a customer has randomly gotten aggressive, and not the first time someone has randomly started getting nasty for some perceived slight. I once worked a short time in a factory and some other donkey got mad at me for not holding the door she was nowhere close to, so sometimes you can't do anything right.

One of the other employees might have been mocking me behind my back later on, but I can't be sure about that.

Then my boss again comes screetching like a crow looking for eyes to pluck. He told me to take care of some things that needed to go out. I did, but a lot of the stuff was new and didn't have anywhere to go. I knew I was going to get into trouble for it, despite it not being my fault. I even asked one of the other managers what to do and she said to leave them there in the carts. So he comes running over later about the carts and stuff. I go back and there's another cart that wasn't there that, okay, there were like two things that could fit anywhere, but the rest? And when I get back, I have to explain to him a second time that that stuff is all new and therefore I did nothing wrong. ""Oh. Go do this.""

Just getting pulled back and forth and barely even getting a break. Was going to go hide in the bathroom and try not to die. Felt... nothing. Distant. Every screaming feeling locked in a box tossed into the void. And that's why it was a functional day. One in which I responded instead of cowered, didn't fawn too much, didn't melt down over some random problem. That's what it takes, to feel dead inside.

It's because I already have a herd of elephants sitting on my mind. That and three days of very poor sleep. You scrape out your working hours, and then you come home to your little box you try to afford. I don't want to be home. I never want to be home. There was something I wanted to do today, but that would have meant driving 40 minutes downtown, alone, and on my budget... so nothing means anything. There's never a way out. Not here in the American utopia. Thought of getting coffee or ice cream or something, the various different places I would like to try, but that's all about consuming and trying to keep yourself distracted from the cycle of futility.

At 45 and 50, respectively, they were like many couples‚Äîchasing dreams of good health, happiness, and the occasional slice of Lisa‚Äôs famous apple pie. However, life had thrown them a curveball when both were diagnosed with prediabetes. They knew they had to take charge before it became something more serious.

The days felt long as they navigated their new reality. Lisa, a dedicated nurse, understood the implications of managing blood sugar levels all too well. Fatigue had become her unwelcome companion, and even the simplest activities felt like an uphill battle. Marcus, with his love for food, found himself irritable and frustrated, especially after indulging in his favorite meals. One evening, as they sat on their porch watching the sun dip below the horizon, Lisa said, ‚ÄúWe need to find a solution, something that works for us.‚Äù

Their search led them through the maze of dietary restrictions, exercise regimes, and the dizzying world of supplements. One evening, while scrolling through an online health forum, Lisa stumbled upon Gluco6. It caught her attention for several reasons: its natural ingredients, including cinnamon bark, berberine, and Gymnema Sylvestre, intrigued her, and the testimonials from others who had experienced positive results felt hopeful.

‚ÄúMarcus, what do you think about trying Gluco6?‚Äù she asked over dinner, her eyes bright with curiosity.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Lisa. It sounds too good to be true,‚Äù he replied, hesitantly pushing his mashed potatoes around his plate. But after sharing stories of others who had found success with the supplement and consulting with their healthcare provider, they decided to take the plunge together.

**The Beginning of Their Gluco6 Journey**

They placed their order and eagerly awaited the arrival of Gluco6, determined to turn their health around. When the package arrived, they unwrapped it like a couple unearthing a treasure, their hopes riding on the promise of better health. That morning, they each took their first dose, nervously optimistic about what the future might hold.

[Gluco6](https://preview.redd.it/001dtja16avd1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d876f1a41cde8e2df35226eae5330f9f72296d)

Weeks passed, and while the initial days brought some adjustments, including a bit of gastrointestinal discomfort, they persevered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of the process,‚Äù Lisa reassured Marcus, who was skeptical but willing to give it a fair shot. They combined the supplement with healthier meals and started taking daily walks together, a routine that slowly transformed into a cherished time for bonding.

By the end of the fourth week, Lisa had her routine check-up, and anticipation filled the air. As she sat in the doctor‚Äôs office, her heart raced. When the doctor entered with a smile, he announced, ‚ÄúYour blood sugar levels have stabilized significantly! What have you been doing differently?‚Äù

With a mix of pride and relief, Lisa shared their journey with Gluco6, and the doctor nodded approvingly. ‚ÄúRemember, it‚Äôs all about balance,‚Äù he advised, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes alongside any supplement.

**A New Sense of Vitality**

Inspired by her progress, Lisa decided to start a blog documenting their journey. She wanted to share their experiences and connect with others facing similar struggles. She titled it ‚ÄúBalanced Living in Maplewood,‚Äù and soon, she was not just sharing her story but also gathering insights from others who were finding success with Gluco6.

Meanwhile, Marcus found himself becoming a bit of a local celebrity as he shared his own transformations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm not crashing after lunch anymore,‚Äù he told friends at the local coffee shop. ‚ÄúAnd my energy levels have never been better!‚Äù

Their lives began to shift in remarkable ways. They hosted potlucks with friends, cooking healthy meals together and swapping recipes that incorporated the ingredients they‚Äôd learned about. Lisa introduced Marcus to a delicious and nutritious dessert that didn‚Äôt spike their blood sugar levels, much to his delight. Their laughter filled the air as they experimented in the kitchen, showing that healthy living could be fun and delicious.

**Building a Community**

As their health improved, so did their sense of community. Lisa and Marcus started leading small workshops at their local community center, sharing their journey and encouraging others to find their path to health. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not experts,‚Äù Lisa would remind the audience, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre living proof that it‚Äôs possible to reclaim your health.‚Äù

One day, a woman named Janet approached them after a workshop. ‚ÄúI tried Gluco6, and it didn‚Äôt work for me,‚Äù she admitted, a hint of frustration in her voice. ‚ÄúI thought I was doing everything right.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get discouraged,‚Äù Marcus replied warmly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about finding what works for you. Everyone‚Äôs body is different. Have you considered adjusting your diet or exercise routine?‚Äù Their conversation blossomed into an exchange of experiences and advice, highlighting the importance of patience and community support.

Lisa often reminded her readers and attendees, ‚ÄúGluco6 is just one part of the journey. It‚Äôs about balance, understanding your body, and finding what works for you.‚Äù

**A Brighter Future**

Months rolled by, and their lives continued to flourish. They celebrated milestones together, from improved blood sugar levels to days filled with energy and joy. With each passing day, they grew more confident in their ability to manage their health.

One weekend, they took a trip to the beach, something they hadn‚Äôt done in years. As they walked hand in hand along the shore, the ocean waves crashing against the sand, Lisa turned to Marcus with a smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come a long way, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Marcus nodded, his eyes glistening with happiness. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve got Gluco6 to thank for giving us the boost we needed to get here.‚Äù

Their journey wasn‚Äôt just about a supplement; it was about resilience, love, and the power of community. Together, they had navigated the challenges of managing their health, discovering that with support, determination, and the right tools, they could lead fulfilling lives despite the hurdles they faced.

As the sun set over Maplewood, Lisa and Marcus sat on their porch, sipping herbal tea infused with a sprinkle of cinnamon. They knew their journey with Gluco6 was just one chapter in a much larger story‚Äîone filled with hope, laughter, and a commitment to a healthier future. And as they looked out over their peaceful town, they felt a profound sense of gratitude for the life they had created together.

1g5zre8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g5zre8/brim/,Brim,"It was mid-August, but the early morning and thick overcast provided a prominent chill this Thursday.  Dave Compensated with a long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and windbreaker combo; his wife would not let him leave the house with anything less. The semi-hot coffee in his Styrofoam cup slowly steamed into the crisp morning air as he leaned against his Ford pick-up waiting for the busy line of crabbers to launch their boats.  He peered into the coffee he had picked up from the local convenience store, ‚ÄúDelilah‚Äôs‚Äù just 10 minutes earlier. Although the store advertised the brewed coffee as ‚ÄúBest coffee in town! Freshly Brewed!‚Äù the coffee seemed to have a burnt taste, indicating it had been sitting out on the burner for at least a few hours. Nothing cream and sugar couldn‚Äôt fix, even though he preferred it black. Nevertheless, he savored the taste as he pulled another sip from the thick Styrofoam cup.  Dave felt a thin layer of coffee cling to his mustache as he drew the cup away, one of the few issues that came with such a fashion choice, but having a mustache, or ‚Äústache‚Äù as his son‚Äôs referred to it, really suited his aging face. 

He looked into the crooked side view mirror to help guide his windbreaker sleeve and rub off any excess coffee. As he wiped the remnants of coffee away, Dave admired the remaining spackle of black hair not only in his now fully grey head but also in his mustache. *Christ*, he was not only feeling old but also looking the part.  It was at least better than his friend and neighbor Bill Hatchers who lived across the street from him.  Bill was around the same age as Dave but had lost what was left of his hair about 8 years ago. *Ain‚Äôt that a bitch*, Dave had thought at the time.  

A squeal of old brakes pulled his attention up from the mirror. A truck and trailer was pulling out from the launch and Dave was now next in line to go. He popped the Styrofoam cup‚Äôs plastic lid back on and pulled himself inside the truck onto an old patchy bench seat. The launch of the boat had not gone as smoothly as he would have hoped, but isn‚Äôt that what everyone thought when pulling such a maneuver?  The awkward sharp curve in the boat launch approach did not provide any favors either when pulling around to back in, but Dave managed to pull it off as he had done many times before.  After successfully launching his boat, he parked the pickup in one of the many elongated parking spots nearby in the adjacent gravel lot - if you can call spray paint on loose gravel a ‚Äúparking spot‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt bother locking his old pick-up next to other empty trucks in the lot, as neither did anyone else that morning and started his way down to the dock. 

The thick rubber brown boots he was wearing crunched on the gravel as he walked toward the dock, and then moved to a soft thud as he transitioned onto the dock‚Äôs surface where the boat was tied onto one of the many silver cleats. Dave bought the 18-foot aluminum boat from a friend of a friend down in Seattle about 10 years ago.  On his way back from the purchase he had also bought the Yamaha outboard engine, from somewhere more local, when he got back into town the following day. The boat itself had a single bench seat closer to the bow and a single swivel chair sticking out near the stern closest to the motor, for easier steering.  This left a decent amount of room in the middle of the boat for gear, a cooler - and in the case of this morning - crab pots.  Although the boat had no name painted on the side of the aluminum shell, Dave had referred to his tiny vessel as ‚ÄúRadar‚Äù, after his childhood German Shepard that accompanied him as a boy. Dave liked this name not only due to it being his late dog‚Äôs name but also thought the name suited the boat great for occasions such as this one.  The name itself gave good luck when looking for *just* the right spot to drop crab pots. 

He swung his leg over the side of the boat, being careful not to clip his boot on the crab pots stacked neatly between the bench seat and the swivel chair. He wouldn‚Äôt dare be seen falling into the boat or even worse, out of the boat, in front of the audience that was amassed at the top of the boat launch waiting their turn this morning. Dave swung his other leg into the safety of the boat and settled onto the cracked leather chair, placing his coffee in a crudely made cup holder attached to the rim of the boat. He then turned to pull back on the old, frayed rip cord on the face of the Yamaha engine.  With the first few attempts, the old engine sputtered, came to life, then died. The outboard motor could definitely use replacing. *Next year*, Dave Thought. Although he had been saying that now for the past two. 

The squawk of seagulls was starting to become louder and more evident as the morning started to warm even with the gloomy overcast. He yanked again on the rip cord, and this time the engine sprang to life, drowning out the above seagulls. Looking up, Dave threw up a wave to the old man patiently waiting to back in. With little effort, Dave swung the boat outward facing toward open ocean, then slowly drifted Radar out of the launch area. 

Brimmer Bay, or ‚ÄúBrim‚Äù as locals in the area call it, is one of the last places in Washington to open for Dungeness; and due to this, Dave never wasted a season.  This was his 33rd year as an active participant in the recreational crabbing season and he always made time for opening day, even in choppy conditions like this.  As he slowly moved out of the vicinity of the boat launch, the wind slightly picked up, as he pulled away from shore. Along with the wind, tiny swells and white caps were slapping the boat and kicking up sea spray which stung his already cold red face. 10 minutes later, farther out now, the waves seemed to die down a bit, giving Dave the go-ahead to throttle the 50-horsepower engine for some speed. The 50-horsepower engine was not necessarily ‚Äúoverkill‚Äù for a boat this size, but it definitely had some get-up-and-go when met with the right conditions. 


After 30 minutes or so, Dave‚Äôs field of view started to fill with a collection of red, white, orange, and yellow buoys which floated lamely along the top of the dark murky water, marking the first of the crab pots that early morning risers had set out before he had arrived. He began to throttle down as the cluster of buoys began to thin. The speed of the boat slowed as he passed the final remaining markers. 
Red, yellow, red again, and then nothing.  
He continued on for another five minutes until he could barely see the last red buoy he had passed.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Radar?‚Äù Dave asked aloud addressing the boat as if it were his childhood dog. But Dave knew - this was **the** spot. 

He killed the sputtering engine, and almost complete silence replaced the noise in his eardrums outside of the faint sound of seagulls in the distance and the small waves against the aluminum hull. This quiet could only be found when one was far enough from civilization. Dave relished it immensely; he even made the point of leaving his cell phone in the cab of his truck as to not distract him while he was out that morning. Dave took a swig of the now lukewarm coffee and placed it back into the crude cupholder.  He did not know, but that was the last he would be sipping the coffee this morning as what lay in a bucket in front of him would kill his appetite. He pulled over a sealed orange five-gallon bucket that read ‚ÄúHome Depot‚Äù and broke open the seal of the lid. The smell from what was piled in the bucket almost knocked him back.  
The refrigeration from the past two days should have dampened some of the smell, but the salmon carcasses smelled as if they were never frozen at all, and in fact, were in the later stages of rot. 
Now that Dave thought about it, had he even plugged the garage freezer in?  It had sat mostly empty this summer as he had otherwise no use for it.  He had unplugged it in July in an effort to be more ‚Äúgreen‚Äù but in reality was just an effort to save some pennies on the power bill he probably wouldn‚Äôt have missed anyway. Cursing his past self, he began to flex his hands into his Gore-Tex gloves. 

As he reached into the now open bucket to start filling the bait box of the first pot of the day, something caught his eye off to the starboard side of the boat (or in other words, his right) about 10 feet away. A thin stream of small bubbles was streaming up through the ocean depths and breaking on the surface of the water. This was not unusual to see out in the bay like this, as it can happen from a lot of different factors, but what was peculiar about this was that it was not a continuous stream in one spot, but a few different streams coming up in different lengths sporadically in an area about three feet wide. Dave allowed himself a 10- or 15-second gaze at the phenomenon before he started back on his work. As he again started cramming the bait box with the remnants of what used to be salmon, he began to hear what sounded like a small dribble coming from the same direction as the bubbles. The sound reminded him of a faucet that was ever so slightly turned on leaking into a sink or bathtub, a steady dribble. He stared up again from the bait box. 

What was there now was more than a few thin lines of bubbles. It had now graduated into a growing number of bubbles coming up in a larger area, these slightly bigger than what he had seen before. 

‚ÄúWhat in the world...‚Äù he muttered standing up from the bucket. Dave was not what you would call a tall man, but the new vantage point and angle allowed him to see better through the reflection of grey clouds on the dark ocean water. Standing up he had noticed now that the area in which he saw the bubbles was occurring in a much larger radius than he initially had thought.  The area had to have been at least 8 feet in diameter and growing. Not only that, but was the slow dribbling noise getting *louder*? Dave craned his neck without moving his feet to not rock the boat and lose his balance. Behind him, a newly discovered crop of bubbles was quickly forming just a few feet away from the other side of the boat. The look on Dave‚Äôs face had now changed from curiosity to dumbfounded, not yet scared but damn well nervous. With that, it only took Dave a second or two to decide that maybe this was not **the** spot after all.  

He sat back down on the cracked leather swivel chair, removed the Gore-Tex gloves from his hands, and felt back for the rip cord, unable to take his eyes off the collection of bubbles slowly growing around him. The area of disruption was starting to overlap where his boat stayed floating on the water. As the bubbles hit the bottom of the hull of the aluminum boat, the sound that was a slow dribble was beginning to grow so loud that it was all he could hear, the faint squawk of the seagulls and small waves he could no longer hear. His hand found the rip cord and tugged on it meekly to find tension in the line. Dave then took his eyes away from the unveiling scene around him, looked back at the engine, placed his other hand atop it to use as balance, and then yanked back. The engine came to life with a small sputter, which he could not hear, but felt with his hand on the engine, and due to the small line of cooling water jetting from the exhaust port indicating it was on. The noise from whatever was happening around him was now so loud that it reminded Dave of buzzing cicadas that he had heard as a kid when visiting his aunt Laurel in Arizona.  The cicada buzz used to be so loud that it would drown out the cheap Mexican landscaping that his aunt would hire during the heat of the summer. 

He looked up from the engine toward the shoreline that seemed so distant and tiny. *Why had he come out so far?* He thought regretfully. The distance from civilization no longer comforting Dave in the slightest. 

With that thought, he faced forward and throttled the engine. The initial sudden lurch forward knocked the coffee out of his cupholder onto the floor of the boat, and almost nearly spilled the still-open bucket of bait just at his feet. Dave did not seem to notice. 

As quickly as the boat lurched forward, it immediately stopped. The Yamaha engine had almost certainly died. ‚ÄúSON OF A BITCH!‚Äù Dave shouted. 

The noise grew impossibly louder still and the amount of bubbles hitting the aluminum hull began to vibrate the boat. The water around Radar now looked like it was coming to a boil. The vibration gave gooseflesh down Dave‚Äôs bundled-up arms and legs. 

Dave was no longer messing around. With fierce determination, he spun around toward the engine, snatched up the rip cord in his right hand, and jerked **hard** like his life depended on it. This time no stream of cooling water shot out of the exhaust port, indicating it was on, but Dave wasn‚Äôt looking for the stream of water from the exhaust port, he was distracted with what was now sitting in his hand. The frayed line that was the ripcord had snapped away from the Yamaha engine and dangled dumbly out of Dave‚Äôs hand that clutched the knob. Dave stood unmoving with a look of cold disbelief.  

It took a moment for his brain to kick back on. Snapping back into reality, Dave began looking around wildly in all directions for **any** indication of life. Looking for a boat to wave at frantically for help. But he did not see any boats. 
*Where was everyone?* 
He knew it was early, but this was opening day!  There had to be others out on the bay.  
Although there were others out that day, Dave did not know that soon after departing the boat launch, the older gentleman whom he had waved to, backed his large trailer and boat directly into the dock with such force that it dislodged the dock for any other would-be crabbers that morning. Later, the old man would blame the curve that led down to the boat ramp, saying ‚ÄúThat it should not be so sharp!‚Äù. This reasoning would not ultimately save him from the fact he would be paying to repair the dock, but others did agree with his statement. That singular boat launch was the most popular not only due to its convenience but also because it was the *only* one serving the general public in the area.  You would have to drive 45 miles out of Brimmer Bay to the adjacent harbor of Awhauktoo Bay to launch, which many folks ended up doing that day.  One individual even remarked Dave was ‚Äúone lucky fuck‚Äù as they watched the sole crabber drone out into the bay that morning, disappearing to a dot as they made plans to drive to the adjacent harbor.   

Dave patted down his faded jeans for the familiar lump, feeling for what he already knew wasn‚Äôt there, his cell phone. Radar was not equipped with a radio, it wasn‚Äôt used enough to garner such a thing, but Dave could not help thinking about how stupid he was to not bring anything except his fucking wallet and crabbing license. The mounting frustration came out as a loud ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù almost involuntarily from Daves's mouth.  He was stranded. 

The now completely enveloped boat was jostling back and forth, making it impossible to stand without the chance of falling overboard.  Dave could imagine a fasten seatbelt sign popping up above him as he sat back down, a captain coming over the intercom, ‚ÄúSorry folks, we are going to be hitting unexpected turbulence.  Please fasten your seatbelts for your safety until we turn off the light‚Äù. Dave braced himself on the engine and rim of the boat, waiting for whatever was to come next. 

The vibration and hum chattered his teeth. Dave clamped down hard trying to prevent his jaw from moving. Off to the right of Dave, a dim blue-gray glow could now be seen emanating from where the original batch of bubbles had sprung up earlier. At first, it was about the size of a small dinner plate, but as it grew brighter it also started expanding. The water slowly stopped bubbling and was now steadily churning as the surface tension of the water kept breaking repeatedly as if a submarine were rising from the depths. The noise from the bubbles was replaced with a low-toned hum that resonated with both the boat and Dave‚Äôs tense body. The slow-growing blue light was now the size of a large transit van, the hum so loud it began to blur Dave‚Äôs vision, making his eyes water.  With morbid curiosity and fear, Dave leaned over the side of the beat. Squinting hard Dave had a hard time discerning what was now only 10-15 feet below the water‚Äôs surface. The confusion was not only due to his blurring vision but also because what he saw made no sense. 

Large Interlaced silver rings spun below the boat. Multiple rings rotated counterclockwise and clockwise independently at a slow gentle speed. Inside of the rings appeared to be a cube-- no, a sphere *within* a cube, that was glowing with a bright blue light. Dave could not tell, but the rings seemed to have something etched along the outside of the bands, something not in any language he knew.  The low-toned hum seemed to be emitting directly from this object that lay below the boat. 

At the outer edges of the blue light that emanated from the sphere, Dave saw what had to be a large fish moving in and out of the edges of the light. Dave leaned further, his face catching licks of the roiling water, and tried to focus his vision as best he could. A large silhouette was cast in the glow of the object. The shape of the dark silhouette looked more humanoid than fish-like, although it had tendencies of both. Its elongated appendices jutting out from its unmoving body, bobbed in and out of the glow as they moved with the current. Dave could swear whatever this thing was, it could see him. He saw no eyes or face, but he **knew** it could see him. This was not a fish moving in and out of the light, but a person with impossibly long arms and legs. The head of the being did not look like a single head but something larger, the silhouette was dark, but he could swear the large oval-shaped head was staring directly at him.  Dave was frozen, staring at the creature in horror and amazement.  He tried pulling his head away, but his body was no longer obeying his mind.  A new noise had popped up, something coming from what seemed to be the creature. A loud moan was being broadcasted directly into his head, along with the hum from the object. The moan pitched up and down continuously sounding ancient and guttural. The moan seemed undecipherable, but in Dave's mind, a small phrase began to repeat. 
‚ÄúWE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME‚Äù
Dave could not move his fixated gaze but could open his mouth to scream. His eyes now streaming with blood as he was forced to stare at the horror below.  

Without notice, a beam of light shot up from the rings and hit the left half of his face. The intense burning sensation slapped him from his gaze. The sudden jolt of pain seemed to grant his freedom of movement. Quickly reeling back from the scene below, he reflexively brought his hands up to his face, throwing him off balance.  Stepping back to catch his weight, his brown boot caught on the stacked crab pots. Dave started to careen down toward the edge of the boat, thinking for one second that he might be heading toward the dark water. Instead, his head clipped the side of the boat, knocking Dave unconscious and strewn beside the crab pots. 


It was dark when Dave came too. The feeling of opening his eyes to complete and utter darkness disoriented him, but his vision slowly began to adjust.  
*Had he dreamt of the events?* 
That thought slowly started to fade as he felt his face and recoiled from the touch. He was badly burnt. On top of that, he seemed to have limited vision out of his left eye. He stuck out his hands in front of him, closing his right eye he could barely make out the digits extending from both hands. The eye ached, but not as bad as his head and face.

A new thought came to him, *was he closer to shore or had he moved farther out?*  Pondering this, he sat up. 

He couldn‚Äôt tell from his surroundings; it was too dark to see the shore. He knew his better half had to have called the Coast Guard by now, but if they were looking for him, they weren‚Äôt looking in the right spot.  No lights shined on the horizon, no helicopter blades whirred, no boat engines rang in the distance. The only noise he could hear was a faint low-pitched hum. 

What *was* prominent to his dazed senses was an awful smell, the salmon from earlier that morning. Stomach turning, half from the odor, and half from the concussion he most certainly had; he threw the whole bucket into the water, which seemed to swallow up the worst of the smell. 

He dragged himself onto the bench seat rubbing his temple, avoiding the burn covering his face. 
*What was he to do now? Sit and wait?*
Dave was not too fond of that idea, but he almost certainly would be forced to do it. He scanned the horizon again, looking into the air for a helicopter, a plane, or anything at all. Would they be looking at night? He didn‚Äôt know. Dave couldn‚Äôt even see the stars that night due to the morning overcast persisting through the day and now into the night. 

Dave turned his focus to the low subtle hum that seemed to be a faint version of the hum he had heard earlier that morning. It no longer seemed to be emitting from the water below him. The surface lay almost perfectly still in the cool night, vastly different from this morning. The faint hum seemed to be coming from above him. Dave looked straight up. Squinting, he could barely make out the twisting of rings some 50 feet above. A frog caught in Dave‚Äôs throat and an involuntary whimper tried to escape his lips. 

Dave remembered now; *we have come*. He stood to his feet. 

‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù Dave shouted, ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù. Dave was no longer scared; he was mad dog angry. If he was to die, he would not die a coward. ‚ÄúYOU PIECE OF SHIT, WHA-‚Äù. 

Blue light began to glow from the object above.  The low-pitched hum exploded now, almost as loud as it had been before. The blue light formed into a circle, then slowly started to funnel down to the boat below. 

Dave froze, tensing up. He pictured the creature silhouetted in the dark water from earlier. The long arms and legs extended out from the dark shadow that looked up from the depths. Dave‚Äôs eyes shot down to the boat, scanning the items he brought along that day. He needed a weapon.

The funnel of light halfway down now, he scrambled around on his hands and knees, frantically looking for what he always brought with him. His hands found the small pouch tucked under the bench seat closest to the stern.  Ripping it open, he brought out a small pocketknife used for cutting line or small rope. Not the most ideal weapon, but it would do. He stood back up looking into the light. 

The light was almost touching his head, Daves courage began to wane. He shrank from the light almost touching his face. Feeling desperate, in a last-ditch effort, Dave decided to do the unthinkable, he dove off the edge of the boat. 

Dave closed his eyes waiting to meet the embrace of ice-cold water, but it had not come. He slowly opened his eyes; the blue light now fully enveloped him. He was staring down at the boat. His body was not moving toward the water but moving slowly up and away. He spotted the pocketknife he had pulled out laying useless in the shrinking boat below.

 A loud moan began filling his ears, pitching up and down, mixing in with the low-pitched hum. Dave hysterically screamed out, ‚ÄúPLEASE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?! GOD WHAT DO YOU WANT?!‚Äù

The loud moan projected a phrase into Dave‚Äôs mind as it had done before, and this time, he heard a voice along with the phrase. A loud guttural moan bellowed into not only his mind but his whole body. 

**‚ÄúYOU‚Äù**

The light blinked out; the low-pitched hum was gone. 

Dave was gone. 

Radar sat idly on still water. A slight breeze now swaying the boat ever so slightly. The sun began to crest the horizon as the early morning dawn filled with the first rays of light.  The horizon slowly transitioned from darkness to a soft shade of blue. In the distance, the faint sound of a helicopter‚Äôs blade whirred.",1,1729194811.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

# My Personal Case Study as a MAILPAL Beta Tester

As a beta tester for MAILPAL, I had the opportunity to put this platform through its paces, and I've got to say, I was blown away by the results.

Before MAILPAL, I was struggling with my email marketing efforts. My open rates were hovering around 15%, and my click-through rates were a dismal 2%. I was spending hours crafting emails that seemed to disappear into the void of cyberspace.

Enter MAILPAL. Within the first week of using the platform, I saw my open rates jump to 45%. By the end of the month, I was consistently seeing open rates above 60%, with some campaigns hitting the 80% mark.

But the real game-changer was the click-through rates. They skyrocketed to an average of 12%, with some emails seeing rates as high as 20%. This translated directly into increased sales for my e-commerce store.

One particular campaign stands out. I used MAILPAL to create a three-day promotional sequence for a new product launch. The results were staggering:

* Day 1 Email: 82% open rate, 18% click-through rate
* Day 2 Email: 79% open rate, 22% click-through rate
* Day 3 Email (Final Call): 85% open rate, 25% click-through rate

This campaign alone generated over $15,000 in sales - more than triple what I'd seen from previous launches using other email platforms.

But it wasn't just the numbers that impressed me. The ease of use was a revelation. I was able to set up complex automation sequences in minutes, something that used to take me hours.

The drag-and-drop builder made creating beautiful, responsive emails a breeze, even for someone like me who's design-challenged. And the detailed analytics helped me fine-tune my campaigns for even better results.

As a beta tester, I can confidently say that MAILPAL lives up to its promises. It's not just an incremental improvement on existing email marketing tools - it's a quantum leap forward.

My mother warned me that it might be illegal to breastfeed in public (spoiler: it very much not), and I was really worried at first about what people might say. Only two months in and my attitude has changed fo ""bodies are just bodies, and babies need to eat). And guess what? The response has been overwhelming positive or neutral. I've only received stinkeye from a middle schooler. 

Today I was nursing baby in my car before we went into the grocery store and had my legs hanging out because my car is comically small. A few minutes in the owner of the car next to me came up to get in her own car, and I tried to scrunch in and make more room for her. 
She said ""no, no, don't disturb the baby! Oh, how beautiful, this is the best thing I could see today!"" Amd then she got in her car and left, smiling. I was really touched by how sweet she was.

1g5zlv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5zlv0,"I tried 8 Miim.Miic Roll-on perfumes, and I am in Gourmand heaven!","Hello! Fellow Perfume Lovers,

This is a brand that I was unaware of until now. Glad I got to try these 2 discovery sets (4 roller perfumes per set). 

Here's my opinion on each of them. Apologies for the awkward photos - my husband was traveling to USA for work and he stopped at T J Maxx where he found these and took pictures in a hurry LOL

1) No. 31 Woody Vanilla Cocoa: inspired by Billy Eilish Eilish. This smells like sweet vanilla, mild berries and cocoa butter. Ranking 8/8

2) No. 32 Warm Gourmand: inspired by Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62. A warm sensual sweet and slightly powdery scent. Ranking 5/8

3) No. 49 Gourmand Floral: inspired by Killian Love Don't be Shy. Sweet pillowy floral amber. Ranking 3/8

4) No. 52 Sweet Strawberry Milk: inspired by Melanie Martinez Crybaby. Sweet cinnamon vanilla (could hardly detect the strawberry notes). Ranking 7/8

5) No. 57 Pistachio Tonka Woods: inspired by Kayali Pistachio Yum Gelato. Creamy airy raw pistachio vanilla. Most comparable to the inspiration and to Paris Corner Khair Pistachio (also a dupe which I have). Ranking 1/8

6) No. 76 Spicy Amber Vanilla: inspired by YSL Black Opium. Coffee citrus vanilla sweet. Also quite comparable to the inspiration. Ranking 2/8

7) No. 79 Cherry Vanilla Wood: inspired by Tom Ford Lost Cherry. Mild cherry rose musky slightly powdery. Ranking 6/8

8) No. 99 Amber Floral Wood: inspired by MFK BR540. Dense floral saffron sweet. Very similar to the inspiration and to Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Rouge (yet another dupe which I have). Ranking 4/8

Overall thoughts:

Pros:
1) Miim.Miic has truly nailed it with ""mimicking the original perfumes (I'm sorry but I just had to plug that in somewhere in this write-up, haha!). Though I haven't tried most of the inspirations, reviews online suggest strong resemblance. 

2) A nice variety to try for Gourmand newbies and lovers alike.

3) Makes for a great gift.

4) Lasts longer on fabric.

Cons:
1) While I absolutely love each and every one of these perfumes, I feel Miim.Miic has bleak lasting power on skin.

2) The vial packaging could be improved. 4 out of 8 had leaked slightly by the time they reached from their long journey. I reckon they may not be practical to travel with. 

I would love to know from others who have tried this brand - what was your experience? Have you tried these roller perfumes or the sprayers? Any other variants you would recommend?

Also, if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them for you.

I've been taking Zepbound since June, and have lost 40lbs so far. I've been taking things pretty slow, so I'm still on 0.5ML. I've had no side effects from the previous dose or this current dose. I love black coffee, and have had no problems drinking it all this time. However, I recently had an incident where I walked into a coffe shop to pick up my coffee, and the smell of it made me feel weird. I basically had to run back to my apartment and puke, which is weird because I don't even remember the last time I've puked. Probably years ago. 

I thought this was an isolated incident, but I've been noticing that every time I drink black coffee now, I don't feel quite right. It's not helping me wake up, and it's more of an inconvenience now because it makes me feel ill for a bit. I'm bringing this up to my doctor, of course, but I'm curious if anyone else has had problems drinking caffeine on this medication?. I also recently had dental surgery and had to take a bunch of antibiotics that I assume ruined my gut bacteria, so I wonder if it's probably that. In that case, if anyone has had to be on a round of antibiotics, did you feel like your stomach needed some time to adjust back to normal?

I also hope this kind of opinion posts like ""I like this better than that"" are allowed.

You may ask as a first question - One is a predominantly CHOCOLATE dish with hints of COFFEE, and the other is a predominantly COFFEE dish with hints of CHOCOLATE, how can you even compare it? But since both desserts contain both CHOCOLATE and COFFEE, I'm going to allow myself.

First of all, Tiramisu feels too overly creamy that it feels heavy to me. That's the only problem, because the flavour of it is very good (the same reason why I don't quite like the texture. Chokladbollar does feel a little bit heavy, but also has a more interesting texture (Somewhat soft, Somewhat crumbly/grainy, Somewhat dense and chewy but also if you roll it with coconut flakes or pearl sugar it can have that crispy layer to it). Therefore it leads to this opinion. And I posted here because of the assumption that a lot of people like Tiramisu.

As boba gets more popular around the world I find myself thinking back to that little tea shop and I can remember the flavor clearly but I have no idea if thats a type of tea they just gave a weird name or if it was a specialty of the store that no one else is making.

1g5zc1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1g5zc1v/hardrock_100_my_dream_race/,Hardrock 100: My Dream Race,"> *""I can do hard things."" ‚ÄîMs. Rachel* 

Around 1pm on December 2, the messages started to roll in:

>""Yeah brother!!!! Hardrock!!!!""

>""Waitlist for Hardrock! Yeah brother!! Hope you get in!!""

>""7!!!!""

I had been selected seventh in the Men's Never waitlist for the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run. THE Hardrock. The big granddaddy of US mountain runs. My singular running goal for almost a decade. I had heard about Hardrock back when I started running in 2012, worked my way up to finishing a qualifying race in 2016, and started applying for the lottery immediately. I had been ""lucky"" to get selected so quickly.

Seventh was an exciting but awkward spot on the waitlist. Low enough that I wasn't guaranteed to get into the run, but high enough that I would have to train. Hard.

Like the name suggests, Hardrock is one of the most difficult 100 milers in the world. Starting in the old mining town of Silverton, the course makes a single massive loop through the heart of Colorado's rugged San Juan Mountains, crossing multiple 13,000 foot passes and summitting a 14er. The average elevation is over 11,000 feet. The run is an homage to the hard rock miners who built many of the trails and jeep roads to extract precious metals from these brutal, gorgeous mountains.

##**Training**

(This section is unlikely to be interesting to most people. You should probably skip it. The actual race report is down below.)

My training volume has been hit and miss over the years, but I was determined not to show up to Silverton unprepared. The only minor, teensy complication was that, for the first time in my life I would be balancing 100 miler training with fatherhood. Yes, it turns out that my first official race after the birth of my daughter Emily would also be the most personally meaningful race I had ever run. No pressure!

Okay, there was a secondary complication if I'm being honest: How do you train for a race that you might not actually run? The answer to that ended up being straightforward. I would simply gaslight myself into believing that it was a 100 percent guarantee. And if I ended up not running it, I could deal with the emotional fallout later. What could go wrong?

As for the actual nuts and bolts of training, I no longer had the time for 8-10 hour meandering long runs every Saturday. I needed to be strategic. The first order of business was to lose some of my ""dad bod"" weight, which meant cutting out my morning bagel and evening beer(s) during the week. I dropped from 175ish pounds to about 160 before race day.

I also adopted the unholy trinity of aging ultrarunners: stretching, strength training, and cross training. I despise every one of those things, but I could feel the benefits almost immediately in my runs, so I stuck with it. My hip bursitis, IT band pain, sciatica, and various other old-person ailments gradually improved even as I ramped up my mileage. I suppose I should have started doing all of this stuff years ago.

Instead of making the long drive to the Catskills, Adirondacks, or Whites to find sustained climbs on the weekends, I spent my lunch breaks on an incline treadmill set to 20%, knocking out 3,000-5,000 foot workouts while watching Hardrock videos on YouTube. Saturday's long runs generally started around 4 or 5am so I could be back at home for Emily's breakfast. Occasionally I would run a second time during her morning nap or in the evening when she went to bed. I did manage to sneak away for my annual Everesting attempt in March and a Cactus to Clouds run in May, which both gave me confidence in my training.

My peak weeks were a respectable 60mi/20k', 61mi/20k', 46mi/20k'. By the time we got to Colorado, I had logged 350,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain in the past six months.

Now I just had to get into the dang thing.

##**The moment of truth... or is it?**

We landed in Denver still not knowing whether I was going to run Hardrock or not. I had gradually moved up to first on the waitlist, but time was running out. Flights, hotels, and a sprinter van had all been booked months in advance, and my crew/pacer dream team had made plans to travel out too. We collectively held our breaths waiting for some movement on the list.

In the meantime, Alex, Em, and I had some vacationing to do. My top priority was to get Emily to the summit of a 14er. I was halfway up Quandary Peak with a sleeping baby on my back when Alex stopped to answer a work email. I figured I'd take my phone off airplane mode to check my emails too, only to see a voicemail from an unknown number.

>Voicemail: Hi Ryan. Dale Garland, Hardrock Endurance Run. When you get this message, if you would, please give me a call. Thanks!  
>Alex: Call him back! Call him back right now!!""

I dialed back.

>Me: Hi Dale, this is Ryan Thorpe returning your call.  
>Dale: Hey, Ryan. Where are you right now?  
>Me: I'm on the side of Quandary Peak.  
>Dale: That seems like driving distance to Silverton.  
>Me: That was the idea.  
>Dale: Well, I have a bib with your name on it if you're interested.  
>Me: I would be happy to take that off your hands.

With my limited reception, I formally accepted my invitation on Ultrasignup and paid the registration fee right then and there. Then Emily summited her first 14er. Also, we saw mountain goats. It was an exciting day all around.

I posted the good news to social media, and almost immediately got a flurry of congratulatory messages and a few asking if I had taken Zach Miller's spot. Unbeknownst to me, he had just announced that he'd had an emergency appendectomy and didn't know if he could recover in time to run.

This ended up causing a bit of drama for me (yes, I'm going to make Zach's appendectomy about me for a moment; bear with me), because a few days later he announced that his doctor had cleared him to run. If I had Zach's spot, was there a possibility that Dale would now rescind my entry? The Hardrock Instagram page had posted a picture of me and then immediately deleted it. Plus, the lottery webpage still showed me on the waitlist. Was this all a big mistake? I was mostly sure that the organizers would honor my entry, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that I was going to go home empty handed. Between these thoughts and the lingering headache that I always get for the first few days at altitude, I became a sullen, miserable prick in the week leading up to Hardrock. Sorry Alex and Em!

Finally, the day of the runner check in came, and I got my number. My mindset immediately flipped from the anxiety of ""Oh shit, I'm not running Hardrock"" to the anxiety of ""Oh shitfuckshit, I'm running Hardrock!"" I calmed my nerves by buying every piece of Hardrock swag available at their expo. I also made it my mission to introduce Emily to all of the most badass women we could find: Courtney Dauwalter, Anna Frost, Maggie Guterl, Stephanie Case, and Tara Warren. Pro tip: If you're too nervous to talk to famous people, just tell them your adorable baby girl wants to meet them.

##**Cruising with Legends (miles 0-11)**

By the time I made it to the starting corral, I was positively vibrating with excitement. This was it: my dream race. Not only that, but I had my wife Alex, my daughter Emily, and some of my best friends (Jess, Boy Alex, and Virginia) there to crew and pace. The dream team for my dream race!

Despite all the adrenaline, I started at my usual conservative pace. So conservative, in fact, that before we had even left the town of Silverton I was the very last runner. Given the amount of older Hardrock veterans at the start, I was a little surprised not to see anyone else walking, but I wasn't overly concerned. Back in 2019 I started the Ouray 100 in last place and worked my way up to 19th by the finish. Let's see how many people I could pass today!

It didn't take long before I caught up to a small pack of runners. I immediately recognized one of them as YouTuber and prolific race director Jamil Coury, who once ran a 29 hour Hardrock in his younger days but had shown up undertrained this year. A few minutes later, 17-time Hardrock finisher Chris Twiggs came charging out of the bushes, explaining simply, ""I had to take a massive shit."" I had found the right crowd to run with. I also spent a few minutes running with American Ultrarunning Hall of Famer Pam Reed, who would tell me jokingly afterwards that I wasn't breathing nearly hard enough for a New Jersey runner. Nice to have some validation from a legend!

The pack slowly spread out and Chris and I ended up running as a duo. I took the opportunity to ask his advice about pacing, nutrition, which sections to carry extra water, etc. Normally this is the kind of stuff I would figure out weeks before a race, but I'd had sort of a mental block about studying the Hardrock course ahead of time. I think this was my small way of protecting myself against the potential disappointment of not getting in. Chris was a wealth of knowledge and was thrilled to have someone to share it all with. We reached the first aid station together quite a bit behind the splits I had given my crew, but I was feeling great and soaking in the experience.

At the pre-run briefing, Dale had described Hardrock as a ""culinary tour of the San Juans,"" explaining that each aid station prides itself on cooking gourmet food. I am typically pretty good at eating during races (and outside of races), and in that moment I decided that I was going to get my money's worth at every opportunity. In my three minute stop at KT, I consumed a full Denny's breakfast worth of bacon and pancakes.

##**Views for Days... Literally (miles 11-28)**

The next section was the crown jewel of Hardrock: Grant Swamp Pass. Despite the name, this might be the most beautiful place in the world. A remote mountain pass with Island Lake on one side and a sweeping view of the San Joaquin ridge on the other. The top of the pass is guarded on both sides by unrelentingly steep scree.

The climb up took a bit of effort, but I was too distracted by the scenery to care. I passed the Joel Zucker memorial at the top and placed a rock on it. It's impossible to convey the severity of the terrain on the descent from the pass, [so instead I'll just link an old video of world class mountain runners struggling to stay upright on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qsrSsPRns).

I managed to mostly stay upright through this section through an extensive application of upper body movement. That is to say, I flailed my arms wildly as my feet turned over at a thousand steps per minute. I reached the bottom with some scraped palms, both shoes full of debris, and a big stupid grin on my face. I sat down to empty my shoes and recognized Jenny Capel from the briefing. She had applied for ten years before getting in and had been recognized by the race director for her tenacity.

""Was that descent worth the wait?"" I inquired.  
""Fuck no."" was the response.

She would go on to finish, hopefully enjoying the remaining sections a bit more than that one.

I cruised into Chapman aid station in 115th place, having passed thirty people in the first 18 miles. I had told my crew not to make the rugged drive to this aid station, but I was instead greeted by my NY/NJ running friends Elaine, Tiffany, Devang, and Nobu, who had come out to crew for two more of my NY/NJ friends Stephen and Jun. They helped refill my bottles and got me back on the trail after just four minutes. Another lightning quick stop! Stephen and Jun were just ahead, and I hoped I could catch them and spend some time together.

The climb up Oscar's Pass is kind of an early crux of the race. Fully exposed to the afternoon sun and rising almost 3,000 feet in 2.4 miles, it can be a demoralizing climb. On the bright side, like the rest of the course it's breathtakingly beautiful. I passed the time by talking to a Utah-based runner named David Fuller, who would pass me on all the climbs, and whom I would pass back on every descent for the next 30+ hours. Just before the top of the pass, I caught Jun and we chatted for a few minutes. He was moving well but the altitude seemed to be taking its toll on him. He would end up having stomach issues but pushing through for his first Hardrock finish in 46 hours.

The descent into Telluride began as a talus slope but gradually transformed into flowy singletrack. I soaked in the extra oxygen as I dropped below 10,000' for the first time in many hours. I was still riding the high of running THE HARDROCK, I could hear the music thumping, and I was about to see my wife and daughter for the first time since the start. I could barely contain my emotions as I ran into the aid station, now in 89th place.

In my memory, Telluride was a long stop because I scarfed down a burrito, two slices of brisket, and a bunch of watermelon, I changed my socks, and my crew refilled my bottles while I told them about seeing Jun. In reality, all of this happened in just seven minutes. A far cry from Ludovic Pommeret's insane one minute turnaround but still respectable for a mid-pack runner.

I planted a big sweaty kiss on Alex and Emily and I was on my way again.

##**A Quick Stop at Kroger's for Snacks and Tequila (miles 28-44)**

The Kroger's Canteen aid station is the stuff of legends. Perched precariously at the top of the 13,000' Virginius Pass within a gap in the rocks that's barely bigger than a dining room table, Kroger's is staffed by the hardiest volunteers you'll ever meet. Alex and I had tried to hike to it a few weeks before the 2017 Hardrock but got turned around by deep snow. I was looking forward to finally reaching this mythical place.

All I had to do was climb 4,400 feet to get there.

The initial climb out of Telluride was uninspiring, rising steeply up dusty dirt roads as the afternoon sun bore down on us. Vandals had removed a few course markings, and I briefly followed another runner off course before checking my map and correcting our mistake. I heard rumbling in the distance and wondered if we would get a thunderstorm.

Hardrock is held in July as a compromise between allowing the snow to melt off the trails and avoiding the peak of the summer monsoon season. At the Ouray 100 in 2019, a bad thunderstorm had derailed my race. I had not carried enough spare clothing then, and perhaps as an overreaction to that trauma, I was now carrying enough gear to waterproof myself from head to toe. I was thankful for this decision as I imagined myself getting pummeled by a hail storm at 13,000'. Luckily, this was all a moot point as the storm passed harmlessly in the distance, dissipating the afternoon heat nicely in the process.

I finally caught up to my friend Stephen England later in the climb. A type-1 diabetic, he has finished some of the hardest races in the world, making it clear that his disease doesn't limit him whatsoever. His blood sugar was a bit low and he sipped on a Dole fruit cup as he hiked up the steep slope.

I called out ""Hey, it's Stephen America,"" which is our little inside joke that only I find funny.

Once again it was great to run into an east coast friend in the middle of the Colorado wilderness. Unfortunately our pace didn't quite match up and I had a date to attend up at 13,000' so I wished him well and continued on my way. He would end up finishing in 41 hours after a spectacular rally (aka project Saturday).

As the trail snaked its way around Mendota Peak on an ancient mining trail, I scanned the craggy ridge above me looking for a gap where it would be possible to wedge an aid station. I couldn't imagine where you could fit anything useful in this jumble of rocks, but suddenly I heard cheering. Directly above me was Kroger's Canteen.

""You're almost there!"" someone called out.

I held up a finger and responded ""Be with you in a moment,"" before snapping a picture of them.

Then I made the final scramble up to the aid station. It was getting chilly out, so I requested the hottest, saltiest food they could procure. Within seconds I received a handful of wonderfully crispy pan fried pierogis. It's also tradition to have a bit of tequila at Kroger's, so I asked for half a shot. I didn't see the drink being poured, but I heard a *glug glug glug* followed by a volunteer saying ""Whoa, that's a big half shot!""

Welp. Tradition is tradition, and maybe a little ethanol would give me the courage I needed for the vertical mile of descent into Ouray. Down the hatch!

I thanked the volunteers profusely and set to work on the first pitch of the descent. Like Grant Swamp Pass, this section was utter silliness: nearly vertical scree and snow at 13,000'. This kind of terrain has no business being part of a 100 miler, and that's exactly what makes the Hardrock course so special. I attempted a standing glissade down the wall of snow and immediately slipped onto my butt, sliding down the remaining section while burping up smoky mezcal.

I sat for a moment to empty snow and rocks from my shoes before realizing that I had nearly another mile of this kind of terrain ahead of me. I alternated between red-lining down impossibly steep, concrete-hard rock slides, resting on any stable rock, and then plunging downhill again. The terrain was like something straight out of Frozen Snot, but at altitude and with 32 miles on my legs. Insanity. Pure, wonderful, insanity!

After the initial chaos, the course turned onto Camp Bird Road, which is a nicely groomed dirt road. This is the most runnable section of the Hardrock course, but I resisted pushing the pace to make sure I didn't blow my quads too early. A string of 11-12 minute miles had me in the town of Ouray in 75th place with 15 hours elapsed.

##**The Long Dark Night (miles 44-58)**

I shuffled into Ouray just as the last bit of sunlight faded over the horizon. I was confident that I had paced myself well in the early miles and I was excited to have friends to run with for the remainder of the race. 

Fellow east coaster John Kemp was volunteering at Ouray and shuttled food from the aid station grill to my mouth like a mama bird. The culinary tour of the San Juans raged on as I devoured more brisket, a cheeseburger, an ice pop, and a Coke. Somehow I also managed to change my socks again, and I still made it out in eight minutes, now with my trusty training partner Jess keeping me company.

One vital omission from my feeding frenzy in Ouray was a coffee or an energy drink. I hadn't anticipated feeling sleepy at just 8pm, but a week of living in a Sprinter van with an 11 month old had left me severely sleep deprived going into the race. Jess - like all good pacers - is a prolific talker, and we often chat for the entirety of our training runs. But within a couple miles I found myself unable to muster the energy to respond to her. Despite her efforts (and despite being on the most dangerous section of the course), I was fading.

I grunted occasional responses as Jess did her best to keep my mind going with hypothetical questions like, ""If you could watch a concert by any three bands from history, who would you pick and what order would they perform?""

At the remote Engineer aid station, I asked for a coffee and a cup of ramen. I gulped them down like I was doing shots at a college bar and then realized that I was getting very cold very quickly. I put on every layer I had with me and called out ""See you later, Jess!"" I heard a squawk from her as she realized I was already leaving when she had only just gotten her own cup of Ramen. Luckily it only took a moment for her to catch up to me, and we were back to doing our 30min/mi march up to Engineer Pass.

The pass was marked by a blinking red light which was visible for an annoyingly long time. Climbing in the pitch black it was impossible to discern any progress toward that little blinky bastard. After an eternity, we finally made it to the top. I vaguely recall telling the light to go fuck itself, but that might have only happened in my mind.

The descent from the pass was on a relatively easy road but I couldn't find the will to run. We walked into the Animas Forks aid and I plopped down into a chair and announced to my crew that I would be taking a five minute nap. They bundled me in as many layers as they could find and set a timer. Despite my struggles, I had still moved up a few spots and now sat exactly in the middle of the pack at 70th place.

Usually I wake up from these cat naps feeling rejuvenated, but I couldn't get my mind to turn off and instead I just listened to the commotion in the aid station. Nevertheless, when the timer went off, I put my shoes back on and headed back onto the trail with Boy Alex.

##**The Lowest Point at the Highest Point (miles 58-93)**

>*""It‚Äôs gon‚Äô be some work, you should pack a lunch for it"" ‚ÄîProf*

Because of a road closure, my pacers would not be able to switch at Sherman like we had originally planned. This meant that Boy Alex would be pacing me from Animas Forks all the way to Cunningham Gulch, a 35 mile section with about 10,000 feet of climbing. Essentially he was doing a third of Hardrock while having to take care of a cranky baby. But Alex and I have shared a ton of miles on the trails together over the years, and living in the Wasatch he knows how to take care of himself and others in the mountains.

At 14,058', Handies Peak is the high point of the course. It is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, but the old saying holds true: there are no easy 14ers. That was particularly true after 22 hours of running at altitude. The sleep monster and the altitude monster teamed up on me big time here. When all was said and done, it took me three hours to cover the five miles to the summit. Thankfully, we were greeted by a beautiful sunrise. [And even better, someone from Mountain Outpost was there to film it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v77j9mAuHpE), so I have been able to appreciate the beauty of this section in retrospect.

The descent was milder than some of the previous ones, but I was wobbly on my feet from the sleep deprivation. I kept tripping and slipping on the loose rocks, until finally in a fit of despair I threw myself to the ground and rage napped. Alex was a few minutes behind me, having stopped for a bathroom break. I thankfully heard him coming and gave a little wave to make sure he didn't pass by my corpse.

After another five minute snooze, we continued our trek to the Burrows backcountry aid for a quick stop, and then a short jog into the larger Sherman aid station. Once again, despite ten minutes of napping and probably an hour of time lost to inefficient shambling, I had moved up to 53rd place. That fact really underscores how difficult the night can be in a mountain race.

Usually I come into each aid station with a plan, but I was so deliriously tired that I spent minutes just wandering around searching for something that would get me going again. I have a distant, cloudy memory of eating a breakfast burrito. That was probably tasty, I guess. I think I also chugged coffee. As a new father, I easily go through half a pot of coffee on a normal day, and that caffeine tolerance means I need to consume a positively stupid amount to stay alert during races. I distinctly remember that Elaine, Tiffany, and Devang all made the white-knuckle drive over Cinnamon Pass to see everyone at Sherman, and it was great to have some friends for support at a moment when my brain felt like a bowl of pudding.

Anyway, someone or something must have convinced me to get back onto the trail, and I found myself wandering up the gentle climb to Cataract Lake. I recall Alex saying how beautiful and unexpected the lush forest was here, but I didn't have enough mental bandwidth to give a shit. Above tree line the scenery got even better, and somewhere in here Alex wandered off trail and [captured this video of me](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9zzdqFv052/).

This is another one of those moments that I'm grateful to have a recording to look back on, because at the time I wasn't able to appreciate how stunning the landscape was.

My mind started to come back online here, but the terrain made it difficult to get into a rhythm. The trail was narrow, rutted, and constantly crisscrossed Pole Creek. Rather than attempt to run, I just tried to maintain a fast power hike, which seemed to work well. However, it was becoming clear on the climbs that my lungs were shredded from thirty hours of running at altitude. Each deep breath resulted in a small coughing fit, and I was unable to generate any power despite my legs still feeling strong. I drowned out the noise of my own wheezing by blasting my rap playlist straight from my phone speakers. My apologies to any marmots who don't like Run the Jewels.

The last climb up and over Green Mountain was hilariously steep over cross country terrain. We were coming to the end of Alex's gargantuan pacing section. With a final 1,600' descent in just over a mile, we arrived at Cunningham Gulch, mile 93. I gave Alex a big hug, kissed my Alex and Emily, grabbed some snacks from the aid station, and headed out with Jess for the final nine miles.

##**The Home Stretch (miles 93-102)**

I had originally told the crew that 36 hours might be possible if I had a perfect race. I arrived at this estimate based on my 35:27 finish at TWOT, which is supposedly similar in difficulty to Hardrock. With 36:22 elapsed and time being linear, this goal appeared to be unlikely. I had also mentioned that anything under 40 hours would be pretty satisfying, but that the bottom line was to carry Emily through the finisher chute and kiss the rock. This mental image had been propelling me since the start of the race.

But still, the allure of 40 hours was strong. That gave us 3:38 to go the last nine miles: two miles straight up Little Giant Pass and seven miles downhill to the finish. On paper that sounds reasonable, but my lungs were staging a full scale rebellion. I was breathing so frantically on the climb that Jess turned around multiple times to ask if I was ok.

""Yeah, that's just what my lungs do now,"" I responded.

I had made the wise decision before the race not to have my watch display mile splits. If it had, I would have seen a split of 65 minutes for the first mile of the climb. Granted, that mile had 1,200 feet of ascent, but I believe it to be my slowest ever in a race. Mile two was a significant improvement at just 59 minutes. Dang. Speedy.

We reached the top just in time for sunset. Jess asked if I wanted to stop for a picture and I flipped her the double bird and sprinted away. Or according to her recollection, I sort of grunted with ennui and kept walking. It's unknowable which one of us is remembering this correctly.

That left us with 1:35ish for the last seven miles. Not terrible. We just had to average 13-14 minutes per mile on some relatively mild downhill trails, if I was remembering this section correctly. I've certainly run faster than that on the final descent of other races.

What I hadn't remembered from hiking this section many years ago, was that the first mile was more loose scree.

""Wow this section is pretty tough, Je-oof!"" I said as my feet slid out from under me.

I heard a yelp from behind me and saw Jess also sitting on the trail in a dust cloud. Folks, only the best pacers will time their falls to coincide with yours. It's called teamwork.

That first mile ended up being 19 minutes, which really ate into our cushion. As the terrain got better, Jess ran ahead and started pushing the pace, finding the best line through the rutted Jeep roads. I willed my quads to absorb each downhill step, audibly panting with each breath.

""Stay with me, Ryan. We can do 40 hours,"" she would call back every few minutes.  
""I'm fuckin' trying, brah."" is what I would have said if my lungs were still capable of speaking.

We picked up the pace: 14 minute mile, 13:12, 13:17. This was gonna be close. We hit a rolling section next to the Animas River and I forced myself to run every step through every creek crossing and every diabolical little uphill.

""Shitgoddamnitwhatthefuck?!"" Jess yelled as we reached yet another short steep climb and were forced to walk.

With a mile to go, Jess turned to me and said, ""We have seven minutes to do this. Do you want to go for it?""

And while yeah, it would have been cool to say that I closed out Hardrock with a 6:59 mile and finished under 40 hours, what I wanted more than that was to calmly pick up Emily and walk her through the finisher chute of the first ultramarathon that she ever saw Daddy run.

Also, I desperately had to poop and didn't like the idea of finishing with shit-filled shorts.

After I made a quick stop in the woods, we walked the final mile to the center of Silverton, making sure to break into a jog once we were within sight of the finish line crowd.

Then I gently picked up a very sleepy Emily who was wearing a very fuzzy bear suit.

And we kissed the rock.

Final time 40:14:42, 52nd place.

##**Closing Thoughts**

Finishing at 10pm and being dead tired for most of the race meant that I got a surprisingly good night of sleep. Alex nudged me awake around 6am to remind me that the Hardrock depletion mile was starting soon. I really wanted to get the full Hardrock experience so I trudged over to the Silverton track and did my best impression of a real runner. My legs felt surprisingly good, and I was on pace for a 6:40 mile through the first lap until my lungs reminded me that we were still at altitude. Whatever, it was fun.

The awards ceremony was held on the other end of town under gorgeous blue skies. They served an amazing breakfast and I got to spend some time sharing battle stories with Stephen, Jun, and our pacers. Then my crew spent the rest of the day soaking our feet in Animas River and sipping on local beer. It was a perfect way to end the weekend.

When I think back on this race months after the fact, the feeling that comes to mind is an overwhelming sense of gratitude. I can't adequately express how thankful I am for the opportunity to run this race and for the time and effort that my family and friends put into making it happen. Thank you to Alex and Emily for kisses, cheers, moral support, and allowing me to spend way too many hours on the weekends doing hill repeats at the Water Gap. Thanks to Jess and (Boy) Alex for pacing me through some of the toughest terrain I've ever seen and to Virginia for being on Emily duty so my Alex could focus on me at aid stations. And another huge thanks to Dale Garland and the Hardrock community for putting on such a world class event. This was a truly special experience. Congratulations to Stephen, Jun, and all the other new Hardrockers.

Oh and kudos to Emily's new BFF Courtney Dauwalter for breaking her own course record!

With the benefit of some time to reflect, I have accepted that I can have my dream race without running my dream time.

1g5z85a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g5z85a/i_24_m_am_confused_about_letting_go_of_my_gf_23_f/,I (24 M) am confused about letting go of my gf (23 F). What would you do?,"I'll start from the beginning to keep everything as clear as i could. I got a text from this girl in my 3rd year in an undergrad programme. She was my junior and we shared a few subjects. So she introduced herself and asked for my help mainly because i scored the highest in the mid term. Anyhow, i obliged and helped her with a couple assignments. I thought nothing of it at first and assumed that she's just dumb and needs help passing the subject. Up to this point i thought that she had a 2.0 or 2.5. 

We talked on and off for a couple weeks and i kept helping her through assignments and projects. We barely talked for a couple minutes and i was pretty straightforward when helping her each time. In the last few weeks of the semester, the assignments and the projects ended and we stopped talking. 

Every single time she was the one to text me first as i had no reason to contact her. Moreover, i was recovering from a previous relationship and didn't want to get involved with anyone. Anyhow, two weeks go by and i got free from the finals. 

During the semester break as the results were being announced, i got another text from her asking for my score. I told her i got a 4 and she mentioned she got a 3.8. i was pretty surprised as i thought she was dumb but the score did amaze me. Still, i never thought anything of it until she mentioned that i should also text her first a few times and she won't mind.

Here, a few bells started ringing for me and i told her straight up that i wasn't interested in a relationship and we'll develop feelings along the way if we kept talking this much. She agreed with me and said that she's just looking for a friend and isn't interested in me either. After hearing that i relaxed a bit and continued talking.

Every morning she'd text me good morning and she was the last person i talked to before sleeping. Somehow somewhere i got addicted to this good morning text and my day would go on thinking about her if i didn't get this text. Still, i didn't realize it for close to three years as we talked on a daily basis.

She shared everything with me from her personal life to her family issues and whatnot. Somewhere i had a hunch that she was into me as what girl would give you so much of her time without asking. Still, every time i confronted her she confirmed that we're just friends and things will end someday. She said that she just wants some good memories and does realize that nothing lasts forever. 

So, she'd flirt with me sometimes, ask to hangout which i declined always, talk with me late each night. At first everything seemed pretty chill for me as i had no intention of committing. On top of that her reputation wasn't that sparkling. Still, it didn't bother me as i don't judge based on rumors. Anyhow, she told me everything about her and i developed a pretty decent image of her. I also corrected her on a few things and she happily obliged. I also told her about the rumors and she said that she didn't care and cut contact with the friends who were spreading them.

In these three years stuff got pretty shitty for me from financial and family perspective. I didnt realize as She became the only good thing in my day that i looked forward to. I waited for her morning text daily for hours before she woke up. Similarly i made sure to be the last one she talked to before she slept. Sounds pathetic i know but that's how it went.

After spending a few weeks in this state, i realised that it has become an issue. She kept giving me attention and i got addicted. So, i decided to cut her off completely. This was the day before her birthday. She was out with her friends all day and i wasted the whole day waiting for her as i didn't want to ruin her birthday. 

So, the next day i sent her a text that i was no longer comfortable being in contact and i want to end things here even if it is just a friendship. We talked for a couple minutes and she was pretty casual about it. She asked for the reasons and whatnot and i gave a vague explanation before blocking her.

The next few days were the hardest as i stared a hole through my screen waiting for her to text. This hope diminished little by little and i started hanging out with friends to keep my mind distracted. Two weeks go by and its my birthday. I had a hunch that she'd text me. So i waited and the text didnt arrive at 12 am. Still, i wasn't bummed out about it.

However, as the clock struck 12.08, i got her text. She used her aunt's phone to wish me and asked to unblock her for a while. She also said she'd respect my decision if i felt the same way after talking for a bit. So we ended up talking till 7 in the morning. I was brimming with joy and thought that she actually cares.

So, the next few days i talked about her habits that bothered me. She said she understood and she would ask me daily about more things that i remember about her. I was pretty cold to her in these 3 years and never showed a soft corner. So she was surprised that i actually listened to so much of her stories and remembered everything. She'd ask me daily about the things she could improve in herself and i saw her shift. 

I was amazed and surprised about how she's changing just for me. Anyhow i mentioned that our friendship would still end when she gets committed. She got really upset after hearing this for the first time. Then she got offline and apologised the next morning about her outburst. I assumed that she was also interested in me and didn't want to let go. Anyhow, she indirectly mentioned that the thought crossed her mind about us being together.

From this point she also starter to force me to be more open and i talked with her about my personal life for the first time in 3 years. She listened to me rant all day almost. I also enjoyed it greatly. Still, i got scared that i was getting too attached again and didn't want to let go.

So, the next few days i became somewhat rude and frustrated at the fact thinking why can't we be together. A few more days go by and she tells me that she's interested in someone and is planning to meet him. She usually tells me about everything but this was news to me. I didn't know how to react and i got pretty hostile. She said that she was joking and got upset.

Here i realized my mistake and after self pondering for a bit, i admitted to myself that I'm hooked. I accepted that I'm interested in taking things forward and confessed to her the next day. I told her that the only two paths i see are either committing or letting go. I can no longer pretend that i don't have any feelings for her and asked her for an answer.

Now she's a religious girl and she mentioned that she isnt opposed to the idea if her family agrees as well. I thought it was fair and we officially starter our relationship after talking daily for close to 3 years. 

Here i got pretty serious about her and got my shit straight. It took me a couple months to sort my finances and personal matters. I told her about her boundaries as well and explicitly mentioned what i expected of her. I gave her the chance to refute or to decline if she can't cope with my boundaries.  

During this conversation she assured and reassured me. She seemed pretty sensible and i trusted her word 100 percent.

My whole focus at this point was to just get the families involved to seal the deal. Now during this period we got more and more into each other romantically. 

In November last year she asked me to meet with her brother and ask for her hand in marriage. I agreed as her father had died a decade ago. I got my matters straight and went to meet her brother. Before that, i also had my mother call her mother to officiate the intentions.

Things went pretty smoothly up to this point. Her family agreed and i knew i could handle my family easily.

One more thing, we met for the first time in November as well and shared a kiss. From there, we met a couple more times each month until January this year. Things did get somewhat intimate but nothing too serious as both of us agreed to wait until marriage.

Now the complications started as i involved my family. I downloaded insta for the first time in 5 years just to make sure my family wont find anything they could find distasteful on her profile.

One important detail that i forgot to mention is that she starter her masters in September the previous years. She's pretty extroverted and made a project group early on. I told her here that i wasn't comfortable with the idea of her working with boys and she assured me there were none in her group. On top of that, she said that she barely talked in the university group chats and avoided contact out of respect of our relationship. Hearing this only made me fall harder for her. I was amazed that she was being respectful.

Anyhow, move to this year in January i view her Instagram and found a few boys in them. All of them were from her university but i couldn't recognize one. So i asked her pretty casually about her Instagram credentials to sort these things out. I assumed that it wouldn't be an issue cuz we were pretty open with each other. She had told me about every fuckup she did and the main reason i fell for her was that she didn't hide anything. I trusted her completely.

Still, when i asked for her Instagram she said she doesn't know the password and said she'd fix everything herself. So i told her i wanted these guys removed and she removed them. I explicitly asked for this one guy and she said it was her czns friend who also studies in the uni. Moreover she mentioned that she never contacted him or any other guy personally. She also added that the guy was pretty decent and treated her girl nicely to tease me. Anyhow, these details didn't fit right with me but i didn't think about it and respected her privacy.

Move forward to the end of her first semester before feb, and i sent my family to her house. My family wasn't too thrilled about her and suggested that i reconsider. Anyhow, i handled everything and assured them that she's a nice girl and I'm serious about spending my life with her. Took me a week but everything went smoothly.

Fast forward to the end of Feb and she accidentally shared me an ss with a message bubble on top. The message bubble had an inappropriate word and it was from her uni fellow who she said is like a brother. I got furious at the text and she lied about everything. The guy had tageed her in a group message and i asked to see her whole convo. Instead of giving me the conversation she deleted everything and said that it was a bug with her phone.

Now I'm not dumb and i called her out on her bullshit by giving proof how WhatsApp works. She was firm on her story that the messages were deleted automatically and the text was from her friend who was pretending to be a guy to prank him. Nonetheless it devastated me somewhat to even think that my love could lie so easily to me. I got beyond furious and said that even if we were married, issues like these could end in a divorce. This upset her a lot and we stopped talking for a couple days.

A few days go by and she apologized and said that i should give her just one more chance. Still, she stuck to her story that there wasn't a single guy involved and i was overreacting. So i let it go thinking that it was the first and the last offence.

A few days go by and she texts me 8.45 on the dot saying that she's home and then she got offline. I called her a few times but she didn't respond until 11. She said that she was in bed and her phone was charging. Pure bullshit right? Well it is. I knew that her sister had an event the same day and she wanted to go. So i asked her point blank if she was at the event and she denied. No big deal, i wana marry her so i should trust her right?

Two more days go by, she tells me that she has to go to the hospital and tend to her mother. She was unreachable all day. I got upset by 10.30 about her behaviour that she didn't even bother to call once. She got mad at me saying that she's in an emergency and couldn't make the time. 

Still at 10.45, she texts me that she's giving food to her mother and will call me shortly. By some luck my mother comes to me at the same time saying she wants to talk to my gf and her mother to invite them.

So i called her mother's phone asking for her and her mother says that she's not home and is attending a university event. This fucking killed me. Like........ Why lie? Why would she lie? She could've just asked? She could've fought? She could've done a million things. Yet she didn't.

My trust in her shattered and i said a lot of mean things to her and also indirectly told her mother that i don't trust her daughters character.

Everything began to shake for me here. I got sick, anxious, depressed or whatever the fuck. i know i seem like the biggest idiot but what else could i have done. Aren't you supposed to trust your partner and avoid being suspicious?? 

Anyhow the next few weeks were shitty, i told her i had lost my trust and all that. Surprisingly she came up with a new story that she was at the hospital but with her friend and her mother didn't know. She said one lie after another just to cover things up as i kept saying to give it to me straight. I said i would still forgive her if she was honest but she denied going to the event. On top of that she got offended when i brought up this topic.

A few weeks go by and I'm still not coping well with her lies. She keep reassuring me and we decided to meet. Things got a bit intimate but not all the way. I said i believe in forgiveness and think that even the worst people can change. I just wanted her to promise to never repeat the same mistakes.

I said I'd let everything go if she'd just give me her phone and guarantee that i wont find anything that will ruin my mood. Conveniently she wipes her convos on a daily. So she just gave me the phone. i had a hunch and i typed in the guys name that i found on her Instagram.

Luckily there was a group convo where his name was mentioned a couple times. I went through some messages and had to physically stop myself from puking. She was being so causal and flirtatious with every guy in the group as if shes single and interested in everyone. This was especially true for the guy i found in her insta. Let's call him aron for now. 

Now i got bothered beyond belief but i still kept to my story of letting everything go if she'd just confess to everything today. She cried a bit and said this was it. She said she realises her mistakes and stopped her contact with these guys in November as we got official.

Moreover she assured me that she is not interested in anyone not even a little bit. She swore that she didn't get involved with anyone. And to some extent i believed her and maybe i still do. Still why would she lie? If it wasn't a big deal why would she lie about every little thing? One answer that i got here was that she didn't want to hurt me, BS right?

Anyhow, i dropped her off and then didn't sleep the whole night thinking about the texts. The next day i asked for her iCloud credentials to clear up a few things that still bothered me. She got angry but i persisted and she gave me the details. I opened her icloud and she aslo told me that she sharer her icloud with her little sister.

Surprisingly enough i found some nudes her little sister sent to her bf at the time. Obviously i ignored them and kept looking for the ss in images. I found a few sets of ss from Instagram. 90 percent of them from me to my gf and there were some from aron to someone.

All of my texts were incredibly intimate, and the texts from aron were inappropriate too. Here i assumed that aron was also talking to my girl and she was also entertaining him. I didn't react a bit an downloaded everything onto my laptop. i called my girl and asked to pick her up from uni. I planned to end things right here. There was no way I'd keep staying in this kind of relationship even if she is my whole world. I'd rather die in a torture chamber than ever accept this relationship.

I planned the whole breakup for hours and thought of shredding her mental health to pieces. However as i went to pick her up and saw her angry little face i kinda melted. There was nothing but love. I couldn't bring myself to be that heartless. So i threw away the whole plan and chose to breakup nicely. 

I got her coffee and recapped our relationship from start to finish. Then i showed her the ss as well as her sisters content. I didn't let her explain anything and she got quite. After hearing me for like 30 mins she got a nicotine pouch out of her purse and put it in her mouth. She always assured me that she had left these habits behind but just to be rebellious and to piss me off she used that nicotine poch in front of me. I got ticked and said some distasteful comments about her sister. However she told me to shut up and i also realised that i crossed a line.

I spent an hour driving around with her and saying everything i had to in a calm manner. I said i forgive her and wish her the best but i just don't wana see her face ever again. I dropped her off and waited for her to safely enter her house before blocking her everywhere and leaving.

I called a friend here and smoked with him for a couple hours while giving him vague details of the relationship. I didn't mention the part with aron ss and he told me to try and patch things up. I shut him down saying that he doesn't know the whole story. So he respected my decision and told me to stick with it.

I got home, told everyone to cut contact with her and her family strictly. They demanded an explanation but i declined. They didn't say much after it.

The next day was deadly for me. I know I'm being dramatic but there's no other way to define it. My family came to me and asked me to reconsider after seeing my miserable self. Still i told them no and didn't agree to anything.

At this point I installed wp again in my phone and saw her text me from a different number. I got curious and called her to stop her from trying these stunts. She said she didn't have the courage to say anything so she will type the most of it. She started typing for an hour and sent me some essays.

In these she took full accountability and confessed to everything and evey issue. Still she stuck to her lies to the point that i starter believing them. She admitted her mistakes and said she would do anything and everything to fix us. She also gave me proof that the ss from aron were to her friend gina. Gina shared these ss with my girl and everything and i sorta believed her. I said i didn't want her to do anything and after giving answers for everything i blocked her.

The next day my mother sat me down and insisted i tell her everything as she couldn't bear to see me this miserable. I gave her some details but didn't mention anything too serious. She convinced me to give her another chance but i wasn't planning to.

At the same time, i got an SMS from her saying she wants me to unblock her for a couple minutes. I said I'm coming to pick her up and I don't want to talk on text.

I picked her up and got a bit of anger out. She passed out in the middle of hearing how she hurt me. I panicked and woke her up bought her coffee and food with desert. I stopped unloading and said I'm open to giving her another chance if she agrees to dropout and starts respecting my boundaries. She agreed right away! 

Things didn't really smoothen out here but we were trying to make it work. I asked for all her socials to confirm there are no more surprises. Even though she hesitates at first, she gives me everything. I told her the trust she broke wont even let me have her be near a cell phone and she said she doesn't needd it as long as she has me. This game m3 some butterflies.

Still things were far from perfect. I would burst out at random and would be unsure about this relationship even after all of this. I would say so many mean things about her and her character. However she usually responded by getting offended by saying that i should just let her go then. She literally said keep crying for all i care cus i never did the things you say i did.

I literally cried for the first time in almost 2 decades. This was supposed to be my person. This was supposed to be the one. This was supposed to be my ride or die. What wouldn't i have done for her? She was literally everything i had and she rekt my pride. She slept with pills peacefully while I couldn't eat sleep shower or work.

I asked my clients to excuse me for a month as i couldn't focus one bit. At the same time, i told my girl that she should continue her uni as i am still unsure about our relationship. So, i don't want her to lose me as well as her degree. Her mother was extremely against her dropping out and rightfully so. So, i thought this would ease up the situation in her family as well. She agreed.

Here i kept asking for proofs to sort things out in my mind. I told her to get the original ss from gina so that i can move forward. She got angry but still asked gina for ss on her behalf. Gina got offended and said that it's her personal matter and said a few things to my gf about why she saved those ss. My gf persisted and gina said that she deleted her convo with aron and no longer has ss. Gina also said a few bad things about me and i expected my gf to defend me but she didn't.

Somehow my gf was more worried that she is causing issues for aron and gina as she was playing matchmaker with them. My gf told me she was close with gina and aron was physically attractive so Gina was interested in him. So being a friend my gf tested Aron in group chats to make sure he isn't a fuck boy. I smelled a big pile of bullshit but still believed the fact that aron was in a relationship with gina. 

Still i got no ss proving my gfs innocence. So i said that ask aron to give you the ss and she sent the ss to aron asking him for the conversation. Now aron got scared or something but still indirectly asked if Gina had sent these ss to my gf. Seems believable right? Still i had no proof. However this much was good enough for me to proceed. There was still the possibility that My gf requested gina and aron to put up an act to confuse me. I seem paranoid right? Well i think it's justified

As there was no proof i made my gf swear on her mother's life that she didn't me any lie about this situation. She hesitates but does swear. I give the benefit of doubt but this issue is stuck with me to this day.

Fast forward two more months as we try to smoothen things out but i would always overreact when she attended uni. Moreover, she went out  couple more times with her female friends who i wasn't comfortable with. All i know is that these friends disrespected me but my gf still chose to hangout with them. Like i shouldn't have to ask her to leave them right? Still it cuased some issues but we got over them.

Next i got her private social accounts which were wiped clean obviously. Still i was able to recover some data. I found pretty disgusting things. Another thing i found was time stamp as well as a picture of my gf being at her uni event. She swore to me she didn't lie but here i had proof of everything. I confronted her and she got cold saying i should do whatever i want. Maybe she saw my weaknesses and assumed I'm not able to leave her. Moreover i got back to the main issue of those Aron's ss thinking that they might be with my gf. Even if there is a little chance of those being my gfs ss, i don't think i can continue. I took her out one more time and asked her point blank. She looked into my eyes and assured me those weren't her ss. However the fact that bothered me was the text style.

I matched my gfs text to those ss word by word and found 99 percent similarities. Then i matched Gina's texts with those ss and found barely 10 percent similarities. Moreover i know how my girl texts and those were hers as far as my brain thinks. The explanation i got here was that gina was asking my gf on how to respond and my gf was giving her replies which she then gave to aron. 

IT MAKES SENSE RIGHT? IT DOESN'T TO ME. WHY WAS EVEY SINGLE SPELLING AND WAY OF TALKING THE SAME AS MY GF????? 

I don't know what I'm supposed to believe but this fucking haunts me to this day.

Anyhow i also found that in her contracts Aron's number was saved with a ‚ú®. She is pretty serious about emojis and she would never add this stsr unless she was interested so i confronted her about it. She denied it too just like everything and changed stories a couple of times about the number that aron himself added himself from her phone or something.

Now i don't know why but i still chose to believe her. As i am writing this i know it seems pretty silly. Maybe I'm the blind guy in this relationship.

Anyhow, i ask her to let me talk to her mother to end things permanently. She declines saying that her mother is ill and she doesn't want to give her any stress. Move forward a few hours, she apologized about everything and her stupidity. She said she was scared of me or something and didn't want to ruin our chances. 

Fast forward to July 15th and i finally snapped with this on again off again bullshit. I told her that she keeps begging me for a clear path and would do anything so i want her to drop out and we'll get married.

Notice that the semester break is going on and things start to get better. I see her behaviour changing. I see her becoming more and more religious and accountable and sensible. I met her once again and was amazed by the change. I melted at her putting the effort. I loved her change in habits and every effort she was putting in. Or maybe I'm wrong

Still i wanted her to drop out to confirm her commitment. Moreover my ego also didn't allow her to ever think that she'd go back to the place that destroyed her. I told her point blank that i would commit right away after she drops out. However if she steps foot in that place then we are done

She needed permission from her mother but her mother denied her again and again. Here i got a bit desperate as well as i had to stick to my word if she went to uni. Still i saw how many times she asked her mother for permission 

After a few days my gf asked me to talk to her mother and i called her to meet with her. She said she was busy and would call a few days later about the meeting. Sadly my gfs nan died and her mother was pretty devastated. 

I didn't ask for a month but after thwt i asked my gf to ask her mother about a meeting. Her mother declined saying that she just lost her mother and doesn't want any stress. 

Then my gf asked me to talk to her brother which i did. The guy told me its not an issue as long as my gf agreeed. I got happy and angry at the same time.

Fast forward another day my gf said her brother talked to her mother and she wont allow her to quit. I called her mother twice one week apart to request her to let my gf dropout as her degree might kill our relationship. I took full responsibility of her along with finances and everything else but her mother didn't agree.

My ego got so fucking hurt my pride was lost in the dirt. I got home and called my mother to come to me. I told my mother to call my gfs mother and end things. 

My mother said don't be rash and i am being unreasonable and maybe i am. Still what about my respect???

Anyhow my mother convinced me to give her family a month before ending things. I said that I'm not waiting and i gotta make a decision now. My mother still doesn't know the whole story.

Still, my mother along with my weak and pathetic mind convinced me to let it go and commit. So i did. However the response from my gf and her mother were so causal and uninterested that it felt like i got stabbed a million times.

Next my mother said these things to me and i felt something die inside. I felt so alone and lost every feeling for her or so i thought.

I talked to her the next day, picked her up, told her i wasn't interested and dropped her off. She called me called my mother and her mother also called my mother to figure things out. However i had told my mother that i was no longer interested and she told my gfs family that we wish the best for my gf and you should have her do what's in her best interest.

I also get a messge from my gfs friend saying shes sick and her family won't agree. Atleast i should stand with her in this tough time. I dont like discussing my personal matters with random people so i brushed her off pretty quickly.

On Friday mid September i texted my gf for the last time from a pure heart asking if she's going to uni. She saw the text and left it on seen.

The next morning my mother gets another call from my gfs mother saying that i should understand their situation and they can't afford to let go of their daughter's degree. From there, my mother said that you guys should do whatever is in my gfs best interest.

I assumed that my gf stepped foot in uni the next day. I waited one more week for her to respond but lost hope when i was sure that she's going to uni.

After 3 weeks in the beginning of October i do get a text from my gf asking if i don't miss her even a little bit. We argue for a couple minuts and i end things by saying that she had made her choice.

The next day she sends me some tiktok reels and i leave them on seen

The next day she sends me some more reels and i delete them without seeing.

I also deleted her number and all texts from 3 years for the first time.

Fast forward one more week she texted me asking if i was okay and i ignored her.

The next day i woke up to a text from her wishing bad on me saying may God ignore me like I've ignored her and to enjoy my life
 

This somehow made me happy thinking that she's finally moving on and all this shit is over

Then one more week goes by and she is begging for a response again saying all these things. I again mentioned how she's nothing but a liar and a deceiver and doesn't deserve any chances we argue more and stop talking

Last week she texts me again calling me the liar and deceiver but i just ignore it and asked her not to text me again until her uni ended. I also told her not to get ger hopes up and to focus on herself from now on.


Her point is that she did everything to change for me and never repeated the mistakes she made. I can somewhat vouch that she didn't repeat any mistake but i still can't forgive her. 

Lord knows I've tried my best in every way to forgive her but i cant. Still she doesn't want to let go. 

Somewhere i still feel responsible for her. I dont like to see her desperate and begging. However i know if i was on the other end of the situation she'd leave me to die alone. Still my heart doesn't allow me to be that ruthless. This is the first time in 4 years that we've not talked on a daily baiss for almost 2 months.

Secondly even if there is a small possibility she was involved with aron i dont want anything to do with her

Thirdly there is no trust and there never will be any trust

Fourth I'm disgusted by her deception and how she took our relationship for granted 

Fifth i am not sure what i did wrong. From the day i committed i removed every female friend from my life and gave my everything to this relationship.

Now the situation is that my gf hopes that we will get everything normal after uni and it will be wll sunshine an rainbow. The truth is that she doesn't have any other option. If she did she would've never been stuck. She calls i love but all i see is desperation.

Is it love when you deceive someone?
Is it love when you wish bad on them?
Is it love when you keep them in the dark?
Is it love when you have to lie to them?

FUCK THIS LOVE 

Anyhow I'm beyond confused. To some extent I'm concerned and worried about her and don't want to leave her as shes had a tough life and i want to help her. I know people change and I've also seen her change. However some part of me will always doubt her and then there is this issue with aron that won't fucking leave my mind.

She says she'll manage even a tough life with me as I'm the only guy in her life. She just doesn't want to leave me

Let's say i do leave her

What about the promises i made?
What about the life we planned?
What about the happiness and progress we were going to share?

Lets say i keep her

Will i be able to keep her happy?
Will i forget all of this shit?
Will there be trust?

I still want to see her happy and succeed in life but i don't think I'm the guy who can keep her happy even if she says she'll die from the inside without me. It kills to me to imagine her crying. It kills me to leave her alone. It kills me to be the reason why she's in pain. 

Still..... What about my pain?

Tldr: GF broke my trust but put in some effort to change. She says she can't live without me and will accept any and every circumstance as long as we are together. I dont know if i should let go or commit.",1,1729193411.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been friends for 6 years already since nun college because of an org. We‚Äôre close since then and I am 1-year ahead. So I am basically his senior.

We‚Äôve continued our friendship after graduation up to now. I never really liked him before, I only saw him like a little brother where we sometimes share personal and deep stuffs and also shared same interests on music which I think the reason why we became friends. 

He‚Äôs not straight, he is still closeted until now. I am also one of the first people where he confessed that he‚Äôs not straight. 

Last August we went on a 1-week trip with our friends. Normal samin yung nag-tatravel together with our friends but this trip made me feel something for him. 

Inasar ko sya dun sa isa naming kasama like shinip ko lang ganon which is normal naman sakin na i-ship ko sya kung kani-kanino. Wala lang naman sakanya pero nung napansin ko na yung kasama namin is parang naging clingy sakanya after nung pang aasar ko nakaramdam ako ng selos. Which is weird.

Then after ko ma-feel yun tsaka na ako nagback track ng mga pangyayari sa buhay ko with him and started giving meaning into things.

List of the things na di ko pansin not until I felt something:
- He was always gentleman sa akin.
- He always check up on me when I am not in my best self.
- Tell me secrets about his life. Even the worst thing he did.
- He was clingy pala sakin noon pa hindi ko lang pansin kahit sa pictures makikita. Kahit malayo sya nakaupo tumatabi sakin.


After the trip last August, feeling ko nag-iba rin kami (baka feeling ko lang lol) mas dumalas yung usap and we sometimes meet each other on weekends for coffee or run. Nagvovolunteer din sya sumama sa mga cafe‚Äôs na gusto kong puntahan, yung magnonote lang sa IG tas sasama na sya ganon. 

He sometimes tells me and our friends na gusto nya daw magka-anak. Para bang inaalis nya sa utak namin na gay sya. He even joked multiple times na kami daw ang gagawa ng baby. Nasasabi nya rin minsan ‚Äúwhat if tayo nga?‚Äù na lagi kong dinidismiss yung thought nya na yon. Alam ko rin kasi na may tendency sya na maging pa-fall sa iba.

I am so confused, hindi ako sure sa nararamdaman ko. Baka sobrang close lang talaga namin kaya ganto ko kacomfortable pero ano yung naramdaman kong selos?

Shux, i want this feeling to go away. I want to keep what we have and don‚Äôt want to ruin that. Feelings often just ruin good friendship. Help!",0,1729193259.0,adviceph,6,0.5,False

But recently, something unexpected happened. I started dating a guy I never thought I would‚Äîa total nerd.

His name is Mark, and we met in one of my accounting classes. He‚Äôs not the type I‚Äôd usually go for: quiet, glasses, always has his head buried in a textbook. But there was something about him, a sweetness I couldn‚Äôt ignore. We started talking after class, and I was surprised at how easy it was to be around him. He didn‚Äôt try to impress me or act like someone he‚Äôs not. He was just‚Ä¶himself.

Our first date wasn‚Äôt anything crazy‚Äîno loud bars or wild adventures. We just grabbed coffee and talked for hours about random things. I learned that he‚Äôs into gaming, anime, and has this ridiculous knowledge of science fiction. I‚Äôll admit, I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd feel about it at first. But the more time I spent with him, the more I found myself liking those little quirks that made him so different from anyone I‚Äôd dated before.

He‚Äôs kind, thoughtful, and actually listens to me. And honestly, it‚Äôs refreshing to be with someone who isn‚Äôt trying to act cool or show off. He‚Äôs just genuine, and that‚Äôs been more attractive than I ever expected.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve completely changed my type or anything, but dating someone outside of my usual ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù zone has been such a surprise. Who knew I‚Äôd fall for the nerdy guy?

I've been seeing a guy (40m) I met on Tinder for about a month. We really hit it off, have been casually dating, going for coffee, and  hanging out at each other's places in our free time. We text and play online games together everyday and there's flirting/teasing involved. He told me in passing conversation he deleted his Tinder a couple days after our first date.

One day last week he mentioned that he didn't have time to date because of various responsibilities. I felt a bit confused at that because it seemed to me dating was what we were doing on a casual basis to determine interest in a relationship, as the chemistry is good and we've only been seeing each other. But I didn't know at that point. So I asked for clarification and asked him if we're hanging out in the context of going on dates for the intent to get romantic, as opposed to being just friends.

He told me he thinks hanging out will figure that out, he has no preconceived notions, and he's going with the flow and seeing where it goes. ""Tldr: I dunno, we'll figure it out lol""

I'm not offended at it by any means, as I don't want to push. Most of my previous relationships have been rushed into without much thought, so thats actually refreshing for me. 

In your experience, does this mean a man is looking for a girlfriend or is looking for a less committed situationship type of thing? I like our connection so I don't mind taking it slow, but I don't want it to end up where we stay in the situationship trap and it doesn't ever progress.  That seems like a waste of time for me. I also feel like it's only been a month and I may be over-thinking it üòÖ. It's the first time since I've been single that a Tinder match has went well past just chatting.

Really need to know if I am the asshole though. I F 23 had been making spicy content on OF for about 2 years before I took a break for a year. I live in a 4 bedroom house that I rent, with 2 other roommates, we will call roommate 1 John 23 M and roommate 2 Alyssa 22 F (for privacy reasons not their real names but real ages). The house is Rent to Own with the ownership split with me and John. John and I have been friends since high school and roomed together at college until Covid and we both dropped out. John has known that I make OF content and has never had an issue with it as long as I respected doing it while he was at work. He got a digital design job and is gone until about 7pm so it has not been an issue. 

About a year ago I lost my sister to a drunk driver and I wasn't doing well mentally. Because of this I stopped doing OF, fell into a pretty dark place and wasn't bringing in any money. I used my savings to continue paying my portion of the rent for about 4 months until John suggested we find a roommate so I could grieve, and have less of a financial burden as the rent and expenses would be spilt 3 ways and would not be eating up as much of my savings. I agreed at the time because I was blowing through my savings pretty quickly and it seemed like it would help. At the time I wasn't even thinking of what I would do for work or if I would go back to OF full time. John told me he would handle finding a roommate so it wouldn't add to my stress or mental load and after talking to some mutual friends he found Alyssa. She is a waitress and worked consistent hours daytime hours so other than paying the bills on time I didn't have many stipulations. Things were good for the first few months I kept to myself and didn't see much of her but after awhile John and I started noticing odd behaviors. I didn't realize that she was Uber religious when she moved in but her behavior got worse and worse. 

First it started with her replacing our coffee table book with a bible and devotional telling us that ""Jesus should be the center of the household"" and then wanting to nail a giant cross into the wall above the sofa. Since this is a rental John and I both said we didn't think it would be a good idea as it would damage the walls. She told us that we were being discriminatory and against her religion. She threatened to sue us. She also started to demand that we allow her to host her bible studies at our house 3-4x a week. I didn't have an issue with 1-2x a week but these were not small 3-6 people gatherings. Her bible studies consisted of 18-30 people at a time until 10-11pm sometimes and it was disruptive for John's work schedule. She then put little fish stickers on both Josh's and my car saying it was for protection from God. She also plays religious music at max volume during the day and evenings and recites prayers very loudly to where it's impossible to concentrate on other things. She won't let us watch anything secular in the living room TV or she betrayed us telling us it makes her feel uncomfortable. Other little things I'm not remembering right now but it has just been a lot. 

About 2 months ago I felt enough like myself to get back to OF, nothing major yet. And knowing how she feels about things I scheduled my content schedule around her work so she wouldn't feel uncomfortable. This worked great until 3 weeks ago it was a Monday she left for work and was supposed to be gone for a 6 hour shift,I felt like filming and when I'm home alone I don't typically lock my door to my room but I do shut it. It must have been slow and they sent her home because I didn't even hear her come back home. I was mid video and Alyssa walks in. No knock, no hello, just walks in. She lets out a scream and I yell at her to GTFO. I then proceed to put on a robe and go talk to her. She was in the living room hysterical. You legit would have thought someone hurt a puppy. I asked her why she would just walk in and she told me she ""sometimes likes to tidy up the house when we are gone"" total breech of privacy but that's besides the point. She then tells me how I lied to her and that I'm going to Hell. And she cannot ""live under these conditions"" and I needed to stop or get out. I was pretty startled and told her I felt violated and she said ""you're putting it out there anyway so who cares if I walked in"". This went on for about an hour until John got home. 

 She then tells John with a smug look on her face as if she was tattling on a sibling. John completely unfazed just struggled and said ""okay"" this made her super mad and she began going on a rant about suing us for defrauding her since we didn't disclose that I was a ""prostitute"" (her words) and then stormed out. John followed her and told her that he was more than happy to terminate her lease with no extra penalty if she felt uncomfortable as well as give back her deposit if she wanted more suitable housing to better fit her lifestyle. She said absolutely not since she couldn't find this good of a deal on housing anywhere else in the city and that I should be the one kicked out. John then said that's not possible because him and I own the property almost outright split at this point. She absolutely lost it and told us that we were stealing from her since she gets no ownership of the property and that since we are all splitting it then she should own part of it too and be on the deed to the house. I do feel bad John didn't tell her about the ownership but we have been paying on this home for years and I would never just give up a portion. 

Fast forward to the following Monday after. She left a set of rules that John and I must follow on the counter, one being I need to get an ""actual job"" and then asked us to sign an updated contract of these rules with her listed as the primary leaseholder with her name on the deed, saying if we broke them we would be evicted. John blew up at her and ripped up the contract and Alyssa started screaming at me. Saying we had to sign it or we would be sorry. Since then she has been harassing us, calling me names and even had some of the elder ladies at her church come over to berate me. Tell me Jesus loves me if I repent and such. I am at my white end and did not mean for this to happen. So aita for telling her I won't quit my OF even though it's making her uncomfortable. Also any advice would be greatly appreciated.

u/spooply Thanks for the cat picnic card. Such a cute design!

u/rennbrig Thanks for the card written with your non-dominant hand - and you even tried a little doodle!

u/kittycatcon Ohhh a unicorn! Good choice for mythical animal!

u/mypetitmal You said not to worry about thank yous, but I wanted to let you know that I got this card anyway, and if you read this, please remind me of your address again because I'm not sure if I have your current one. I'd love to reply!

1g5yluf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5yluf,"Sublet in Bed-Stuy starting Dec. 1 - $1,200 (utilities included)","I‚Äôm moving out of my current apartment after nearly six years, and my roommates and I are looking for someone to sublet my room in a 4-bedroom/2-bath ground-floor duplex in Bed-Stuy (near the Bushwick border) starting December 1.

Rent is $1,200/month, which includes all utilities (electric/gas/internet). The ideal person would be interested in subletting long-term (e.g., one year, with the option to sign on/stay longer).

The apartment is within walking distance of grocery stores, laundromats, a gym, coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. It takes about 20 minutes to get to Lower Manhattan. The closest subway is the J (Gates Ave.), which has nearby connections to the G, M, L, A, and C within a few stops.

You‚Äôll have direct access to the backyard from the bedroom. I‚Äôve included photos of the room as it looks now and some older photos from before I moved in to give you a better idea of its size.

I am not taking a handful of items in the bedroom with me‚Äîthe air conditioner, the bed frame, the box spring, and the mattress‚Äîand can leave those behind if requested. Otherwise, the room will be unfurnished when you move in. The living room will be furnished apart from the brown recliner and ottoman, which are both coming with me. The apartment is pet-friendly.

Here‚Äôs some info on the roommates you‚Äôll be living with:
- Kenny (he/him) is a dog walker, filmmaker, and writer working in film and TV who loves finding new music, going to shows, and gardening in the backyard.
- Karina (she/her) is an architect who loves to cook and go out salsa dancing.
- A third roommate, who will be living in a room that‚Äôs also available starting December 1. (This is not included in this listing as it‚Äôs not mine to make.)

If interested, please message me with your name, a way to contact you (phone/email), occupation, and where you‚Äôd be moving from.",1,1729191806.0,NYCapartments,0,0.67,False

I'm looking for a pair of headphones to be used primarily at home (and only occasionally at a coffee shop/park), so noise cancelling is not something I really need. At home I'm more prone to listen to full albums, and would love something that really brings out the details in music during more 'careful' listening. Is a neutral/flat tuning best for this? I edit sound from time to time, so I know that'd likely be the best for that purpose, but am okay with getting something a little different if it's better for music.

I listen to all kinds of genres, but if it helps some of my favorite artists are Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Taylor Swift, Weyes Blood, and The Caretaker, so basically anything from heavily layered instrumental post-rock to radio hits to chamber pop / folk to ambient drone - I also love jazz. Budget would be $400, but preferably under $300. Despite the flair would also be open to hearing open back recommendations if anyone thinks that'd be best! I recently got Artti T10s and am loving them.

1g5yl7v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5yl7v,Sanding help - see swirls at an angle ,"So, I'm still technically working on my first table. The table was getting too thin for my liking so I moved on to a thicker piece of wood as another test piece. 

I thought I figured out sanding but I guess I didn't. I went back to my original piece so I can finish it. I wasn't looking at the wood at an angle while sanding so I didn't see the swirls until later. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? I've been following directions of some site where you go in one direction and then follow through by going in the other direction. Moving from lower grit to higher bit. I think I stopped at like 300 or 320 before I noticed the swirls. 

Any advice would be appreciated. I've been putting a lot of money into this (not planned) and I'm just trying to make a decent table. I've wasn't planning on putting this much money into an epoxy table but apparently i can't follow directions well. You put wood in front of me i can recreate it. I didn't realize how difficult epoxy would be. Someone has already purchased a piece from me after looking at my previous wood working. I don't want to sell something that has these big swirls when looking at it from an angle. If I'm gonna sell something I want it to be perfect or close to or I won't sell it. 

I've been using poliwell mesh sanding disc's. I've been blowing dust with my compressor while I'm sanding and stopping frequently to blow out any dust on my sander or sand paper. I read this helps with issues like I'm having. 

Should I be using a different type of sandpaper? It's difficult to tell if you're using the right grit at the lower grits because well obviously you can see scratches. 

I'm honestly impressed I made this far from the original piece that was given to me. The person that gave me the piece of wood takes a lot of value in things like this. He knows the history of the wood and I'm just trying to make a nice table.

Also, any suggestions on leg ideas would be great. This table is probably going to be an entryway table. Once, I feel comfortable making epoxy tables I plan on having it match a dining table, coffee table and end tables. I'm just mentioning that to keep in mind for leg ideas. I'm thinking probably making something out of wood and painting it black. I thought that might be better because of the number of tables I'm planning on having it match and the heights.

Did errands earlier today (i own a shop online so i dropped some orders) and it was traffic i was pretty much exhausted and not to mention overstimulated because of the afternoon rush hour and traffic commotion, i figured i take a little detour for an iced coffee in starbucks right where i live before i head straight to my house. I did that, i got in line and they already know what i always get there so i let the lady approaching the line went go right ahead of me i noticed she just seemingly gave birth (she has a newborn and her husband sitting right across the table) then she looked at me for a sec at first probly didn‚Äôt think much if it but she looked at me again her eyes scanned at my face for 5 seconds with the most innocent gaze ive ever seen today and she smiled. I got confused for a sec and she looked away. I thought that was very nice i got shy so i looked away and smiled. In most of these cases i dont usually shy away and i smile back.

So that was out of the table and my eyes started to wander again inside the cafe and there on the far left across the lane sitting at the table by the big transparent window was another lady (pregnant obviously could pop anytime soon by the size of her belly) on a green dress and i realized she was also looking at me so i  brushed it off a bit my eyes scanned elsewhere but she was literally gazing on me and kind of nodded and smiled. I felt shy and i felt really pleasant actually. I feel immense joy and sadness at the same time. Just like with the lady in front of me i smiled back as soon as i turned my back i shouldve done that when we met eyes


I had a miscarriage @7 weeks just this aug me and my SO were still grieving but its getting a lil bit better by time. My SO was very happy and our family knew already and all he ever wanted to be is to be a dad, finally and it just slipped through our hands. He was devastated. So these type of things messes both us up quite a bit usually and i became really emotional seeing and being around babies and pregnant women and as of this very moment it just reminded me what me could‚Äôve had and almost seemed like ‚Äúthey knew‚Äù kind of look the way they smiled and looks at me or am i being crazy? They dont know me. I dont know them and they both dont know each other they have their own respectable husbands and theyre like tables apart.

They called my name, i got my drink, i rushed to the toilet and i wanted to sob or cry but i just felt immense sadness and happiness at the same time i couldn‚Äôt explain it. I dont know if thats just my hormones still. I walked right through that door feelings dormant and get what i usually get and thats it. Today was a little bit interesting to me because i felt like i just had unspoken exchange with strangers for a short while but it meant and felt a lot for some reason and i dont know how to explain it‚Ä¶
I went out from the toilet i scanned the room for the two women and it seems like business as usual.

1g5yk2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1g5yk2d/do_you_think_there_is_a_certain_degree_of_irony/,Do you think there is a certain degree of irony in Ireland trying to spread awareness about mental health? Specifically mens?,"My Apologies, but I don't know how to do a TLDR for this one.

So, Ireland is one of the lonelinest places in the world; I truly believe this. And on top of that, I truly believe Ireland's largest university is also it's loneliest - which is where the bulk of my thoughts have formed for this topic. (In 3rd year now).

But what is really our biggest cultures? Literature, music or Theatre?

No. I believe it's alcohol, gossiping about people behind their back, and alienating people who don't like to do these two things. My opinion is we have a culture of alcohol and exclusion. (I was born in Ireland by the way, didn't move here or anything).

And yet, we go around during June and November trying to spread awareness about mental health? I think there's a very depressing irony here.

I truly believe that those who ""are good at having the craic"" will always have their mental health prioritised over those who are ""dry shites"".

Now, I am choosing to back this up with my own personal experience: It was June this year, (and my birthday month too) and my dad was rushed to the hospital after his health got worse. He's still in the hospital - pneumonia. And yet, during that month as the ambulance was taking my father away, none of my ""friends"" listened to me, or gave me space to vent, to request some comfort. None of them checked up on me and asked me how I was doing, invited me out to coffee etc. This confirms my suspicions that most don't actually care as much as they say they do.

Now I'll wind back the clock a bit earlier to when I was in 2nd year and an acquaintance of mine asked me ""oh actually were you in the same class as me?"" I said yeah, they replied ""oh yeah my friend said you were so..."" They brought on an embarrassed smile and said ""I don't know"". This confirms my suspicions about one of our ""traditional pastimes"". I'm guessing whatever they said had something to do with what I would share with our professor during certain topics of discussion; I don't mean straight up trauma dumping which I get, but odd or ""interesting"" thoughts about whatever it was being discussed. (But, I also boil it down to something neurotypical about myself), whatever they said, I'm sure the ""I don't know"" was a blanket for something a little more hurtful.

So this is why I can't help thinking the way I do about Ireland as a country and it's people. And so I look around online and in real life during right now, and I just laugh...in a way like ""really? We actually care do we?""

I'd love to hear some thoughts. And I would be interested to hear why some people might disagree. Not in a aggressive manner however, because I would like to not believe any of this anymore but I'm having a very difficult time doing so.

One day, over coffee, he told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of becoming a software engineer.‚Äù I laughed at first, but he was dead serious.

He stumbled upon a blog post that laid out exactly what a software engineer does, and it hit him: this was *his* path. It wasn‚Äôt just about coding, but the idea of solving complex problems, building real-world solutions, and actually creating something from scratch. He was especially drawn to the fact that software engineering is in demand, with salaries starting around $70k and going well over $120k for experienced engineers. Plus, he loved that it‚Äôs a career where you can work remotely or jump between different industries.

Sure, it wasn‚Äôt going to be easy. He didn‚Äôt have a formal background in computer science, but he started taking coding bootcamps and working on his portfolio. Chris said the flexibility of the job, being able to work in industries from finance to gaming, and constantly learning new tech made it all worth it.

So, Ireland is one of the lonelinest places in the world; I truly believe this. And on top of that, I truly believe Ireland's largest university is also it's loneliest.

But what is really are biggest cultures? Literature, music or Theatre? 

No. I believe it's alcohol, gossiping about people behind their back, and alienating people who don't like to do these two things. 

And yet, we go around during June and November trying to spread awareness about mental health? I think there's a very depressing irony here.

I truly believe that those who ""are good at having the craic"" will always have their mental health prioritised over those who are ""dry shites"".

Now, I am backing this up with my own personal experience: It was June this year, (and my birthday month too) and my dad was rushed to the hospital after his health got worse. He's still in the hospital - pneumonia. And yet, during that month as the ambulance was taking my father away, none of my ""friends"" listened to me, or gave me space to vent, to request some comfort. None of them checked up on me and asked me how I was doing, invited me out to coffee etc. This confirms my suspicions that most don't actually care as much as they say they do. 

Now I'll wind back the clock a bit earlier to when I was in 2nd year and an acquaintance of mine asked me ""oh actually were you in the same class as me?"" I said yeah, they replied ""oh yeah my friend said you were so..."" They brought on an embarrassed smile and said ""I don't know"". This confirms my suspicions about one of our ""traditional pastimes"". I'm guessing whatever they said had something to do with what I would share with our professor during certain topics of discussion; I don't mean straight up trauma dumping which I get, but odd or ""interesting"" thoughts about whatever it was being discussed. (But, I also boil it down to something neurotypical about myself), whatever they said, I'm sure the ""I don't know"" was a blanket for something a little more hurtful. 

So this is why I can't help thinking the way I do about Ireland as a country and it's people. And so I look around online and in real life during right now, and I just laugh...in a way like ""really? We actually care do we?""

I'd love to hear some thoughts. And I would be interested to hear why some people might disagree. Not in a aggressive manner however, because I would like to not believe any of this anymore but I'm having a very difficult time doing so.

My therapist said i should discuss this with him. Now ik he's coming to visit this weekend. And somehow now I helped plan it and I'm invited but I'm worried I'm falling for the grandiose gestures. I think maybe he's too far gone to see how manipulative it is too bc hes ""the best"" (covert npd and I have bpd recently diagnosed). 


So since i moved BACK to my hometown from living w him a state away to get away from him. He is CLAIMING he's now moving HERE. Idk what I can do to make sure he stops interacting bc hes not doing it directly or in a way I can prove a restraining order is needed. I've gotten messages forwarding his info to me (prob fake accts he made), and b4 i left i made it clear i would not feel safe having him move here. He was playing white knight and love bombing to make it seem like it was his own decision (i wanted to try seeing if we could make it out here b4 this last official breakup bc i tried breaking it off abt 4 times before this time) and the various things he did until i went no contact to ""prove"" hes good for me and can follow thru are distrubing to me as well.

We were together almost 3 years. Wedding was supposed to b next spring but he controlled our finances so there actually was never anything done towards that goal. 
I stayed home and wasn't allowed a job to take care of his 2 preteens and the home. His car eventually stopped working and he had to use mine--to the point I couldn't. I had to schedule anything for me or kids around him. He ignored real life to play video games and blamed me when things went wrong even tho I warned him my concerns. He played victim. He wanted a mommy. And by the end even if I did everything right, it was wrong. Like cleaning everything and making dinner but I didn't have a fork ready for him was appalling. He made a comment abt ""If i ever got pregnant and didnt lose the weight quick enough he wasnt sure hed still b attracted to me""

He did tell me he's a recovering npd but now I'm thinking it was covert. And it got worse/shows up more when the kids moved in (their mom passed away suddenly ||her own choice||) and then we moved to get a bigger place for them. He even said ""I bet ur gonna leave now"" in such a way that it was a challenge like damed if I do damed if I don't. So I took that on. I wanted to b a mom. 
Now also keep in mind I'm 23 at the time, he's 36, and his exwife I wasn't ever able to meet b4 she died was 51. They married at 21/36 yrs old. 

There were various issues throughout but the tipping point was him cheating. My biggest issue wasn't the cheating itself bc I told him I understand why ppl go poly. It was the hypocritical fact that since day 1 he said his exwife cheated on him (funny enough bc he said, she thought he did it first) and he would rather ""b told than find out abt it"" and that he needs monogamy. He still denies it after the proof I had FOUND. The girl (listed as a dude in his phone) i talked to and when he tried to make up a conspiracy he said she'd never know his tattoos unless she went over to him (claiming she worked a building over). I asked her abt that to prove his point, she got them all right. Down to the finger tat. 

He claimed we had no money to do the things I begged him for (fixing my car that is illegal to drive now) among other things. 2nd day i left he bought MY dream car. He's doing things I've asked him to do w me during our relationship. Like spending time with his kids, going out just to not b in the house. Apparently he went to fanX (told me too expensive) and took the kids to aquarium (things ur supposed to do). Claiming he's into crystals now and seeing a therapist. I wasn't even allowed to get coffee or monster energy from gas station bc too expensive... hes going to the coffee shop that was our first date EVERYDAY. 

Like i said, all this told to me, keeping me down like he needs a fan club. He lied abt when he got a ring (i had to ask for proof, next day he went to mall i saw on the gps tracker app he said he loved seeing me on and so I can see him). he broke down bc he ""couldnt handle being alone this long"" and claimed he was moving my stuff out as I was on a very important business trip over 2 time zones away, in the car w my boss so it got me fired bc it was unprofessional. They chose to move on w another candidate. My mental health and age and body (weight and type) i was repeatedly told were an issue for him and complained about it to me. If I brought up anything he shut down essentially not giving me the time and the next day would mirror my concerns and insecurities to gain sympathy over what I JUST told him abt for himself. If I pointed out that I was feeling it too he would complain ""im just trying to make it abt me"" 

I need to move on. I'm starting over like i was at 19 (at 24) in my parents den with no income or working car (yet) and no support system bc my parents are not as understanding just bc theyve never been thtu this amd thank god tbh, my insurance is still other state Medicaid so no therapy, and my friends are not here (the 2 i was allowed were online) and no hobbies to get me out of the house. 

 I don't want someone else to fall for it only to b left in a worse position than if they just said no im not moving in after a month but I also know that can't b a responsibility of mine. 

My therapist told me to get in touch to get a picture as to why like closure. Welp. Now I'm not falling for him like back in love, I'm just falling into old habits. 

I helped plan the trip out here. Now he's ""following thru"" and doing it which was a big issue we had.  But like, it was something I wanted to do w them and he knows that so he invited me, and now I just feel like very concerned. I was fine yesterday w it and it's hitting me as it gets closer, maybe there's something more going on and I'm being naive again?? I dropped everything once he replied to see what was up and make the time for him. To the point I kinda have been blowing off everything else. I have to have a job by now 1st and I've applied to a lot of places abd heard back from a couple but it's like, now I need to make sure I text him back timely even if I need to focus on job search. Even getting back to my best friend (one of the online ones) has become like ""less on the list"" bc of how high i held him in the relationship. Like im stuck in the relationship mindset?? Idk 

I feel like I was doing sm worse until I had to confront him. I was starting to b ok. Knowing he's ok. I can barely eat or sleep and im so depressed and now im at least able to eat more solid food. He's saying all the right things I begged him to talk abt b4. And idk for how long but do I really wanna find out?? 

I don't want the kids to b anymore messed up than they probably are but I can't control that as not mom and to involve myself w just them automatically involved him. Do uk how hard it is to watch a car crash? Knowing it?? Like I miss them sm I think maybe bc he knows that he's using the kids card? Am I being too cynical? 

Idk what to do. Bc I feel like the only way to confirm my fears that he hasnt changed is to see him and kids in person when they visit. But also is that just an excuse to myself? I wish we could b ok enough to not b no contact but it's been 3 days now that we started talking again after almost 2 months and idk how much it's helping actually like my therapist thought it would. 

It was my would-be step daughters bday last Friday and that's what kinda started this convo w therapy too bc I was sobbing over not being there for her.

1g5y7wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1g5y7wq/friend_wants_to_be_in_a_onesided_friendship_with/,Friend WANTS To Be In A One-Sided Friendship With Me,"Some context, we had a situation between us (will refer to him as Friend A) come up recently that put some strain on our friendship.  Dynamics in our friend group of three shifted and led me to have to withdraw.  I was never really close with the third person (we will call him Friend B) and have mixed feeling about him due to incompatabities of personalities, but him and my friend still have a strong connection with each other. This left my only connection remaining with Friend A.  Me and Friend A used to have more hangouts and conversations before all this shook out, however afterwards interactions became few and far between.  We did have one meet-up that persisted which was grabbing coffee with each other once a week to talk and catch up.  Conversations we did have around this time became more deep and personal as I was being open about what I've been going through and he opened up a bit to me as well.

We talked about the situation and I was very open about how I felt about things and how I still wanted to maintain a good relationship with him, even if it meant things were scaled back a bit.  I told him what expectations I had for our friendship and I asked him to do the same, realizing I might get an answer I don't like.  However, the response I got threw me off a bit because it ended up being he wanted to be a mentor to me rather than a friend.  He says he still cares about me and likes hanging around me, but something about the dynamic we have makes him want to help me with certain aspects of my life (Example: being more social, having more life experiences, general life stuff) and provide more of a service to me than an equal relationship.  In fact he even said that he doesn't see me as equal as a peer because of this mentorship role he is taking upon himself (I'm 27 and he's 31 so age isn't a factor in this).  He even said he wants nothing in return for this, no reciprocation or anything needed.  

When he told me this I pushed back against it as I see him as a friend and an equal rather than a person who fills that mentor role.  A mistake I may have made was being open about my struggles and trauma from my past with him.  I believe he misattributed my ability to talk to him about it as something he did or how our connection was, but in the background my ability to open up to him came from breakthroughs I had through therapy and healing I've done myself.  He wasn't the reason for these breakthroughs, but he was the type of person I felt could hold space for it and be someone in my actual life who I trusted with these types of conversations because we had similar experiences.

We were unable to come to a compromise and we have currently not talked to each other for weeks.  I'm worried because I care about this friendship with him but I can not and will not give in to having a one-sided relationship with him under the rules he set.  The longer this goes on the less and less I feel like I can relate to him and the more likely it is our friendship just falls apart.  I don't even know if he wants me to reach out to him or if this is even salvageable.  Should I give it some more time and wait to see if he reaches out, reach out to him or just walk away?

I am here today with a Fundie Book Review for your entertainment and (hopefully) education. I have been trying to write this review for a few weeks now and realized there was no way I could cram every single offensive and stupid thing from this book into one post, so this is a much-abridged version of my (many, many, many) pages of notes.

Qualifications: Former fundie, atheist for over a decade, English teacher for 6 years.

**TW: Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia.** There is nothing very graphic or explicit in this review, but a lot of harmful language and ideas being presented.

Today‚Äôs book review is *Vote Like Jesus: Answering 15 Big Questions About God vs. Government* by our favorite disgraced megachurch pastor, Mark Driscoll. I read it on Kindle so I do not have specific page numbers, but I have indicated the chapters where I have taken direct quotes. All direct quotes are in ‚Äúquotation marks‚Äù.



##Book Overview

As Americans prepare for another contentious election, Mark Driscoll presents *Vote Like Jesus* as a beacon of hope shining through the darkness that is American culture. However, this book is less like a lighthouse in a storm and more like a phone flashlight in a dark movie theater - unnecessary, attention-seeking, and disruptive to everyone nearby. Driscoll fails to offer any actual guidance and instead uses the book as a personal soapbox to air his grievances with other Christians. Spoiler: this book doesn‚Äôt actually tell you how to vote like Jesus by the end.



##Personal Anecdotes

Marky Mark loves telling anecdotes about Totally Real Situations That Happened and then makes some incredible leaps in logic in order to connect them to his current topic. A few of my favorite anecdotes include:

* **Chapter 1:** Mark is sitting in a coffee shop when an Amish family comes in to buy snacks. The girls are in dresses and bonnets and the boys are in pants and suspenders. This is important because it shows us that ‚ÄúThere was no gender confusion in this family.‚Äù
* **Chapter 5:** Mark is asked to come to a (presumably secular) college campus to talk to some Christian students. Once they start talking about politics, a student interjects that ‚Äú‚ÄòThere is supposed to be freedom from religion,‚Äô‚Äù to which Mark smugly responds ‚Äú‚ÄòThe opposite is in fact true; there is supposed to be freedom \*of\* religion.‚Äô‚Äù This story is the launching point for the rest of the chapter, where Mark insists that the government should not be in church but the church should be in government because of reasons.
* **Chapter 6:** Mark tries to rent space at another local church to host his college group. Upon meeting with the pastor, she asks Mark if he believes in the apostle Paul, and he says yes. She responds by laughing in his fact and saying ‚Äú‚ÄòWell, you shouldn‚Äôt believe in Paul because he‚Äôs a sexist, misogynist, bigoted homophobe and should have never gotten into the Bible!‚Äô‚Äù



##Projections

Mark tells on himself frequently throughout the book, lamenting ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù situations or heavily projecting his own experiences onto Biblical figures. These projections include:

* **From Chapter 2:** ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe that some people are totally depraved and wicked, you are naive, gullible, and susceptible to destruction.‚Äù
* **From Chapter 13:** \[In reference to the Pharisees\] ‚ÄúJesus also didn‚Äôt appeal to them, and He wasn‚Äôt approved by them. He didn‚Äôt make it through their process to be considered acceptable for their conference, publishing house, seminary, or Bible college.‚Äù
* **From Chapter 13:** \[In reference to the Pharisees attacking other believers\] ‚ÄúThis leads to a lot of unnecessary character assassinations and creates a community where even the young novices in their freshman year at an unaccredited Bible college go online to critique lifelong Bible teachers.‚Äù
* **From Chapter 14:** ‚ÄúAnyone who disagrees with the spirit of the Sadducees, yesterday or today, is attacked and ignored for being out of touch, outdated, primitive, unlearned, uncouth, repressive, intolerant, bigoted, and behind the times.‚Äù (I am convinced he got a YouTube comment that said something like this and it made him so mad it had to go in the book)



##Christian Nationalism

Chapter 7 of this book is subtitled ‚ÄúShould a Christian be a Nationalist or a Globalist?‚Äù Based on that, I am sure you can imagine the racism and xenophobia that permeate this chapter. It‚Äôs the most blatant racism in the entire book and, while not unexpected, is gross and hateful. I don‚Äôt see a need to go through every shitty argument he presents in this chapter, but I will pull out some highlights for you as to Marky Mark‚Äôs thoughts on globalism and nationalism:

* He claims that there is a Muslim community in Detroit who operates outside of US law. While there is a thriving Islamic community in Detroit, they are still following US law like anyone else who lives here
* He argues that Abraham Lincoln was the¬† ‚Äúmost important American to fight against slavery‚Äù and that slavery would never have ended in America if it weren‚Äôt for Christians who fought against it. (He conveniently leaves out the part where [we also used scripture to justify American slavery.](https://time.com/5171819/christianity-slavery-book-excerpt/))
* He goes on a side tangent about how the media is ‚Äúso hostile to the Christian faith‚Äù and muses that this is because many Christians are Republicans and only 3.4% of journalists are Republicans. The study he cites is from Syracuse University and it does seem that, as of 2022, that this number is correct; however, this same study also says that [only 36% of journalists identify as Democrats and that the majority of journalists (52%) identify as independents.](https://newhouse.syracuse.edu/news/survey-of-journalists-provides-insights-into-the-state-of-journalism-today/) This study also talks about the harassment and death threats that journalists receive, regardless of political affiliation, but Mark doesn‚Äôt want to talk about *that.*
* He claims George Washington led Congress in a 2-hour worship service as part of his inauguration; spoiler alert, he did not. There was a worship service but it was led by [The Rev. Dr. Samuel Provoost](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-first-president/inauguration/new-york), the Senate chaplain at the time.
* Towards the end of the chapter, Mark lists off a bunch of examples of globalism, including the UN, the WHO, NATO, NAFTA, and cryptocurrency. [However, did you know that Mark‚Äôs church will accept tithes in crypto?](https://thetrinitychurch.com/) Guess Jesus is cool with globalism if it benefits him.



##Grammar and Structure

Mark‚Äôs writing is, to put it mildly, disorganized and often incoherent. This book is self-published and it is very clear he did not bother to hire an editor. There are typos, grammar mistakes, run-on sentences, and rambling passages that could have better articulated his points if he had bothered to have an editor review it. In almost no chapters of the book does he answer the question posed in the title, instead opting to go on long meandering side tangents with some seminary school words thrown in. He often makes references to ‚ÄúBible scholars‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiblical commentaries‚Äù without bothering to name the scholar or commentary and why their opinions should be trusted. Some of these include footnote citations but many do not. It is unclear exactly who the audience is for this book; half of it is written like Mark is trying to impress his theology professor, and the other half is written like he‚Äôs talking to 2nd graders about why Jesus is important. It‚Äôs simultaneously pretentious and condescending.

He is also a fan of using what I affectionately call \*\*Long Ass Citations\*\* - most of the book is written using footnotes (or no sources at all), but frequently throughout the book he uses these super-long parenthetical citations within a quote. Something like ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a quote from a Bible commentary.‚Äù (Author Name, ‚ÄúChapter or Article Title,‚Äù Editors, Book Title, Publisher Location, Publish Date.) They‚Äôre clunky, ugly, and take up a ton of unnecessary space in the book. Maybe Mark was trying to hit a word count?



##Conclusion

After 15 chapters of racist and homophobic rambling mixed with some right-wing talking points, Mark prepares to tell us how to vote like Jesus. He makes sure to let us know that he is ‚Äúa Christian, conservative, and a Republican, in that order‚Äù (which I‚Äôm pretty sure is something Mike Pence would say all the time?), and that he is ‚Äúfurther to the right than the modern-day Republican party.‚Äù To his credit, he also offers some insights on how policies outlast personalities and that we should vote carefully based on the policies of the person - this is the one point in the book where we agree. At this point, Mark finally tells us how we can vote like Jesus:

1. Choose to abstain entirely
2. Cast a protest third-party vote that won‚Äôt mean anything because your candidate can‚Äôt in
3. Hold your nose and vote for a candidate who actually has a chance of winning

And that‚Äôs the end of the book, save for a brief author bio in which Mark suspiciously does not mention the nearly 20 years he spent being a pastor at Mars Hill - it just says he and his family have been doing ‚Äúvocational ministry‚Äù since the 90s and that he founded his new church in Scottsdale, AZ.



##Accidentally Good Band Names

One thing Mark accidentally does well in this book is come up with some fire band names. Here they are in case anyone else needs a cool and irreverent band name:

* Bred Them For Bedlam (ch. 1)
* The Antichrist Loves Globalism (ch. 8)
* The Satanic Six (ch. 8)
* Counterfeit Prophets (ch. 9)
* Red Letter Losers (ch. 14)
* Pathetic Progressives (ch. 14)



##Final Book Stats

* Long Ass Citations: 28
* Mentions of Marxism: 10
* Mentions of ‚Äúgender confusion‚Äù: 7
* Mentions of ‚Äúgender mutilation‚Äù (only used in reference to trans people and never about circumcision): 5
* Accidentally good band names: 6



This book was terrible and Marky Mark is a sad, insecure little man who is more interested in puffing up his own manhood than actually helping people be informed voters. I left an Amazon review on the book as well and it‚Äôs currently voted the most helpful review. So I guess that‚Äôs something. **0.5/5 stars.**

GW: 130
5'1, 37 yr old F

Just wanted to check in with y'all!
We're on day 2 after my first shot and I'm feeling pretty great! I think they gave me a .12

I'm a little scared to over eat, so I've been eating small amounts several times throughout the day, as that has been suggested in this group and by vloggers.

I felt a bit fatigued yesterday, but it could've been because of my drop in calories.
Maybe also because of a panic attack when the doctor called and said my white blood cell count was higher than normal.
After i dropped off a urine sample yesterday, she called today to let me know that it's not a UTI but probably because I smoke a pack of cigarettes every day.
I have to reduce my smoking and go back for another test to see if that was the cause.

Aside from that scare, things are good!
No nausea or headaches.
I do have tiny burps, but they don't seem sulfury.
I haven't had a BM since my first shot on Tuesday, so I'm going to eat more fiber at dinner tonight to try and keep that in check.

I noticed the feeling of fullness comes on stronger and quicker almost.
It feels kind of foreign to be honest.
I'm not used to eating slowly or smaller portions.
Little more heartburn than usual but nothing Tums didn't help!

What I've eaten the past two days:

Day 1
-Tuna salad sandwich before shot
-Grilled chicken salad with vinaigrette for two meals
Day 2
-Palak Paneer microwaveable wrap from Sprouts. I ate the whole thing and ended up tooooo full about an hour later. Probably should've only eaten half.
-A microwaveable single serving of vegan Pad Thai in a pouch from Aldi.
-Two crackers with fresh ground honey roasted peanut butter before bed
-Coffee with two creamers and a tiny bit of sugar.

Day 3 (today)-
I had HALF of a fried Chick fi la sandwich with Colby jack cheese, lettuce, honey mustard and a tiny bit of mayo. No sides
I made especially sure to eat that slower so I didn't overdo fried foods, which i hear is danger zone lol
-Shared a diet coke with my boyfriend

Hoooooopefully I don't regret the Chick fi la sandwich, we'll see! üòÖ

No alcohol since Sunday or Monday- Really hoping to kick that for the most part!
I'm a bit of a heavy drinker, but I'm not missing it right now which is awesome!

I know everyone on here is struggling and have probably tried everything and researched everything. I guess I am just hoping that someone might by some miracle recommend something that helps me to sleep or cope with the current situation. It feels like I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun. Supplements, sleeping medications, relaxation techniques, trying my best not to think about it, praying, vitamins, antidepressants etc. Currently I‚Äôm getting 30 mins to 2 hours of sleep a night for almost a year. It‚Äôs seriously affecting me cognitively, physically, mentally, my relationships and work. I‚Äôve been lucky to have my mother helping me with things but cant expect it forever. I am very desperate like many of you here. So I guess I am basically looking to see what has either helped people sleep and cure their insomnia or what helped them cope during the day other than coffee. Reading my post, I seem neutral but I‚Äôm breaking apart inside and out and can‚Äôt imagine this reality much longer.

1g5y0m0,https://i.redd.it/9zc6w8rl2dvd1.jpeg,Vancouver Island (and Seattle) Whiskey Trip,"Visited my sister in law and her family on Vancouver Island and made sure to hit up plenty of distilleries along the way.

The Strath Ale Wine & Liquor Merchants: a boutique liquor shop in Victoria that had way too many exciting things and I had too little time to explore. Spoke with a few employees for a while including the owner Adam and was able to try a few of their store picks including a cask strength Benromach (delicious) as well as the bottle I ended up taking home, Stillhead‚Äôs 100% BC rye finished in a PX cask ‚ÄòThe Iberian Cascadian‚Äô that just won ‚ÄúBest Single Cask Whiskey‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Cask Strength Whiskey‚Äù at the Canadian Whiskey Awards 2024. Honestly wish I had like two more hours to hang here as they have a huge selection that also includes SMWS bottles. Highly recommend a visit here if ever in Victoria. Also left with a 50ml of Glenfarclas 15.

Devine Distillery: Unfortunately these guys are closing their operation at the end of the year, but we visited and took advantage of their 25% off everything sale. I picked up their Ancient Grains quarter cask which has a mashbill of barley, spelt, emmer, khorosan and einkorn. As a baker this really intrigued me and am looking forward to trying it. My brother in law took home their double oaked single malt which we drank together and it was really delicious. Sweet and oaky. Thanks for the recommendation Adam. Also, if you do get out there before the end of the year, the location is ridiculously beautiful and a stones throw from Bouchard Gardens.

Shelter Point Distillery: A beautifully situated farm distillery on the coast in Oyster River, BC that makes single malts and now rye. Enjoyed a tasting and left with their Cask Strength Single Malt. Other highlights were their Ripple Rock expression (aged in alligator charred new oak) and their Smoke Point (aged in ex peated islay barrels.)

Wayward Distillery: Small distillery in Courtenay, BC that specializes in spirits distilled from and/or infused with local honey. Tried everyything they make (complimentary tastings!) including their Raspberry Gin but left with bottles of Krupnik spiced honey liquor and their coffee and cocoa bean infused vodka called Depth Charge. Really unique spot - the Krupnik is going to be awesome for the holidays.

Copperworks Distillery: Flying out of Seattle to head home I only had one day in town (and Westland was closed unfortunately) so I decided to check out Copperworks. They are founded by beer lovers and brewers and you can taste it in their product. They have a long fermentation and also cold lager their wash before distilling. I got a distinct craft beer taste in all their offerings that make them a unique pour. I left with their Farmsmith expression which features a single varietal of barley developed by WSU bread lab and grown all on one farm from one season in Washington. Nose was extremely butterscotch and sweet with the palate following suit but adding more complexity.

Other Pickups: Was hoping to be able to visit Macaloney‚Äôs Distillery but timing didn‚Äôt work so I took home a tasting pack I found in a local store. Also found a 375 from Odd Society in Vancouver called Community that is distilled from a double ipa from Bomber Brewing.",6,1729190315.0,bcwhiskey,5,1.0,False

She is medically retired from armed forces. Two kiddos boy 12 and girl 4. Intimacy deteriorated since daughter born 4 years ago. Average once every two to three months only if i initiate. She has completely changed since daughters birth. No energy, no libido, migraines, weight gain, always moody. I work full time and take care of everything bill wise and house chores and kids on weekends.  Wife takes kiddos to school and takes care of home workdays. We pretty much rotate. But the anger and arguments and divorce threats are really getting to me. Went to counseling 5 times over the years only because I requested. I applied every tool we were advised. Nothing worked. I bought love languages books, couple games, coffee mugs for wife appreciation, marriage rules decor, flowers, candles, write letters everything you can think. No effort from spouse.

For instance, son birthday just passed. Bought him a new Xbox. Wife joked with me last night she was going to play it. I joked back and said please don't. Two words. All hell broke loose from me saying that. She begin saying I treat her like a child, don't talk to her so demeaning, that was hurtful, brought up things I did and said ten years ago, and started just screaming over please don't. I was so stunned I had to leave and sleep in my car at wal mart as it was 11pm and my daughter was sitting there saying stop fighting. I couldn't believe how quickly things changed. 

We are not struggling financially or anything. I supported her since 2018 splitting half my $10k per month salary with her. I gave her half the tax return every year, paid off her car, paid off her CC, sold my house gave her $12k of the proceeds. And only recently stopped once her retirement went through. Six years straight financial support. She got a fat check from retirement back pay and gave me nothing. Offered me nothing. Not even a dinner date.  My dad said it's peri and I should leave her. but I don't know my kids are really important to me. I buy stuff all the time for her recently a $100 pillow to support her back that she says always hurts. Got a thanks but it's not my birthday response. Kind of want to throw in the towel on this marriage because I am doing everything right as a man and I can't keep doing this especially after last night. 

For my birthday, I asked her to do one thing and just write me something. She gave me a cup of assorted halloween candy from Walmart and a cake. Shittiest gift I ever received from a woman. I confronted her and she said there was nothing to say in writing. I left it at that.

I feel like I am walking on glass and eggshells. If I get asked am I hungry and say no thank you I get yelled at for not allowing my wife to do anything. Then it spirals from there. It never ends. The smallest thing sets her off.


I am not argumentative and a very mellow romantic detail oriented planner type of guy. I love thinking and solving problems. I have structure and balance and make high income money. Finance is my background. I know people like to tell one side of the story but I honestly don't know what I am doing wrong as a man.

I remember having 3 coffees a day and sleeping not well. Then i watched a serial just next day learnt about als. After i googled twitching i saw als and due to serial i got quite panicked. My son was around 2 years. I had to carry him and pick him all day different times. I still do. I read the article where all athletes twitched after exercise and mostly on muscle they workedout.  My twitches became bodywide. I twitch in total of at most 50 a day. If i dont drink coffee, dont lean on my forearm while i work and sleep well it is maybe just 10 a day on various part of the body. It is like this for last 8 months. I recently increased coffee again and today after americano i got thenar twitches maybe 20 times in 2 hours kind of twitches moved my thumb. It made me anxious. I have been to three different neuro all clinicals are clean last one was 2 months ago.  just bilateral active knee reflexes no one offered emg. I have no weakness. I bought flowmeter for lungs and hand dynamometer and my numbers are same for the last 6 months. I do daily balance tests and all is good. No family history of mnd. I dont have any cramps. I am a scientist so i read all the literature. I did not see any literature twitching without any other symtomps turned to MND after 12 months. Yet i am still not relaxed. I daily check reddit bfs groups and also drug development. One of the neurolog i visited said he also had twitches and also his wife. But after their anxiety passed their twitches disappeared and he told me all tired muscles would twitch due to anxiety. I think i fuel my anxiety and stress that is why twitches persists. This increases cortisol which increases twitches similar to morning twitches. I feel i will only relax when they find a treatment which i think they are getting very close. What helped me is when people shared their doctor experience and their attitude towards twitching.  I want to thank people who shared their doctor visits seems doctors do not care about twitching without weakness and they see many patients with bfs. ",1,1729190045.0,BFS,1,1.0,False

We're flying into Haneda, arriving in the afternoon on Sunday, 11/3. We have five full days in Tokyo, then traveling to Hakone/Gora where we stay for two full days, then traveling to Kyoto where we stay for four full days (including a day trip to Osaka, and finally traveling back to Tokyo for another five full days (including a day trip to Yokohama). I know that there is a lot packed into each of these days so we're looking to see if our expectations are unreasonable. I've tried to group things based on proximity/neighborhood using Google Maps but it's hard to get a sense of scale and know how long we'll take at places and also travel between them. We're still working on our ""must haves"" and will continue to research and refine, especially based on the feedback here.

This sub has been an invaluable resource for ideas and I have admittedly wholesale stolen a bunch of great ideas for our trip so I wanted to leverage the community's expertise again to kindly ask for feedback on the below itinerary. The itinerary is laid out on specific days just for ease of organization, but for the most part it can be rearranged if there is a compelling reason to do so (with the exception of Tuesday, 11/5 since we have tickets to teamLabs Borderless and want to see the Tori no Ichi festival which only happens that day). We're considering them as blocks of time in specific neighborhoods that can be rearranged as needed, so essentially I would appreciate advice on whether we're doing too much in a day and/or we are missing something cool based on our interests. Speaking of which...

We're (collectively and individually) into coffee, beer, bikes, records, shopping (thrift and otherwise), shoes, video games, and museums. I've covered a lot of this hopefully in our itinerary, with some specific examples as well as going to areas that are known for being good places to explore those interests. I have a separate spreadsheet with restaurants and bars listed out, but haven't included most/all of those here so please feel free to make suggestions for your favorites in the areas/neighborhoods we'll be visiting. We're also very much into people watching and window shopping, as well as just randomly exploring so we're not afraid of taking off on a whim and seeing what we can discover culturally and attraction-wise.

Regarding food, I have a number of places saved on a Google Map and will be doing more research up until we leave but if anyone has good recommendations for the following please do let me know:  tonkatsu, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, curry katsu, yakitori, sushi, pizza, noodles of all sorts (ramen, soba, udon, etc.) chuka, and anything that is local/special to the towns we'll be in. We're visiting from Seattle so we have access to good Japanese food already (obviously not as good or varied as the real deal) but we're adventurous eaters and looking forward to really taking advantage of our trip food-wise.

1. baking soda spread out in freezer and on every shelf in fridge, let sit for 24 hours
2. mopped floors with pine sol to try and mask scent
3. took apart all shelving & scrubbed down fridge components with baking soda/water mix
4. ozone machine for 30 mins (helped in short-term? smell came back overnight)

my next ideas are:

* cleaning the fridge drip/condensation pan 
* simmering vinegar + water mix on the stove (this seems temporary?)
* spreading coffee grounds on cookie sheets and leaving inside fridge & freezer for a few days

if those don't work either, i'm really not sure what to do next. what's stumping me is that the inside of the fridge/freezer seems okay, i'm not getting a strong smell from inside after cleaning thoroughly -- but the kitchen area itself is BAD...like, old fish & meat bad

has anyone in a similar situation had any luck with specific methods/products? thanks in advance!",1,1729189999.0,CleaningTips,4,1.0,False

1g5xsrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jackery/comments/1g5xsrl/uses_for_lowcost_jackery/,Uses for low-cost Jackery,"Hello friends!

This year I've had some real-world experiences with power stations and solar panels.

I visited friends who invited me to stay with them, and it seemed like a good time to try tent camping in their field beside their house. I had my Jackery 500 with me, and a 100 watt folding solar panel.

Morning coffee was pour-over, and the boiling water was provided by a small rice-cooker. Each time I boiled the water it used about 12% of the Jackery's charge, drawing about 292 watts. That gave me several uses throughout the day, including using that same rice-cooker for heating soup. I quickly made eggs with one of those mini-dash griddles, rated at 300 watts but mine was about 280 watts. Takes very little time to heat up, and only 2-3 minutes to cook the egg.

One night got a bit cold, so I tried out the electric afghan my wife gave me. It's ac, not dc, and on high, it pulled about 65 watts, on low about 54. I couldn't have run it all night on the jackery, but it was plenty to warm up the bed and turn on a couple times during the night.

It also powered my laptop and kept my phone charged. I was fortunate in that the sun was available at full-blast during the day so pulling in nearly 75 watts constant, the Jackery charged up nicely.

Then, less pleasant circumstances: Hurricane Helene. Being at the foothills, we suffered only trees down and power outages. I used a Vtoman to keep the fridge and small freezer running, but the portability of the lightweight 500 allowed us to move it around to the rooms we needed light (LED bulbs are so great) and even watched a DVD and our TV each night. I also had some movies on a USB drive, which saved the power from the DVD.

Now that said, yes, for emergencies more power is great. But that comes at a price... a dollar price and a weight price. So if you'll allow me to offer advice... don't discount the usefulness of a 500 watt power station. Buy some of the right things (like the rice cooker and mini-dash appliances), whether it's camping or emergencies, you'll appreciate how practical it is.",4,1729189751.0,Jackery,0,0.84,False

But the point is both Asim and Shalin were centre of attention in their seasons. But here, only Avinash is getting footage but Shehzada who is also active (that's why almost all of housemates are so comfortable with him including Eisha and Avinash as well), is not able to get any footage. Did love angle or anger issues are only ways to get some footage for him. Because he can't do fake fights properly as we have already witnessed with his last fake fight with Avinash on coffee.

Hope to those that struggle with mental health,"This one‚Äôs for those with ADHD, depression, PTSD, OCD,anxiety, insomnia, bipolar, bpd. The ones that are/have struggled with substance abuse, suicidal tendencies/ideation, self harm. The ones that feel like they aren‚Äôt ‚Äò‚Äôsmart enough‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äôgood enough‚Äô‚Äô. The ones that are struggling to make ends meet, the ones with traumatic childhoods, the ones with so many responsibilities that you barely have time for yourself and for the Godless.

You can do this.

I cleared step 1 after 8 months of dedicated prep. My aim for this write up is to give you hope. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember coupled with borderline personality disorder. I have average intelligence and below average memory. For most of my life, up until two years go, I was suicidal to the point its a miracle I‚Äôm even writing this right now (Took therapy and medication to stabilise me). I won‚Äôt bore you with my life story and cut to the chase.

I studied 3 hours a day for 8 months (started 1st Jan '24) during which I had days and even weeks where I could barely get off the bed. My triad was June-Aug which I extended to Sept- Nov (Don't hesitate to extend if you have to). You see posts of people studying for 8 hours a day which is unfathomable to me. Some people here be like: ""I woke up at 4am to study, ate raw eggs with the shells, did 2 NBMEs in 30 mins, ran a marathon, did 10% UW all in 2 hours, 2000 Anki cards in 15 minutes and have 7 hours to spare"". Bish I can barely do 40mcqs/ day. 

 I used 93% of UW with 47% correct. My NMBEs were:

1st May: 28 with 52%
25th June: 27 with 56%
4th July: UWSA1 41%
9thJuly: 26 with 54%
1st Aug: 29 with 57%
18th Aug: 30 with 60%
28th Aug: 31 with 58%
7th Sept: 25 with 65%
12th Sept: Old free 120 with 73%
18th Sept: New free 120 with 60%

3rd Oct: Exam day

People here with 75%+ asking if they're ready. Ignore them. But also don't take my scores as validation that you should give your exam with low scores. This post is to give you hope and show that despite low scores you can clear it. You just have to keep at it. Consistency and quality is more important. Work smart and work hard. Don‚Äôt give up. I know it's easier said than done and I know this sounds cliche as heck but you have to truly believe in yourself. You can clear it.

What I did:
BnB, FA, UW,  Sketchy, first 3 chapters of Pathoma, a little bit of Dirty Medicine and Randy Neil. I did a lot of Mehlman pdfs and a lot of his questions on yt (I personally dislike that person because of how he SA-ed women). I won‚Äôt lie though, his material was one of the biggest reasons for passing. His audio Qbank was a game changer. He taught me how to approach questions, what they‚Äôre asking, what they want. The biggest thing after you‚Äôve covered the content is knowing how to answer questions. 

What I wish i did:
I didn‚Äôt like Anki so I didn‚Äôt do it but I wish I had. It would‚Äôve helped a lot. Do flashcards in any form, ideally Anki but if you struggle with that you can make your own on paper (I kind of did that). I didn‚Äôt do pathoma aside from the first 3 chapters but I wish I had. Dr. Sattar teaches very well and it would‚Äôve given me a boost and helped me a lot with concepts. I‚Äôve heard Bootcamp is better than BnB. I wasn‚Äôt aware of Bootcamp when I was covering syllabus but I do wish I at least checked it out. 

Exam day:
First, I had 5-6 hours of sleep, without which I couldn‚Äôt have done this. I can‚Äôt emphasise the importance of a good night‚Äôs rest. Keep food, coffee, painkillers, jacket and anything else you think you‚Äôll need. Shut off your emotions just answer and move on. I didn‚Äôt have an issue with time management. You can look up strategies for that on this sub. Second, the questions aren‚Äôt hard but they aren‚Äôt easy if you haven‚Äôt studied. The questions that felt like complete curveballs, that I was sure I didn‚Äôt know, were answerable after reading the stem a few times. Keep reading the vignette multiple times for questions you think you don‚Äôt know. Even the factoid ones. People complain about the long vignettes but don‚Äôt realise how helpful they are. The smallest clue can help you come to an answer. Think outside the box. I messed up biostatistics which felt like 50% of the paper. While in reality it was <5% of it. Don‚Äôt let the questions you don‚Äôt get or answer wrong break your spirit during the exam. I coped with this by convincing myself that the ones I‚Äôm getting wrong/don‚Äôt know are experimental and they aren‚Äôt marked. I didn‚Äôt allow myself to acknowledge I was tired and that surprisingly worked. I didn‚Äôt feel tired during the entire exam but melted the second I got into the car. 

Keep your cool. Believe in yourself. Keep covering even if it's a little, but keep pushing. I had to read Davids Goggins‚Äô book ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt Hurt Me‚Äô to put me in the mindset I needed when I first started studying. It‚Äôs a battle but you have to keep fighting. Somedays you won‚Äôt be able to, and that‚Äôs okay but you get up again when you‚Äôre ready and you keep moving forward.

I was with my friends, having the time of my life, when I got the email and found out I passed. In that moment, surrounded by everyone I love, I was happy I didn‚Äôt unalive myself. It may or may not get better. I don‚Äôt know. But for me personally, I‚Äôm in a better place now and I‚Äôm glad. 

For the ones that aren‚Äôt able to clear it, it's okay. We live in a world of infinite possibilities. This one exam doesn‚Äôt dictate your life unless you make it so. I got into the worst med schools when I aimed for the best. That defeat CRUSHED me. In retrospect, everything worked out. We‚Äôre merely a speck in time and space, in the grand cosmos. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You can cry, you can scream, you can break down. You‚Äôre only human. But you get back up. You get back up and you try something else but you keep moving. You're worth more than an exam. You are nothing short of a miracle. Please be kind to yourself.

In more than 500 deliveries I have only picked up coffee once and they had a lid with an open slit and was not sure if that was common or not?,2,1729188734.0,doordash_drivers,11,1.0,False
