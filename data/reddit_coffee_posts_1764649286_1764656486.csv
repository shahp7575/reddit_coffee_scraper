hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the ultimate bullfighters event on 12/06. resorts world is awesome but parking on the strip is always a nightmare, especially when you are trying to leave right when that friday afternoon rush hour traffic hits.  
  
first, and honestly the best option if you can snag it, is checking out an app like prked. it lets people rent out their private driveways or garages right next to resorts world. it's usually way cheaper than the casino rate and you get to skip all the traffic and congestion in the main garages, plus the walk is usually shorter than finding a spot on floor 7 of the official structure.  
  
for resorts world itself, the official parking situation is pretty straightforward but pricey. self-parking is a flat $21 for the whole day, and valet starts around $40 . they do charge event pricing sometimes, so don't be shocked if the sign is a bit higher than that $21 when you pull in . if you do park here, the north-end garage is reportedly a much shorter walk to the resort entrance and casino floor than the south one .  
  
pro tip for resorts world free parking: if you are a nevada resident with a local license plate, your self-parking is complimentary . also, if you signed up for the genting rewards players club, the elite tier or higher members get free self-parking (imperial tier gets free valet) . check your card status if you have one.  
  
now for the tricky part-timing. the 1:30 pm start time means you're trying to leave around 3:30 pm or 4:00 pm, which is the exact start of the weekday commuter rush hour in vegas . the strip is already slow 24/7, but the freeways and surface streets near resorts world will be brutal . if you park in the main garage, one insider tip is to actually wait an hour after the event is over-grab a coffee or walk the casino-so you miss the big wave of cars trying to exit all at once .  
  
if you want to avoid the $21 fee entirely, there are two solid walking alternatives:  
  
1. \*\*wynn/encore:\*\* they offer a generous 3 hours of complimentary self-parking for everyone, regardless of what you are doing . resorts world is right next door; the walk is only about 1.1 miles, which takes 15-20 minutes, and it's a nice easy strip walk .  
2. \*\*fashion show mall:\*\* this is another great option as the mall often offers free parking and is also very close to resorts world . the walk is around 14 minutes (just over 4,000 feet) and puts you right on the strip near the venue .  
  
there are also still a few other places like circus circus or treasure island that have free self-parking too, if you don't mind a slightly longer walk . good luck with the bullfighters, hope this helps you save some cash and time!",1,1764656468.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1pc17oc,https://i.redd.it/rpn2npdjhq4g1.jpeg,Finally finished all of the work on my Silvia.,"Bought my Silvia V3 secondhand a month or so ago from someone who I'm guessing never cleaned or descaled it. I fitted it with a new brew gasket and IMS shower screen, rebuilt the steam valve, stripped down and cleaned the OPV, which would change the bypass pressure dramatically if you tapped it - It was jammed with limescale.

Yesterday I finally finished modding it and getting it clean enough that I wasn't getting chunks of limescale flushing back in to the water tank, and little specs in the drip tray and blind basket. I don't think there's a part of the machine that I haven't touched.

Mods include an XMT7100 PID and SCR, the OEM Rancilio boiler wrap, a pressure gauge teed off the pump, and a steam wand from an Ascaso Duo, as well as a bottomless portafilter, better basket, etc.

I'm really impressed with it, and the quality of coffee it makes. Not regretting the purchase or all the work it's taken to get it here one bit.",1,1764656454.0,ranciliosilvia,0,1.0,False

At first you prepare yourself, expecting the same welcome you’ve gotten from the rest of your homeland, only for him to offer you some of his meal. A foreign dish consisting of a sort of meat in a sort of patty-esc shape, placed between 2 pieces of bread.

""Hello, Brave Tarnished. Do not fret, I am not an enemy, nor am I native to your home. You could call me a scholar, of sorts... Perhaps a Researcher?” He takes a bite out of the strange sandwich-like dish he’s prepared himself. “Maybe… the details matter naught, in the end…” He brushes the crumbs of bread off his hand and stretches it outward towards you.

With a handshake, you introduce yourself. Noticing the tone of circumspection in your voice, he places his hand over his heart. “The Erdtree and your precious Elden Ring are not my interest, if that is what you’re chary of. I am a Knight belonging to the Order of Avalār. I am here to study the Blights in this land, along with assisting this land’s denizens with their troubles.” His voice gets softer, lower, almost like it’s not meant for you. “There is already so much malice in the world, we are not here to add to it…”

The sounds of crickets and crackling fire start to fill the empty air, before he finishes his meal. He reaches over, offering you an item wrapped in a delicate cloth. The shape of the gift almost resembling a hook. “I understand that here in the Lands of Gold, you Tarnished are able to use these ‘Furled Fingers’ made of a substance called ‘Corpse Wax’.”

Attached to the cloth’s binding is a piece of parchment reading “Avalar” in elegant writing. “I also understand that by focusing on a word, it can help you call out to even the strongest of warriors.” The knight leans closer to you, placing a hand on your shoulder. “If you are ever in need, please do not hesitate to call upon me, friend. I, Enoch Koh, Avalāriem Aegis and Knight of the Order of Avalār, shall be by your side at a moment's notice. Be it for your travels, or battles, my Essence will heed your call.”

# Konichiwassup, Brave Tarnished

I am an RL713 who can switch between aggressive and supportive combat. Utilizing Erdtree Heal, Warming Stones, Minor Erdtree, Uplifting Aromatics, and a Crimsonburst Dried Tear; I can keep both the Host of Fingers and myself alive to the best of both of our abilities. Combining this with Starlight Shards and Lulling Branches, I ensure that I will stay in the Host’s world for as long as they may need me.

I also do much more than just helping people with Bosses. I heavily enjoy exploring the Open World and Dungeons, seeing things I haven’t before. I’ve played this game a lot and I often find myself going the same routes as I always do, helping people out gives me a chance to see more of this game that I normally would have missed. I also help improvement with PvP and PvE, however I do not claim to be good at any of these things. My primary goal is to be an immersive and fun experience in a game where everything wants to kill you.

# Exploration

I will often stick to the Host, as an NPC would, following and assisting in any combat. When I am accompanying new Tarnished, I will often alert my Host by calling out to them. An environmentally aware Host can then follow me to various Key Items such as Golden Seeds, Perfume Bottles, Scadu Fragments, and many more. The Host can also inform me of anything they are looking for and I can lead them to it once we are in the area. The DLC is my second home, I spend more time vibing there more than anything, sticking mainly to Rauh and  Belurat/Enir-Ilim. Thanks to this, I have every Scadu Fragment in the DLC marked on my map.

# Improvement at Player vs Player?

I can spar with you for as long as you need, I even have an Un-Upgraded Loadout so there is less risk of you dying during live exercises. If you want to get better in certain aspects, I can do that as well. Need to get better against Invaders? Summon me as an Adversary for various types of Invaders you’d run across, in a Non-Toxic Environment. Want to get better at being an Invader? I can summon you as an Adversary and you can get a feel for what’s right for you.

# Improvement at Player vs Environment?

I have a RL713 character with +0 Equipment that I’ve almost beaten the Base Game and DLC on. Here you can Explore, Fight Roaming Bosses, or Vibe with Me. As a Cooperator, you won’t have to worry about losing your Runes or Invaders, since the RL and Upgrades are so different. Have a friend who wants to get better or just be an Adversary? That’s fine too, the more the merrier. Toxic Players Will Be Blocked.

# Communication?

Direct Messages are perfectly ok with me, however I do not do VoIP. Much like most of the Ashes in-game, I don’t typically speak. This is because I’m typically in a party or otherwise unable to use my headset, however I will rarely make an exception. I do not accept random Friend Requests on a whim.

Learning how to make cold coffee at home is easier than you think—and it’s the perfect way to enjoy your favorite brew without the heat.**

Whether you want a quick iced coffee or a creamy, frothy delight, this guide will show you simple steps to create a delicious cold coffee that suits your taste perfectly. Keep reading to discover easy tricks and tips that will turn your coffee routine into an exciting, cool experience you’ll look forward to every day.

# Cold Coffee Basics

Cold coffee is a refreshing drink loved by many. It blends rich coffee flavor with cool, smooth texture. Knowing the basics helps you make the best cold coffee at home. Simple steps and the right ingredients make a big difference.

Start with good coffee, fresh ingredients, and the right tools. This guide covers all you need to know to prepare a tasty cold coffee easily.

# Choosing The Right Coffee

Use coffee with a strong flavor for cold coffee. Dark roast or espresso works best. Instant coffee is also a quick choice. Avoid weak coffee; it tastes flat when cold. Freshly ground beans give the best aroma and taste.

# Essential Ingredients

Basic ingredients include coffee, milk, and sugar. Use cold milk for a creamy texture. Sugar or syrup adds sweetness. Ice cubes keep the drink cool and refreshing. Some people add vanilla or chocolate for extra flavor.

# Tools You’ll Need

A coffee maker or espresso machine helps brew coffee. A blender or shaker mixes ingredients well. Use a tall glass to serve. Measuring spoons keep ingredient amounts right. Ice trays and a refrigerator are important for chilling.

# Classic Cold Coffee Recipe

Cold coffee is a refreshing drink loved by many. The classic cold coffee recipe blends strong coffee with chilled milk and a touch of sweetness. This simple combination creates a smooth, tasty beverage perfect for warm days. Follow these steps to make cold coffee at home quickly and easily.

# Brewing Strong Coffee

Start by making a strong coffee brew. Use more coffee grounds than usual for a rich taste. Use filtered water and your preferred brewing method. A strong brew keeps the flavor intense even after adding milk and ice.

# Cooling Techniques

Let the brewed coffee cool to room temperature. Pour it into a clean container and place it in the fridge. Cooling prevents the ice from melting too fast and watering down the coffee. Avoid hot coffee directly on ice for better taste.

# Mixing With Milk And Sweetener

Use cold milk to mix with the chilled coffee. Add sugar or your favorite sweetener to taste. Stir well to blend the flavors smoothly. Pour the mixture over a glass filled with ice cubes. Enjoy your classic cold coffee fresh and cold.

# Instant Coffee Cold Brew

Instant Coffee Cold Brew offers a fast and easy way to enjoy cold coffee. It uses instant coffee powder and cold water to create a smooth, refreshing drink. This method saves time and avoids the wait needed for traditional cold brew.

The process is simple, making it perfect for busy mornings or hot afternoons. You get a rich coffee flavor without the bitterness that sometimes comes with hot brewed coffee cooled down.

# Quick Preparation Steps

Start by dissolving 2 teaspoons of instant coffee in 1 cup of cold water. Stir well until the coffee powder fully dissolves. Add sugar or sweetener as desired and mix again. Place the mixture in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours to enhance the flavor. After chilling, stir once more and pour over a glass filled with ice cubes.

# Customizing Sweetness And Flavor

Adjust the sweetness by adding sugar, honey, or flavored syrups. Use less or more based on your taste. Add milk or cream for a smoother texture. Vanilla or caramel extracts give a nice twist. For extra richness, try a scoop of ice cream on top. Experiment with flavors to find your favorite blend.

1pc14yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pc14yq/the_digital_currency_end_of_times/,The digital currency end of times!,"In our world, cash didn’t disappear loudly.

It disappeared politely.

They  will call it “progress,” “convenience,” “security.”

But in the underground, it was known by another name:

**Ledger Zero.**

Officially, the new system was said to be coordinated through institutions like World Economic Forum, implemented through central banks like the Federal Reserve, and “inspired” by experiments such as Bitcoin.

That was the story people were meant to hear.

The real story?

Ledger Zero didn’t just track money.

It tracked *you*.

# Phase One: Replace

Physical cash vanished under the excuse of:

* Crime prevention
* Hygiene
* Efficiency

Soon, the average person couldn’t buy coffee without the new currency app.

No app.  
No life.

# Phase Two: Observe

Ledger Zero introduced something called:  
**Dynamic Valuation**

In theory, it adjusted prices based on the economy.

In truth…

It adjusted prices based on **you**.

Your currency account learned:

* How angry you get
* When you’re lonely
* Whether you shop when sad
* How easily you comply

Two people standing in the same store?  
They paid **different prices** for the same item.

And never noticed.

# Phase Three: Influence

Then came the “health incentives.”

Missed a medical appointment?  
Your food cost more.

Read “harmful content”?  
Your transport options shrank.

Spent too much time offline?  
Your entertainment subscription quietly doubled.

No punishment.

Just *friction*.

Enough to nudge you.

Enough to soften resistance.

# Phase Four: The Lock

Finally, Ledger Zero introduced the feature the engineers feared most:

**Compliance Mode.**

It didn’t deny you outright.

It *slowly squeezed*.

A little hunger.  
A little boredom.  
A little isolation.

Until most people became…  
quiet.  
predictable.  
manageable.

# The Glitchers

But not everyone synced cleanly.

Some people felt:

* Headaches
* Disorientation
* Sudden mood shifts
* An urge to throw the phone away

These were called “hardware sensitivity cases.”

In the underground?

They were called:

**Glitchers.**

People whose nervous systems could *feel* when the system tried to recalibrate them.

People who got headaches when others numbed out.

You might be one of them.

# The Truth File

The Glitchers found an archive.

Buried.  
Encrypted.  
Unlabeled.

Inside it, one line flashed again and again:

>

# The Resistance

Not with weapons.

With:

* Offline trades
* Paper codes
* Spoken words
* Memory
* Trust
* Rebelion

1pc14h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/transconnection/comments/1pc14h3/a_little_romance/,A Little Romance,"Elias had always been a creature of quiet routines. Tuesday nights meant the same corner booth at the same coffee shop, a notebook of half-formed poems open in front of him, untouched while he people-watched and tried not to feel lonely.

That’s when she walked in.

A flash of teal hair, a leather jacket that had clearly lived a life, and a laugh that sounded like she already knew the punchline to the universe. She ordered her drink — lavender latte — and took the booth across from him. For a moment, her eyes met his, and his chest did a little stutter.

He didn’t talk to strangers. But he found himself saying, “Is that any good?” like his mouth had decided to improvise without consent.

“It tastes,” she said, leaning forward, “like someone distilled hope and anxiety into a cup.” Then she smiled. “I’m Riley.”

They fell into conversation like they’d been saving up years of dialogue. Movies, bad poetry, quiet hometowns — everything spilled out easily. By closing, she tapped her number into his phone and told him not to make her regret trusting his face.

They started seeing each other. Park walks turned into late-night ramen and unhurried mornings. One night, on a stretch of boardwalk where the ocean roared just for them, Riley exhaled sharply, the way someone does when bracing for judgment.

“There’s something you should know,” she said, voice carefully neutral. “I’m trans. If that changes things… I’ll understand.”

Elias blinked, surprised only that she looked so scared. He took her hand gently.

“It doesn’t change who I’ve been falling for,” he said. “But thank you for telling me.”

Her lips parted, like she was trying to hold in disbelief — then she kissed him. Slow, grateful, real.

From that night on, the romance deepened, carrying the soft courage that comes from two people choosing each other fully. He learned the right ways to show up; she learned she didn’t have to shrink to be loved. They were messy, imperfect, still figuring things out — but every step was taken together.

1pc13qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kitchen__Appliances/comments/1pc13qo/fresh_water_within_reach_why_a_countertop_water/,Fresh Water Within Reach: Why a Countertop Water Dispenser Just Makes Life Easier,"If your kitchen counter is already busy with a coffee maker, toaster, air fryer, and who-knows-what else, the idea of adding one more appliance might feel a little ridiculous. But a countertop water dispenser is one of those quiet helpers that actually earns its spot. It doesn’t buzz, blend, or fry—but it does something you use every single day: it makes getting clean, good-tasting water incredibly easy.

Whether you’re trying to drink more water, stop buying heavy jugs, or just keep the family from crowding around the fridge dispenser, a countertop water dispenser can be a surprisingly practical upgrade.

**What Is a Countertop Water Dispenser?**

A countertop water dispenser is exactly what it sounds like: a compact unit that sits on your counter and gives you filtered, [room-temperature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/room-temperature), cold, or sometimes even hot water at the push of a button or turn of a knob.

Depending on the design, it might:

* Use **bottled water** (like 3- or 5-gallon jugs) that sit on top or load from the bottom
* Have a **built-in reservoir** that you fill with tap water
* Include a **filtration system** to improve the taste and quality of your water

Some models give you just cold and room-temperature water. Others give you hot water for tea, instant noodles, or coffee—basically like having a mini water station on your counter.

**Why People Love Countertop Water Dispensers**

You don’t truly appreciate one until you’ve had it for a week. Here’s what usually wins people over.

**1. Super Convenient Hydration**

Instead of reaching into the fridge for a bottle or waiting for tap water to run cold, you have instant access to water that’s ready when you are.

* Kids can serve themselves without juggling heavy pitchers.
* You’re more likely to refill your own bottle because it’s so easy.
* Guests don’t have to ask where the water glasses are—you can just point to the dispenser.

When something is simple and visible, you’re more likely to use it. That alone can help everyone drink more water throughout the day.

**2. No More Lugging Cases or Jugs (or at Least Fewer)**

If you’re used to buying bottled water by the case, you know how much effort—and space—that takes. With a countertop dispenser that uses filtered tap water, you can cut way down on:

* Single-use plastic bottles
* Heavy grocery bags
* Stacks of bottles taking over the pantry or fridge

Even if you use large refillable jugs with the dispenser, you’re still dealing with far less waste than individual bottles.

**3. Better-Tasting Water**

Let’s be honest: some tap water just doesn’t taste great. A countertop water dispenser with filtration can help remove [chlorine taste](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38471095/) and other off-flavors, making it easier to enjoy plain water.

When water tastes clean and fresh, you don’t need to hide it behind sugary drinks, syrups, or endless iced tea.

**Types of Countertop Water Dispensers**

A quick look online will show you lots of options, but most fall into a few main categories.

**1. Bottled Water Dispensers**

These use large jugs (often 3 or 5 gallons) that sit on or inside the unit.

**Pros:**

* Great if your tap water isn’t very good
* Simple to use—just swap out jugs
* No plumbing or complicated installation

**Cons:**

* You still need to buy or refill jugs
* Lifting full jugs can be heavy
* You need a little storage space for extra bottles

**2. Filtered Reservoir Dispensers**

These have a tank or reservoir you fill with tap water. The water passes through a filter and is stored ready to dispense.

**Pros:**

* No jugs to manage
* Good for renters or small apartments
* Often more compact and lightweight

**Cons:**

* You need to refill the reservoir regularly
* Filters need to be replaced on schedule

**3. Hot and Cold Countertop Dispensers**

These are a bit more advanced and can give you hot, cold, and sometimes room-temperature water.

**Pros:**

* [Perfect for tea, coffee, oatmeal, or instant soups](https://www.opensciencepublications.com/wp-content/uploads/IJN-2395-2326-11-280.pdf)
* Cuts down on the need for a kettle
* Convenient for families or offices

**Cons:**

* Typically a bit pricier
* Use more electricity than basic models

**Features That Actually Matter**

When you’re comparing countertop water dispensers, it helps to look beyond the marketing and focus on what will make a difference day to day.

* **Size and height** – Check the dimensions and how much vertical space you have, especially if it goes under cabinets.
* **Capacity** – Larger reservoirs mean fewer refills, but they also take up more space.
* **Filtration** – If it has a filter, consider what it removes and how often it needs to be replaced.
* **Temperature options** – Do you want just cold water, or hot and cold? Think about how you actually use water throughout the day.
* **Ease of cleaning** – Removable drip trays, smooth surfaces, and accessible tanks make maintenance much less annoying.

 

**Keeping Your Countertop Water Dispenser Clean**

Because it deals with drinking water, a little basic care is important:

* **Rinse and clean the reservoir** according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
* **Wipe down the spout and drip tray** regularly to avoid buildup.

1pc11bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pc11bt/questions_about_night_shift_pay/,Questions about night shift pay?,"Hi Reddit, I don’t usually make this kind of post but I’ve been having some problems at work. Just for some background, I work the night shift alone at a 24hr car dealership. I don't know why we’re open 24/7, I think its some kind of gimmick. We’ve cycled through 6 managers in the last 2 years and I don't think any of them have had enough time to actually rethink the idea. Anyway, when the promotion started they offered an extra 5 dollars an hour to whoever took on the night shift, so I jumped at the chance. Since then, its pretty much been a perfect 2 years for me, there are basically no customers, and those that do come are usually only there because they need to be so the close rate is great. I also get a tonne of free time, I’ve actually become fluent in French since I started the night shift due to all the extra time. I’ve only had a couple run ins with weird customers which have only been a problem because the company is too cheap to actually hire security (although they usually get temporary security after the incidents). I realize that a lot of that information seems unnecessary, and it might be, but I think it should help to illustrate the problem that I’m having.  

   
So for the past 2 months I have been having a regular customer, which as you can expect is pretty strange for a car lot (when I say regular customer, I really just mean regular browser). This guy comes in, walks around the lot, looking at cars, kicking tires, coming in for coffee and cookies, etc. The first few times he showed up he didn't come inside, just walked around the car lot looking around. After the 3rd or 4th time he came around I decided that he might be waiting for someone to help him so I braved the night and went to talk to him, the conversation went like most conversations with customers, all very standard. I walked around the lot with him for a while while he told me about all the different cars he was interested in. We walked around for about 2 hours that night (you do get pretty bored when you work alone every day) but I didn't make a sale. He came back, not the next day, but a few times over the next week, each time I would go out, walk around the lot with him, just talking about whatever came up, his family, his job, his insomnia, etc. The whole thing became very routine, at that point I really didn’t expect to make a sale, it was just something to do to pass the time.  

  
This all sounds pretty good I imagine (or my standards are low from working nights for the last 2 years), but about 2 weeks ago things started to get uncomfortable. During one of our walks the topic shifted to politics, something which surprisingly had never come up over our month of conversation. Normally this guy is very calm, he has a polite presence, and has never made me feel uncomfortable, but as soon as the topic shifted, I could tell he was getting angry. I didn't say much, and I tried to reroute the conversation as much as I could, but he just kept getting angrier and angrier, until he was yelling at me in the parking lot, face red, covered with sweat and spit coming from his mouth. Until recently this is the most scared I have ever been in my life. I basically ran inside the building and locked the door behind me, he looked sort of shocked and just stood there outside before shuffling away, I think he might have been embarrassed.  

  
The next few days he didn't show up, but my stomach was in knots the entire time. The idea that someone who honestly I considered a friend could become dangerous so quickly really scared me. Before anyone says, I have considered asking to switch to the day shift, but the idea of actually putting a focus on the night shift (and making my extra $5 an hour go away) is kind of not something I want even if I’m scared. I know that they have offered security in the past but that was 3 managers ago, and I just don't want to risk it. When he did finally show up, he brought a large goodie basket with him, full of different things that we talked about over the month that he's been coming by, snacks, drinks, even a video game that I had talked about wanting. I tried to tell him that it was okay and he didn't need to worry about it, but he got kind of forceful, not like before, its hard to describe but his tone was nice but still kind of scary (at the time I just assumed it was because of the previous experience that I was reading into it). I accepted the gift, and I was ready to come up with some excuse to get him to leave, but he told me that he knew it was better for him to leave, and he apologized for blowing up at me. The apology basically boiled down to “Sorry I’m going through a divorce and my kids have been having similar conversations with me and I just blew up.” Both of these issues had not come up in our previous conversations.  

  
I didn't see him again for another couple days until last week when he started coming around again. When he came back, he acted like everything was normal, to the point of being even more friendly than he was before. Instead of walking around the lot, he now comes into the showroom, usually bringing small gift, at the start of the week I tried again to say it wasn't necessary but like before I got a very forceful order to keep it, and I could see him heating up again. I now realize I didn't describe him much at the start, but he is a white man, mid 50s, well put together with slicked back grey and black thinning hair and a matching black and grey moustache. He usually wore warm sweaters when I first met him, but since the weather has changed he has worn a nice looking leather jacket. All of this is to say that he is normally very put together. However, over the past week and a half he has deteriorated, physically. I don't think he has showered, all of his clothes are covered in sweat stains, and I think he may be sleeping in them. His visits are much shorter than they were in the past, and his behaviour is very erratic, on Wednesday he was friendly, it felt almost like he was back to his old self, he joked around, and I was starting to feel like he was just hitting a rough patch, but the very next day he was angry, stomping around the show room, yelling about his wife and kids, how ungrateful they were. The really scary part was when he got calm and told me that I was never ungrateful.  
  

All of these times I have considered speaking to my manager, telling her that I need security, but I haven’t gone through with it. If he stayed longer I might, but its 15-20 minutes out of my night, and it just hasn’t seemed worth it to me. I feel really stupid now but I don't know that was my thought process.  

  
As I’m writing this the police left about an hour ago, I’m not at the dealership anymore, I don’t want to say where I am, but I don't think he can find me. The police gave me an escort just in case, so I think I’m alright. Okay, I’m really not looking forward to writing this next part.


When he came in today he practically ran to my desk, sweaty, hair all over his face, and his lips pulled back in something like a smile, like he just couldn’t wait to see me. I just cant get the sight out of my head. He clumsily lunged onto the counter and started flailing to grab me. He caught my arm and started mumbling about how I need to come with him, how he did everything for me. I had been crying this entire time (I still am honestly) so I couldn’t see super well but I managed to scratch at his face which I think shocked him. He stumbled backwards and cracked his head on the ground, he wasn't unconscious and I could hear him mumbling. Im sorry I don't know what he was saying. I ran into the managers office and shut and locked the door behind me. My phone was on my desk when he came into the showroom, and the office phased out desk phones in favour of personal devices (with the exception of the showroom desk), so I had no way of calling the police at this point. Outside the office door I heard his footsteps and a massive crash as he repeatedly slammed into the door. I yelled at him through the door that I called the police on the office phone, the slamming halted and he started pleading with me to let him in. I stayed silent and after a minute I heard him walk away from the door. I waited in the room for an hour before leaving to call the police for real on the front desk phone (my smartphone was gone and has not been found).  

  
The police arrived shortly after. They informed me that the man had committed familial homicide before coming to find me. He has not yet been apprehended.

I spent two years after college unemployed, applied to over 200 jobs, and only got a response from 10. I did all sorts of coffee chats, reaching out to other school alum, personal networks to no avail. When I finally got my job, it was because I diligently, repetitively, almost annoyingly reiterated to the recruiter day after day if there were any updates regarding my application, and that I was so extremely interested in working here. This is also a job I got a referral for, but felt the need to constantly follow up. 

Fast forward to now, I am trying to refer a friend to an open entry-level position at the company I work for. I referred this person twice in this round already. Once was when we got a company wide email to start sending in resumes for people we want to refer internally. I followed up with the email to which I got the response that the application is being reviewed. When the position became publicly available again, I had this person submit an application that I “boosted” through filling out the referral google survey. Still she got no response from my company. Through reviewing her resume, it looked way better than mine when I applied and she got a whole masters degree that is highly relevant to the position. 

Why is it that companies not only ignore most applications, but also are now starting to “ghost” internal referrals? In my job search, I too have been ghosted by a few referrals. Why can’t these companies just straight up say no? Are these referrals even getting reviewed? I feel awful for people who are still in the job search this just seems like such a huge systemic flaw.

1pc0wb4,https://v.redd.it/59sfm29feq4g1,Short Story: The Delhi Directive,"The Delhi Directive

The hum of the C-17 Globemaster’s engines was a lullaby Sullivan McAllister had known for twenty-five years. It was the sound before the storm. At forty-five, his six-foot-five frame, encased in a black tactical polo that did little to conceal the ripped physique of a man half his age, was a monument to disciplined habit. His hair, cropped short and peppered with gunmetal grey, was a stark contrast to the still-vivid blue of his eyes, eyes that had seen too much in places he’d rather forget.

Langley had been its usual sterile, urgent self. The briefing, delivered in a windowless room that smelled of stale coffee and anxiety, was stark. An international group, calling themselves “The Luddite Hand,” planned to disrupt the Global Tech Summit in New Delhi. Their rhetoric was anti-technology, anti-progress, a return to a purer age. Their methods, however, were brutally modern: a sophisticated, coordinated attack designed to kill thousands of delegates and executives and send the world’s economy into a tailspin.

“They’re not amateurs, Sully,” Deputy Director Crane had said, pointing at the holographic display of New Delhi’s sprawling convention center. “Their leader is a ghost. We have aliases, fragments. A man named Raza. Ex-Special Forces, Pakistan. Went rogue. He’s clever, connected, and he believes his own fanatical dogma. Your job is to liaise with RAW, plug into their intelligence apparatus, and stop this. You leave in two hours.”

Now, descending into the swirling heat of Indira Gandhi International Airport, Sullivan felt the familiar tightening in his gut. The mission was clear. The environment was not. India was a sensory explosion—a cacophony of car horns, the scent of spices and exhaust, a sea of humanity moving with a chaotic, vibrant energy that was the polar opposite of the controlled, silent halls of Langley.

The meeting at the Ministry of External Affairs was a dance of diplomatic niceties and veiled scrutiny. Senior officials in crisp kurtas offered warm welcomes and assurances of full cooperation, but their eyes were cautious, assessing the large American operative who moved with the quiet, predatory grace of a panther. They were proud, capable, and understandably protective of their turf.

It was then that she entered the conference room.

“Agent McAllister, this is Agent Priya Sharma. She will be your liaison and partner for the duration of this operation.”

Priya Sharma was not what Sullivan had expected. She was young, perhaps early thirties, with intelligent, dark eyes that missed nothing. Her hair was a long, dark cascade, tied back in a practical but not ungraceful ponytail. She wore a well-tailored linen blazer and trousers that, while professional, couldn’t hide a lean, athletic build honed by what Sullivan recognized as serious training. She was, by any measure, strikingly beautiful, but her beauty was sharp, like the edge of a finely crafted blade.

“Mr. McAllister,” she said, her voice firm, her handshake surprisingly strong. “I’ve been briefed on your file. Impressive.”

“Sullivan,” he corrected, offering a curt nod. “Let’s hope the file is the most impressive thing about this trip.”

The tension was immediate, a low-frequency current in the air. He was the seasoned, grizzled outsider, a bull being carefully guided through a delicate china shop. She was the brilliant, young native guide, tasked with babysitting the American bulldozer. On the drive to a secure safe house, the friction was palpable.

“Your agency’s intelligence on Raza’s possible locations is… broad,” she said, her tone neutral but laced with a hint of criticism. “We have more precise leads. The Luddite Hand has been recruiting disaffected youth from university engineering programs. Their idealism is being weaponized.”

“Idealism that ends with a bomb vest isn’t idealism,” Sullivan grunted, staring out at the chaotic flow of traffic. “It’s pathology. My approach is simpler: find the head, cut it off.”

“A direct approach. How very Navy SEAL,” she replied, a trace of sarcasm in her voice. “This is not a desert compound you can raid. This is a city of twenty million people. Subtlety is required.”

“Subtlety gets people killed when the clock is ticking, Agent Sharma.”

“Priya,” she corrected, mirroring his earlier tone. “And not if your subtlety is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.”

For two days, they worked in a tense, professional detente. Sullivan’s field craft was unparalleled; he could break down a weapon blindfolded and identify the maker of a pressure-plate IED from fifty yards. But Priya’s network was her superpower. Her sources, cultivated from the bustling markets of Old Delhi to the sleek tech parks of Gurgaon, fed them a stream of whispers and clues. She moved through the city’s social strata with an effortless grace he could never hope to match.

The breakthrough came from one of her university contacts. A brilliant but withdrawn PhD candidate in robotics had gone missing. His specialty? Nano-drones and dispersion systems. The perfect delivery method for a chemical agent.

They tracked the lead to a decrepit textile mill on the outskirts of the city, a supposed relic of the old world being used to plot the destruction of the new. Their raid was a synchronized ballet of violence. Sullivan’s raw power and precision cleared rooms, his suppressed MP7 coughing quietly in the dark. Priya was his shadow, faster, more fluid, disarming two guards with a devastatingly efficient combination of Krav Maga and Kalaripayattu strikes that Sullivan had to admit was awe-inspiring.

They captured the PhD student, terrified and remorseful, but Raza was not there. The leader was always one step ahead. But they got a name. A location. A warehouse in the wholesale market, where the final device was being assembled.

They roared through the crowded streets on a borrowed Royal Enfield Himalayan, Sullivan driving, Priya riding pillion, her body pressed against his back for stability, a partnership forced by necessity. They arrived at the market to the sound of a high-revving engine. Raza, spotted by their perimeter team, was fleeing on a fire-red Ducati Panigale V4.

“Dammit!” Sullivan snarled, spotting a Yamaha MT-09 parked near a chai wallah. He tossed a wad of rupees at the startled owner, grabbed the bike, and looked at Priya. “You coming?”

Without a word, she swung onto the pillion seat, securing her grip around his waist. “Try not to crash. The traffic here is slightly more unpredictable than a Kabul road.”

What followed was an insane, pulse-pounding symphony of chaos. The Yamaha wasn’t the Ducati, but Sullivan wrung its neck, weaving through buses packed with people, dodging recklessly crossing pedestrians, and sliding past ox carts with inches to spare. Raza was a demon on wheels, using his raw power to force his way through gaps that seemed impossible.

Priya was his second set of eyes, shouting warnings and directions into his ear, her voice calm amidst the roaring engines and blaring horns. “Left! Left between the trucks! He’s heading for the flyover!”

The chase ascended onto an elevated highway, the city sprawling beneath them in a haze of heat and pollution. Here, speed was the only currency. The Ducati pulled away, its superior engine screaming into the distance.

“He’s getting away!” Priya yelled.

Sullivan’s jaw was set. He tucked in, becoming one with the machine, his world narrowing to the strip of asphalt and the red speck in the distance. He saw Raza look back, a arrogant smirk visible even from this distance. It was his mistake.

A loaded vegetable truck, its rear gate dangling open, pulled out half a kilometer ahead of Raza. A cascade of large, round cabbages spilled onto the highway, creating a rolling, green minefield.

Raza saw it too late. He hit the brakes, the Ducati’s rear wheel fishtailing violently. He tried to correct, to steer through it, but physics was a ruthless opponent. The high-sided sportbike lost all traction. It lowsided in a shower of sparks, then began a violent, cartwheeling tumble down the highway, metal screeching and fragmenting against the asphalt.

Sullivan braked hard, sliding the Yamaha to a stop fifty yards short of the carnage. They approached cautiously, weapons drawn. Raza’s body was broken, twisted at an unnatural angle amidst the wreckage of his machine and the scattered vegetables. The life faded from his eyes, the arrogant smirk forever erased.

The device was found at the warehouse, disarmed with minutes to spare. The summit proceeded without incident. The world never knew how close it had come.

Back at the safe house, the adrenaline finally receded, leaving a profound, weary silence. The tension between them had evaporated, burned away in the fire of the chase and the shared triumph. It had been replaced by a deep, resonant respect, and something else, hotter and more urgent.

Sullivan was cleaning his Sig Sauer when his encrypted satellite phone buzzed on the table. Langley. No doubt Crane, ready to debrief and issue the next directive.

He looked at the phone, then at Priya. She stood by the window, the lights of New Delhi glittering behind her, reflecting in her dark eyes. She had taken her hair down, and it fell around her shoulders like a curtain of night.

Their eyes met. No words were needed. The friction had found a new, potent form.

Sullivan reached over and silenced the phone, letting the call go to voicemail. The world, and its endless demands, could wait.

He crossed the room in two strides. She met him halfway. There was no more tension, no friction, only the inevitable collision. His hands, capable of such brutal force, cupped her face with a surprising tenderness. Her arms wound around his neck, pulling him down.

And as the chaotic, vibrant heart of India beat outside the window, the seasoned CIA operative and the brilliant RAW agent finally found a mission they could pursue solely for themselves.",1,1764655378.0,IndianAmerican,0,1.0,False

Recently, I snagged a new 6 cup Imusa Aluminum moka pot with a silicone gasket for less than $9. Yay for on line bargains. It is cheaply made (the metal is thin), but it works very well.

Before my new moka pot, I had been drinking Yaocono Espresso (10 oz brick for $4.39) as a pour over, but then my local independent grocery store stopped carrying it. I have not been able to find it anywhere, so I switched to Sello Rojo Espresso (10 oz brick for $3.76) also as a pour over and it is great.

I put the Sello Rojo in my moka pot and it was even better. So Happy. It is a little bitter (as I like it), but it does not taste burnt and it seems to not be acidic at all.

I was running low on Sello Rojo and my local store was out, so I snagged a brick of El Morro (8.8 oz for $3.25) at an Aldi to try. That coffee tasted burnt in my moka pot. I made it as a pour over and it was better, tolerable, and not quite as burnt, but I won't be buying it again.

Finally, for the coffee snobs reading this, I have a new hand grinder and some Ethiopian medium to dark roast single source beans roasted locally in Chicago (not cheap coffee $17/lb) and it smells absolutely fantastic. I tried that in my moka pot today. It was very balanced and not quite as bitter as I like, but also a lot more effort than just using Sello Rojo and not really any better IMHO.

Sello Rojo Espresso in my moka pot just has that strong deep full bodied flavor, a little bitter, but not burnt and not acidic, just the way I like my coffee. It reminds me of the Cuban coffee my Cuban aunt served me when I was a child, but without the sugar (yes, I have been drinking coffee since I was 8 years old). It is ground perfectly for use in a moka pot.

Unrelated, but my husband, knowing my love for bitter coffee, jokingly tells people that I married him because I like bitter things. What does he know, he hates coffee and drinks green tea instead.

Years ago, I used to buy the 8 O'Clock Italian Dark Roast and I loved it, but it too has not been available in my local stores lately. I may order some on line directly from the company to try in my moka pot. I would also like to try the Youcono espresso in my moka pot if I can ever find it again. I am guessing it would be good. I am  curious to try the La Llave espresso  in my moka pot, but just have not gotten it yet and it is slightly more expensive.

So, is there anyone else who likes cheap espresso brands pre ground and sold in brick form for their moka pot?  If so, which brands? Please tell me I am not alone.",2,1764655214.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1pc0svm,https://www.reddit.com/r/burnedout/comments/1pc0svm/i_hit_a_breaking_point_from_overwork/,I hit a breaking point from overwork,"I had always heard about “burnout,” but I didn’t realize I was knee-deep in it until last year. I was 34, working 70-hour weeks at a startup and **utterly exhausted** every day. My mornings started with dread and three cups of coffee. My evenings ended with me collapsing on the couch, too tired to think or even sleep properly. One night I drove home and sat in the car in my driveway for an hour because I just **couldn’t summon the energy** to step inside. That’s when it hit me: this wasn’t normal fatigue; I was **burnt out** in every sense.

At my lowest point, I felt hollow – like I had nothing left for myself after work devoured my life. I missed my friends, I stopped going to the gym, and even small chores felt overwhelming. Worst of all, I lost the passion I once had for my job. I was running on fumes and resentment. After I broke down crying at work over a minor mistake, I knew something had to change. I took a week off (which felt “wrong” at the time, but I now realize how badly I needed it) and did some serious soul-searching. I read personal stories on this subreddit and realized I wasn’t alone in feeling this way. Burnout wasn’t a personal failure or weakness; it was my mind and body **screaming for a break**.

So, I started with one tiny act of self-care: every day, no matter how busy, I would take a 15-minute walk outside. At first it was weird to “permit” myself this, but soon it became non-negotiable. That little walk was when I decompressed and let my brain know it was okay to relax. Next I started turning off work email on my phone after 7pm. (The world didn’t end – who knew!) I began journaling before bed to dump out all my anxious thoughts. These sound like small things, but over a couple months, they made a **huge difference**. I was sleeping better, my constant tension headaches eased up, and I actually laughed again – genuinely – which I hadn’t done in a long time.

The biggest change was learning to be kind to myself. I had to accept that I’m human, not a machine. I stopped beating myself up for “not being productive” during downtime. Ironically, once I prioritized my mental health – things like short meditation, cooking a nice meal, seeing friends on weekends – my productivity *at* work improved. I had energy again. I started setting boundaries: I told my boss (nervously) that I’d no longer be available on Sunday afternoons because I needed personal time. And guess what, the world kept turning and I earned new respect at work for maintaining that boundary. By refilling my own cup, I could finally pour from it again in my career **without** feeling like I was draining my soul.

One tool that really helped me rebuild my life was an app I downloaded from app store. It’s basically a habit and energy tracker. I used it to log those little daily habits (walk, journaling, lights-out by 11, etc.) because I wanted a visual reminder to stay on track. It sounds silly, but seeing a dashboard of how I was doing in areas like “Mind, Body, Spirit, Drive” was motivating – it showed me that, for example, I was putting all my time into “Drive” (work/career) and neglecting the other parts of my life. That reality check kept me balanced. The app even has a feature called a “grace day,” letting you skip a habit once a week without breaking your streak. That was *huge* for me – it taught me that taking a rest day was actually part of the process, not a failure. Instead of my old all-or-nothing approach, I could miss a day of exercise or meditation guilt-free when I truly needed rest, and get back on it the next day. I’m not here to push any app, but I have to give credit where it’s due: that tool kept me accountable and reminded me *in a fun way* to take care of myself.

It’s been about 10 months since my breakdown-in-the-car moment. I won’t lie and say everything is perfect – I still have tough days. But I feel **alive** again. I wake up with energy, I’ve rekindled hobbies I love (even started painting again!), and my performance at work is solid without sacrificing my sanity. If you’re in that dark hole of burnout, please remember to be kind to yourself. You’re not lazy or broken – you’re a normal person who needs care, too. Take a step back, even if it’s a small step. It might just save you. **There is life after burnout**, and it’s waiting for you when you’re ready to reclaim it.",1,1764655074.0,burnedout,1,1.0,False

I've been mentally out for a year and physically out for a few months, and I have told my parents. (I live at home) and I had told them that they were welcome to tell any of the family members if they felt like talking about it and that I didn't want it to be a secret that I didn't go to church anymore. My dad had said something about how it ""doesn't need to be an announcement"" so I assumed that they probably didn't mention it to extended family and I was a little worried about my grandparents coming to visit for thanksgiving. 

Once my grandparents are here, my younger brother makes a jab (he likes to tease me and rage-bait me, he's 10.) saying, ""if you were mormon you wouldn't have had to work this morning"" (It was a sunday.) and my grandma jumped in being like ""(brother's name) don't say stuff like that"" so I'm assuming they know about my religious inactivity. On actual thanksgiving, we're sitting and eating dinner altogether, and I'm listening to my grandparents talk about plans to serve a mission together soon and my grandpa just starts bearing his testimony to us, but he's staring at me. Like barely looking away, just staring into my SOUL. Saying stuff like, ""I know deep in my heart that this gospel is true."" ""If you really give yourself to Christ you'll be blessed"", etc. and I'm just sitting there trying to maintain a little bit of eye contact as to not make it weird, but more than anything I'm just so pissed off. I'm just so sick of my family looking at me like I'm a lost sheep that needs guidance back to the one and only true church on earth and that I'm falling down a dark path. 

I really love my grandparents and my family but it's so hard to do ANYTHING with them because church HAS to be mentioned. My grandparents/parents can't go ten minutes without bringing up church callings or temple trips or youth activities or ward christmas parties, and everytime something church related comes up I have to sit silently and wait for them to stop talking about it or say something like ""oh fun"" because if I say anything that isn't overwhelmingly positive I'm being disrespectful to their beliefs. If I don't close my eyes during prayers, I get a frown from my mom and a head shake from my dad, and this absolutely enrages me because I don't practice their religion! I should obviously not be disruptive while they're praying, but if a non-member was in our house and they didn't close their eyes, I doubt it would be an issue. 

Everytime I mention something about how I have work on a Sunday, or that I went to a coffee place the other day, (and I'm not even bringing these things up just to rub it in their faces, it's essential to a story or conversation) and the energy in the room just becomes so uncomfortable. Like everyone gets visibly upset and like silent, and won't make eye contact with me it's ridiculous. Like even the idea of me not practicing makes them so incredibly uncomfortable.

The New York Knicks and Boston Celtics are set to clash in a rematch that’s less “friendly neighborhood showdown” and more “two tired boxers squabbling over the last energy drink at a gas station.” Let’s break down why this game is a statistical circus and why your betting app is probably sweating bullets trying to set the lines.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree

The Knicks (-2.5) are slight favorites despite the Celtics’ recent 42-point explosion against Cleveland. Why? Because stats don’t lie—well, sometimes they do, but in this case, they’re mostly honest.

* **Offense/Defense Face-Off**: The Knicks average **120.4 PPG** (5th in the NBA) and allow **112.9 PPG** (4th in defense), while the Celtics score a pedestrian **114.9 PPG** (21st) but stoutly defend (**110.9 PPG allowed**, 3rd). Translation: New York’s attack is a loaded cannon; Boston’s defense is a brick wall with a coffee addiction.
* **Rebounds & 3-Pointers**: The Knicks dominate the glass (**46.5 RPG**, 1st) and swat threes like they’re exes (**15.3 3PM**, 4th). The Celtics? They’re 16th in rebounds (**44.5 RPG**) and 4th in 3-pointers made but 18th in FG%—a team that shoots a lot but sometimes misses the basket entirely.
* **Implied Probabilities**: At FanDuel, the Knicks’ moneyline odds of **+198** imply a **50.5% chance to win**, while Boston’s **+186** suggests **53.8%**—a statistical tug-of-war that’s basically a stalemate. The spread? A meager **-2.5** for New York, which feels like betting the Celtics will lose a race to the buffet line.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Pritchard, and the Ghost of Tatum

Both teams are nursing injuries that could make this game a medical drama:

* **Celtics’ Absentees**: Jayson Tatum (Achilles), Derrick White (calf), and Neemias Queta (injury management) are out, leaving Boston reliant on Jaylen Brown (28.4 PPG) and Payton Pritchard, who recently scored **42 points** against Cleveland—proof that when you’re desperate, even a

1pc0bfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1pc0bfk/i_31f_am_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my_29m/,I (31F) am thinking of breaking up with my (29M) longterm partner of 8 years,"Hello everyone. 

I am making this post seeking advice. Essentially, I have been with my current parent for 8 years. We met when I was 23, and he was 21. Honestly speaking, we should've broken up in the beginning. I am an Indigenous person in Canada, and I experienced a lot of trauma growing up. From an abusive family, living in pretty severe poverty and going through the foster care system. When I met my partner, he was the first person I had ever truly dated, and he showed me so much unconditional love that I hadn't ever had before. He is the kindest, most loving, and supportive person I could ever imagine having met. He taught me to love myself and supported me to go back to school (I dropped out of HS) and held my hand over my very long 20s healing journey. I am currently doing my master's degree. 

In our relationship, we've had plenty of horrifying experiences. I was a very explosive person. I don't want to excuse my toxic behaviour - but in my family, yelling, screaming and breaking things was very very very common. Whenever my partner and I would fight, I would have massive, explosive freak-outs. It honestly was not fair to him, and he should've dumped me. However, a lot of these anger fits were due to his not cleaning (as well as me) and how he'd talk down to me. He'd also freak out and scream and break things. We never had any physical violence against one another; however, one time, he did throw my desk with my computer on it, and I slapped him. During that fight, he was surprised I hit him - as well as myself. I realized then I had a big problem and sought help. 

After going to therapy, I was diagnosed with ADHD + CPTSD, and I learned my trigger points. I learned how to communicate and how my trauma related to how I interacted with my partner. The past 3 years we have had a very healthy relationship. We no longer had those fights - and if we did, I knew how to articulate myself, and he in turn, learned how to help me in some ways with my ADHD. We haven't fought in years. I also struggled a lot with my own body and sexuality my entire life. I was a victim of a pedophile when I was 2 and a half years old when I was graped. From that point too - I was SAed by my adopted cousins, my brother's friend, and another teenager when I was 5 years old. Because of this, I have blocked out a majority of my childhood. Because of this, I held a lot of guilt and felt ""dirty"" my entire life. While other girls who were 15/16 were falling in love, losing their virginity etc, I was ashamed and hated my body. I had attempted suicide a multitude of times in foster care. Feelings of being abandoned by my parents were very prevalent. I spent a good amount of my late teens/early 20's homeless and sofa surfing while working a lot of shitty jobs. I went to university at 24 to seek answers about my family, and myself.

Back to my partner - there's always been resentment underlying things. For example, he wouldn't buy me things because he thought I wouldn't value them. For our anniversary this year, he bought me workout gear because he wanted me to ""be healthy"" - I was pretty hurt by this, as I had worked on a gift for him that took me 15+ hours to make. I'm doing my master's and living separately from him - and so, I've had a lot of alone time and exploring who I am again. I realized I had stopped doing the things I loved - stopped meeting friends - stopped living honestly. When he had come to visit, I was annoyed the entire time, and he had done some things I couldn't understand. He has a very calculative personality. There were a few things that came up - 1, I have to eat with my medication, especially in the evenings. I had told him a few times about this (as my class had a 45-minute window time), and he told me he'd order food or cook for me when I came back in between classes. I had articulated this a few times to him, and when I had come back for the break, he hadn't ordered/cooked anything and said he forgot. This made me spiral a bit - it made me feel like he never listened. On top of this, he had created an issue in which he didn't want me to get permission for him to stay with me in my dorm and was adamant about this. This meant I couldn't have my own key, and we had to sneak around the security guard, which added more anxiety. Later on, I disregarded his marks and got permission easily for him to stay 1.5+ weeks once a month. 

All of these things made me realize how much I disliked his nature. On top of these things, I am a person who likes little acts of love. So, bringing my partner coffee - or making him breakfast in bed, or picking up his favourite snacks on my way home, etc. However, he hasn't done these things to me in a very long time. I've been feeling unloved - even though he tells me he loves me all the time. Me living in a dorm too - it was because he suddenly decided he didn't want to move cities last minute. 

I also, as an Indigenous Person, have worries about dating outside my culture. Honestly speaking, I don't think other people have to worry about this as much. For me I am 1/4th Indigenous - which means my blood quantum is pretty low. My people have undergone a genocide - my great-grandparents attended a residential school, and a lot of my family has been displaced. Intergenerational trauma in my family is pretty intense. I feel a lot of guilt dating him because he is non-Indigenous, and I want children. I worry about my kids' blood quantum. Deep inside, I know this is colonial thinking - but realistically, thinking we are such a small % of the population. When I was younger, this stuff didn't matter to me - as I was just trying to survive. Now that I've gotten older and I am thinking of children, I've slowly started thinking of this. It also honestly really sucks not having him participate in my culture or ceremony or things of this nature. 

I have expressed all of these things to him. He's even told me he'd be willing to have our second child through a sperm bank (lol) and understands why I've been having these thoughts. 

After he had left his first visit, I had initiated a 7-hour conversation where I wanted to break up. I expressed everything here - my dissatisfaction with feeling like I have to push him to do the bare minimum of making me feel loved. That I don't want him to ask him to do things for me, that he should want to do things for me. I also told him I believe we were very co-dependent, and it has stopped us from growing. He cried a lot listening to me and essentially begged me to stay together - that he'd work on everything. One of my dissatisfactions, too, was that he had relied on me for everything. For his entertainment. He works from home, so he is always home. I never get alone time. And when I was home from class, and I wanted to sing / play guitar, he'd ask me to be quiet as he was working. This eventually led me not to want to sing anymore. I also felt suffocated. Constantly, I'd come home from class, and he'd be home, and I'd have to entertain him. He has no friends separate from me - except one person he'd rarely see. All his other friends are my friends from uni - that he hangs out with, too, with me. Anyways - I know I am rambling and it's a lot. I feel like such a child at 31. I don't even have my license, and I feel like I've just lost so much of my life to trauma. 

I love him a lot, but man, I'm so tired... I also really want kids in the future, but man, I am also worried about my age and if we were to break up, that I wouldn't find anyone who loved me and would want kids. I am terrified I am throwing away the best thing in my life. He even told me that he had been planning to propose to me during our 7-hour conversation of us thinking of us breaking up. I don't wanna break his heart, and I feel like a piece of shit to want to leave him. A big part of these issues is me. I want to break up - I know I should, but I battle with so many insecurities, and I feel as if I will regret this decision. I also know it'll absolutely destroy him. He wants to move to this city too - to leave his good paying job just to be with me here. I pushed that move to April when I am done with my first year, but man - it's terrifying if he DOES move here and then I decide to end things and ruin his life. I don't know wtf I am doing.

1pc0as8,https://www.reddit.com/r/monogamy/comments/1pc0as8/from_enm_to_monogamy_hopefully/,"From ENM to Monogamy, Hopefully","This is a personal story. No advice needed. But maybe some of you can relate?

Wife Polybombed me in 2018. Kind of.  We were having serious relationship issues at the time. Not the best way to open things.

She had a hair dresser who had just gone ENM so my wife picked up The Ethical Slut and soon after, proposed we try ENM.  I had mixed feelings about it, and I generally need time to process big decisions like that. Unfortunately, she was off and running by the time I decided I didn’t want us to open our marriage.  She would not stop.  She had 2 boyfriends in a month.  She had sex with people, breaking the marriage contract,  when I was still protesting to not be ENM. It was a very dark time for me those first few months in 2018.  I actually fantasized about suicide some.  My wife went way too fast into ENM and seemed to lack empathy for me.  I even filed for divorce, temporarily.

And then miraculously we found a great therapist and I also started dating to distract myself from what my wife was doing.  I do love sex. And I was able to get dates and start having sex. I was more into FWB arrangements.  My wife was more into actual romantic relationships.  I had a lot of fun and learned to manage my feelings of jealousy or possessiveness.

We practiced a form of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” or DADT, which I insisted on.  I’d never wanted to meet or know about any of her other partners.  She respected it. We both knew what we were doing when we had “plans” on a given night, but we didn’t need to talk about it.  It worked for us.  A year after our very tumultuous start into ENM, we had a groove going.

By the time Covid came around, my wife was disillusioned with ENM.  She found managing extra relationships to be too draining.  She’d neglected platonic friendships or some other aspects of our life.  She and I both had jobs and we had kids, and friends, and hobbies.  Like most people. She found ENM required her to give up some of those things.

For me however, FWB worked easily.  Low maintenance.  I continued to have fun.  Now here is where DADT was a problem.  She assumed we went back to Monogamy after Covid.   We didn’t formally discuss it.  And yes, I kind of suspected that she thought we were monogamous again.  So I was a shithead badge wearer then, because I kept having sex outside the marriage. But given the cold, rushed way she handled things originally, I felt entitled to my fun. I justified my behavior.  I still don’t feel guilty about it.

A year ago she found out I was having sex with others. She was upset, but not furious. At least at that time. I think she actually is sort of furious that I took control of things and I wasn’t under her control.  More that than feelings of jealousy from her.  She said she’d start dating others again. And she did /does. We are right back to the way things were before Covid.

She sometimes complains of being exhausted after working all day and spending time with her partners afterwards 1-2 times a week.   She neglects her platonic friendships again now, also. But she also must be getting something out of her relationships.  But she does sometimes say to me “Dating others sure makes me appreciate you more.”  Meaning the options out there must not be too great.

 As we age, I do value my time with my wife more. I’ve decided to stop seeing people a few weeks ago and am hopeful she’ll start to do the same. I figure I must model the behavior I want to see.  It can be hard on nights when she is away. She will be out this Tuesday and Thursday night for example. 

I know this will sound like a nightmare to many reading this.  While we have had our ups and downs, I am proud our marriage has lasted and we enjoy traveling and dancing and working out together. We have a coffee date every morning before work to talk and stay connected. Sex every weekend.  
I do adore her. And I’m willing to fight for us. ",2,1764653414.0,monogamy,6,1.0,False

Her truck took the sharp turns of the mountain road with ease. Dust curled up from the tires and drifted through the open window of her father’s ’97 Chevy. The truck had been towed to her apartment in the city after he died last year. Driving it reminded her of him: fishing in Clear Lake, nights at the drive-in.
They were memories long since buried, as the past always is, but somehow always clawing its way back.
Her long red hair flew wild in the cold mountain air.
It was hard to believe she hadn’t been home in ten years.

Her mother’s house was a modest two-bedroom near downtown. The old ranch-style home of her childhood was long gone, sold off to some venture capitalists hoping to cash in on scenic resort development.
A wooden sign hung above the door that read “Everyone’s Welcome Here”, painted in one of those old-timey holiday card fonts.
As she stepped out of the truck, the front door swung open. A woman in her late sixties came hurrying out or moved as quickly as her knees would allow.
“Sara, you made it!” her mother called out. “Come on inside. I made us dinner!”

“Wow, that dinner was great. Much better than I remember your cooking to be,” Sara joked as she put the dishes in the sink.
The kitchen was small. It was about the size of her apartment kitchen in the city, and much smaller than the one she grew up with.
This may not have been the home of her childhood, but the smells were there: her mother’s perfume, the stink of old dogs.
She could see herself finding a cozy spot here to breathe for a couple of weeks before heading back. Every once in a while, she kept telling herself she needed this, that she wanted this.
Family wasn't something you just shrugged off and left behind, no matter how painful the past had been. 

“When you get done there, go grab your stuff from the truck. I've got Alex’s room made up for you. It’s the second door on the right, past the bathroom,” her mother said, motioning toward the hallway.
The gray in her mother's hair caught Sara off guard.
It was strange for both of them. Sara and her mother had never really imagined growing older.
They never thought they would feel the weight of age pressing on their shoulders.

The screen door slammed with the wind. Sara leaned against the side of the truck. The soft hiss of a soda exhaling cut through the rhythmic rustling of the hills just before she took a drink. Light from the setting sun reflected off her brown sunglasses, casting a warm glow in the dusk.
This was her hometown, a place she once knew so well. There used to be open fields for miles around, but not anymore. Fast food joints, convenience stores, vape shops, and liquor stores now shaped the landscape of her youth.

She tossed the can into the recycling bin after finishing the last of the backwash. As she reached over to grab her two duffle bags from the passenger seat, she heard her mother calling from inside the house, asking what was taking so long and if she needed help.
“No, Mom, I got it. Just taking it all in. It's been a long time,” Sara called back, loud enough to be heard over the wind.
She picked up her things and headed back inside.

The posters on the walls were the same ones she remembered. The pin-ups the boys loved when she was growing up still lived here in Alex’s room, untouched and frozen in time. The proportions of the room felt all wrong, but otherwise it was just like the old days. Sara moved her fingers down an old CD rack, pausing to savor the names of music she'd forgotten a lifetime ago. A stack of VHS tapes sat next to an old CRT television. It was the same TV she grew up with, the same one she and Alex used to watch Saturday morning cartoons on.

She reached over and grabbed the tape on top, the label reading July 4th. The rest of the label had been worn off, so the year wasn’t immediately evident.
Hooking her finger under the top, she flipped the cover on the cassette and exposed the videotape inside.
Staring into the depths of the magnetic tape, she could see the home movie play out in real time inside her mind.
When she closed her eyelids, the movie came in at an even higher resolution.
Roman candles flew over the old windmill as firecrackers exploded like movie-butter popcorn in the driveway.
A hand crept under a burger on a charcoal grill and flipped it in a ballet of carnivorous virtue.

""Alex, food is ready. Come grab a plate,"" she heard her mother call out over the sound of her father's boombox, tuned to classic rock radio.

In that hot July sunset, she saw the door to the backyard open and her mother motioned to someone in the doorway as she drifted back to the present.
Sara closed the cover and set the tape back on the stack.
She didn’t need to watch it. Her version would always be better.


“I tried to fix it just how he left it,” her mother said, motioning around the room.
“These women he had on his walls look damn near church-like compared to what you see today.”

She let out a chuckle, and Sara smiled.

“You okay?” her mother asked, a slight concern in her voice.
“Yeah. I’ll be alright. I think I’m going to ride down the strip, see what’s up with the old places.”

“Well, make sure you take the house keys in case I’m not awake when you get back.”
She pointed at the key rack as Sara got ready and headed out.

She rounded the corner on Main Street, passing the boarded-up remains of what used to be Hal’s Hardware. Its guts spilled out of the abandoned loading dock, a raw wound in the quiet street. She and her dad came here every summer when it was time to set up the pool. She remembered how heavy the chlorine jugs felt when she was a kid. She wondered how they’d weigh now. Further down the strip, new shops had popped up where nothing had been before: a corporate coffee chain, a big-box retailer, a franchise bookstore. The mom-and-pop stores of her childhood were now just a footnote in the town’s fading history. Just when it felt like she was lost in a foreign land, she spotted the familiar neon glow of Randy’s Dive. Yeah, it was exactly as it sounded. She pulled the truck into a spot near the door and made her way inside.

She was pretty sure no one had smoked in there for at least a decade, but that stink of slow death seeped from every wall and crevice. A cough felt inevitable, but she held it in. On the stage, a guy about her age played a Don Henley cover of a song she’d heard on the radio a thousand times growing up. He was all alone, just him and his guitar, the spotlight lighting him up like a messianic figure.

After heading over to the bar, she sat down on a stool.
“What can I get you, little lady?” the barkeep asked, moving a towel over a wet spot on the bar in front of her.
“That looks good right there,” Sara said, pointing to a beer on tap.
“Coming right up,” the barkeep acknowledged, swinging around to fill an icy mug.

The beer tasted good. Fresh and cold. Not like the IPAs she was forced to drink back in the city. This was actually bearable. It reminded her of nights at the old lumber mill back in high school, nights spent doing things she was told never to do.

""That's all I've got for tonight. Thank you guys for listening."" The guitar man stepped off the stage. Sara watched as he set his guitar in its case and thanked a couple near the back. Then he started toward the bar, and for a brief moment, their eyes met.

“Is anyone sitting here?” he asked, pointing to the stool next to her.
“No, there’s not,” Sara said, offering a small smile.
“Good stuff up there.”
“Yeah,” he said, nodding. “People like the classics. Brings them back to simpler times.”

The barkeep slid a cold mug across the bar, and he took a drink. After setting it down, he turned to face her.

“My name’s Mark.”

His eyes held the kind of sadness that felt too vast to name, like an ocean pressing against paper-thin glass, just waiting to break and spill over. She’d never met him before, but somehow she knew this was a soul that had weathered many emotional storms. 

“You play up here a lot? I’ve been gone for a long time. The town doesn’t look the same as I remember it,” Sara said, taking another drink.

“Nah, I’m only here for a couple more days. Then I’m back on the road,” Mark replied. He paused for a moment, thinking to himself. “It’s weird what you said, though, about it not looking the same. I’ve been through hundreds of towns now, and they all look the same to me. Seems like places used to look different, huh?”

He chuckled, though something in his tone lingered.

“You tour just playing covers, or do you have your own stuff too?” Sara asked, genuinely curious.

“Yeah, I’ve got some originals. People don’t really want to hear those, though. They want the old stuff. The classics. But yeah, the originals are why I do this. Maybe I’ll be a rockstar one day, maybe not. At least I’ll know I tried, and I won’t be staring down the barrel of old age with a lifetime of regrets and missed chances.”

He smiled and took a drink.

“If I wasn’t doing this, I’d probably be back home, barely making enough to eat, working some factory job, settling down with a girl I went to high school with. Out here, sometimes I don’t eat at all, but the bars usually give me free beer. And every once in a while, I get to talk to interesting people.”

Sara laughed, smiled a little wider, and took another sip.

The sunlight filtered through the white blinds beside the bed, warming the room with the glow of mid-morning. She turned to look at the clock. It was almost ten. She had slept the first part of the day away and had no regrets.

A business card rested on the nightstand.
“Mark Everley: I accept all paying gigs! Even bad paying ones!”
She couldn’t help but smile.

She and Mark had talked until closing time. He told her about growing up in Ohio, getting expelled from university, and the winding, uncertain life he had carved out on the road.
Sara didn’t say much. She just listened, smiled, and pictured his life as a series of truck stop postcards.

She had enjoyed their time together more than she expected.
And she found herself thinking she might go see him again tonight, if fate allowed. Maybe even catch more than the tail end of his set.

“Time to get out of bed. It's almost noon.”, her mother yelled from the living room. “Hey, quit exaggerating. It's not that late.”, Sara responded with a laugh. She slid off the side of the bed, and immediately began making up the baseball themed sheets and comforter. She stared at the diamonds on the dark blue bedspread for longer than she should have. A sinking feeling filled her whole chest. Some feelings can't be described in words. In the bathroom, she stared at herself in the mirror, wondering who this person is that she is now. She wondered how the world viewed her. The toothpaste tasted almost sugary as she brushed her teeth. It was something to kill some of the numbness of this exact moment. After she rinsed her mouth out she washed her face, she headed into the living room where her mother was sitting.

“No TV in here?” Sara asked with curiosity. 

“Nah, I never bothered to upgrade, realized I didn't need it. I got my books, and if I wanna see a movie or something I'll go down to the Twin Theater,” her mother responded, sounding strangely satisfied.

“I guess you still have that TV in Alex's room too if you ever had the urge,” Sara spoke as if offering a solution.

Her mother sat up in her reclining chair a little bit and leaned forward. “To be honest, I never really go in there. Washing the bedding and putting it back on was actually the first time I'd been in there in a couple of years.”

This took Sara by surprise. She couldn't imagine not stepping foot in one of her bedrooms for that amount of time.

“Are you doing anything today? Want me to take you to lunch? Maybe we can catch an afternoon show later on?” Sara asked her mother, just wanting to do something for her, something that might make her happy.

“Nah, I got some stuff for sandwiches here. I don't think there's anything I want to see at the show either.” Her mother responded with a kind of quiet resignation.

Sara looked down at the floor. She could feel a pressure in the room. It was like a massive balloon filled with words unspoken. A heaviness hung over the living room, a subtle darkness. A curse that could never be undone.

“Well, I was thinking about going for a drive again. The place has certainly changed from how I remembered it,” Sara noted.

“Well, please be careful out there. People drive like madmen these days. I guess they always did,” her mother responded.

“You wanna come along? I'll clean out all the junk from my passenger seat,” Sara asked, hoping with everything she had that she could get her mother out of the house for at least a little bit.

“No, it's okay. Go ahead. I'll make myself some lunch here, and I've got one of my mystery novels I need to get back to,” she replied with a little smile.

It wasn't the smile of happiness.
It was the smile of lost hope.
Of years and years of letdowns and tragic mishaps.

It crushed Sara to see her mother like this.

Driving past the old high school, Sara thought about how little she’d known back then. What would she even say to that younger version of herself? That things would be okay? She wasn’t sure she could say that. It wouldn’t be true.
Those days felt sun-bleached now, dipped in a warm orange haze, like an old polaroid picture with all its fades and imperfections. A different life. A different girl.

She stopped by Ruby’s for lunch, a little sandwich shop just down the street from the high school. She’d been here countless times as a teenager.

The checkerboard floor was still there, untouched by time. The tables sat in the same arrangement, like nothing had ever changed.
Walking in felt like stepping into a time machine. That was exactly why she came. It made her feel so much younger, like the past ten years had never happened.

Sara sat down at a table and noticed a familiar-looking waitress walking over.
“Hey, how are you doing today? Welcome to Ruby’s. Our monthly sandwich is the pulled beef, made right here in-house, and I’d definitely recommend it,” the waitress said, still looking down at her order notepad.

Sara looked up. “How are you doing, Madison?” she asked politely.

“Wow, it’s been so long. I didn’t even realize it was you. When did you get back into town?” Madison replied, finally meeting her eyes.

“I came in to see my mom. I’m only here for a couple days,” Sara said. “I’ve been doing well. How about you? How are things these days?”

Madison looked toward the ceiling and replied wistfully, “You know. Just trying to make it. I had to take this after I got laid off from my real estate job. I guess we’re just in a bad market right now for families buying homes. Plus, Dave’s income isn’t enough for us and the kids to live on alone.”

“Dave?” Sara asked curiously.

“Yeah, Dave Simmons. I’m sure you remember him from high school. We’ve been married about six years now,” Madison explained.

“Yeah, he always seemed like a great guy to me. Congratulations to you both,” Sara said with a smile. “That sandwich you mentioned does sound good, though. Let me try that?”
“Sure thing. I’ll get that right out to you, and I’ll bring you a drink cup,” Madison replied with a smile.

Sara could feel the tension between them. Madison didn’t really know what to say, and Sara didn’t want to reveal anything more.
As the waitress walked back to the kitchen, Sara wondered how things might have turned out if she had never left her hometown. If she had never seen anything beyond what she grew up with.

Would she have settled down with someone from high school? Had a couple of kids? Taken beach vacations in the summer and worked a job she hated until the day she took her last breath?

Would that have been a life fulfilled?

Would she have noticed the town changing little by little, or would she just wake up one day and realize it didn’t look like it used to?

These are all questions that she would never know the answers to, and maybe she didn’t want to know. Maybe ignorance is truly bliss.
Lunch was surprisingly good. Probably the best sandwich she’d had in a long time.Back in the city, most sandwich shops were corporate owned. The quality had been stripped away in favor of shareholder profits, and you could taste the absence. Places like this still existed across the country, but she knew they wouldn’t for long. While waiting for her food, Sara had noticed how empty the restaurant was, especially striking at lunchtime. It was the kind of observation that would stay with her, even if she wished it wouldn’t.

She left her payment on the table with a generous tip, waved goodbye to Madison, and said how happy she was to see her again. Then she headed out to the truck.
It was only mid-afternoon, but she figured she’d go ahead and stop by Randy’s. She was hoping Mark might already be there, setting up for the night.

As she pulled into the gravel parking lot, she spotted Mark sitting on the bench out front. He wore old-school black sunglasses and a faded t-shirt that once bore a band logo, now nearly erased from too many washes.

He looked up and gave a small wave, signaling he’d noticed her.

“How are you doing today?” Mark asked as Sara settled beside him.

“I’m okay. I wanted to get here early so I wouldn’t miss any of your music. Last night I only caught the covers. They were definitely good, but I wanted to hear some of your originals,” Sara replied with a smile, the hot summer sun catching on her white teeth.
A gust of wind blew dust into Sara’s eyes, and she slipped on her sunglasses. They sat quietly for a moment, listening to the sounds of the road and the low hum of music drifting from inside.

“So, where are you headed tomorrow?” Sara asked.

“Ah, somewhere down the road. Maybe two or three hours from here. Not a big town, probably something like this,” Mark replied.
Sara clasped her hands and stared down at the concrete beneath the bench, its cracks spiraling out like veins worn thin by time. The paint on the bench flaked away easily as she ran her fingers across it.

“You ever wonder what any of this is for?” she asked quietly. “Why we keep going, even when it feels like things just keep getting worse?”
Mark sat in silence.

When he finally spoke, his voice held the kind of quiet resignation she knew all too well.

“I think we keep going because we have to,” he said. “I used to think I was living for other people. Like they needed me. I’d get up every day just so they wouldn’t worry, so they wouldn’t be sad. But I never felt like I was actually adding anything to their lives. I was just... there. Background noise.”

He rubbed his hands together slowly, staring ahead.

“They’d probably feel it if I was gone. But not for long. I think, deep down, most of us know we’re forgettable. No one’s going to remember us in fifty years.”

He let out a sigh.

“I guess that’s why I’m out here. Why I’m wasting my life on the road. I know it’s all kind of pointless, but I still want to be remembered. Even if it’s just by one person. I want to know I mattered to someone. Even if, in the end, that someone turns out to be me.”

They talked more about their upbringings. Sara shared more than she had before, but not everything. No one ever shares everything.
They laughed over familiar memories, fell quiet over painful ones.

Eventually, they headed inside and had a couple of beers. Sara helped Mark set up his amp, and he showed her a few chords before the set.

It was her first time holding a guitar.

It felt good.

It felt right, in the moment she needed it most.

She grabbed a seat near the front as his set began.

He opened with the classics, the kind of dive bar anthems that got people in the drinking mood.

Songs that hit like a flood of memory, reminding you where you were the first time you heard them, and who you were with.
Then Mark shifted into a few of his own songs. They were quieter, more meditative, songs lived in, with pain etched into the walls of the houses built around them.

They reminded her of tunes she used to listen to on an old record player, the indie folk that shaped her formative years. She closed her eyes and saw herself back in her room, flipping through dog-eared magazines as the sounds crashed in waves from the small stage in front of her. It was a quiet kind of beautiful, the kind that destroys you from the inside with its sadness.

Mark finished his originals and returned to the classic rock fare. Sara had already told him she might head out before he was finished because she needed to go home and check on her mother. Mark had lost his own mother a couple of years ago, so he understood how much that bond means and what it feels like when it’s gone. He had her number and promised to call if he ever passed through the city again. There was something about him, something rare and deeper than most of the men Sara had dated over the years. She hoped she’d hear from him again.

It was dark outside when she stepped out of the bar. She could still hear Mark playing inside, a cover of one of her father’s favorite songs.
She knew all of his favorites and held onto the memory of them like precious artifacts, reminders of a man who once lived but was now gone.

As she climbed into the truck, the memories came rushing back. She realized how much she cherished it too.

Summer days with her father filled her mind, moments she would never get to relive.
What would he think of how she turned out?
Would he be proud of the woman she had become?

Regrets and missed opportunities followed her all the way back to her mother’s house, past every place she had once stood, every place where she hoped she had left a mark, a scar on the landscape of the town that shaped her.
Pulling into her mother’s home, she saw all the lights were out, even the front porch light. She could see a glow coming from the front bedroom, the one she had been staying in. The blinds that had filtered the sunlight earlier in the day now radiated a soft white glow out into the night. 

The buzz from the streetlight interacted with the sounds of insects in the dark. They danced in waves of synchronicity, the world thriving just waiting for order.

The house was dark when she opened the door. She could barely see where she was going. Sara followed the light from Alex’s bedroom, stepping over an empty liquor bottle on the floor. She didn’t remember it being there before. 

Alex’s door was cracked just slightly, enough for the light to spill out. Sara gently pushed open the door and saw her mother lying on Alex’s bed, the glow of the television lighting up her outline. Children laughing while firecrackers went off were coming from the TV’s speakers. 
She heard the voices of her mother and father yelling commands, asking everyone to be careful. “You’ll blow your hand off with one of those!”, her father chuckled, unworried because he knew he had taught them well. There was nothing to be afraid of. The whole future was ahead of them, and everything was going to be okay. They were times that seemed like a million years ago, the fourth of July celebrated with a Wooly Mammoth in the background. It also felt like it was only yesterday. 

Her mother looked like she was sleeping, and she didn’t want to wake her. Sara turned on the hallway light and walked back into the room. She turned off the old television and checked on her mother. She put her hand on her side and felt her breathing, slowing breathing in and out like waves on a calm ocean. Sleeping was how she was dealing with her pain, along with other things. Sara understood that now. 

“I love you, mom.”, Sara gave her mother a kiss before she lifted her hand. She looked back as she entered the hallway. Her heart broke into a million pieces looking at her mother, a woman that raised her and is now in an amount of pain that’s indescribable.

After a moment, she moved into the living room and turned on the lamp. She sat down in her mother’s recliner, immediately smelling her mother’s scent as she reclined back. The house was silent. Sara felt like she could hear her own thoughts out loud, the pain of seeing her past and her mother brought into the future. 
Sara grabbed a pen from the table beside her and ruffled through its drawer until she found a piece of blank paper. She began writing:

Mom,
I love you. I want you to know I love you more than anything.

Everything that has happened, I want you to know that’s all in the past.

After the past couple of days here, I don’t think this is the place you need to stay. I want you to come move in with me in the city. I’ll take care of you. I need you, and I think you need me.

This is no kind of life you’re living. I can’t bear to see you like this. I’m leaving tonight. I’m going to start getting everything in order for you to move. I’ll pay for it all.

Dad, Alex, they’re gone now. The things we celebrated don’t exist anymore. We can reminisce, but we can’t hang on to it this tightly.
If you do, you’re going to sleep the rest of your life away, and I don’t want that.

Please, for me. Please.

I hope you’ll come be with me, Mom.
I’ll call you when I get home tomorrow, and we’ll begin a new phase of our lives.
Love,
Sara

Sara folded the paper and wrote “Mom: Please Read” on the outside. After placing the note on the kitchen table, she walked back to Alex’s room. She grabbed her bags and stood over her mother for another moment.

 Tears cascaded down her face as she turned around and headed out of the house. It was going to be a long drive back home.
Starting the truck, she fantasized about a full house, full of voices and laughter, her future children playing with their grandmother, their father playing his guitar in the den. Birthday parties, holidays, smiles, graduations, marriages. A life made for home movies.
The cold realization of her empty apartment crept over her like a black wave as her truck’s tires gripped the pavement.

1pc04l6,https://i.redd.it/t2er7fcy6q4g1.jpeg,Whisky Bar Tasting,"So in a quite lovely whisky bar, in Tainan City, called ‘Whisky Age’, I decided to try these 3 drams. There were an inordinate amount of bottles to choose from, these just felt like something I wanted in the moment, there’s another 100 bottles I could have easily opted for instead.  I’ll try to review from memory (this was a few days ago now) and give my opinion on the three whiskys which, though aged in a similar style (sherry), showed vastly different profiles.

**__Signatory Brora 26yr__**

This is my first ever Brora and, as much as I wanted to be underwhelmed by it, I have to admit that it was great. Beautiful mouthfeel, extremely oily, but extremely well-balanced.  It was so cohesive, with a lot of nuance, but all working well from nose to palate to finish.

**Nose**: rich and layered. Despite being of a sherry nature there is a lot of honey, biscuity notes coming through. The Sherry is there, but it’s subtle, it’s hints of ripe Strawberry, maybe even plum, but only hints. The sweet, caramel honey richness envelopes the strawberries and it all hits you at a similar time, really well balanced.

**Palate**: It is very thick and I don’t know why, but the word that kept coming to my mind was ‘glossy’. It’s sort of thick and volumptuos, but bright as well. It’s not weighed down or dominated by the sherry cask, it’s supported by it. A really good continuation of the nose, lots of honey, hints of red fruit, in Taiwan they have a traditional cake, translated it’s a brown sugar cake, but the palate really does have those notes, with bits of red fruit intertwining, it’s great. There are chocolate and coffee notes that come and go as well but, again, all very subtle and well integrated. 

**Finish**: Yep, long and rich, the viscosity of the mouthfeel really helps carry the finish. It’s great.  

**Rating**: 8/10 - I know it costs an arm and a leg for a bottle, but for my first ever Brora this did not disappoint. The only thing I didn’t get was a heavy waxiness I’ve heard Brora have - this isn’t a criticism, more a curiosity. Great dram though, delivered on expectations. 

**__Midleton Single Cask Sherry__**:

Didn’t know the age unfortunately, but single cask Midleton’s aren’t even anything I have ever seen before, so it felt well worth the try.  This was a more typical, though still good quality, sherried dram, but in some ways lacking a bit of a wow factor.  

**Nose**: Heavy notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Maybe some baking spices? A bit of oak spice? But predominantly those coffee and dark chocolate notes are there.  Very pleasant, but more singular.

**Palate**:  Again the promise of the nose is following through almost to the letter on the palate.  It’s coffee and dark chocolate for days, which is lovely, but there is not a lot else. The typical Irish whisky notes you would look for have been swamped by an admittedly excellent sherry cask so, whilst it punches in flavor, it doesn’t quite have the complexity or nuance. It is also a touch hot as well (though it is cask strength), but I do not know the age so that could just be the vibrancy of youth. 

**Finish**:  Quite drying, the coffee and chocolate continue, but leans now to coffee and then drying tannins. I really like these sorts of finishes, but I know they’re not for everyone. Also long.  

**Rating**: 6/10 - I like heavily sherried whisky so I’m down with this every day of the week. If you aren’t though this wouldn’t be the bottle for you.  The mouthfeel is good too, but not as viscous as the Brora by any stretch. It reminded me in many ways of an Omar 10yr Sherry Single Cask I have, except without the white pepper note I always get on the back end. My type of dram honestly, but not for everyone thus the score.  

**__Smogen Sherry Cask 10yr__**

I have been fascinated by Smogen for a long time, but struggled to locate any bottles in my market…Whisky Age has plenty, so expect more reviews in the near future! The story of Smogen is interesting and, as the owner of the bar discussed with me, it is a distillery run by one person - if they can get it so right (spoiler alert) why can’t the distilleries with so much more financial fire power? That’s a conversation for another post though. 

**Nose**: I love this nose. Out of the three it was my favorite. There is a barnyard/hay funk right upfront, with a beautiful back drop of red fruits being cooked, almost like mulled wine but without the spices. I loved the funkiness and I mean it can be too much in some drams - this was bang on the money. 

**Palate**: The palate is quite a detour from the nose. It is very silky, but not necessarily viscous or oily. It sits really well in the palate but the intensity of the nose isn’t quite followed up. The stewed red fruits are there, some oak spices appear, it is very juicy, but the barnyard funk is conspicuous in its absence. This is a peated dram as well, but the peat (to me) feels gentle, it’s very much in the background sort of supporting the structure of the dram,  rather than being front and center like typical peat expressions. Actually in someways like a Ballechin but far more well-mannered - there are no harsh edges or alcohol spikes, it is extremely well constructed. Actually, if you put the nose and palate together, it really reminds me of a Tobermory.  Towards the back end the red fruitiness really starts to come out more - there are no chocolate or coffee notes at all though, it’s all juice with bits of earthy smoke behind it.

**Rating**: 7/10 - honestly I think this is a great dram, and I want to drink more! The reason it isn’t rated higher is due to the mouthfeel not having the rich oiliness of some standout drams.  The mouthfeel is nice, but it’s not an integral part of the experience - in the Brora for example it’s almost its own tasting note it is so prevalent.  Great dram though, and I think the bourbon cask matured versions should be an even more interesting experience. 

**Price**: I think it’s really important to be honest about what we pay for things so that we can get a good idea of market prices, and decide for ourselves what constitutes value for money.  This obviously varies person to person, but being honest is at least helpful. I ordered a 15ml dram from each bottle, and the total for this, converting from Taiwan dollars, was just under $60. Over 2/3’s of that was spent on the Brora alone.  I feel like it is really good value for money, and at Whisky Age pretty much everything they have available is really fairly priced.  This may feel like too much for some, and I totally get it, but I had a great time and would have no qualms about repeating the experience (although given the amount of bottles available I’d probably opt for some different ones purely out of curiosity). 

Thanks for reading, Slainte.

1pc00bo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc00bo,How severe is my gum recession?,"I have not been seen by a dentist or accessed any kind of dental care in at least ten years, a situation which I am trying to remedy as soon as possible. Until then, I am hoping to get some opinions to help me gauge the severity of my gum recession. The conditions of my oral health and the assaults it has sustained have varied widely in that ten years. Below is a brief oral history (if you will) for those  interested, but in summary: While there have been multiple factors that would negatively impact my oral/dental health, I have made significant progress in eliminating them.

During the aforementioned ten years, my oral hygiene (in simple terms of brushing and flossing) was relatively decent and consistent, adhering to common guidance. Presently and for the last two years, I have been religious with brushing and flossing. I floss twice, brush two or three times without rinsing the toothpaste. I do not eat or drink within 30 minutes before or after brushing. I use ACT anticavity rinse once or twice a day, but always more than 30 minutes after brushing.

Fluctuations in care and negative impacts of the past:

- During periods of poor mental health, it would not be uncommon for me to forego flossing, and there were times when I would not brush my teeth for a day. I don't recall going longer than a day. These periods were not prolonged.
- I was a very serious nailbiter for approximately 5 years.
- I smoked cigarettes for a bit less than 5 years, and vaped for about 6 years. I have not smoked tobacco in close to 3 years and have not vaped for 2.
- I have smoked green with varying frequency for most of that 10 years, but less than 5 times per year for the last 2 years.
- I drank alcohol somewhat heavily for less than 2 years, moderately to infrequently for around 6 years, and now consume almost no alcohol (no alcohol 2025, 1 instance of drinking alcohol 2024, 3 or less in 2023). 
- being American, I do consume more sugar than I ought to. Mostly added to coffee and tea. In a week, I will usually have some chocolate and some bakery sweets. I do not drink soda or juice. Sugar is my final boss, but I hope to one day reach a low intake for overall health.
- Despite knowing about the potential for and trying to be cautious of overbrushing, I am beginning to think that I still tend to brush too aggressively and am attempting to adjust.

Other than overbrushing and sugar intake, what potential blindspots might I have that may be contributing to my gum recession?

I mean yeah he's shown to be a bit psychotic and angry.

Think about it:

His long term girlfriend suddenly starts cheating on him with a small talking bee right in front of him. 

That same bee keeps showing up in his apartment, interrupting dinner, ruining their dates, and nearly killing him with coffee.

Everyone around Ken just accepts that this insect is basically replacing him, and he’s the only one reacting like a normal human being.

Vanessa never once acknowledges how insane the situation is, and gets annoyed at him instead.

By the end of the movie, his whole relationship, home life, and sanity are destroyed — not because he was a bad guy, but because a bee with jazz-voice swagger showed up.

Honestly, he didn’t deserve what he went through. If anything, he’s the tragic character of the whole movie. Barry steals his love life, wrecks the economy, and somehow Ken is the one everyone clowns on.

So yeah… I might actually be Team Ken.

Anyone else feel like he got done dirty?

Life doesn’t wait.
Stress, exams, work, responsibilities…... it piles up.

Here’s a 3-minute reset anyone can do:

1.Breathe like you mean it

4sec inhale → 6sec exhale × 10

Your mind clears faster than scrolling Instagram


2.Write one thing you’re grateful for

Even if it’s “I have coffee ”

Gratitude flips your focus from stress → solutions


3.Visualize one success today

Picture finishing a task, acing a test, or nailing your goal

Your brain starts working to make it real


Do this anywhere. Anytime.
3 minutes = zero excuses.
Your mood, focus, and energy will thank you.

1pbzmjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1pbzmjp/how_to_navigate_relationships_24m/,How to navigate relationships? [24M],"I'm 24M and have never been in a relationship because I never felt ready. Now that I've worked on myself and am finally confident being myself, I thought I’d experiment with dating apps for the first time.

Matched with a girl (26F). We didn’t chat much before meeting. I asked for a coffee, she agreed. After the date, I thought she didn’t like me at all, and I fell into limerence for a bit. Eventually I recovered and asked if she’d like to meet again because I wanted to get to know her properly. She said she did like me, which honestly surprised me because in my mind I’m not exactly “likeable” in that way.

We chatted that morning and planned to meet in the evening. During the conversation, she told me she was already catching feelings. I told her we should take things slow because I didn’t want either of us to get attached too early. Things went well and we had a good second date.

She told me she was looking for a long-term relationship. I wasn’t looking for anything specific. I’m still experimenting, and I planned to take whatever felt internally right.

Later she mentioned how her ex cheated on her. That triggered a very overprotective reaction in me. I started thinking about the future, like, if everything went great between us, what would happen long-term? With the age gap, cultural factors, and other circumstances, the probability of us actually being able to stay together and eventually marry felt low to me. I felt like I couldn’t commit knowing my intuition was saying “this probably won’t last forever.” And I was scared that if I continued, I’d either sabotage it or we’d eventually have to break up because of those external factors.

But I still had feelings for her. She’s emotionally mature, funny, caring, intelligent and pretty. It wasn’t an easy decision.

After the date, I told her I didn’t think it would work out. She didn’t question it at all. I didn’t explain further or ask her anything because I didn’t want to trigger any emotional manipulation (even accidentally) or make it messy. She seemed emotional on the date, and I didn’t want to make things harder for her. So we ended it cleanly.

My friends all told me I should’ve given it a go because it’s rare to find someone you connect with emotionally like that.

Later I asked her again about her relationship goals just to confirm, and she said she does want a relationship with potential for marriage. Theoretically it’s possible for us, but realistically I don’t see it working out because of the timing and circumstances. So I said no again.
After that I went through another round of limerence, but now I’m okay and stable again.

I still feel like I made the right call. I’ve thought about it multiple times from a detached place and still end up with the same conclusion. But I also know that many people in the same situation would have just gone ahead and tried anyway. To me, that feels like lying to myself.

My questions:

1. Did I overreact or overcorrect?

2. What should I keep in mind if something like this happens again?

I think I’ve covered everything clearly. If you need more info, I can explain.

TL;DR:
First dating experience, connected strongly with girl (26F). She wanted something long-term. I liked her too but realistically don’t see a future because of age gap + cultural constraints. Didn’t want to hurt her later, especially knowing she’d been cheated on before. Ended things cleanly even though it hurt. Friends think I should’ve given it a shot. I think I made the right call.

Today I'm nicotine free 22 days and I'm so grateful to not be a slave to smoking anymore. I began smoking cigs at 19 when I was introduced to alcohol. My sheltered life quickly turned into a circus after learning how fun black outs were. Fast forward to 2019, I got sober and I switched from cigs to vape thinking it was a ""cleaner"" option. I didn't smell, I didn't need an ashtray, and I could smoke literally everywhere. With that, I began smoking more than I normally would (cigs were half a pack a day) and now I was smoking a pod a day. I could vape in bed, on the toilet, at my desk, in the car, in between bites of food, it was NON STOP. I was worried to volunteer at my child's school because I was worried I wouldn't be able to vape (but that didn't stop me from doing secret hits).

I noticed toward the end of my smoking career, my throat started having muscle spasms where my gag reflex was tickled. It was strange. Like the muscle of sucking to vape had upset my throat. Over the years I'd get upset stomach, a TONNNNN OF ANXIETY, small panic attacks, and I'd just learn to cope with it with therapy and sticking in my bubble, but still always vaping because you know, that was my pacifier.

I was a slave. It was my last vice so I wasn't in a hurry to quit it, but man, it bothered me how much I was dependent on it and always ALWAYS had to have 1 or 2 vapes in my pocket. Heaven forbid it died and I didn't have another on me. That seldom happened because I planned around this little electronic thing.

Anyway, I prayed about it and wanted to stop so badly. I asked God to make me sick and tired so I could do something about it and on Sunday, November 9 2025, I was coming home from my sisters house and a voice just said, ""It's time"" and I knew what I had to do. I told my 12 year old son, who's been telling me I need to quit, that I was going to end it all and to grab a gallon zip lock bag. I put every single vape and its charger in that bag, said a prayer, and threw it on the bottom of the garbage can outside.

Of course I didn't know how to handle my own brain after that so I decided to treat myself and went to the store and bought every single hand to mouth reliever I could think of - Twizzler, lollipops, chocolate, (coffee straws were my fav).

The weirdest thing happened to my psyche - I was dizzy and lightheaded for 9 days to come. I was basically high! I didn't replace nicotine with anything, I stopped cold turkey baby. I didn't want crap in my system. But, I was left with loud feelings echoing in my head. I took SEVERAL walks a day to get out of my mind and feel the fresh air on my face and exercise my body. I focused on being grateful I had made it 12 hours nicotine free, 24 hours nicotine free, 5 days nicotine free, and so on.

I think it was day 7 I realized after I woke up that morning it took me 20 whole minutes to even remember I used to vape. The habit was subsiding and my body was forgetting I was a chronic vape head who couldn't life her life without breathing in that poison.

Day 9 I finally felt normal again and my head and chemistry leveled out. My sister joked and said ""Welcome back home!"" 

  
So, my friends, I'm here on day 22 with more clear lungs, a healthy start, happy conscience, bigger appetite (I need to eat better LOL), and free from the chains of addiction. If you're struggling with nicotine addiction, I hope you get sick and tired of it and find the strength to break the chains and life addiction free.

1pbzg0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingBetterMen/comments/1pbzg0c/how_to_plant_ideas_in_someones_mind_without_them/,How to plant ideas in someone's mind (without them noticing): the psychology guide you wish you knew earlier,"We all do it. Subtly steering conversations. Nudging someone to see things our way. Wanting them to come up with *your* idea like it was *theirs*. Whether it’s getting your friend to finally switch gyms, influencing your manager to greenlight your pitch, or helping your partner consider therapy without triggering defense mode, planting ideas is a skill. And like most powerful skills, we’re never formally taught it.

I started digging into this after realizing how much of modern life is about persuasion but TikTok & pseudo-self-help bros get it all wrong. Influencer advice is all tactics, no depth. Stuff like “use reverse psychology” or “mirror their body language” sounds smart but usually collapses in real life. I wanted something deeper, evidence-based, actually useful. So I nerded out on negotiation books, psychology research, behavioral economics, podcasts, even propaganda case studies. What I found changed everything.

This post pulls from legit sources like Robert Cialdini’s research, Daniel Kahneman’s behavioral science insights, and some wild techniques rooted in social engineering. This isn’t about manipulation. It’s about *influence with integrity*, ethical, subtle, powerful. Used right, it helps people make better choices faster, while preserving trust.

Here’s a breakdown of key frameworks and tools that actually work.

---

1. **Make them feel it was their idea**  
The human brain protects its ego above almost everything. So if you push your idea too directly, it triggers psychological reactance a resistance to being controlled (Brehm, 1966). Instead, frame your suggestion as a question or unfinished thought. Example: Instead of saying “We should use this strategy next quarter,” try “What do you think would happen if we tried X?” This makes them explore the idea mentally, leading to what scientists call “self-generated persuasion,” which studies show is more sticky and believable (Aronson, 1999).

2. **Use the “foot-in-the-door” technique**  
Get people to say yes to a small ask before you pitch the big idea. This technique, first studied by Freedman & Fraser in 1966, proves that once someone agrees to something small, they’re more likely to agree to a related bigger ask later, it’s about consistency. Want your roommate to try a new diet? Start with: “Hey, can I send you one TikTok recipe I tried?” Don’t push the full diet plan… yet.

3. **Prime before you plant**  
Subtle cues change perception. In a 2008 Yale study, just holding a warm cup of coffee made participants rate strangers as more warm and trustworthy. This is priming. Use it before “planting” an idea. Want someone to support your team? Before you pitch, implicitly establish shared goals, common enemies, or familiar values through casual stories or visuals. Then pitch the ask.

4. **Repeat subtly, over time**  
The “mere exposure effect” (Zajonc, 1968) shows people prefer things they’ve seen more often—even subconsciously. So casually repeat keywords, themes, or ideas across different conversations. Bring them up naturally. No need to push. Just let familiarity do the work. This is why political campaigns hammer the same phrases constantly.

5. **Tap into social proof**  
People are more likely to adopt an idea if they believe it’s already gaining traction. That’s why Yelp reviews, celebrity endorsements, and social media trends work. Drop subtle cues like “I saw a few people on our team already trying this” or “It’s something lots of founders are experimenting with lately.” It lowers perceived risk by transferring responsibility to the collective.

---

Here are some resources that completely changed the way I think about influence and idea-planting:

1. **Book: *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* by Robert Cialdini**  
NYT bestseller. Cialdini is a psychology professor who spent years undercover in car dealerships, marketing firms, and sales teams to identify the *real* influence tactics people fall for. He breaks it down into 6 timeless principles, reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. Every marketer reads this. But it’s also brilliant for life.

2. **Book: *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman**  
Won the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Kahneman shows how humans use two thinking systems: fast (intuitive, emotional) and slow (deliberative). And how most decisions come from the *fast* brain even when we think they don’t. This book helps you learn how biases work *without people realizing*. Insanely good read.

3. **Podcast: *Hidden Brain* (NPR)**  
Hosted by Shankar Vedantam. Deep dives into unconscious behavior. Especially good episodes on decision making, moral reasoning, and why we believe what we believe. Useful for understanding how to reframe ideas so they’re accepted without resistance.

4. **YouTube: Derek Banas – Psychology playlist**  
Surprisingly good. Banas breaks down psychological concepts using real-world examples and easy visuals. He’s known for his explain-it-fast style. Watch his cognitive biases video if you want to see how people actually get influenced in everyday life.

5. **App: Readwise**  
If you tend to collect ideas but forget them later, this saves you. It pulls your highlights from ebooks, articles, tweets, etc., and helps you revisit the best stuff each day through email or flashcards. You start to remember and *use* the ideas you plant in yourself.

6. **App: BeFreed**  
This one’s been a game changer for how I learn influence frameworks without reading 30 books. You type in exactly what you’re trying to improve like “how to influence without being manipulative”, and it builds a tailored audio lesson, like a podcast, using insights from top books, research, and expert interviews. You can pause, ask questions mid-episode, go deeper into any part, or even ask it to give real-life examples. Feels like chatting with a coach who knows the science *and* your context. What I love is it personalizes your learning model over time, so it starts sending you deeper content as you grow. There’s also a flashcard mode for when you want to remember an idea for future use. Perfect for revisiting persuasion tricks before a big convo.

7. **Book: *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss**  
Written by a former FBI hostage negotiator. No fluff. Every single tactic is field-tested under real pressure like life-or-death. You’ll learn how to use calibrated questions, tactical empathy, and labeling to guide others from resistance to alignment. This book will make you *dangerously good* at persuading people while making them feel safe and understood. Best negotiation book I’ve ever read.

8. **Podcast: *The Knowledge Project* by Shane Parrish**  
Long-form interviews with thinkers and decision-makers across fields. Great episodes with people like Adam Grant and Esther Perel. The conversation always dives into mental models, thinking frameworks, and subtle ways of shaping behavior. Ideal if you want to upgrade how you think *and* influence others long-term.

9. **Book: *The Catalyst* by Jonah Berger**  
This book flips persuasion on its head. Berger (Wharton prof) argues that instead of pushing people harder, we should remove the *barriers* that block them from changing. He breaks emotion and resistance into five buckets (Reactance, Endowment, Distance, Uncertainty, Corroborating Evidence) and shows exactly how to counter each. This book will make you rethink how you influence stubborn people.

10. **Build learning into your life**  
Don’t try to do it all at once. Set up habits like listening to one 15-min learning audio each morning, journaling how well you applied a tactic after conversations, or recapping your favorite idea from BeFreed at night. When learning becomes part of your day, planting ideas becomes effortless.

My baby just turned 5 months old… The 4th month was hell with the developmental leap and teething — I was/am exhausted. I really thought things would get a bit easier now in the 5th month.

My baby is probably hyperactive; she never stops moving no matter what I do. She doesn’t even relax in my arms — she’s constantly moving her hands and feet or wriggling around. Also she gets bored every 2 min.🥲 

For example:We visited my husband’s sister, who has a baby one month younger than mine. She was holding him on the couch, calmly drinking her coffee while we talked. When he got sleepy, she just put him in his nest and he fell asleep on his own… I never expected to feel jealous about something like that, but I did.

My baby usually sleeps for the night around 19:00–20:00.  So i have like 2-3 hours to do some stuff around the house or chill for a bit until i go to sleep.Yesterday she started getting sleepy around 18:30. By 19:00 we were lying down so she could breastfeed and fall asleep (the only way she sleeps,doesnt take bottle or paci), and for two whole hours she just wouldn’t sleep. I tried everything — walking around the house, breastfeeding from both sides, rocking her in the stroller or in my arms… until I completely lost my patience. Eventually My husband  took over because i was getting angry and started rocking her in the stroller while I took the dog out for 10 minutes, and when I came back, she was finally asleep. She ended up falling asleep at 21:30. I felt so dumb that she fell asleep in the stroller now on 10 minutes and i've tried everything .

Also, no matter what I do, she wakes up at 5–6 in the morning and i cant get used to it.

1pbze47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1pbze47/friend_went_snooping_through_my_phone/,Friend went snooping through my phone,"So today was certainly an interesting day. Hung out with my best friend of a year and had a perfectly nice day, went and got boba went shopping then back to her house and watched movies and shows. Literally braided/played with eachothers hair. Now this friend has done/said some questionable stuff in the past, especially recently. Cried because I didn’t get her a starbucks drink type stuff. By no means am I a perfect person but I am self aware and don’t get extremely upset over minor inconveniences. But she certainly does things often that rub me the wrong way or make me uncomfortable to the point where I consider if the friendship is worth it. That being said she also does have good qualities and I wouldn’t have stayed friends with her this long if she didn’t. She’s a good listener, she’s caring, she’s generous etc. But she can genuinely act crazy at times and mistreat her husband and that rubs me the wrong way too. So in these moments of contemplation, I vent about her to my boyfriend or my other friend. Maybe I’m harsh, maybe I came alittle crazy for her but she genuinely makes me upset sometimes. I am imperfect as well and maybe said some things coming for her character but this was heat of the moment things and still respect her as a person. My boyfriend doesn’t like her at all and definitely said some shit. And I’ve even defended her several times to this. She equates buying me coffee or whatever sometimes and visiting me in the hospital when i’m unwell to being the perfect friend and trust me i’m not ungrateful but she isn’t taking into account the things that she does. So yes instead of ending a friendship that i do cherish, I vent. Well I guess she had a “gut feeling” this entire time and was waiting for the right moment for me to be away from my phone for long enough for her to read through my texts. She must have been spying on me typing in my password with the intention of doing so. False pretense of a hangout because she just wanted to confirm her suspicion. As if I was cheating on her or saying crazy shit when i was just opening up to my loved ones about arguments me and her have. She typed in her name and skimmed through whatever she could find in the minute i was in the bathroom. She then said nothing to me and waited for me to get home before she texted me an essay telling me how awful I am and how she had every right to invade my privacy like that because she had a hunch that was correct. Mind you, I wasn’t truly talking shit, I was ranting about how she affects me and how it’s hard to talk to her sometimes. Because I have tried. She doesn’t respond well. So now she’s telling me to get my life together (just had a pulmonary embolism and almost died btw) (not saying for sympathy but what the fuck you know why my life isn’t together). Is she saying she’s never ever talked about me to anyone? Her husband or friends? That if I typed in my name in her texts i’d only find pleasant things? So yeah, my trust was broken more than it already was, I feel betrayed, kinda heartbroken, lost a best friend over some crazy shit, and now am even more alone during the scariest health crisis in my life. Genuinely crashing out and had a panic attack for an hour. But I guess she showed her true colors? ",1,1764650578.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1pbzcwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1pbzcwj/qcrit_adult_science_fiction_what_keeps_the_stars/,[QCRIT] Adult Science Fiction - What Keeps the Stars Apart (75k/First Attempt),"Hello! This is my first query draft of my first novel.

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for my 75,000 word science fiction novel *What Keeps the Stars Apart*. *What Keeps the Stars Apart* combines galactic scale with emotionally intimate prose and characters in a similar style to *The Vanished Birds* by Simon Jimenez, while incorporating the apocalyptic stakes of *Stars and Bones* by Gareth L. Powell.

In the distant future, humanity has spread to hundreds of star systems, but it has been a slow crawl, the harsh limitation of the speed of light never having been circumvented. Civilizations under different suns go through their own crises and emerge—or perish—entirely alone. Any communication made between systems arrives so late that its only use is as history…or, it arrives with no one left to hear it. Devised in the face of this paradigm was the program of Galactic History Preservation. GHP vessels travel between the stars with crews in a state of cryogenic fugue that entirely suspends the aging process, allowing them to wake for a period of months in each system to perform field research and update their historical records. This way, GHP teams record humanity’s fragmented history in a continuous, interstellar manner.

A small but diverse crew of academics comprising a GHP team approach a system that they know housed a flourishing interplanetary civilization mere thousands of years ago. Upon entering the system, they are faced with evidence of a complete apocalypse. Unfortunate, but not unprecedented. But when the crew’s geological survey of the world from which this society originated shows no record of anthropomorphic habitation in the planet’s deep past, the system evolves from a graveyard to a paradox. Through a story that spans several timelines, pasts erased and gradually recovered, and an interstellar quest for answers, *What Keeps the Stars Apart* explores the extents to which human science, human relationships, and the human mind can be pushed when the threat of total extinction is battled by a small team of scientists, alone on a ship traversing the vast, cold void between the stars. 

\[Bio/Personalization\]

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

\[Name\]

First 250:

The Astronomer woke to silence. Right on cue, their cryogenic sleeping pod had initiated waking procedures as the *Absolution* decelerated into the Alpha-8457 star system. The rest of the crew still slept. The chance of pod failure was less than ten-thousand to one—it had to be—but still the Astronomer checked every one, running manual diagnostics each time. It was habit. When you spent thousands of years adrift in the emptiness between the stars, habit was all you had—that, and your crew. They all came back green. 

Everyone on a Galactic History Preservation team got used to traveling in cryosleep, but no one ever came to like it. If they did, the Astronomer thought, their psych profile should probably be reevaluated. A person taking the long nap was biologically almost dead, and they woke up feeling that way.

After the head, the Astronomer’s first stop was at the autodoc. They drank a liter of water and, needing something with a little more kick than coffee, took some mild amphetamines prescribed by the system. Other than the temporary brain fog, their body appeared perfectly ship-shape. The Biologist would have gently chided that the human body is an enormously complex organism and that keeping it working nearly perfectly for thousands of years was a miracle that should never be taken for granted. But she was asleep, so fuck biology. The Astronomer took more amphetamines and moved on to what had long ago become their favorite part of being conscious—long, hot showers. 

EDIT: I anticipated the difficulty with the absence of character - the characters are all referred to by their roles throughout the novel (the Astronomer, the Anthropologist, the Biologist, the Psychologist, and the Engineer), so describing the characters in the synopsis became very cumbersome, leading to the eventual omission, even though I knew that was breaking some rules. In addition to the titles, it is a more distributed cast with multiple PoV characters and less of a solid singular main character, so it would be misrepresentative of the story to frame everything through the Astronomer. I'm not sure if there is an easy resolution to this problem or if I am just always going to have a weird pitch for a weird novel.",2,1764650473.0,PubTips,12,1.0,False

I just got back from a 3 week solo trip in Japan, which includes the golden route with a few detours here-and-there: Tokyo → Matsuyama → Miyajima → Hiroshima → Osaka → Nara → Kyoto → Takayama → Kanazawa → Tokyo, with day trips speckled in there. My plan was to move around a lot -- I was originally going to make some detours for some concerts -- so I just had a carry-on size backpack with me.

 

I had originally posted my itinerary here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nncj4p/itinerary\_check\_22\_day\_november\_930/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nncj4p/itinerary_check_22_day_november_930/)

 

**Tokyo + Yokohama:** November 9, 2025 - November 12, 2025

I arrived at Narita at 12:45PM. After customs, sorting out my JP phone number and bidding on a few more concerts, I decided to head to my accommodations near Kannai, Yokohama to drop off luggage. I wasn’t sure about concert bag policies in Japan. It’s actually pretty relaxed, and there are lockers in the venue. I went straight to the concert afterward at Yokohama Arena. After the concert, I went back to Yokohama and ate at a random sutadon restaurant (Namara Umaissyo!)

 

The following day was an exploration day: I started around Kannai station, meandering my way through Shinko and Minatomirai, and eventually finding my way to Yokohama Station. The area has an interesting mix of architecture. Rinko Park was a really nice, peaceful spot. I also dipped into the Pokémon Center. Once I reached Yokohama Station, I took the train to the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum. The museum was pretty small. I opted not to do the ramen course, but sampled a few different bowls downstairs. Afterward, I took the train back to Kannai Station. I meandered through Chinatown to Yokohamabashi dori shopping district and back up toward Bashamichi Station. I stopped for a flight at the Yokohama brewery, and then went to find food at a local izakaya (炭火ノ串や。ニューハカタスタイル 関内店). After dinner, I walked around Isezakichō, made my way back to the Red Brick Warehouse, Akarenga Park and Zou-no-hana Park before calling it a night. The area around the water was really nice for an evening stroll.

 

The third day, I went directly to Ueno Station. I was headed to Tokyo Dome for a concert, so I just slowly made my way, exploring the streets. I walked through park of Ueno Park, Ameyoko Shopping Street, 2k540 Aki-Oka and Electric Town toward Akihabara Station. The park is a really nice reprieve from the hustle-and-bustle of the surround area, and I stopped by Izuei for an eel lunch before leaving the area. Akihabara was a lot quieter than I was expecting. Enroute to the Dome, I unexpectedly ended up at the Kanda Myoujin Shrine and the Origami Museum. After the concert, I took a subway back to Ueno, grabbed a bowl of duck ramen at Ramen Kamo to Negi Ueno Okachimachi and then headed back to Yokohama.

 

The last day I flew out early, so I just packed up and headed directly to Haneda Airport. (I decided to forfeit the second concert day.)

 

**Matsuyama:** November 12, 2025 - November 14, 2025

 

After arriving at the Matsuyama Airport, I went directly to Dōgo Onsen area. I grabbed a quick inari snack at a small shop near the station (Dogo Inari Sushi Yunoya ). (It was about to open and there was already a line around the corner, so it left me curious -- definitely worth it!) I went for a soak at the onsen, and had tea and treats in the relaxation room. There’s also an area that was used by the old royalty, so it was neat to see some of the history as well. It was super peaceful and worth it. I’m glad I went at that time, since there was a large line-up later in the day. Afterward, I wanted to just explore the area. At the stores, I grabbed a quick botchan dango snack (my botchan dango 30) and orange flight (愛媛の食卓1970). I walked through Dogo Park, went up to the observation deck, down to Ishite Temple, through the back trails to Isaniwa Shrine and then Hogon Temple. Ishite Temple is nestled in a forest, so it was a nice place to stop and take in the environment. I grabbed a quick yakimochi snack (三好本舗) and stopped at Dogoichie to try some local sake. There wasn’t much else in that area for me, so I walked toward the area around Okkaido Shopping Steet. I had taimeshi for dinner at Matsuyama Taimeshi Akiyoshi Honten, which I really enjoyed. After dinner, I took a stroll around the perimeter of the park that surrounds Matsuyama castle, through Shiroyama Park and through the shopping areas before heading back to my accommodations.

 

The following morning, I walked up to and explored Matsuyama Castle, which is one of the original twelve. I grabbed a quick matcha mochi snack at a nearby shop (霧の森菓子工房 松山店) for a treat on the road. I actually spent way more time at the castle than I was anticipating. The design was pretty neat and the views from up high were great. Afterward, I walked back down through Shiroyama Park and meandered through Sanbancho before having nabyaki udon for lunch at Asahi. I had some spare time, since my concert plans fell through, so I did some random window shopping in the area and walked around the area east of the castle/near Heiwadori-Icchome tram stop. I stopped for a taruto (株六時屋) before heading to Mitsu. I had mitsuhamayaki (a local version of okonomiyaki) for dinner at Miyoshi Mitsu -- a super small local spot, with only a few seats and one menu item on the wall. Everything was closed by that time, but it was still nice to go for an evening stroll and explore the area. I wasn’t sure what to expect here, since it was hard finding information on this place – there were two soy sauce producers that I would have loved to visit.

 

The last day I left early, so I just took transit and walked to the port. I took a ferry to the Hiroshima port, and another ferry to Itsukushima.

 

**Itsukushima \[Miyajima\]:** November 14, 2025 - November 15, 2025

 

When I arrived, it was really close to low-tide, so I headed toward the Itsukushima Shrine Otorii gate. I grabbed a few oysters (grilled and fried from Kakiya) as a snack. They were really good! I also grabbed a curry bread and Momiji manju for the walk up Mount Misen. It was neat to walk up to the gates at low tide, but it was pretty crowded so I didn’t linger. From there, I took the Momijidani course up Mount Misen, walked up to the observatory, down to Miyama Shrine, up to Komagabayashi Peak and then back down the Daishō-in Trail. The trails were pretty easy. It took about 75 minutes to get up to the observatory, including curry pan, and picture and video stops. I ran part of the way from Komagabayashi Peak down through the Daishō-in Trail, so it took about 40 minutes to get back down. Views were worth it! I sat around for over an hour soaking in the views. Once I reached the bottom, I had a late anago lunch at Fujitaya Anagomeshi. I went back to explore the main area in town. I took a break to enjoy a flight at the Miyajima Brewery and another oyster at Kakiya. It was close to high tide, so I went searching for a view of the Otorii gate. (I think I prefer the high tide view better.) I went for another evening stroll, over toward Kiyomori Shrine and into Omoto Park before heading to my accommodations and calling it a night. I had a simple curry dinner at the guest house.

 

The following day, I visited Itsukushima Jinja, Daishō-in Temple and Henjo Cave in the morning. It was really peaceful in the morning -- I can see why some people prefer to stay here overnight. High tide was in the morning, so that was also a nice bonus! I had an oyster lunch at Yakigaki No Hayashi before heading to Hiroshima via. JR ferry and tram. (Between the oysters and anago, this might have been my favourite food location.)

 

**Hiroshima + Ōkunoshima:** November 15, 2025 - November 17, 2025

 

Most of the first day focused around the Peace Memorial Park: I went to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. They were both very well curated/displayed. I visited the numerous memorials, and Atomic Bomb Dome. (Funny enough, there was a group of school students at the peace museum and I’m pretty sure it was the same group that was on Itsukushima. I guess it’s a common school trip circuit?) This was the largest part of my Hiroshima visit, and it was definitely worth it. I’d consider going earlier in the day though. It was packed. You pretty much had to shuffle with the crowd. Afterward, I relaxed by the river for a bit before going to a small, local Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki joint (Kanrasha) on the island west of the Peace Park. I stopped by Session’s Brewery for a flight, and then went for a walk in the evening. Hiroshima Castle was really pretty when it was lit up at night, and also a super peaceful area. Conversely, Nagarekawa Dori and Yagenbori Dori were super lively at night! I stopped for a bowl of dan dan noodles at Kunimatsu Nagarekawa before calling it a night.

 

The following day ended up being a day trip. (Concert plans didn’t work out, so I ended up with an extra day.) I was split between gambling for a rental bike to do the Shimanami Kaido and going to Ōkunoshima. Ultimately, I didn’t want to risk all the travel time and decided to go to Ōkunoshima. Transit was easy. You can take a bus to the ferry terminal, and then hop on the ferry to the island. There’s a small museum on the island, a few ruins and a decent number of bunnies. It was a pretty relaxing way to spend a nice day out, but I think it’s the type of day trip I’d include if this were my 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) time in this area. After returning, I had okonomiyaki at Yagenbori Hassh and went for my evening stroll.

 

The last day I left early. I just walked to Hiroshima Station, and hopped onto the shinkansen.

 

**Okayama + Himeji:** November 17, 2025

 

The travel day to Osaka had a few stops. My first stop was Okayama for the Kōrakuen Garden. I was there for opening, and spent a few hours there -- longer than I was expecting. It turned out to be my favourite garden from this trip. It’s surrounded by a wall of trees and a river, so it felt like a peaceful escape from the city. I also did a quick walk around Okayama Castle. It’s called the crow castle, and the outside looks stunning! I grabbed a kibi dango from Koeidoo before leaving the area.

 

The second stop was Himeji. Enroute to the castle, I had a fish cheese stick from Yamasa Kamaboko Otemae and a tamago kake gohan with a side of anago from Tamagoya. (I really enjoyed Tamagoya and it’s pretty affordable for a touristy area too. The cheese stick wasn’t my jam, but it’s a pretty popular item.) Himeji Castle, another one of the original twelve, is massive. It was really neat to see and learn the history behind it. It also felt completely different from Matsuyama Castle. There’s a small garden, Koko-en, which I visited as well. I enjoyed parts of it, but it was packed and small, so it wasn’t as enjoyable for me. Afterward, I stopped for a quick coffee, almost toast and cinnamon toast at Hamamoto Coffee before leaving for Osaka.

 

**Osaka + Sakai:** November 17, 2025 - November 20, 2025

 

After arriving, I checked in at my accommodations and met someone for dinner. There was an ordering miscommunication, so we had yakiniku at Ginmiya Nishikuten and then paitan ramen at Bokkoshi Ramen. I went for an evening stroll afterward, mainly around the America-mura and Dotonbori area, before calling it a night.

 

The following day, I went to Sakai with the hopes of picking up a few knives. I visited Takada no Hamono, Baba no Hamono and Konosuke. I was originally planning to visit Ashi no Hamono, but ran out of time/opted for food instead. I also wanted to visit the Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum, but didn’t realize that they were closed one day of the month -- today. In between the knife shops, I went to the Shimano Bike Museum. It was a mix of general bike history, and then a bit about the history of Sakai and local bike manufacturing. Afterward, I took the subway to Nakatsu and had a tonkatsu lunch at New Babe Toyosaki. I meandered my way back south, through Umeda, Nakanoshima, Utsubo Park, Orange Street and America-mura. (I didn’t think about it, but the art museum there looked neat. Definitely on my radar for another time.) I took the subway to Shin-Osaka to meet someone for a sukiyaki dinner at Wadaya Shin-Osaka. After dinner, I took the subway back to Namba and meandered the streets for a few hours. I stopped at Moegi for an Osaka-style okonomiyaki. (I think my preferred style is Hrioshima.) I ended up at a couple parks where the locals would hang out, so it was nice to see that quieter pace of life as well.

 

The third day I went to Kuromon Market, and then visited Sennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street. I decided to go back to Sakai afterward to visit the Sakai Traditional Crafts Museum. The museum is focused on knives, but there were displays on other trades, such as dyed tenugui, seaweed processing, etc. – I really enjoyed it. I had a simple soba lunch at Hiro nearby, and then dropped by Takayuki knife gallery before leaving Sakai. I decided to just explore different areas, so I took the subway to Hanazinokita area. I meandered north, through Shinsekai and other neighbourhoods and visited Osaka castle and the surrounding park before going to grab dinner. (I also grabbed a Takoyaki snack at Jumbo Sohonten.) After walking into three restaurants that are reservation or 2+ people only, I decided to grab dinner at the yakitori chain Torikizoku. After dinner, I took one more walk through the areas surrounding Dotonbori to my accommodations.

 

The last day I left early, so I just walked to the train station and took it to Nara.

 

**Nara:** November 20, 2025 - November 21, 2025

 

After arriving to Nara, I walked through Kōfuku-ji and Noborioji Park to Kasugataisha and Wakamiya Shrine. It’s nestled in the forest and quite nice. It was a really peaceful stroll. It was getting busy by the time I finished, so I decided to take the rear trail to Wakakusayama Hill. It was a really nice view up top! I continued through the rear trails, visited Uguisu Waterfall and the abandoned shrine, and exited through the Kasuga Primeval Forest Trail. Definitely an unexpected treat! I ended up in a slightly more rural/remote area, which was neat to see. I went to Harushika Sake Brewery for a flight, visited the Naramachi Nigiwai-no-le, which is a traditional house, stopped by Nakatanidou for a mochi snack and meandered the area.  I had a tonkatsu dinner at とんかつ清善. Less wandering tonight as I had to find a coin laundry place.

 

The following morning, I took an early stroll through Kasugataisha Shrine. The calmness of the forest was lovely. Afterward, I visited Todai-ji Temple. I was originally going to skip it, but it’s so commonly recommended that I decided to slide it into the schedule. I’m glad that I did visit it. It’s impressive. During the day, I’d pick Todai-ji Temple. In the morning, I’d pick Kasugataisha  Shrine -- there’s something special about walking through the forest and up to it when there’s no one else there. I left for Uji after finishing at Todai-ji Temple.

 

**Uji:** November 21, 2025 - November 22, 2025

 

After arriving at Uji, I went to Nakamura Tokichi Honten to reserve a spot. I walked around the neighourhood for half an hour while I waited. It’s a quaint area. I picked up a couple buns from Mogmog Bakery for my walk later, which ended up being pretty tasty. (I’d go back to that bakery.) I went back to have tencha soba and matcha for lunch. Afterward, I went to Byodo-in Temple and visited Phoenix Hall. There was a museum inside as well. It’s a nice temple to visit.  I spent some time exploring the area afterward: I visited Tō-no-shima Island, Tachibana Island, Uji Shrine, Daikichiyama Observation Deck and Hōjō-in Temple. I also stopped for a matcha at Tsuen near Uji Bridge before going to have a ramen dinner at MENYA INOICHI #3. I took the train to Kyoto afterward.

 

**Kyoto:** November 22, 2025 - November 24, 2025

 

After arriving in Kyoto, I went directly to teamLab Biovortex. I had heard mixed reviews of teamLab, but I enjoyed it. I spent sky of 2 hours there and likely could have spent another 30 minutes. It was a nice break from the previous types of sights. I meandered my way back to my accommodations near Nishiki Market. I planned on an early morning, so no late wandering today.

 

The following morning, I went to Fushimi Inari. I arrived around 7AM. It wasn’t crowded, but there were a decent number of people at the base. It thinned out when you go up. It took me a couple hours to go up, do the upper circuit, visit the observation deck and head back down. This includes waiting out sections of the trail for it to be completely clear for photos. I had a tea ceremony booked, so I decided to do some souvenir shopping while slowly making my way back. I visited Kaikado for a tea caddy, Ichihara Heibei Shōten for chopsticks and Naito Shoten for brushes. I also walked through Nishiki Market before heading to Gion, and Tea Ceremony Camellia FLOWER. The tea ceremony was a nice experience, but not something I would repeat. (Part of it is education/try it yourself.) I did it as an individual so it was a group of random people. Afterward, I tried to walk through Gion but realized it’s too crowded during the day. I went to Butsuden temple, visited the Yamatomichi shop (lightweight hiking gear), had soba lunch at Soba-no-Mi Yoshimura and slowly meandered my way to the southern end of the national garden (veering right to swing by Pontocho Alley) before turning around for the GEAR show. I really enjoyed the show. It’s non-verbal, which made it feel very inclusive. Most of the people were tourists. Afterward, I grabbed a 10 yen coin snack and tonkatsu sandwich for dinner. I took a stroll through the market area and called it a night.

 

After realizing how busy it gets, I decided to head out early on the third day. I walked along the Shirakawa Canal, through Gion and visited the Yasaka Shrine along the way to Kiyomizu-dera. All of the areas were really nice. I understand why people like it, but I definitely would not try to go during mid day again. Kiyomizu-dera was really nice as well. It’s perched up high and surrounded by trees, so the scenery was lovely with the leaves changing colours. Afterward, I took the train up to Jingu-Marutamachi Station and walked along the river to Demachiyanagi Station. This stretch was actually really enjoyable. It showed me a different side of Kyoto. A lot of people were just hanging by the riverside, going on runs, etc. At Demachiyanagi Station, I took transit to Kibuneguchi station, and walked/visited all the shrines up to the rear shrine. I then took the path through the forest toward Kurama and stopped at Kuramadera Temple to enjoy the views. The trail is pretty easy and there were some really nice views (mainly on the east side) with the leaves starting to change colours. After reaching Kurama, I decided not to go the onsen and just went back to Demachiyanagi Station. I meandered back to the main strip near Karasuma Station, zigzagging through the market and the adjacent alleys/streets and popping into the national garden. I had a late eel lunch at Sumiyaki Unafuji Daimaru Kyoto Bettei, and then hopped onto a bus to the northern end of the Philospher’s Path. I walked south on the path to Eikandō Temple for the autumn illumination. Both the path and temple were actually really nice strolls at night, but I think they’d be better with daylight. I took a bus back to Karasuma Station, had yakitori at Torikizoku again and called it an early-ish night.

 

The last day I left really early. I wasn’t able to pick up a knife I wanted in Sakai when I was there, so I decided to try one last time. I showed up early and got it, and then headed to Takayama. The Hida train ride was really nice. Views were great and made better when paired with an ekiben!

 

**Takayama:** November 24, 2025 - November 25, 2025

 

After arriving in Takayama, I decided to just explore the old town. It’s quite quaint. I mainly spent time in shops and tried a few sake breweries. I also had a couple hida beef skewers at Hidagyu no komori, which were delicious. I had yakiniku for dinner at Aji-no-Yohei. After dinner, I just walked around and explored. I visited Hie Shrine and Hida Tenmangu Shrine in the south, and meandered up north west of the train station, near Takayama Sky Park. (I regret not going up Sky Park though! The views are supposed to be nice, but the weather wasn’t cooperating so I forfeited it.)

 

The following morning, I walked through the old town on the east side of the river again. I really enjoy the morning and evening peacefulness. I visited the Miyagawa morning market, the Hida Kokubun-ji Temple and then walked to the Hida no Sato Folk Village Museum. It’s a bunch of historic houses with educational displays inside. There were houses brought in from different areas of Gifu. It was raining off-and-on that day, so it was nice to be able to duck into the houses. I enjoyed this more than I had thought. There’s plenty to read, and I found the construction interesting. Afterward, I stopped by Hida Craft Beer for a pint before returning to downtown. This turned out to be my favourite craft brewery! (Originally, I wanted to visit the Matsukura Castle ruins and the Sky Park, but alas, the clouds foiled my plans.) I visited the Takayama Jinya, which is an old governing building -- lovely to see the architecture. I grabbed a couple snacks -- hida beef sushi at 金乃こって牛, and a bun at Kikura Kami Ninomachi -- and went to try the other two distilleries. The Retro and Shōwa-kan Museums were on my list of places to visit, but I ran out of time before my bus to Kanazawa.

 

**Kanazawa:** November 25, 2025 - November 27, 2025

 

After arriving in Kanazawa, I walked to my accommodation near Omicho Market and then went to grab a seafood donburi for dinner at Izakaya Sashimiya Ōmichō. I meandered my way over to the east side of the Asano River for a flight at Oriental Brewing, and then continued through Higashi Chaya. I started to go up Overlook Hill, but the storm clouds were really coming in, so I stopped at 三浦彦太郎君之像. Regardless, I had some great city night views at Hosenji Temple. I decided to head back and call it a night with the rain and wind picking up.

 

The following day, I went to Noukabanzai Tonariya Nodoguro for a mamameshi breakfast -- I really enjoyed it. I walked around Kanazawa Castle (which was under repair) to Kenroku-en Garden. The garden was nice, but it was still raining on-and-off, which detracted from the experience. There were a few pockets of sunlight and the views of the city from up top were pretty nice. I also went to the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Traditional Arts and Crafts, which I may have enjoyed more. Afterward, I went back to the Omicho Market. I had a curry lunch at Kanazawa Curry Laboratory, and a small crab snack (It was crab season.) and grilled loach snack at two random vendors. I walked to the Nagamachi samurai district. I visisted the Kanazawa City Ashigaru Museum and Nomura-ke Samurai Heritage Residence, which were old samurai houses from different classes. It was neat to see the difference. After exploring the area for a bit, I went to Myouryuji (Ninja Temple) -- a temple which was built with traps and secret doors -- and Ninja Weapon Museum in the Nishi Chaya District. The guide through the temple was pretty enjoyable. I think a lot of people enjoy the ninja weapon museum, but I think I preferred some of the other museums I’ve visited more. I walked around Tatemachi for a bit, and ended up at Craft Beer Bar & Pub Tatemachi CHE. I chatted with a random other traveler for a few hours, and then went to Torikizoku for dinner as most places were now closed. I called it a night after and then just headed back to my accommodations.

 

The last day, I decided to see if I could get a better view. I went back to Noukabanzai Tonariya Nodoguro for breakfast again, then headed over to Higashi Chaya and back up to Hosenji Temple. I enjoyed the stroll through the neighbourhoods, and the views up top, but I ultimately decided not to continue to the top of overlook hill. I didn’t want to get back to Tokyo too late, so I just meandered my way to Kanazawa Station, through Hikosomachi.

 

**Tokyo:** November 27, 2025 - November 30, 2025

 

After arriving in Ikebukuro, I went to asahi for a steak lunch. I then explored Ikebukuro PARCO, to find the Evangelion Store and the Kei Mochizuki art exhibit. Unfortunately, I couldn’t book a ticket for the same day online, so I postponed it till the following day. It was still early-ish, so I hopped on a subway and went to Setagaya City to visit the Hitohira store. I also grabbed a taiyaki snack at 横浜くりこ庵 三軒茶屋店. Afterward, I went back to Ikebukuro to check-in to my accommodations. I went to the SUNSHINE 60 OBSERVATORY. The views were great at night and definitely worth it for me. I explored Sunshine City. The Pokémon Center and Bandai Namco Cross Store were pretty cool to see. (I wish I would have had time to go back, but I was in other areas instead -- next time!) I had ramen dinner at Karashibi Miso Ramen Kikanbō, and then meandered the streets. There were so many gatcha, claw and other game stores! It was definitely neat to see the contrast, especially after all the time I’ve been spending at temples and old neighbourhoods. I walked back to my accommodations after those places started to close.

 

The following day, I went directly to Roppongi Hills in the morning. (Rush hour on the subway is wild! People are too dense for my Bluetooth signal to pass through them, haha. Also, can confirm: Shibuya crossing is just a busy crossing.) I walked around the neighbourhood for awhile, and then headed up to Mori Tower for the Evangelion 30^(th) Anniversary Exhibit. As an old fan of the series, I really enjoyed the exhibit. It’s also at the top, so I had some really good views of the city – with Mt. Fuji in the background too! Afterward, I planned to do some kitchen equipment shopping. I took the subway to Tawaramachi Station (southwest of Asakusa), walked toward Asakusa and meandered my way up to Sensō-ji. I zigzagged a bit to explore the area. I had a melon pan snack at Asakusa Kagetsudō Melon Bread and an eel onigiri snack at Asakusa Unana before heading to Kappabashi Street. The knife selection was pretty disappointing for me -- a lot of overpriced stuff – but there were a couple decent pieces at a couple stores. It wasn’t bad for general kitchen stuff though (e.g. brushes, spatulas, etc.). Afterward, I walked down to Morihei near Asakusabashi Station for natural stones and then west to 2k540 Aki-Oka between Ueno and Akihabara Station for some pottery. I grabbed a quick egg sandwich at Egg Baby Café and then took the subway back to Ikebukuro. I went to the Kei Mochizuki art exhibit, went to the Evangelion store, had dinner at gyukatsu at Gyukatsu Motomura, and then wandered around the west side of Ikebukuro before calling it a night. I enjoyed the exhibit more than I thought I would!

 

The third day was a mix of exploration and dealing with logistics. I had started picking up souvenirs, but I only had a carry-on piece, so I needed luggage. I walked from Ikebukuro to Shinjuku station. I ended up getting two IKEA bags to use as luggage (nested in one-another), picked up some gifts from Itoya, LOFT, Hands, Don Quixote, drug stores, etc. I heard that Shinjuku is a busy station, and I see what people mean now -- I spent some time to just watching all the trains. I stopped at TSUKEMEN RAMEN NAMIURA for a tsukemen lunch. I went to Akihbara afterward. (Originally, Meiji Jingu and the walk to Shibuya were on my list, but I spent too long in Shinjuku.) The evening vibe is very different -- a lot more active. I went through some of the malls, and shops from Akihabara Station to Okachimachi Station. I also grabbed a taiyaki snack from Kurikoan. I took the subway back to Ikebukuro and had omurice for dinner at yellow. Unfortunately, by the time I was done, places were starting to close. I went to grab a few last minute gifts and then headed back to my accommodations, since I still needed to pack.

 

The last morning always feels weird -- maybe a bit bittersweet? I headed out early and walked around Ikebukuro. I sat around the east side of the station -- definitely less morning traffic than I was expecting. Once stores started to open, I went to grab some last minute plane snacks and pantry goods to bring back. I then packed up, took a subway and bus to the airport. Check-in was faster than expected, I definitely could have stayed in town a bit longer, but oh well. Less stress this way, and I guess I’ll just have to come back.

 

**Final thoughts**

 

Overall, it was a great trip. It was busy and I moved around a lot, but I never felt tired from it, was able to see a lot of cool stuff and gave myself moments to just sit and take it in. A few random thoughts:

 

Looking back at it, I covered a lot: I walked a lot (\~35k daily average), ate a lot (snacks and meals for days), and read a lot (every single plaque).

 

Travel was super convenient. Transit was easy to navigate, either via the Google Maps or JapanTravel app. Most places I visited took Suica, and Apple Wallet has easy access to Suica for international users. This could then be connected to SmartEx for shinkansen. That said, sometimes it would take be a bit more time to walk than to take transit, which would let me see so much more of the city.

 

I started early to avoid the crowds and ended late to see more at night. Because of that, konbinis were great for coffee on-the-go and fast food chains, like Yoshinoya, were great for early morning breakfast when I didn’t want konbini food.

 

Because I only had a backpack, I often just carried everything with me. It kept things more flexible -- there were a couple times when I wouldn’t have detoured if I had large luggage. I also kept plans pretty flexible, so I usually modified things at night or during the day.",1,1764650375.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

This week I got the chance to host a beautiful group of **16 mid-elderly couples from Uttar Pradesh**, and trust me — they had *more energy and enthusiasm than any young group I’ve ever taken* 

They landed in Port Blair, and on Day 3 we did the **Baratang Island tour** — crossing the famous **Jarawa Reserve area**.  
This journey itself is magic. Every minute feels special.

# We Started at 3 AM! Yes Midnight!

We booked a **21-seater AC Tempo Traveller** — super comfortable.  
Early morning journeys in Andaman are different… no traffic, no noise, just pure peace.

And guess what? **I was the guide for the group**. At the end of the tour they told me how much they loved the explanations — and honestly, this made my day.

I always feel:  
*Without proper guidance, it’s just a visit.*  
*With guidance, the place becomes a memory forever.*

Places like **Cellular Jail, Ross Island, Viper Island, Baratang** — these become 10x more meaningful when someone explains the history, stories, and local insights.

# Jirkatang Check Post – First Stop (45 km / 1.5 hrs from Port Blair)

We reached early so our vehicle could be among the first in the convoy.  
Because inside Jarawa Reserve **no overtaking** is allowed.

At Jirkatang:

* Sunrise was beautiful 
* Lots of small breakfast stalls (tea, coffee, idli, dosa, puri, vada)
* Basic toilet facilities available
* Locals here mostly belong to the **Ranchi community**—they were settled here long ago for forest work.

At 6 AM sharp the convoy starts.  
Forms submitted, names registered, and we entered the **Jarawa Reserve Forest Area**.

# The Jarawa Tribe Experience

Many rules:  
No stopping, no photography, no feeding, no open windows.

The Jarawas here are not extremely shy anymore.  
You will mostly see **women and children**, very rarely young males.

It’s a short 50 km stretch, but speed limits make it a 2-hour slow, calm drive through untouched forest.

# Middle Strait Check Post → Vehicle Ferry → Baratang Island

After crossing the forest, we took the **vehicle ferry**. This ferry connects thousands of locals every day.

A new bridge is also under construction here — once it opens, travel will be smoother.

We reached Baratang around **8:30–9 AM**.  
Because we arrived early, we avoided the heavy crowd and got the first boats to the **Limestone Caves**.

# Mangrove Boat Ride + Forest Trek (Most Adventurous Part)

We took 2 high-speed fibre boats (8–10 seaters each).  
Life jackets on — and we started the beautiful mangrove ride.

This part is unreal:

* Narrow creeks
* Mangroves bending over the water
* Small hills on both sides
* Feels like mini-Sundarbans 

The wooden forest walkway is adventurous and scenic.  
Boards show details about birds, trees, and reptiles found here.  
Local stalls sell nimbu pani, cucumber, and seasonal fruits — refreshing!

The trek is around **1.6 km one side**.  
Even though my group had elderly members, **they completed the trek with full confidence and smiles**.

During monsoon, this trek can be slightly tough.

# Inside the Limestone Caves

This is where the real wonder begins.

As soon as you enter the caves, the temperature drops.  
Our boat boy used a torch to guide us, showing formations shaped over millions of years.

You can spot formations that look like:

* Elephant head
* Ganesha
* Human figures
* Various natural sculptures created by nature

# How Limestone is Formed (Simple Explanation for Everyone)

Limestone is mainly made up of **Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)**.  
It forms over **millions of years** when:

Shells, corals, marine skeletons, and tiny sea organisms settle at the bottom of the ocean  
Their remains compress under pressure  
Layers harden into solid rock called *limestone*

Over time, water seeps in and dissolves parts of the rock.  
This creates:

* Passages
* Chambers
* Stalactites (hanging from the ceiling)
* Stalagmites (rising from the floor)

This slow dripping and dissolving process formed the **Baratang Limestone Caves**.

So what you see today is the result of **nature working continuously for millions of years**.

# Overall Experience

My group said that the guidance made their journey unforgettable — which made me genuinely happy.  
Whenever we handle groups, I personally accompany them to ensure they understand the stories, culture, and history of Andaman deeply.

Andaman is not just beaches —  
It’s **tribal history, costal lifestyles, mangroves, caves, forests, ferries, and pure untouched nature**.

1pbz0ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pbz0ma/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_bestfriend_of_nearly_3/,AITAH for cutting off my bestfriend of nearly 3 years,"there is a lot of context here so i will try and cover all bases. 

So there is me 21 F, my ex bestfriend we’ll call her Leanne 21F and my boy bestfriend Andy 22M.

For context, me and Andy are very close friends and used to spend a lot of time together as we used to be in a metal band together. I met Leanne through the gigs I played with Andy’s band and became some what friendly with Leanne as she always came to the gigs.  The summer I joined the band I ended up going to a music festival with my ex, who left me at the music festival by myself mostly for 3 days straight. Leanne happened to be at the festival so I met up with her spent most of the festival with her and after became super close.

Leanne had recently gone through something very traumatic, her dad is in jail for being a p*do for years. Not going to get into too much detail but it’s was quite severe, especially in my country where the judicial system doesn’t actually give you time. So yk… if your in jail in this country it must be prettttyyy bad. (He never did anything to her only make her feel uncomfortable). As a normal person would, I was a support system or Leanne because she didn’t have many close female friends and we were very close at this stage it felt like she was a sister. I even put my own personal stuff aside to be there for her when I should’ve looked after my own mental health, but I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through so I always put her first. 

As time went of we were inseparable, we had an on going joke that we were each others ‘wives’. This. THIS IS WHERE IS ALLL WENT WRONG. (Or maybe my eyes were opened).

Context: we are in a large friend group of 4 girls and about 5/6 boys. We’re like a family HOWEVER, she had kissed Andy in the past very drunk and another boy we’ll call Bob. 

Anytime I got any male attention she would just shut it down always or try to involve herself. So you get and idea of how bad it got I’ll give you a short anecdote: 

I met this guy we went on a few dates I brought him out with my friends to celebrate 
Leanne getting into the same college as me.
And I was sat in between Leanne and the guy, when she starts caressing my thigh and telling him if he wants to date me he has to get used to her. Etc etc, I felt deeply uncomfortable with that and I went out for a smoke with him BUT SHE FOLLOWED (she doesn’t smoke). I mentioned it to her after to clam down with the whole wife thing because it made me feel uncomfortable and there’s no way any guy would be comfortable with that type of behaviour in front of someone who’s supposed to be their date/gf yk. And she said it was a joke and any guy would want to get used to how your friends are with you. Mind you completely ignoring the fact I said I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT. 

I am aware of other women being jealous of me because I am a looking girl and I do get all sorts of attention I don’t want for just existing but that’s not my fault. I’ve had so many people be horrible to be over the years it’s exhausting. But I never thought it would be my best friend 

Bob had a friend well call her Kylie F23, Kylie and Bob got together a few times. But Kylie was very touchy feely and flirty with every guy and as a feminist and as someone who really tired to give Kylie the benefit of the doubt and teach her girl code and normal girl stuff. She was in fact and on paper the DEFINITION of a pick me, and I hate saying it but I tired but there was no use with her, she was just sooo rude. Anyways Leanne absolutely hated Kylie for liking Bob because Bob liked Kylie too and Leanne got thrown to the side after Bob gave Leanne her first seggzy time experience. (Sorry idk if Reddit filters stuff like that but I also think it’s hilarious typing it out) 

So you know what Leanne does after being rejected. She gets Kylie kicked out of the friend group because apparently she kept making her feel conscious about her weight because Kylie kept talking about how small she was (tbf the girl was the same size as a 10 yr old). Which is fair I’ll give her that but I think she could’ve gone about dealing with Kylie differently instead of making everyone else fight her battles for her. 

Over the summer one of our friends 23 M was getting married and couldn’t go on his stag to Spain to see the formula one. I was best woman, and took his place on the trip. 

HOWEVER.     Ohhh boy.     So. 

At the turn of the new year, I also happen to have a similar trauma to Leanne. I found out my stepdad had been posting pictures of me when I was 15/16 on kik and saying he was having relations….(if you know what I mean) with me for 5 years. So until he was caught. I couldn’t cope my whole world fell apart. Couldn’t eat sleep you name it nightmares panic attacks. 

ANYWAYS, this is where the stag comes in. At this point in my friendship with Leanne I’d like to believe she had a lot of control over me, she asked me to do something I’d do it out of guilt or pity. I always put her first. Always asked if she wanted to come out or go places feeling like I had to ask for her permission a lot of the time. So when I was asked to go on the formula one stag trip, I rang and asked her if she definitely didn’t want to go and if I could go instead. 

WELL WELL WELL 

She couldn’t go. So she made it her mission to make me feel like I couldn’t. She told me I’d look like Kylie. I’d look like a pick me going on a holiday with a bunch of lads and especially because it was a f1 trip too. I will never forget putting down that phone after that call I felt sick to my stomach. 

CONTEXT: I used to fix cars with my dad when I was small always a loved them. All those boys are like my brothers. (used to have a crush on Andy when I first met him, for context again at this point that was at what a year ago) 

I was in shock. My bestfriend. The only person that i know that will actually understand everything I’ve been going through. Treats me like that? Wow. OH AND IT GETS WORSE. 

after the trip and my friends wedding. I really sit and think about all the things she’s done and said. I was going to sit down and talk to her like a normal adult would because I valued our friendship and didn’t want to lose it. 

(Context again: I go home to the countryside for the summer and go back to the city for college) 

I wanted to go to a gig during the summer in the city, so I asked to stay over at her house. That’s wasn’t an issue and we had a good time. I wasn’t ready to talk to her about our friendship yet I also didn’t want to do it in her safe space, especially if I were staying the night. What if she kicked me out and I had nowhere to stay? 

I didn’t see her again until I moved back for college. At this time Andy was leaving for Erasmus we were over at Bob‘s house me and Bob and another girl and guy from our group. We were hanging out playing darts and pool. Before we left, I was messing with Bob and Bob nearly slipped up and told me something he shouldn’t, and said I can’t tell you that and I said tell me what? what are you talking about? So Bob brought me into the shed in his back garden and told me that Andy and Leanne had got together twice over the summer as in went back to Andy‘s house if you know what I mean. 

I was infuriated 

Leanne had the cheek to call me a pick me and then she goes and gets with the one guy that I liked in our friend group. I know I don’t have ownership over Andy I don’t like the guy I see him as my brother but girl code is a real thing especially if you want to so heavily police it when it comes to BOB!!!!!

So I pulled bar side and I asked him what happened. He said that they went back to his that they didn’t go all the way and he didn’t tell me because Leanne wanted to hide it from me. 

He told me that he wanted to tell me and it’s something stupid to lie about and hide from me and that I probably wouldn’t care. It’s the lying that I would be mad about. 

Which is BANG ON THE MONEY. 

So Andy does actually know me as a friend. 

I genuinely wanted to cry. I was so upset and I got one of the other guys to drive me home. I screamed in his car all the way home about how much I absolutely hated Leon. I was so upset and I don’t get angry. It’s just not in my nature.

At this point in time I was with one of my other girlfriends she didn’t know about it because Leanne never told anyone Andy told all of the boys. So some of them had known from two months and never said anything to me.

Unfortunately, the next day it was Andy‘s leaving party before he was leaving for Erasmus to go to France for the next few months and guess who was obviously coming on Leanne herself and all of our friends. 

Amazing. Just delightful. 

So I got to Andy first when I arrive and I speak to him and I say were you gonna tell me at all and he said I was gonna tell you today and I said what at your party so you could have a big fucking drama before you leave And he was like yeah it’s probably not a good idea and I said yeah, and I kinda left it at that for the rest of the night

I kept close to Bob because I trust Bob because he told me the truth. I was radio silence with Leanne the entire night because I couldn’t talk to her without blowing up and I didn’t want to do that so I kept my cool and drank my beers and kept quite as good as I could. Meanwhile having a fiery pit over rage in my stomach. 

Eventually Leanne lefts I think she realised that I knew and that’s why everyone was weird with her.
 
I needed time to cool down so I left it a week. I called Andy I told him he needs to stop thinking what his dick that has so much more than whatever he was doing with Leanne. I said it’s a break of trust and it’s a break of respect. I said it takes 2 to tango and I said to him that you’re your own person you have your own backbone and you should’ve done the right thing instead of handing all the blame to Leanne. I told him it’s gonna take a long time for me to trust him again and that I need him to be a better friend. I do understand where he was coming from. I think he wanted to please everyone in that situation. I do understand that he does have a lot of anxiety and a lot of people pleasing tendencies. I said I had the same thing to him But in these types of situations you have to make the hard decision and do the right thing rather than try to please people.

Then I met up with Leanne

When I tell you it took everything out of me not to smack her

Just to piss her off, I was fashionably an hour late. I met her at an expensive coffee shop in the city centre and sat down outside rolling my cigarette having my coffee and I said to her is there anything you would like to tell me?

She said no 

I said OK, are you sure about that? 
And then she said is this about Andy? 
And I said yep, this is about Andy 
She said that she made a mistake and she doesn’t understand why I’m not talking to her 
(This is a month or 2 after I acc had this conversation so I’ll sum it up to the key points) 

She basically told me that she only did it for the attention because she never gets that type of attention and that if she has bigger things to worry about then this because she has her career to build she also told me that it was a mistake she didn’t mean it, but I told her that she did it twice. It’s not a mistake if you do it twice And the second time she didn’t drink that much she only had one beer so she was sober.

I asked her why she didn’t say anything she said you’re going through so much that I wouldn’t want to put this on you as well. I said you did it anyways and then hid it for two months when I was in your house you could have told me. 

She went on about the fact that her life is so hard at the minute because her routine has changed because she has a job teaching that she has got with her degree because she needs the experience for her masters that she applied to do 

Meanwhile, I have not slept for the entire summer. I’ve lost so much weight and I’m kind of losing my mind and now my best friend has decided to lie to me in the exact time where I am at my weakest and the time that I need her the most She does something I would never ever think about doing ever. 

Throughout the entire conversation it went in loops of me catching her out on her manipulation and back tracking and being empathetic when she said she was struggling. I really did hear her out however she didn’t make any sense. 

(a stranger came up to me and told me that they overheard my conversation with Leanne and asked me if I was a therapist because I handled it so well calmly and compassionate) - one of my prouder moments 

It’s been a few months since me and Andy have sat down and had a thorough talk and Aaron speaking terms now and he plans to make up for what he’s done and he’s actually cried a lot to me and it’s very very upset with what he did he said if I felt like I got told you I wish it could’ve been a different way yada yada yada you know yourself. However radio silence nothing from Leanne.

Am I the asshole ?
