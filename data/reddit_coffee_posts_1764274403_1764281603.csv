The therapist also coached their clients into confronting their abusers, often bringing the abusers into therapy sessions to coach the victims through the confrontation. One example is where the client confronts their abuser at their grave.

That is all I can remember. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!",1,1764281373.0,askatherapist,0,1.0,False

1p8edq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1p8edq1/what_is_going_on_with_french_restaurants/,What is going on with French restaurants?,"I've been in the country for 12 days now, Paris plus 2 other cities, and sorrynotsorry but the food has been mid.  A few pretty good meals but nothing noteworthy.  I made a point of trying multiple boulangeries wherever I was staying and the results were very mixed.  And what's with all the bitter vending machine coffee everywhere?

I've eaten at variety of places, in some tourist areas, some well away from the tourist areas.  Some French (""French""), some Asian, some hipster-y fusion-y, some Middle Eastern, etc.  I've tried to mix it up, is my point.  And it hasn't helped.

E.g. I went to a boulangerie that looked good, and got a fridge-cold croissant and chausson aux pommes that were definitely not baked in the 12 hours prior.  I've had better Pillsbury crescent rolls.

Tonight I had ""bao"" that was a large hamburger bun that had been baked and later steamed.  Served with COLD roasted potatoes!  From a place with good reviews!

One of the better sandwiches I had was from a train station Pret a Manger.  I guess I happened to get it when it was fresh.

Two nights in a row, I went into restaurants planning to order a dish from their posted menu, only to be handed the current/real (I guess) menu that did not have that dish. Okayyyyy... 

I might as well keep going.  I have an issue with the food hygiene.  E.g. bread served in baskets that are not lined with a napkin or similar and the basket is visibly grimy and/or impossible to wash (straw).  I happened to be sitting outside a boulangerie when a van pulled up to deliver some more baguettes from wherever they are baked.  50 or so unwrapped/uncovered baguettes in this big plastic wheeled bin.  Gross.

I'm sure this post will set some people off but this has been my experience.",0,1764281287.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.4,False

First of all, my boss and I applied lmua with a visa consultant and during the process it was only my boss and the consultant talking so I am not very sure what kind of stream exactly it was.

Applied ealry August 2024, low-wage, inland (BC). Not 100% sure what my job teer or title was but I'm currently working at a coffee shop as a store manager. I was the first employee who ever applied for lmia under my employer so it took a little extra time. Received a rejection email couple weeks ago so it took a year and three months since I applied.

The reason of the rejection was they found the job position that I applied for doesn't look qualified/needed in the business and they won't proceed it anymore. So yeah, sadly, it got rejected.

If you guys have any questions I'd be happy to answer but unfortunately that's pretty much all I know right now. I just wanted to share this information with you guys. 

Hope you guys have a good luck with your case.",0,1764281237.0,lmiaprocessing,0,0.5,False
1p8ed3n,https://i.redd.it/jsh40h2xhv3g1.jpeg,Solo US Cross Country Roadtrip in December,"Hi everyone
I am planning a long solo road trip (~20 days) soon and I would love to hear from people who have done something similar. I want to know what the journey felt like for you, what you learned, and what you would suggest for someone doing this for the first time.

My route is simple and mostly focused on mountains, deserts, and open landscapes.
I start in Nashville and drive to Denver.
From Denver I continue toward Page in Arizona.
After Page I head to Las Vegas.
From Las Vegas I drive to San Jose.
From San Jose I continue to Reno.
After Reno I move toward Salt Lake City.
From Salt Lake I continue to Albuquerque.
Then I return to Nashville via Dallas.

I would love to hear from anyone who has driven through these areas or done long solo road trips in general.

I am especially curious about what parts of the drive felt the most beautiful or meaningful.
I want to know which stretches felt safe when you were alone and which areas you think require more caution. I would appreciate any memories of food or coffee stops that stood out.
I am also interested in roads that looked ordinary on the map but turned out to be incredible in person.

Any helpful ideas for staying focused and comfortable on long driving days would mean a lot.

If you have suggestions for places to rest or stay along the way that would also help.

I would love to know what items you were thankful you carried with you.

If there are hidden viewpoints or small surprises on this route that most travelers miss I would love to learn about them.

I am planning to record parts of the journey so any advice for capturing good photos or video while traveling alone would be great as well.

And if you have personal stories from your own solo trips that taught you something important I would love to hear them.

Thank you to anyone who shares their thoughts. I want this trip to be open and flexible but I also want to be prepared and aware.

I appreciate any help and I will try to update the post once the trip begins

It’s that time of year everybody, it’s dark, it’s cold, it’s wet- snowy and icy depending where you are in Canada and amidst all of this bone chilling heart ache from the summer time fling that has come to an end; Christmas lights start appearing all over the place. Gigantic inflatable snowmen, Rudolphs, Santas, fake and real icicles hanging from soffits. Bublé and Bieber belting out Christmas lyrics like they were just in a boy band break up because they were rivals, now competing for Walmart’s hot Xmas playlist. 

Speaking of which, time to start making lists, checking them twice, send em off to your loved ones. “Hey!! This is what I want for Christmas this year!” And “Why haven’t you sent me your list yet!? How am I supposed to know what you want from Santa!?” 

Black Friday and holiday emails filling up my inbox like it’s St Nics sac before he drops off gifts at all the good kids’ houses and condominiums. Racing to the shopping malls, the outlet stores, navigating through all of the fuckin holiday zombies out there driving like they haven’t been living in a snow riddled province. “This. Is. Snow?” “You drove in it like 6 months ago, you fuckin’ idiot, have some situational awareness!” Walking through malls running into walls of these same automobile drivers now, outside of them, eyes glued to cellular devices, full family outing, standing five abreast strong, clogging the aisles with their fat shopping carts and fat meat mobiles. “Excuse me…” “EXCUSE ME!!” “Oh, sorry.” “Yeah.” 

There’s two ways to avoid this. Go early, like very early. November and time of day wise, greet the door opener type early and double check your list before you go in. Think about the layout of the mall, park accordingly, “Ok, if I go…no. Ok if I go counter clockwise I can hit Aritzia, LuLu lemon, SportCheck, hang a quick right, stop at the fucking Lego store for these 35 year old children, then, double back hit the Apple Store and I’m back where I started, the East 112th street exit.” Or if that’s not your thing, you sit on the couch, you’ve got your list in your hand, beer or coffee in the other, depending on time of day of course, and you get on that Amazon app, start loading up that virtual cart, boom. Boom. Boom. No strain, no playing Red Rover  in the aisles with families who’re looking up, down, left, right, cross eyed, and half eyed down at a phone. No parking lot trots. “Ok where’s my wallet, my cvv…k yeah, I used to have this memorized you know” talking to no body. Click. Confirm. Click. Done. Wait. Open front door, grab the package, store in closet or wherever your hiding space is. *Knock knock* open, grab your last delivery item. “Uh huh, thanks, yeah I just put them up actually, they’re on a timer”. Enough of that bullshit, grab your gifts. Get your tape, wrapping paper, some egg nog and rum, with a fuckin nice dusting of cinnamon on top and spit some bars like you’re Eminem or Logic, no oxygen needed, I’m just wrapping. Go place that shit under the tree, keeping a close eye on your loved one eyeing the shit out of their gift. “Eh stop that. I know what you’re doing. Put that down. Nice try.” Wait for the big day.

My Family Left a Chair Empty On Thanksgiving.,"I’m writing this at my aunt’s kitchen table with my duffel bag sitting by the door and a cold slice of pizza going soggy on a paper plate next to me.

If my parents call, I’m not picking up. I already told them I’m not coming home for Thanksgiving. Not tonight, not tomorrow, maybe not ever.

I know how dramatic that sounds. I’m seventeen, not seven. I’m supposed to roll my eyes at family drama and get over it.

But last year, the night before Thanksgiving, something walked me home.

And I don’t mean that in the cute “guardian angel” way adults use when they talk about near misses on the highway.

I mean something followed me, herded me, and tried to make sure I didn’t make it back at all.

We live in a small town off Exit 23, outside Albany. My parents moved us there when I was in middle school for “fresh air and a good school district.” It’s mostly trees, a strip mall, a Stewart’s, and the kind of old houses people hang American flags on year-round until they’re sun-bleached.

The only thing that ever felt unique about the place was the story everyone told in November.

They called him the Buckled Man.

The first time I heard it was in sixth grade during a lock-in at the community center. Lights off, sleeping bags everywhere, kids wired on Mountain Dew and Red Vines from the vending machine. It was around one in the morning. One of the counselors, a college kid named Eric, started telling us “local history.”

That’s what he called it. Not a ghost story. “Local history with a warning.”

He said back when the town was just a cluster of farms and a church, there was a man named Gideon Yates. Gideon was a veteran from “the war back then” (which one changed depending on who told it) and supposedly walked home from battle to find his family had moved away without leaving word.

No one invited him in that first winter. Not for Sunday dinners, not for the harvest feast, not even for Thanksgiving. They were “all full up,” they said. “No room at the table.”

That night, a snowstorm rolled in. The story says Gideon wandered house to house in the dark, knocking and begging to be let in. Everyone pretended not to hear him.

In the morning, they found him frozen in the middle of his field, dressed in his Sunday clothes and the black coat he wore to church. His hat was tipped over his face. His boots were lined up neat at the front door of his house.

The houses that had turned him away started having accidents after that. A child went missing walking home from a neighbor’s. A man bled out from a “farming tool mishap.” A woman was found in the well. Every year, always right around Thanksgiving.

Kids said Gideon came back as the Buckled Man. That he walked the back roads and fields in a long black coat with old-fashioned buckles on the shoes and hat. That he hated empty chairs and full tables. That if you left a seat open on purpose—because you didn’t want someone there, because they “weren’t welcome”—he’d come the night before Thanksgiving and take someone to fill it.

Adults rolled their eyes when we brought it up. “It’s just a story about hospitality and gratitude,” my mom said once, rinsing dishes. “A scare tactic from back when people had to rely on each other to survive winter.”

For years, that’s all it was. A story. Something kids whispered on the school bus or used to dare each other into walking past the empty field on Yates Road.

Then last year happened.

The fighting started early that week.

It was about my Uncle Mark.

He’s my mom’s older brother. He used to come over every Thanksgiving with his wife and little boy. Then he started drinking too much. Not just beer during the game, but showing up with a flask, taking “bathroom breaks” every twenty minutes, coming back red-eyed and loud.

Two years ago, he started a fight with my dad. Threw a chair, smashed some dishes, knocked my little cousin’s plate right off the table. My parents cleaned up the mess and swore that was it.

“He’s not welcome here anymore,” my dad said. “Not until he gets help.”

I understood at first. I saw my baby cousin hiding under the table, shaking. I heard my mom crying later in the bathroom with the fan on.

But this year, Uncle Mark called me himself. Slurred, yeah, but crying. He left this long voicemail about how he was “trying real hard” and just wanted to see the family.

“Please, kiddo. Talk to your mom for me. I just want my seat back one more year.”

He called me “kiddo” like when I was ten and he took me fishing. That messed with me.

I made the mistake of playing the voicemail on speaker at dinner.

My dad shut it off halfway through. “He’s not coming, Kyle,” he said. “We already talked about this.”

“We could… we could invite him and just tell him he can’t drink?” I said. I knew how dumb that sounded as I said it.

My mom shook her head. “You don’t tell an alcoholic ‘just don’t drink.’ It doesn’t work like that.”

“So you’re just going to pretend he doesn’t exist? Leave his seat empty and act like—”

“We’re not leaving it empty,” my dad snapped. “We’ll move things around.”

They didn’t, though.

The next morning, I walked past the dining room and saw the table already half set. My mom likes to do that early so she’s not scrambling on the actual day. The good tablecloth was out. Turkey-shaped napkin rings from when I was in kindergarten that still have my fingerprints baked into the paint. A line of plates.

There was still a chair at the end of the table. The folding one my uncle always used, right by the wall. No plate in front of it yet. Just blank table.

I stopped in the doorway. “I thought you were moving that chair.”

“I will,” Mom said. “I just haven’t decided how I want people seated yet.”

“You said you weren’t leaving an empty seat.”

“It’s not empty, Kyle.” She gave me that tight smile she uses when she’s trying not to argue. “I’m still figuring it out. Please drop it.”

I didn’t. Not really. I muttered about it on my walk to work, under my breath on the CDTA bus. Some guy in a Carhartt beanie looked at me like I was crazy.

When my shift lead at the grocery store asked how I was doing, I actually said, “My family’s trying to get me killed by a pilgrim ghost.”

He laughed. “What, you finally learned the Buckled Man story?”

“It’s not funny. They’re literally leaving an empty chair.”

He shrugged. “Then maybe don’t go home tonight.”

He meant it as a joke. I laughed like it was one.

I work part-time at Greene’s Market. It’s the only full grocery store in town unless you count the Dollar General. The day before Thanksgiving is hell there. Lines down every aisle, people yelling about pie crusts, some lady crying because we ran out of canned yams, everyone insisting their emergency is the worst.

The store plays this awful loop of holiday songs—“All I Want for Christmas Is You” starting up before we even clear Halloween. By that night, I wanted to rip the speakers out of the ceiling.

My shift started at two in the afternoon and was supposed to end at eight.

By nine-thirty, I was still there, restocking cranberry sauce on Aisle 4 and stacking frozen turkeys in a big cardboard display shaped like a pilgrim hat while my manager muttered about no-shows.

My phone kept buzzing in my pocket.

Mom: You okay?
Mom: Roads are getting icy. Dad can swing by.
Mom: Kyle? Answer please.

I sent a quick: Still here. I’ll walk. It’s fine.

It’s not that far. A ten-minute walk if I cut behind the strip mall and took the path through the woods instead of following the main road around. I’d done it a thousand times. Literally, like three or four times a week since sophomore year.

At 9:45, my friend Dani texted.

Dani: u off yet
Me: almost
Dani: don’t forget who walks tonight ;)
Me: stfu
Dani: u know the rules. empty chair = buckled man patrol. stay on the main road

I sent back a turkey emoji and one of those skulls and put my phone away.

We closed at ten. Fluorescent lights off, security gates down, doors locked. The parking lot thinned to just employee cars and a few last-minute shoppers hustling out with plastic bags.

My dad texted again as I stepped outside.

Dad: I’m already in the car. 5 minutes.
Dad: Don’t walk.

The air hit me like a slap. Sharp, wet cold that cut straight through my hoodie. You could see your breath. The sky was clouded over, low and heavy. The wind kicked little scraps of receipt paper and dead leaves across the asphalt.

“Hey.” My manager, Raj, flicked his lighter and cupped his hand around a cigarette. He always smells like coffee and Marlboros. “You need a ride?”

“Nah, my dad’s coming,” I lied. “He’s already on his way.”

“You sure? Roads are crap. People drive worse when they’re stressed.”

“I’m good. Thanks, though.”

He nodded, pulled his coat tighter, and headed for his Corolla.

I watched his taillights fade as he pulled out of the lot. It was just my breath and the hum of the parking lot lights then. The distant whine of a truck on the main road. Two shopping carts someone hadn’t brought in, bumping gently against each other.

Somewhere, the timer on the deli oven beeped twice and then shut off. The sound echoed weirdly in the empty front end.

I stood there a second longer than I needed to.

I don’t know why I changed my mind. Maybe it was stubbornness. Maybe it was the thought of sitting in a warm car with my dad in silence, both of us pretending we hadn’t been fighting about his brother all week.

Maybe a part of me wanted to prove I wasn’t scared of some old story.

I typed out a new text.

Me: Nvm I’ll just walk. It’s like ten mins.

I dropped my phone back into my pocket before the “…” even popped up.

I cut across the back of the parking lot, past the dumpsters where the light doesn’t reach as well. The asphalt back there is cracked and broken, weeds punching through. Somebody had dumped a busted pumpkin there that was still half-frozen to the ground. The air smells like rotting produce and burnt oil.

Halfway past the dumpsters, I heard a sound.

It was small. A scrape and a soft clink. Metal on pavement.

I stopped. Turned my head.

One of the carts rocked on its wheels, nudged by the wind. A loose can rolled against a dumpster.

I told myself that was it. Just the wind and the can.

Then something stepped into the edge of the light.

It was just at the border where the parking lot glow fades and the dark from the tree line begins. A shape. Tall. Still.

I couldn’t make out a face. Just the outline of a long coat and a wide-brim hat. For a second, the light hit something on the hatband. A small square of shine. A buckle.

I blinked hard and it was gone. Just the tree line again. Shadows and branches.

My heartbeat kicked up. My jaw clenched. The sensible thing would’ve been to turn around, go wait by the front of the store where the cameras and lights were, call my dad like he’d been telling me to.

Instead, I told myself, It’s a branch, an afterimage, stop freaking out, and kept walking.

I crossed the loading zone, stepped up over the broken curb, and slipped between two scraggly bushes onto the path.

Behind Greene’s, there’s a narrow trail people made from walking the same shortcut for years. It goes downhill behind the strip mall, through a stretch of woods, and comes out on Yates Road on the other side.

That road is the closest one to my house.

The trail was soft under my sneakers, dead leaves and old mud. The trees blocked most of the streetlight. My eyes adjusted slowly as I went. Tree trunks, low branches, the dark drop of the ravine to my right where the creek runs in spring and smells like wet pennies.

My breath sounded too loud. The wind in the bare branches sounded like whispering.

After maybe a minute, I heard that sound again.

Scrape. Clink.

This time behind me.

I froze. Listened.

At first there was only my own breathing and the wind fussing with the leaves.

Then, soft and distinct, I heard it again. A step. The weight of a boot on cold ground. Then another. Slow. Even.

I turned and squinted back the way I’d come.

Something stood where the trees met the edge of the parking lot. Taller than me. Shoulders a little hunched. Coat hanging down past the knees. Wide brim of a hat pulled low.

It was too far to see a face. The main thing I saw was the way the hatband caught what little light there was.

A dull, square gleam at the center. Like a buckle.

“Hello?” My voice came out sharper than I meant. “Raj? Is that you?”

No answer. No one stepped closer or moved away.

“Seriously, this isn’t funny.”

The shape didn’t react.

My throat went dry. I told myself it could be anyone. A random guy cutting through. A homeless person. One of the older kids from school with a hat and a coat trying to scare me because they saw me closing.

In stories, the stupid character always goes closer to check. I didn’t. I turned and started walking faster.

The trail bent left and right. Roots rose and fell underfoot. My breath came in shorter bursts as I sped up. I tried to keep it quiet, which just made me more aware of every exhale.

About thirty seconds later, I heard him again.

Scrape. Thud.

Bootsteps, slow and steady, matching my pace.

I sped up more. So did he.

The problem with that path is there’s no easy way off it. The ravine and creek cut deep on one side, and on the other, there’s a steep slope packed with underbrush and broken branches. You can climb it if you really need to, but not fast, and not quietly.

I pulled my phone out without looking and jabbed at the screen. I didn’t care who I called anymore. My dad, my mom, Dani, 911—anyone.

The screen stayed black.

I held the power button.

Nothing.

The cold must’ve killed it. It had thirty percent when I clocked out. Now it was a dead brick in my hand, not even the little battery icon.

“Come on,” I muttered. “Come on, come on—”

Behind me, the steps kept coming. Not rushing me. Not running. Just staying the same distance back.

I glanced over my shoulder.

He was closer now. I could see the coat better. Long, old-fashioned, the kind with buttons that go all the way up. The hat sat low over the face.

In his right hand, something glinted pale. For a second, I thought it was a knife. Then I realized it was longer. A fork.

A big, two-pronged carving fork.

Everything in me went cold in a different way.

I stopped pretending it was anything normal.

I jumped off the trail, my shoes sliding on damp leaves as I scrambled up the slope. Branches whipped my face. One caught my cheek and left a hot, stinging line. I grabbed at saplings and exposed roots and hauled myself up until I crested the top and rolled onto the edge of a field.

Yates Field.

You can tell because of the rock. It’s just sitting there near the tree line. A big slab of stone with a metal plaque about “original homestead of Gideon Yates” and “founder of the township,” the dates all rubbed at by kids’ fingers and weather.

Kids throw beer cans at it in the summer. People leave pumpkins on it in the fall until the deer get them.

The field itself was rough, dead grass and patches of old corn stubble. It sloped up toward a dark shape in the distance: the skeleton of the Yates farmhouse.

The house had been abandoned as long as I could remember. A sagging two-story thing with broken windows and a front porch that looked ready to collapse.

My chest tightened when I saw it. Every story I’d ever heard about the Buckled Man sat in the back of my throat.

Don’t go past the field on the night before Thanksgiving.
Don’t leave an empty chair.
Don’t answer if someone knocks after midnight.

I pressed myself flat to the ground and looked back over the edge of the hill.

The Buckled Man had stepped off the trail and was standing at the bottom of the slope, looking up.

I should’ve been able to see his face. I couldn’t. It was just darkness under the brim. But I could see the line of his shoulders, the slow rise and fall of his chest.

He lifted his head a little, like he was smelling the air.

Then he started up the hill toward me. Same slow, measured steps. The carving fork hung from his hand, catching faint bits of light.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The dead grass was slick with frost. My sneakers didn’t grip well. I slid and stumbled more than I actually sprinted, but I kept moving forward until my lungs burned.

The house loomed bigger with every step. Up close, it felt less like a building and more like a dead thing hunched in the field. The front door hung crooked on broken hinges. One of the front windows was boarded up; the others were just black.

I veered left at the last second, thinking I’d go around it, cut toward the road.

That’s when I saw the fence.

Someone had put up a line of metal posts and rusted wire along the far edge of the property. Not a solid fence—more like the start of one. But it was enough to slow me down, to scratch my hands as I grabbed and lifted the wire, to snag my jacket when I tried to duck under.

By the time I pulled free, I heard him again.

Closer now. On the porch.

The boards creaked under his weight. One. Two. Three steps. The sound of the carving fork gently tapping wood, like he was dragging the tines along the railing just to hear the noise.

I pressed myself against the side of the house, out of sight of the front. My breath came in sharp, loud gulps that I tried to smother with my sleeve.

“Everyone eats.”

The voice was low and dry. Not quite a whisper, not quite normal. It came from the front of the house, just around the corner.

“Everyone eats,” the voice said again. Like he was reciting something. “No empty chairs.”

He was talking to someone. Or to himself. Or to whoever he thought I was.

I took a slow step sideways, trying to edge away from the sound.

The porch boards creaked again. The steps were moving toward the corner.

There was a side door halfway down the house. I’d seen it before in daylight, driving past with my mom. The paint long gone, the frame soft. Now, in the dark, it gaped open a few inches. Black inside, but open.

I had two choices. Run back out into the field and hope I could outrun him in a straight line, or duck into the house and pray he went around the other way first.

The thought of stepping into that house made my stomach twist, but the idea of crossing that field again with him behind me made my legs lock.

I grabbed the handle and slipped inside.

The smell hit me first.

Old wood. Wet plaster. Something sour under it, like garbage that got wet and dried and got wet again.

The floor under my shoes felt uneven. I reached for the wall and found peeling wallpaper. My eyes strained in the dark until shapes came into focus.

A hallway. A doorway on the left opening into what might’ve been a kitchen. On the right, another room with what looked like a toppled bookshelf.

I heard the front door groan open.

“Everyone eats,” the Buckled Man said again, now inside the house. Closer. “Everyone gets a plate. Everyone gets a seat.”

His footsteps were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slipped into the room on the left and froze.

A table filled most of the space. Not a dusty, rotten one. A cheap folding banquet table someone had set up recently.

On it:

Paper plates. Plastic cups. Two unlit candles stuck into old green candleholders. A grocery store turkey in its plastic bag, still raw, sitting in a roasting pan. Tins of instant mashed potatoes and stuffing. Cans of cranberry jelly. A bag of dinner rolls with the Greene’s price sticker still on them.

Every item had a sticky note in front of it with a name written in careful block letters.

“Mom.”
“Dad.”
“Grandma.”
“Me.”

I froze when I saw the last one.

“Kyle.”

The note sat in front of an empty, clean plate.

My plate.

My legs went weak. I put a hand on the back of one of the chairs to steady myself.

Something crinkled under my fingers.

I looked down.

The chairs around the table weren’t old farmhouse chairs. They were mismatched kitchen chairs. An office rolling chair with the fake leather flaking. A folding metal chair. Tied to the back of each one with twine were photographs.

Some printed on regular paper. Some glossy. Some ripped from family holiday cards.

In every picture, a Thanksgiving table.

Different families. Different houses. Different dishes. But always the same thing: a table full of people, everyone smiling at the camera.

On some, faces were crossed out with a black marker. On others, someone was circled.

My hand shook as I flipped through them.

Neighbors. People I recognized from school. People I’d seen in town in the cereal aisle.

Then I saw my family.

The photo was from three years ago. My mom had it framed on the mantle for a while. We were all squished around the table, me in a gray hoodie, my mom laughing, my dad pretending not to laugh, my little cousin with mashed potatoes on his shirt. Uncle Mark on the end, holding up his glass.

In this version, someone had drawn a thick, black X over my uncle’s face.

And a neat circle around mine.

I still know the exact way my own face looks in that circle. I’ve seen it enough in my head.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway.

“Smells good,” the Buckled Man said. “Smells like a full table. Smells like no one left out in the cold.”

They were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slid down off the chair and crawled under the table. The floor was gritty with dirt and crumbs. I could see boots now at the doorway.

They were old-fashioned, square-toed, with tarnished buckles across the top. Dark leather cracked at the seams. Mud crusted around the soles.

He stepped into the room, and the whole table shook with his weight.

“I like this house,” he murmured. “I like a house that remembers. I like a table that’s ready.”

He walked slowly around the table, fingers trailing along the back of each chair. When he reached the one with my photo, he stopped.

“There’s my seat,” he said softly. “There’s my guest of honor.”

The carving fork clicked gently against the chairback.

I clamped a hand over my mouth.

“Come out, Kyle.”

He said my name like he’d been saying it all his life.

“I set a place for you. Your family didn’t.” The chair creaked as he pushed it in a little. “They left you out here, all alone. Didn’t move the chair. Didn’t set the plate. Didn’t keep the rules.”

He started walking again, slower now, listening.

“You know the rules, don’t you? You and your friends whisper them every year. You think they’re just a story.” He paused on the far side of the table. “Everyone eats. Every seat filled. No one turned away.”

He stopped directly across from where I hid.

The boots turned toward me.

I could see the hem of the coat now. Heavy fabric, stiff with age and grime. Dark stains along the edge, flaking at the creases.

The carving fork lowered until the tines hovered above the floor near my face.

“You came all this way,” he said. “Would be rude not to sit down.”

I exploded sideways before I could think.

I rolled out from under the table on the far side, grabbed the nearest chair, and flung it in his direction without looking.

It hit something solid with a loud crack. The fork clattered to the floor.

I ran.

Back into the hallway, toward where I thought the back of the house might be. My shoulder hit a doorframe. Pain shot down my arm. I staggered, bounced off the opposite wall, kept going.

Behind me, I heard the table screech and a low grunt.

“You run,” he said. “They all run.”

I don’t remember choosing to go down the stairs. One second I was in the hall, the next my foot found empty space and I was skidding down steep, narrow steps into the dark.

I hit the bottom hard enough that my teeth rattled. My ankle twisted. For a second, I lay there in the cold, dusty air, listening to my own wheezing and a faint hum from somewhere—maybe the extension strip.

Then I heard him again.

The slow thump of boots on stairs.

I pushed myself up.

The basement smelled worse. Damp concrete. Old mold. Something metallic that sat on the back of my tongue.

There was just enough light leaking through a tiny, ground-level window for me to make out shapes.

A workbench with tools hung neatly above it. Hooks hanging from a ceiling beam. Chains. A stained plastic folding table with an electric carving knife on it, the cord winding to an orange extension strip.

The hooks weren’t empty.

One had what looked like a whole, plucked turkey hanging from it, skin yellow and bumpy under the weak light. Next to it, something smaller. A shape about the size of a cat, skinless and pink, head missing.

Under that, on the floor, a single child’s sneaker. Muddy, the Nike logo half peeled off.

I swallowed something sour.

Boots hit the bottom step behind me.

“Basement’s best,” he said. “Nice and cool. Quiet. No one hears anything over the holiday noise upstairs.”

I lunged for the far wall. There was a low, square hole there. A coal chute. The wooden panel that had once covered it was half off, hanging by one rusted hinge. The opening wasn’t big, but I’m not huge. I dropped to my stomach, shoved the panel up with my shoulder, and wriggled through.

The concrete scraped my back. Nails snagged my clothes. I kicked and pushed until my shoulders wedged on the edges. For a panicked second I was stuck in the tight space.

Then I heard the carving fork scrape against the floor behind me.

“You don’t have to go,” he said. Closer now. “You just have to sit. One plate. One night. Then everyone’s even again.”

I screamed and kicked hard. Something tore—my jacket, my shirt, my skin—I don’t know. Suddenly I was free, tumbling onto cold, wet dirt outside.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The coal chute opened on the far side of the house, down in a little hollow. Dead leaves had collected there, matted with ice. The night air hit my scraped back and made it burn.

I sprinted up out of the hollow and into the field.

For a second, everything was open again. The sky dark overhead. The town’s distant streetlights a faint glow. Wind cutting through my torn clothes.

Behind me, I heard a hollow thud as something hit the coal chute from the inside.

Then the scrape of boots on concrete. Then on dirt.

I didn’t look back.

I ran straight for the road.

My ankle screamed with every step. My lungs burned. My side stabbed. I could feel blood running down my back in thin lines, soaking into my waistband.

I crashed through the tall grass and hit the ditch before the road without seeing it. My feet went out from under me. For a second I was in the air, then I hit muddy water and cold stones shoulder-first.

The shock of it stole my breath. The world shrank to the sound of my own gasp.

I pushed myself up on hands and knees and clawed my way up the far side of the ditch.

A pair of headlights washed over me.

I threw up my hands, blinking against the brightness.

Brakes squealed. A horn blared.

The car stopped a couple feet short of me.

The driver’s door flew open. “What the hell—Kyle?”

It was my dad.

He was out of the car and at my side in seconds, grabbing my shoulders, turning me to check for injuries.

“What are you doing?” he shouted. “What were you thinking, running into the road like that? You could’ve—Jesus.”

His hands came away dark from my back. For a second, he just stared at them.

“What happened?”

“He—” My throat seized. I coughed and spat mud and bile into the ditch. “He followed me. From the store. Through the woods. The house—there was a table—”

I turned back toward the field.

The farmhouse sat there, dark and still. No lights in the windows. No shape on the hill. The coal chute barely visible as a darker patch near the foundation.

The field was empty.

“Who?” my dad demanded. “Who followed you?”

“The Buckled Man,” I said before I could stop myself. “He said—he set a place—he knew my name. He had pictures, Dad. He had our picture. He circled me.”

My dad stared at me like I’d started speaking another language.

Then something changed in his face. Just a flicker.

“Get in the car,” he said. “Now.”

He kept glancing past me at the field like he expected something to step out of it.

The rest of the night is a blur of bright lights and questions.

My mom cried and kept touching my face like she needed to make sure it was still there. My dad called the cops. They came, took statements, took pictures of the cuts on my back and the mud on my clothes.

One of the officers wrote “possible fall injury” on his notepad before I even finished talking.

Two officers drove out to Yates Field to check the house.

They came back about an hour later. The TV was still on mute in the living room, showing some late-night infomercial about knives, which felt like a bad joke.

“Basement had some old tools,” one of them said. “Some hooks, probably for hanging game. Nothing unusual for a farmhouse out here. No fresh food, no photos, nothing like what you described. Just junk.”

“That’s impossible,” I said. My voice sounded thin. “It was there. The table was set. There were plates, names—”

“Kid, we looked,” he said. “Top to bottom. House is falling in on itself, but there’s nothing in there you need to worry about.”

He gave me the careful look adults give when they think you’re lying or hysterical but don’t want to say so.

“Probably a trespasser messing with you,” he added. “Someone heard the local legend and wanted to scare kids. You were running in the woods in the dark. Adrenaline does weird things to your memory.”

I wanted to scream.

Instead, I sat there on the couch, wrapped in a blanket that smelled like our attic, feeling every cut on my back itch and sting. My dad kept pacing. My mom made tea and forgot to drink hers.

After the officers left, my parents went into the kitchen and had the quietest, angriest fight I’ve ever heard.

I didn’t catch every word. I caught enough.

“You told him that story when he was little, what did you expect?” my dad hissed. “Now some lunatic’s using it.”

“This isn’t about a story!” my mom snapped back. “This is about you refusing to see that your brother—”

“He threw a chair at our son, Marie!”

“And now our son is bleeding because you didn’t move a damn chair!”

Silence. Then my dad, low: “You think this is my fault?”

A cabinet door shut too hard. A mug rattled in the sink.

I went upstairs before I had to hear more.

I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the boots at the edge of the table. The fork lowering toward my face. My name on that sticky note.

At some point, maybe around three in the morning, I heard it.

Three slow knocks on the front door.

Not loud. Not frantic. Just firm.

My parents must’ve heard it too. I heard my dad’s steps on the stairs, then my mom’s soft protest.

“Don’t,” she whispered. “Don’t answer.”

“It’s probably the officers,” my dad said. “Maybe they forgot something.”

The front door creaked open.

Silence.

Then my dad’s voice, sharp. “Hello?”

More silence.

The door closed again.

He came back upstairs a minute later. I cracked my bedroom door and peeked out.

“Who was it?” my mom asked.

“No one,” he said. He looked pale. “Probably kids. No one on the porch.”

He avoided my eyes. He does that thing where he rubs the bridge of his nose when he’s lying. He was doing that.

The next day, my mom moved the folding chair from the end of the table. She put it in the garage. She set the table for three instead of four.

She called my Uncle Mark and invited him for “dessert and coffee sometime next week.” Not Thanksgiving. Not dinner. A compromise.

He didn’t come.

Every year before that, Thanksgiving smelled like turkey and pie and sounded like football and laughter and my mom yelling at my dad about using the good knife on the carving board.

Last year, it tasted like cold gravy and fear.

I picked at my food and watched the front door.

I slept with my bedroom door locked for months. I still do.

I know what people are going to say.

Stress. Family drama. Darkness. Overactive imagination. Urban legend in my head. Every year, kids around here swear they see someone on the side of the road in a long coat near Thanksgiving.

Maybe that’s all it is.

But here’s what hasn’t gone away:

The scars on my back from where the coal chute ripped my skin. They’re crooked and shiny and I see them every time I forget and take my shirt off in front of the bathroom mirror.

The way my phone, which had thirty percent battery when I left the store, wouldn’t turn on again until the next morning, and then suddenly booted up like nothing happened.

The report my dad found buried in the town archive when he couldn’t sleep one night. An old clipping about a man named Gideon Yates found dead in his field, “frozen in the posture of supplication,” and a side note about “local superstitions regarding holiday hospitality.” He didn’t show me the whole article, just read parts of it out loud and then went quiet.

The fact that a couple days after the police “found nothing” in the Yates house, it burned down in the middle of the night.

Electrical fire, they said on the local news. Old wiring. Whole place went up. No one inside. Case closed.

And the way my dad flinches now whenever anyone jokes about “just one empty chair.” He did it in Price Chopper last week when some lady in front of us said that, and he dropped a can of corn.

It’s the day before Thanksgiving again as I’m writing this.

My parents invited me to come home. They promised to “do things differently.” They said we could talk about Uncle Mark and the chair and everything. My mom texted me a photo of the table already set, every seat filled, like proof.

I told them I’m spending it with my aunt instead. Her table is small, but every seat will be filled. No one is left out. She even pulled up a random folding chair just so there’d be literally zero gaps. It looks stupid, but I didn’t say anything.

Even then, I keep looking at the door.

If your family has someone they’re “not ready to see,” that’s between you and them. I get it. Sometimes people are dangerous. Sometimes boundaries are necessary. My uncle really did throw a chair at me; that part isn’t made up.

But if you’ve got an empty chair this week, maybe think hard about why it’s empty.

And if you hear slow footsteps behind you on a cold November night, or knocks at your door after midnight that don’t sound urgent, just patient—

Maybe don’t answer.

Everyone eats.
Everyone gets a seat.

A couple of weeks ago I approach a girl in my math class (we are both doing a masters degree in electrical engineering) and ask her out for a coffee. The date goes well, I find her cute, she also finds me cute. She is extremely smart, pretty, hardworking, has ambition and reads the same books that I do. She has no social media, which I also find attractive. She treats me with respect and is kind to me and asks me how my day was every day. You can probably guess that I'm pretty smitten with her, just my type.

At some point, she told me about her best friend, with whom she lives together in a student dormitory. Three people, 2 girls and the guy. Alright, I didn't think too much about it, living in London is expensive. Then she told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend of 3+ years about 1,5 years ago and a short while after her dad had gotten a cancer diagnosis, so she had her guy best friend as her primary comfort and she told me they hooked up for a while, until he slept with someone else and then she made it clear they were only friends. Normally, at this point, I would have ran, but I viewed it with empathy. It couldn't blame someone for their actions under such extremely difficult circumstances. So I sort of didn't view that as a dealbreaker as well.

Last sunday, I was at her place and the guy had told her he would be off for work, but then decided to stay (probably because he heard that I would be here) and he just massively cockblocked me. He just joined us and wouldn't leave, until I left. Afterwards, she apologised to me over text and told me that she had had a bad gut feeling over him and she also told me that she would understand if I found things too chaotic and left, as long as I was honest to her. She texted me a lot and I just calmed her and told her not too think too much about it, as we have just been dating for a month ( we didn't even sleep with each other yet, just made out). She then told me that I was definitely the only guy she was romantically interested in right now, and honestly, call me naive, but I believe her. Finally, she said that she knew that this was her problem to fix.

In short, I met this wonderful girl that I like a lot but I'm wondering if this is a situation that can be truly fixed. They really are best friends (she is rather shy and has only few but close friends, which again, I also would find attractive if one of her close friends wasn't that sus guy), they cook together once a week, they go dancing together once a week, they watch movies together, so in short, they are doing everything a couple would go except for having sex, which I also can't be sure about. We are gonna meet up on Saturday and she said she would tell me about everything that had actually happened. I decided to at least listen to her and decide then on what to do.

Dear people, should I run (= this situation does not have a fix, because they literally live together) or would you proceed, but with caution? And under which circumstances should I proceed?

In general, I'm totally fine with other-sex friends, I also have a lot of female friends with whom I would never hook up with.",1,1764279240.0,AskMenRelationships,1,1.0,False

I recently had a discussion with someone regarding how our city is recently being more involved in hosting events. Tik tok provides a good example of these type of events like social clubs, run clubs, etc. 

Given with the recent influx of people moving here from the Bay Area, I think our city has potential of creating ""third spaces"" that not only bring business, but also unity with our community. 

You may ask, what is a third spaces? This is Google's definition: Third spaces"" are public or private locations separate from home (the first place) and work (the second place) where people can socialize, build community, and engage in activities.

Yes, we are seeing social events going on. But I believe our city can expand on this. 

Here are some examples I have in mind:
1. Networking events - this includes professional groups that include career fields, hobbies, etc. 
2. Hosting art fairs/community gatherings
3. More coffee shops/expanding various business spaces where people gather
4. Invest more in our libraries: our libraries provide so much for our community. We can invest more that can engage our community. For example, I have seen libraries in SoCal that do art contests where people draw a design for a library card. I have also seen libraries where coffee shops are integrated in them.

My dad studied engineering but left the industry after 10 years for some odd reason, and then struggled financially. Meanwhile, my mom came to America for him so she could become a stay-at-home mom. She loves fashion and has a classy lifestyle.

My brother isn’t financially responsible, so my dad paid his entire college tuition (over 100k). But when I was in college, my dad asked me for part of my bursary and said he would pay me back later. Of course, as a good daughter, I let him keep it because he was struggling.

Now whenever I go out with my mom, I’m the one paying for restaurants and coffee. Cuz my dad can’t always pay for outings.

My brother also used to borrow money from me and now owes me over 7k, and he’s been unemployed for four years.

Sometimes I wish I asked people for money the way they ask me 😒

I’m going back to college soon, and I’m worried my family will ask again for part of my bursary.

Plus, when a family member visited my city, I ended up paying for so many things to help out including activities.

I've (38M) been dealing with pain after I eat for about 6 months now. I feel very bloated but the worst pain is just under my sternum and a little to my right rib. Relieving gas in either direction does seem to help, but the pain begins so quickly after eating that I can't believe it's gas pain.

I'd been on omeprazole for years due to GERD and acid reflux and for the last year or two prior had been using energy drinks for caffeine. I noticed the stomach pain after drinking them and have all but quit them since, and moved to coffee, but the pain doesn't seem to be correlated. I have tested with foods and drinks and I can't for the life of me find consistent scenarios where some foods trigger and others don't, it seems to be a crapshoot. As an example, plain rice and chicken doesn't tend to cause pain, but on the other hand, very fatty greasy foods like takeout pizza will also only sometimes bother it. Soda is a very quick way to cause the pain, I don't drink alcohol, and coffee causes it more mildly and I need *some* kind of caffeine.

  
I've been checked by my PC, a gastro specialist, and had an endoscopy, and will have a follow up with the endoscopy doc this week, but I feel desperate and that nobody has any ideas. I do have a few small kidney stones that don't seem to be related, have had my gallbladder checked (all good) and the endoscopy was due to the gastro docs expecting an ulcer, but that also came back clean. I stopped the omeprazole for a while to see if that could be causing it, and no change other than stool going back to a regular darker color from orangish. I also had stomach cultures done during the endoscopy to check for bad gut bacteria and that was also negative.

  
I'm praying others have either experienced this and have a diagnosis or have ideas on what it could be? It started in June when visitors to my work from India had been in town for around 4 weeks and I had been eating out with them almost every day, but other than local Thai and Indian food, nothing especially strange in the diet that I'd have expected long term damage from- I'd thought the years of energy drinks was more likely a culprit.

I could use some helpful insight from others.  I am planning a move to Colorado and am between Golden/Lakewood area and Fort Collins CO.

A little about me and what I am looking for:

32 years old male, single, no kids. I don’t drink, into meditation and psychological healing. Overall laid back vibe.

I am currently in a Masters program for Counseling, in which classes are online so flexible scheduling.

I am looking to be close to nature as I find it incredibly regulating to be in quiet open space and sitting in a park on a bench with a book and coffee and looking to be able to bike around casually.

I also want to feel connected to others and the community, I can tend to self isolate and want to focus on building secure relationships with others and join groups.

My concerns with Fort Collins is the demographic (families or college kids) and the lack of professional opportunities for my field (looking to become a licensed counselor but not quite there yet) and also maybe a little too isolating from everything?  However, the vibe seems awesome and down to earth people which is important for me, just lack of things happening is my concern.

My concerns with Golden, is it might be a little less interpersonal community which may be more isolating as well, maybe less green?  And more traffic. However, more professional opportunities nearby.

For anyone who has good experience and knowledge of either or both places based off my information; I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts.

I'm looking for some advice. I’m 26 and work at a bakery/tearoom. A few older male customers have made me uncomfortable before at work, one being a blind man that I was always chatting with, helping him around by holding his arm etc (he asked for this and asked specifically for me to help him whenever I was at work), until at some point he gave me a gift with a note attached to it with his phone number, asking me to come with him to his place after my shift. It made me super stressed and after this I completely avoided him, he even called my work to ask for me but I always told my coworkers to say i'm not there. I haven't seen him in weeks so luckily this situation is over now but it was super stressful. 

Now another regular (much older man than me) keeps asking for me, joking to my colleagues that im his favourite and he only wants to be served by me, hinting we should hang out, and he even called the bakery today just before we closed to give me his number and ask to have a coffee together sometime outside of work. Honestly I used to enjoy chatting with him, he's really goofy and extravagant and honestly for this reason I always assumed he was gay which made me naturally more comfortable around him, but now i'm thinking I was just naive this whole time and maybe he's not a quirky friendly gay dude but just again one of those creepy old men who only want one thing from younger girls. 

Idk if i'm overthinking and maybe he does just want to be friends? Either way it's stressing me out a lot to the point that i'm scared to go to work tomorrow because I know he'll be there and he might talk about it or idk. I just want to be able to be social and be able to talk with strangers with no stress (that's why I got this job in the first place, because I've always isolated myself too much socially and have had a lot of social anxiety and this is really a way to force myself out of my shell and talk to strangers and be a friendly social person lol). I also don't really have friends so idk the idea of making new friends makes me happy but I also am scared to be too naive and put myself in situations I don't want to be in.

The setting I'm using on the K6 grinder is around 40 clicks. I've tried 45 and also 30 clicks with not much luck.

Does shot time and also grind size matter much in non-pressurised baskets? I've read the size doesn't but maybe it's extracting too slow.

1p8d6k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgriTech/comments/1p8d6k4/i_built_a_simple_crop_management_app_to_solve_a/,I built a simple crop management app to solve a problem I saw on my dad's coffee farm,"My dad and grandfather run a coffee farm in Brazil, and for years they've been tracking everything on paper: irrigation, pesticides, fertilizers, harvests. At the end of each season, they'd spend days trying to organize scattered notes and messy spreadsheets. It was frustrating and time-consuming.

The problem is that they're not tech-savvy, and most farm management software out there is way too complex for their needs.

So I built **Demeter**, a simple and intuitive mobile app designed for small and medium farmers who just want to record what happens in the field without dealing with complicated tools.

**What you can track:**

* Irrigation
* Defensives (pesticides/herbicides)
* Nutrition (fertilizers)
* Harvesting

The app is currently in Portuguese and focused on Brazilian farmers, but if there's enough interest, I'd love to create an English version.

I'd really appreciate your feedback. Does something like this sound useful? What features would you want to see in a farm management app?

I’m a returning rider that’s been out of the hobby for ~3 years. There are a handful of bikes that I’m interested in. Hoping y’all might have some insight that could sway me towards one.  

&nbsp;

Most of the riding I do is putting around town a small city in Texas. On weekends I like to explore some of the farm roads just outside of town. Occasionally I’ll commute to work via the highway. Here are the bikes I’m looking at:  

&nbsp;

ZX4RR - Having an inline 4 has been a dream of mine for ~20 years. And I think this motorcycle would stay in my garage as long as I can ride it. But I also think it would be horrible for 95% of the riding I do.

&nbsp;

Honda Transalp - I have been wanting to get into moto camping. This seems like the ideal bike for that, while also doing everything else well. If I end up not enjoying camping, I’m worried I’ll be disappointed that I picked this bike. 

&nbsp;

Yamaha Tracer 9 GT+ - I think my wife would be most comfortable on the back of this one. Plus the motor has a great reputation. Just not sure if I’ll want to hop on such a big bike for a quick ride to the coffee shop. 

&nbsp;

Honda Hornet - This is probably the bike that makes the most sense for the type of riding I will do. And I’ve been hearing great things about it. But this one doesn’t get me excited to ride like the other 3.",0,1764277711.0,motorcycles,7,0.5,False

​I just installed **macOS Sequoia** on my beast: **Razer Blade 15 Advanced (2018) - i7-8750H, UHD 630, 4K screen.**

​I know Sequoia has problems , but the results are... rough.

# ​1. Horrible iGPU Lag (4K screen struggle)

​The system recognizes the **Intel UHD 630**, but the lag is insane. I'm talking seconds-long stutters. It feels like it's running without any hardware acceleration, even though I've used the correct **Coffee Lake-H** patches and ig-platform-ids for the 4K internal display.

* ​**Suspect:** The 4K resolution combined with the older UHD 630 on a bleeding-edge OS like Sequoia is asking for trouble.

Whether you're typing emails, writing reports, or just browsing, having a comfortable and reliable keyboard matters more than you might think.

**What Makes a Good Bluetooth Keyboard?**

Before you buy anything, you need to know what actually matters. Battery life is super important – nobody wants their keyboard dying in the middle of work. Look for keyboards that can last at least a few months on a single charge. Some even use regular batteries that can last a year or more.

The key travel and typing feel also make a big impact. Some people love the clicky mechanical keyboards, while others prefer quieter, softer keys. Think about where you'll be using it. If you're in a shared office or coffee shop, a quieter keyboard might be the better choice.

**Compatibility and Connection**

Make sure the wireless keyboard you're looking at works with your devices. Most bluetooth keyboards connect to Windows, Mac, tablets, and phones without issues. But it's always smart to double-check before buying. Some keyboards can even pair with multiple devices and let you switch between them with a button press – super handy if you use different computers throughout the day.

**Size and Portability**

Full-size keyboards with number pads are great for desk work, especially if you deal with spreadsheets. But if you travel a lot or have limited desk space, a compact keyboard might work better. Some fold up to fit in a bag, which is pretty cool for people always on the move.

**Extra Features Worth Considering**

Backlit keys help when you're working in dim lighting. Ergonomic designs can reduce hand strain during long typing sessions. Some wireless keyboards also include a built-in trackpad, which cuts down on the number of devices you need to carry around.

**Where to Find Quality Options**

You can check out a solid selection of bluetooth keyboards at [this collection on Amazon](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard). They have different styles, prices, and features to match whatever you need.

**Price Range**

Don't assume expensive always means better. You can find decent bluetooth keyboards starting around $20-30 that work perfectly fine for everyday typing. Mid-range options ($40-70) usually offer better build quality and extra features. Premium keyboards ($100+) often have mechanical switches and fancy materials, but they're not necessary for everyone.

The bottom line is that the best keyboard for you depends on how you work. Think about where you'll use it, what devices you need to connect to, and what features actually matter to you. Take a look at [different bluetooth keyboard options here](https://athomewave.com/bluetooth-keyboard) and read the reviews from actual buyers. They'll tell you the real deal about battery life, durability, and typing comfort.

Getting a good keyboard is an investment in your comfort and productivity. Take your time choosing one that fits your needs, and your hands will thank you.",1,1764277572.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

We ended up talking about padel, swapped numbers, and finally played last week. We’re both beginners, so it was easygoing and fun. I suggested playing again and she agreed.

We played this morning and had to wait a bit before a court opened up, so we ended up chatting — work, how long we’ve been in the city, books we’re reading etc. She asked me questions, offered to coffee for me on her way (I got to the courts first so was waiting on her), and was super open when I helped her with a few things on the court.

After the game, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee, but she had plans. Still, she walked with me to the café before heading out.

She said she’d be down to play again this weekend. I’m enjoying the vibe but I feel some chemistry, and would be exciting to explore it further off the court. On the other hand, I could be wrong and maybe it is ""padel buddies forever"" situation.

Hi r/AnimalCrossing.

We, the villagers of **Thankarat** (for the record, the name is apparently Thanksgiving + Ten Carat Hill. OP said it very proudly. We nodded in fear.), have taken over OP's NookPhone to report the situation.

We are not well.

We have never been well, but now we're especially *not* well.

\---

🦃 **1. THE TURKEY (VULTURE) HAS LANDED**

OP looked at a Mandibuzz and thought:

**“Yeah, that’s a turkey. Let’s build an entire island around it.”**

Next thing we know, the Village Bridge from Unova is rebuilt plank-for-plank on our island. Not *interpreted*. Not *inspired by*.

**Rebuilt**.

Out of sheer terraforming willpower and a suspicious number of inclines.

\---

🧢 **2. KAHILI COSPLAY HAS GONE TOO FAR**

Our resident rep now lives permanently dressed as Kahili, complete with:

\* **OK Motors Cap** (translation: “once the hat chirps, it’s over for us”)

\* **Cinnamoroll blouse + sneakers** (acqua/white pastel drip so powerful Blathers fainted on sight)

\* **Box-pleated skirt** (the formal skirt of someone who has never missed a Bird Pokémon League meeting)

\* **Soccer socks** (???)

We have accepted this. We cannot stop this. The drip is unstoppable.

\---

🏡 **3. EVERY VILLAGER IS NOW AN NPC AGAINST THEIR WILL**

We’ll let everyone speak for themselves:

🐺 **DOBIE (Elderly Stone Cutter)**

\> “Sonny… my great-great-great-grandpappy helped build this bridge 200 years ago… allegedly. OP made me say that in five different takes. I’m tired. My joints hurt. The bridge keeps getting redecorated. I sweep one leaf and 47 more appear. Please.”

🐶 **BONES (Village Sandwich Enthusiast)**

\> “WOWIE!! Guess what!!! I’M TWO PEOPLE NOW!! TWO!!

\> One guy eats sandwiches like it’s some kind of carbohydrate Olympics, and the other one is reading HISTORY BOOKS, YIP YIP!!”

🐊 **ROSWELL (Shiny Krokorok Cosplayer)**

\> “Look, I get it. I’m brown. I’m tan. I’m shaped like a funky little crocodile pokémon. But OP literally hands me a Soda Pop every morning now. It’s 7AM. I want coffee. Not another Soda Pop.”

🦆 **FRECKLES (Fisherwoman / Literal Tuna Cultist)**

\> “OKAY BUT WHY AM I FISHING 24/7??? My house already has giant tuna in it. Giant. Tuna. Now OP keeps yelling ‘LOOK FISH NPC!!’ when I walk by the river. This is harassment but also kinda flattering?”

🐿️ **CAROLINE (Patrat Girl With Big Eyes)**

\> “Oh dear… they said my big eyes make me look like a Patrat. I don’t know what a Patrat is, but I hope she’s nice… OP keeps staring at me like they’re waiting for me to scurry. I’m very uncomfortable.”

🐭 **PETRI (Pokémon Healer / Science Gremlin)**

\> “I have been promoted to Pokémon Nurse. Do I get benefits? No. I get villagers showing up with ‘my foot fell asleep, is that a status condition?’”

\---

🦅 **4. KAHILI’S TEAM HAS MOVED IN AND WE’RE NOT OKAY**

**Amelia = Mandibuzz**

\> “Kahili keeps calling me ‘queen of vultures’ and honestly? I’m into it.”

**Sterling = Toucannon**

\> “Resident walked up and said: ‘Sterling, your beak says toucan.’ So now every morning I shoot fruit out of my beak. …Well actually I just throw apples really hard. Hit Apollo in the head earlier. 10/10 would do again.”

**Phoebe = Oricorio Baile**

\> “I just wanted to listen to K.K. Flamenco. Now villagers keep expecting me to dance with enough drama to give Broadway a panic attack.”

**Apollo = Braviary**

\> “America.”

\---

🎁 **5. EVERYTHING ON THIS ISLAND IS NOW A POKÉMON ITEM**

\* **Apple** → Leftovers

\* Randomly scattered **bottled beverages** → Calcium, HP Up, Full Restore (all delivered by a rogue Primeape with Amazon Prime)

\* **Dodgeball** → Ultra Ball

\* **Blue capsule machine** → Dive Balls ×5 (OP insists)

\---

👥 **6. TRAINERS LIVE AMONG US AND THEY ARE… CONFUSING**

\* **School Kid Serena’s stack of books** → She read many books and learned nothing. Iconic.

\* **Scientist Shannon in a doctor’s coat** → She is researching the bridge’s vibrational frequencies. Dobie is vibrating too but for different reasons.

\* **Baker Chris** → She wants to hire us as a waiter, which feels suspiciously like a multi-level marketing scheme but okay.

\---

👾 **7. THE POKÉMON REPLICAS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND**

\* A **coprolite** → “that’s Grimer.”

\* A **Mama Bear** → “URSARING!!”

\* A **Bat umbrella** → Zubat (blown into the ocean three times)

\* Two **yellow water birds** → Doduo (if you squint they share a body)

We are living in a museum of *vibes*.

\---

🚷 **8. OTHER NPCS WE DID NOT ASK FOR**

\* **Backpacker** → Keeps yelling “JUST TWO MORE BRIDGES TO GO!!!” There are no bridges left. He will not stop.

\* **Old moonbathing artist man** → A beige painter’s jumpsuit placed ominously.

\* **Guy walking under the bridge** → OP placed a Pipe and said “he lives here now.” The cliffs do NOT allow walking under bridges. OP found a way. We fear their power.

\---

🏝️ **9.** **ISLAND ADMINISTRATION**

\* **Island Tune**: first notes of Village Bridge OST → We cannot escape the Unovaification.

\* **Island Flag**: Mandibuzz Mystery Dungeon sprite → It stares. Always.

\---

📣 **FINAL MESSAGE FROM ALL OF US**

If you ever visit Thankarat, you will see:

\* Kahili arguing with seagulls over bridge real estate rights

\* A Soda Pop addicted crocodile

\* Petri screaming “I CAN HEAL THIS” at inanimate objects

\* Phoebe’s feathers exploding with enough drama to give Broadway a panic attack

\* Scientist Shannon doing research, probably on why the island lags

And much more.

We villagers stand united to say:

**THIS IS THE MOST MAD, ACCURATE, OVER-THE-TOP ISLAND THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN AND WE RESPECT THE COMMITMENT BUT ALSO WE ARE BEGGING YOU TO LET US REST**.

Happy Turkey Day.

Happy Mandibuzz Day.

Happy Thankarat.

I just recently started dating again, and I can admit I am having a hard time. 
I met Max(43m) not his real name a few weeks ago. So far he is a really good man. He is a vet and does a lot in the community, goes to therapy and does a lot to help other vets. He has a good relationship with his ex wife and they coparent very well. He almost seems to good to be true. 
However we have been clear on our boundaries & we have communicated very well on what we want. I know I'm not ready to get into a commited relationship I really want to take a year to work on myself and live on my own. 

I told him we could date but it would have to be at a snails pace. He agreed and said he also was looking to go slow when it came to dating. But by date 3 he was already planning vacations, talking about our ""future"" together. Which made me wildly uncomfortable, I talked to him again & told him that I was uncomfortable and felt like we were on two different pages. 

That I couldn't yet offer him a future as I  am also navigating what I want my life to be and I couldn't promise him we would still be together in the future. I told him he was a good man & I didn't want to lead him on, and that we should stop dating bc it seems like he is looking for a serious relationship and I am not. He took it well, and said he needed space to think things over. A week ago he asked if we could meet up for coffee. 

He told me that he did come off too strong and got caught up in how much he liked me, but he understood that I was not willing to be commited and was okay with taking things slow with me. That he would respect my boundaries and wouldn't put pressure on me while we dated. 
But a few days ago he started using exclusive terms such as ""I'm yours & you are mine. And I'm glad you chose me."" And I told him again that I felt like things were going to fast again. 

Which than he back peddled and said he was just trying to reassure me, and that he also wasen't looking to get serious anytime soon. 
I really do like him, we have good conversations and we have a good time when we hang out. But I feel like he may be growing attatched and is saying what I want to hear so I don't end things between us. I really do not want to lead this man on, but I can't tell if he is honestly on the same page.

Dark. Just like down there...

''Mother...'' Her eyes fluttered open. It took her a minute to remember, she did not live with her anymore. She was a grown woman now.

Still, in the dark she remained.

Dripping. What had awoken her was not the nightmare, but the water droplets torturing a dent in her scalp, like some war captive. The aroma in the room, reminiscent of urine, dog's breath, and other bodily fluids, only fed the image.

As her mind shook off the daze, aside from the dripping and the occasional rusty creak, she could swear a sound of a muffled gurgling gently wafted through the air.

Feeling the tension in her wrists above her head, the situation gradually returned. She shook the cuffs once. Then once more.

With a sigh, she pressed her naked back against the cold concrete wall.

Her shackles felt old-school. And she could escape old-school cuffs. The method, however...

What seemed strange to her was the weight attached to her left foot. Not even the ankle- the whole appendage. It felt weighty, yet not hard. What's more, it made her ankle stiff and seemed to amplify the feeling of her pulse. The most unsettling part was the feeling of her foot being moist. And warm...

Clenching her teeth, she gripped her thumb bones and, with a push and upward twist, aimed to dislocate the joint closest to the wrist.

She had to contact her partner. Because her current predicament confirmed it. They had found 'him.'

Yet she would not commit. Sudden footsteps, light yet still audible in a quiet room, approached. Slow and deliberate, they were stealthy and measured. Someone stood near her right leg. With a deep inhale, as if to smell the air, a sudden burst of light blinded her.

The sudden, silly hope or a convenient rescue died in a flash.

 

''Perfection...'' A voice like smooth bourbon whispered. Freed from the torture of the sudden burst of light, the woman looked upon the sculpted features of the male supermodel. His flashlight now slowly examining her bare birthday suit.

''I know what you-'' Perfectly shaped fingers gripped into her lower jaw, forcing her mouth shut.

''Hush...'' He whispered. The blond artwork of the man's profile came closer. Light blue eyes, like some animal examining a curiosity, trailed from her chin to collarbone to every curvature till her waist.

''Mmmph!'' Bending her knees, kicking heels in the concrete, she contorted her body in an attempt to get away. Cover herself somehow. The woman's foot felt immobile, and at one point, she could even hear a gag-like sound from the dark.

Like some medieval ball and chain.

Yet the chiseled fingers held her like a vice.

''Flawless... Skin...'' Whispering, the handsome lips whispered in her ear. ''Perfectly proportional... Artistically curved...'' A gentle hand caressed her face, then her neck, contouring her collarbone. ''And the hair...'' There was a sound of a switchblade being drawn, as the hand that used to hold the flashlight now held the crude blade up to the woman's neck. The flashlight tossed in her lap, she swallowed heavily and tried to lean into the wall as much as she could. As far away from the blade as possible. ''Silk of a divine seamster...''

She felt how the fingers unsealed her lips, and after choosing a lock of her chestnut hair, with a swift motion, the knife severed it.

''I...'' Rattled and exposed, she swallowed. ''I know about the abductions. Them... You took them...'' Why was she whispering to him? She had no rational reason. Some primal instinct, perhaps. ''Where are they? Dorian?!'' She allowed herself to raise her voice.

A mistake.

''How many, agent?'' The buttery smooth whisper crawled in her ears, like a winter breeze, as the cold steel was suddenly pressed against her throat. ''How much CYRUP flows through your 'meat', huh?'' There was disdain, hatred, in the naturally handsome features bearing down on her.

''You-you can fix this Dor-''

A swift movement slid the blade across her neck. Not deep. Just enough to draw blood.

''Fix what?'' Scoffing, he examined the blade. ''You are all so perfect after all. And you can't improve on perfection, now can you?''

''Tell me...'' The woman felt her severed skin cry down her neck. ''Where are the other girls-''

With a click, the lights went out, as a powerful digit squeezed her lips shut.

In the lightless space, where a gurgle massaged the silence of what, for a moment, reminded her of an abandoned factory, footsteps could be heard.

They wandered in the rhythm of a barefooted drunkard in the rain.

A step. Step. Pause. Step, step. Slide. Paused- right in front of her.

''Help me... Daddy... Pl... ease...'' It was a woman's voice. It went silen-

''HELP MEEE!'' Like the cry of a banshee of old, it was the despair of someone being slaughtered. ''NOOOOOO! SOMEBODY-'' And just as sharply as it started, it cut to silence. Its echo still exploring the space for a moment after.

The agent could feel something boring through the darkness towards her. The sense of being watched.

The steps resumed, bumping into furniture and hanging chains, as they left the room once more. Abandoning it to the occasional gurgle, and drips of water droplets. The light did not return.

''They are here, agent...'' Covered in shadow, the honeyed voice whispered. ''As God intended. Imperfect... And beautiful.'' Her lips were set free. ''As you all will be one day...''

The shadowed shape leaned away and, with an athletic bounce, rose to his feet. ''Bon appétit!'' The agent heard the gentle steps of the male model leave, trailing the previous visitor's path. Even bumping into the same worktable. She sat alone again.

Perfection obscured by the darkness.

 

The silence did not last. Taking a sharp breath and gritting her teeth, she gripped one of her thumbs. The pop was dull and quick, and she could not imprison the sharp moan escaping her lips.

Leaving the other cuff on, she lowered her hands. Slowly, gently, she reached for the flashlight. And with a click, it came alive.

It was like a crooked branch on a tree. The usually meaty part of her wrist now looked almost hollow. Taking the flashlight in her teeth, the woman was determined to remedy that. Her accelerated STEM cells were already knitting her neck back together.

Biting down on the metal handle, she gripped her thumb once again. Sweat drew contours on her face, choosing the deliberately sculpted features from her forehead to her chin, down her healing neck.

She had never done this before. She was trained to, yes. But this was the first time theory met practice.

Clenching her jaw, she gripped the dislocated bone, and with a grunt-

She almost cracked a tooth. Her finger remained a straying branch. However, her left foot...

There was a loud 'gulp' sound, and a sudden sharp pain shot up her leg. On instinct, she pulled her leg closer and grasped towards the point of soreness.

''Mo... ther...'' The eye dialated upon first contact with light. The only eye.

''What the fuck...'' Taking the light source in hand, the female agent, repulsed, examined the... growth on her leg. It was like a crippled, freakish infant. Limbs- too stubby and short, if they could even be called such. It had a single lock of hair on what the woman assumed was its stomach or back, surrounded by a ring of baby teeth. It had a nostril right below its single eye, yet it was nearly impossible to understand whether it was on its scalp or face. In general, the growth had no distinction between its body parts or proportions.

It seemed to have no bones.

''Mo... ther...'' Like an ancient record player, only now did the disturbed agent realise it had spoken. But how? Its mouth was-

With a lurch of its body, another moist gagging sound vibrated her shin, as the sharp pain made itself known once more. The woman's foot had been within it. Whatever opening it had for a mouth had wrapped itself around it and, almost like an esophagus, was swallowing it deeper into itself.

''Oh God!'' Tears swelled in her eyes. Like a wet, meaty cast, the thing had made its way halfway up her calf. Like a caterpillar, its body weaved itself higher, half-inch by half-inch.

Gripping at its flabby, boneless form, the agent tried to pull the 'thing' off. Her failure painted another picture. Its mouth, where one may have lips, was molded to her leg. Like fresh scar tissue, it had merged with her.

She had begun losing feeling and motor function in her left ankle.

''No! No no no!'' Panic ensued. Adrenaline surged, accelerating her body's functions. The infant's eyes focused, its swallowing becoming louder. It's lurching- more vicious.

''Mo... ther... God...'' Muffled reflections vibrated from it upon each impact. She had no idea what to do. At first, it was her fists and nails. A dislocated bone was not considered an obstacle. Bashing and pulling it away from her, it was like hitting a sweaty leather sack. Like pulling at her own leg.

She switched to using the metal flashlight. It had barely any weight, yet the metal still painted blue marks on its form. Soon enough, her own leg began feeling the impact.

The thing had slowed.

It had not stopped.

''Shut up! Shut up...'' Why did the infant's gurgled, distorted voice remind her of that dark, desperate pit? Why now...

Raising her other leg, like a sledgehammer, she brought her heel down. It felt like she was breaking her own ankle. With each impact, she grunted. On the fifth, it stopped moving. On the eighth, it stopped making sounds. On the sixteenth, it's singular, lidless eye rolled back. It still lurched. It grew bloated.

It was vomiting.

She could almost taste the acidity of its puke. However, the woman felt the burn first. Then the tear of their molded connection right down the scar tissue seam. The flaying of her calf forced out a scream, as tears followed. She muffled it.

Grabbing at its bloody separation, she pulled it back. It felt like taking off a wet sock. It smelled like raw meat, close to expiration. Agony incarnate. She could not hold her bladder.

The thing was heavy, soft, and boneless. With a pain-fueled cry, she tossed it into the dark.

Her foot had lost a layer of skin, revealing crimson muscle below. A thin layer of yellow lymph had hardened around it. Like a wet mummy, it appeared moist and dry at once. And aside from the bleeding of her freshly skinned calf, there was no sensation in it.

''W- what the hell!?'' Hyperventilating, she felt her head grow light. Tears streamed down her face. She saw her toes. Molded into a single joint, it was like the muscles and bones had been interwoven. There were no nails, no skin, no bends. A single mitten-like joint. ''Why...?''

''Mother... Oh God...'' It had not died. Breaching the lights' barrier, akin to a worm, it slithered and lurched into illumination. It had grown bigger and seemed more structured.

It seemed to have grown half a skull.

The agent almost tossed the flashlight at it, yet composed herself. With a few deep breaths, she rose to her feet. The skinless one felt closer to a crutch than an appendage.

'Objective: escape. understand?' She meditated on the thought. A practiced method of calming her nerves. 'Objective: find an escape route. Yes.'

''Hello?!'' A distorted screech made her shiver. Somewhere to her right, where the man had gone, slapping footsteps were fast approaching. The slapping and flapping sounds made it sound frantic. And naked.

'Objective: What the fuck is going on!?' With an awkward step, she walked towards a side hallway on her left.

''Help me!?''

''Moth... Ther...'' Leaving the room upon the second entity's arrival, with a click, her flashlight went dark.

''Mother...'' She was at her mercy again. The growl of her stomach painted the memory even clearer. The deep sounds of swallowing and tearing flesh. The screaming from the room the girl had just left. That brought her back here.

She was never allowed, after all.

Strange. The woman remembered eating dinner with 'him.' Why was she hungry?

 

Her leg still bled. She couldn't move with any significant speed and mostly stayed close to some balance aid, like a wall or railing. She hadn't gone far, but it had been at least half an hour. Her STEM healing should have begun its work on her leg, as well as her finger.

Her thumb had bloated now. She couldn't find the proper angle to put it back in place. She could barely even feel the bone. Had she overdone it?

Nonsense. She could heal bullet wounds in 33 hours.

The woman had tried to push it back. She had hoped it had relocated at least partially. Yet her cry, and what it had attracted, told her the contrary.

There were more of those things in this building. Many more. A choir of screams, pleas, and calls echoed in response to almost any sound she made.

It was like a pack of bloodhounds tracking a hare. She could feel them on her heels.

She kept the trek mostly lightless. Groping in the dark, she hoped that whatever other inhabitants were here, did the same. She clicked the light on once or twice, mostly to examine her injuries and to get a rough grasp on what awaited her further.

Limping down these hallways, it seemed the agent had found herself in some sort of industrial complex. She crossed a few balconies, above, what she assumed, were manufacturing areas. In parts, replacing the aroma of sweat, urine, and stomach acid was the smell of sterility and disinfectant. The woman tried to favour those areas.

Passing room after room, hearing grunts inside. She walked over brittled glass, the shards' razor edges cut into her still skin-covered foot.

She hid, hearing bare feet stumble through hallways, out of rooms, or patrol ahead of her. They moved at varying speeds, had varying heights and shapes, and were diverse in the lines they echoed.

Shapeless shadows haunted these halls.

The agent grew despaired of looking for the glowing escape signs. They were required by law, however, it seemed they had been removed.

Perhaps deliberately.

Nearly 2 hours into her limp, she came across a crossroad. Not the most unusual thing to find, but her flashlight revealed the building plan on the wall. Illuminating the map, she learned her prison was one of the old mega complexes, which used to belong to KISR Tech. The company, which, along with its factories, went bankrupt and decommissioned in 2037.

She was stuck on the 3rd floor of a 100-floor biotech mega skeleton.

''That explains-''

''Agent Celeste! Where the hell do you think you are going?!'' Her investigation was interrupted by a scream. And unlike the monsters in shadow- a male scream. The frustrated echo guided her towards its source. ''Come back here, you flesh puppet bitch!''

Perhaps she got lucky. Or maybe it was simply how her fate should have played out. The girl cared little which.

For a split second, turning to assess the threat, her flashlight illuminated a pale-skinned, upright, bloated, hairless corpse. Its razor-packed mouth dripping saliva through incomplete lips. Something vaguely humanoid, and plenty alive.

With a click of a button, the injured woman ducked as the world went dark. Feeling a slight tug on her chestnut hair, she stepped back and turned to run.

''Alison... I'm sorry, Alison...'' The thing spoke, as it grasped in the dark. Its bare feet pattering behind the agent. ''I'm sorry... I was no good...''

The woman had gotten used to the unfeeling leg. However, moving at an increased pace, in pitch black, had its own challenges. She ran into walls. Failed to take corners. Bumped into open doors and tripped over tray carts and other appliances. Her crooked thumb complained with every impact.

In addition, the created sounds made the pitter-patter of bare feet not only increase in speed, but also in quantity. If she tripped on a steel tray cart, it was tossed against the walls, as multiple others ran right into it. If she bumped into a door, whatever was within joined the hunt.

They seemed blind enough, yet the effects of stealth had all but disappeared.

''I can hear you, you Godless mistake!'' The model's voice was growing closer. His previously composed voice now a raspy sauce of rage, disappointment, and lunacy. ''Join them!''

''Fuck fuck shit!'' There was no composure to keep here. She had joined the force to catch criminals. To help those more unfortunate. To stop people like 'her'. A different kind of 'monster'.

She clicked on the flashlight...

It wasn't hundreds. It was an amount that reached a point where any more would not have made a difference. After all, what does it matter if a hundred or half a hundred monsters hunt you from the dark?

Eyes. Glistening skin. Disproportional bodies and crippled appendages. All looking right at her. Gnawing for her. Pleading to her. And just like behind, so did in front, a choir of different tones and voices assaulted her hearing. She ducked between them as the abominations charged, clashing, tripping, and grabbing at each other in the process. A flesh ocean of bloated, barely humanoid shapes.

''What is this...'' With a whine, she squeezed past one that appeared to be cannibalizing its kin. These things were not fast. Seemed not to possess any reason either. Yet they were loud, relentless, and clearly aggressive. ''What do you want from me?!'' Screaming at them in desperation, the despairing girl tripped over a misplaced wheelchair. She lost grip of the flashlight, and it slid further down the hallway.

With a desperate grunt, the woman rolled into a sideroom as the fleshy weight of the horde crashed over her. Blood pounded in her ears. Her breath ragged and short. Her nose leaked like a faucet, as her eyes blinked at an uneven rhythm. Vision blurred.

Her stomach grumbled.

How long had she been crying?

Something shook the walls and floor.

The mass of meat pushed further along the hallway. Their goal- to snuff out the flashlight. Some did stop to stare within the dark room where the agent crouched, blocking her nose and mouth from breathing. But pushed by the rest of the wave, the suspicion was drowned by the pleading cries of... desperate female voices.

''Ob-objective: escape...'' Grabbing at her shaking shoulders, the agent mumbled to herself. Her mind too tortured to craft a logical thought. ''Objective: survive... Survive...''

Watching through the crack of the door, at the slowly drowned light source, she remembered the hatch. The gap in the planks.

''Ugly... So ugly... Disgusting...'' She bit her nail as the light cracked and went out. ''Born abomination...''

And the voices abruptly ended.

How long did she sit in that dark room, clutching her knees to her bare chest, she did not know. She listened to uneven shuffles and steps of shoeless, wet feet wandering the halls. Until, the woman thought, none remained in this immediate hallway.

She hoped...

Her nails had carved juicy welts into her toned, shaking shoulders. Composing herself with a sigh, she rose and prepared to leave. Remembering the map, the agent had a rough idea of where the exits were.

''GUH...'' A deep guttural moan vibrated the room. ''Shumashin eghtrutoy aheadn shtimlis...'' Nonensical sounds pushed through the hallway. Some MASS forced, squeezed, and crushed every obstacle in its way.

The agent heard metal trays bending, doors creaking, and snapping off hinges. The scratch of metal against the concrete. As it pumped closer, the girl backed deeper into the room, bumping into a table. As the mass came upon her part of the hallway, it stopped. ''Shmllshlik somesrup gvitmer... HEJLPSVMEE!'' It suddenly yelled and screeched. Her head rang like a metal enthusiast next to a speaker at a concert.

A straying hand touched something on the table. An old-school flip lighter. One she had only seen in movies. Yet the function was clear.

With a flick of her wrist, she heard the sound of its lid popping open. And three attempts later, the lighter dull flame came to life. The small source gave just enough light to see a fleshy bulbous form pushed through the doorway.

That thing was too enormous for the hallway.

The shadows she used to jump at, shaken into motion by her holding the lighter, had ceased to be intimidating. As the giant flesh slug-like form resumed its movements, squeezing through like paste from a tube. The young woman felt something nearly break in her.

There seemed to be a limit to the heights of one's emotional turmoil.

Closing the lighter, she waited until the doorway was free. Logic would dictate that a creature of that size could not turn with any semblance of efficiency.

Stepping over what she assumed to be a cursed recreation of leg-like appendages, she found herself back where she had come from. Now mostly cleared of obstacles.

Walking back to where they all had run from as fast as possible, she again used her light source sparingly. Hope was, that with the big thing blocking the way, none of the monsters could have been able to come back up this way.

 

Reaching for the wall, she eventually touched upon the plastic-covered floor plan. The spark, catching on the lighterwick, illuminated the map of the building once more.

The stairway should be just around the corner-

''There you are!'' The flame painted the man coming across the same hallway junction. ''Perfection awaits!'' The strong, sculpted hand wrapped around the tired woman's throat, pushing her up against the wall. She dropped the lighter; however, the unextinguished flame now gave the handsome poster face a demonic picture. Like staring at The Devil Himself! ''Fine! I know it's scary. I guess I'll help them find y-''

Grabbing the loose cuff from the handcuffs, using them like makeshift brass knuckles, she swung at the model's face. The crack of his gift of a nose unclasped her throat, as she fell to the ground, gasping. The undeniable satisfaction was a welcome bonus.

''Fuck you, you sick bastard!'' Bashing into him with her shoulder, the naked agent ran.

''Bitch!'' His steps followed. And they were faster.

So she put her vocal cords to use and screamed.

The monsters may be blind, but they follow sound well enough. To her satisfaction, she heard screams not far from her. The screaming woman ran towards them.

The model was faster.

Pulled by her long, silken hair, her head shot back, killing all momentum. Strong hands pulled her closer, grabbing at her naked form like an animal would prey. She struggled and swung. There was an impact, and a response, but it did not lessen the clutch. With a kick to her skinned shin, she wailed and fell to the ground. Another kick connected with her abdomen.

With a handful of her hair, the supermodel ignited the discarded lighter. His perfect nose, now crooked and bleeding.

''Why so stingy with your CYRUP?'' The lunatic giggled. ''Aren't you a civil servant, Agent Celeste? Share a little...''

''What are you doing here?'' The woman nearly yelled. ''Are these the human experiments-?''

''Human experiments!?'' The man yelled, his voice echoing a response through the hallway. ''Look whose talking, DOLL!'' Even angry, his features remained chiseled in marble.

It, however, was getting closer.

''Why did you kidnap and kill all those women?!'' The agent yelled on purpose.

''Kill?'' The man looked into the dark and tossed the woman the lighter with a smile. ''I haven't killed a thing.''

''Andy... Save me... Andy...'' A moaning figure stepped into the light. Its features exaggerated by the flame-cast shade. Its shape was vaguely human. One arm too many, one too short. Too many fingers, and some sprouting in the wrong places. It looked like a child's drawing brought to abominable reality.

A mistake.

The thing gripped into the blushing man's shoulders and scalp, as its maw opened. ''Andyyyyy.... HELP ME!! NOOO!'' It screamed at the model's face, as a tongue-like tentacle folded out of its gape.

''Check all you like, Anna.'' The male supermodel released the agent and spread his arms, as the monster pulled him closer. Its tongue licking the blood from his broken nose. ''No CYRUP here-''

Interrupting his caressing voice, the tentacle shot into the man's mouth and swirled around it. The surprised man gripped the monster's form, yet instead of repulsing, he pulled himself closer. The snaking tongue deformed his cheeks until eventually it slid deeper in his throat, bulging and stretching. The man's eyes rolled back into his sockets as the two interlocked in a kiss-like form, his throat swelling in waves.

The woman sat stunned. The creatures' misplaced eyeballs seemed to shoot from side to side. In some parody of the motions of thinking. And with a lifeless gasp, the man was eventually let free.

''Told... you...'' Gasping for air, the blonde coughed out some words. The monster now turned to the injured agent.

She ran. Luckily, the flesh parody was not a fast one, yet soon enough she heard the man's shoes clacking on her heels.

''HELP ME! SOMEBODY! NOOO!'' The monster screamed.

''Help her!'' With a giggle, still easing his breathing, said the male model. ''Isn't that why you're here?''

''I will burn this place to the ground!'' The woman's frustration exploded. ''You will burn, Dorian, you sick fuck! Along with the rest of your monster-''

The thought was short-lived.

''Mother...'' Her own voice tripped her over the railing. As she lost grip on the lighter, she went into a 3 story free fall. Her last thought, as she saw the half-formed meat blob: 'Huh... It grew bigger.' She was almost proud.

''Watch your step...'' Dorian chuckled as her senses disconnected.

 

''Honey... She's beautiful.''

''Oh my, she really is! Our little blessing.''

She recognized those voices.

''What do you mean, she has a skin condition?!''

''Ma'am, it's not that big of a deal. We will simply prescribe a shampoo-''

''Nonsense!''

''Mom?''

''She's perfect the way she is!''

She remembered that day.

''Why!''

''I'm sorry, mom! Please stop-''

''Why is your nose so big, huh? Who did you get it from? Don't look at me!''

''I'm-I'm sorry!''

''You ugly, ugly girl... Turn away, I said!''

She remembered the impacts.

''Where's dad?''

''He left me...''

''What? Why did he leave us?''

''One of your eyes is higher than the other. Your nose is too big for a girl.''

''Mom, I'm sorry-''

''I'm NOT your mother!''

''Mom... Please don't-''

''He left because you are too ugly! A born abomination!''

''No... I'm-''

''You need to be fixed...''

She recalled the toolbox.

''I don't ever want to hear from you.''

''Yes, mother-''

''DO NOT SPEAK! I don't want to even know you exist, understand? What a curse you are upon me... Disgusting...''

The creak of the plank hatch still grated on her ears in the dark. Those slits of light.

And then, her saviour...

 

''Garret...''

The agent's heavy lids slowly opened as she felt the flat concrete floor. There was a spotlight turned on. The back of the male supermodel was turned to her.

''Tch! You just had to break, stupid woman. You were supposed to be the last...'' With a sigh, he placed an autosyringe to his neck and injected himself. ''Fine. I guess I'll do it myself...'' He turned to face the lying agent.

She felt her body aching all over. Breathing was hard. But her mind began to work.

She played dead.

The man lifted the woman on his shoulder and began to carry her. The spotlight illuminated some kind of machine.

Taking the chance, she wrapped the handcuff chain around his neck, grabbing the empty cuff with her mangled hand. And with all her weight, she pulled.

The man panicked. Trying to flip her off of him ended up only giving her the leverage to pull herself tighter around his throat, and pull him to the ground.

They fell.

He gurgled, grabbed, scratched, and hunched. His heels trying to push away the very concrete they wrestled on. He even knocked down the spotlight, rendering the room dark once more. The struggle lasted no more than 8 seconds. The man's pulse went still in 15.

The world-famous male supermodel now lay dead and twitching on the cold floor in the skeleton of immoral ambition.

The female agent sat up. She felt weak, tired, and injured beyond belief. Her feet and fingertips tingled. But there was hope. Car headlights illuminated the hallway, which led to the entrance of the complex.

It also illuminated the horde of flesh surrounding her.

''No! No!'' She screamed, crawling up to her feet, trying to ignore the dull aches in her head, spine, and fingers.

Her very flesh.

As she got to her feet, gravity dragged her back to her knees. A severe concussion rattled her brain. Her motor functions were fading.

Crawling on all fours, she watched as 3 montsers began licking and eating... No... Merging with the supermodel's corpse. Then, with each other. They were growing bigger. Yet, the enormous shadow cast above them consumed them all the same.

It had grown larger. Like a grafted centipede tumor, the enormous blob of flesh did not appear so immobile in a big enough room. Its countless limbs carried it with the swiftness of a hunting dog.

It reached for her! Relentless...

''Comeandtastethepureessenceofgodlikepowers.'' As she crawled, it crawled with her. Yet what reached her was another.

''Mother...'' Its skull, like that of a baby and adult, now spoke as if sentient.

''Leave me alone, you disgusting fucking monster!'' She was so close. So close to salvation. And now this disgusting form of flesh was tangling in her legs. ''Abomination!'' She kicked it. And as she kicked it again, it almost seemed to let out a cry.

She froze, looking at it.

''Why do you...''

She pitied it.

The enormous shadow tossed the flesh monster towards her. It latched onto her shoulders as she felt a painful suction upon her skin.

She pushed herself forward with all her might. Too weak to fight, she struggled forward at a slug-like pace. It seemed like she had to drag two people along with her.

She needed help. She had to get outside, and they could help.

'Objective: escape!'

The rattling exhaust and police lights gave her an enormous wave of hope. Her muscles screamed with the will to survive.

The infant was consuming her.

''Garret! Garret, help me!'' She yelled over and over again. ''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' She remembered the creak of the hatch as it opened. Tears filled her eyes as she reached for the light at the end of the hallway. She had lost all sense of feeling in her lower back and legs.

She was staring through the cracks again.

''Garret! Save me...'' She cried.

''Mother... Save me...''

She had become just like she wanted. Just like everyone else.

She was beautiful now.

She was perfect now.

''Mother...''

 

''A missing person? In the Big 45?'' The voice on the radio scoffed in disbelief.

''Kidnapping.'' The older man explained, making a left turn in his police cruiser, its exhaust popping on occasion. ''20 of them. So tell me what do you have on the suspect?''

''Alright, alright.'' There was a rustle on the other end of the radio. ''You sure you need 'The' Dorian Grayson?''

''Yes.''

''The only supermodel actually BORN handsome these days?''

''The very same.'' The old detective groaned, forced to sit at a red light. ''I need files on his sudden disappearance.''

''Sure sure...'' As the light turned from red to green, the man on the other side of the comms responded. ''Well, the document is sparse. It's mostly about his father-''

''Just read it, why don't cha!''

The sound of page flipping paused their dialogue, as eventually the thin voice responded again. ''So the boy was born roughly around the time CYRUP Tech was being developed. You know the story, right?'' With no response, the voice cleared his throat and continued. ''Their joke was that the founders made the name simply by using the first letters of their own first names. And it just so happened to make sense scientifically as well.''

''Relevance?'' Exasperated the detective, as the small hairs of the bionic sniffer device on the hood dictated he turn right, before switching to left. ''Piece 'o shit...'' He mumbled.

''Relevance being, Dorian Grayson's father, Hyuell Grayson II, argued that he was the sixth founder, and that it was his tech, which the founders stole, that revolutionized CRISPR tech, and gave birth to CYRUP.'' The voice continued after a sip of coffee. ''To combat this, he launched a whole spite campaign, and eventually made KISR Tech. Named it, 'a supposed antidote to artificial perfection'. We all know how that ended.''

''What of his son?''

''Well, Dorian Grayson soon rose to fame as a 'natural beauty'. His father's antics dragged him into controversy of being the 'first' human experiment. But DNA tests showed no meddling. Not even CYRUP! That shot pushed him into the limelight. He had a pretty successful career because of it. Handsome Devil, he was-''

''What else?'' Pulling onto an abandoned road, the detective spoke.

''Not much. Around the same time, 8 years ago, when KISR Tech went bankrupt, he vanished from the public eye. His father-''

''Suicide.''

''Yes. Public news.'' The tone in the car grew as dark as the nights this time of year. ''Speculation being, like the controversy which buried KISR Tech, Dorin Grayson was 'cleaned up', as a human experiment after all. Cutting all loose ends, and such.''

''What were they developing exactly?'' The police car drove up to the Mega structure industrial complex.

''They promoted, apparently, tech which was even more revolutionary than CYRUP. The ACTUAL plans died with the founder.''

''And Dorian...'' Making the car stop, the exhaust fired once more. All semblance of a quiet approach just went out the window.

''I even heard it from here. You need a new car, Garret.''

''Yeah...'' unbuckling his seatbelt, he reached out the window to grasp the hairy bio device. It was like a fleshy smartphone, with a layer of thin, hard hair. It was supposedly more sensitive than a K9's nose.

''You think she's alright?'' Asked the concerned voice as the older detective took his biocoded firearm.

''She is. She's strong.'' The detective closed the doors and reached in to disable the radio. ''She has to be.''

''Garret! Save me!'' Before disabling the radio, a scream echoed from the building ahead.

''Call reinforcements!'' The veteran investigator ordered, raising his gun. The DNA reader unlocking the trigger. ''Celeste!'' The detective sped up to the entrance. ''Celeste?!'' The flashlight on his gun had a dead battery. ''Shit...''

''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' Her voice echoed from deeper into the hallway. ''Garret! Save me...'' It whined.

''I'm coming, Celeste! I'm coming, baby girl!'' And the detective rushed into the darkness.

''Garret! Help me! Save me...''

''I'm here, Celeste! I'm here... Celeste?''

The Truth That Destroyed Him
Chapter 1
Chapter 1
In front of the memory trial machine.
Countless sharp needles were densely packed before my eyes.
Soon, they would pierce my brain, pass through my nerves, and extract all my memories.
""Chloe Fisher, you never lost your memory, did you?
You must remember what the kidnappers looked like, right?""
Julian gripped my shoulders tightly, his eyes bloodshot.
""You knew to scream for help when that stranger pinned you down!
But why can't you imagine how much Clara hurt when the kidnappers killed her?
Why won't you help us find her murderer…?""
He screamed hoarsely: ""I promise you, I'll marry you, and our engagement still stands. Just tell me what the kidnappers looked like!
I just want to give Clara a proper burial...""
My birth parents stood nearby, staring at me with resentment.
They said that ever since I returned to the Summers family, I had brought nothing but bad luck.
They also said I was jealous that Clara had stolen my identity for eighteen years, so I faked amnesia to hog all the affection.
But I really couldn't remember.
In my last life, I'd run away from here out of fear.
But in the end, I was subjected to revenge, dragging my adoptive parents down with me—our family destroyed, everyone dead.
This time, I didn't dare to resist.
I looked at Julian, trembling, and spoke with difficulty: ""Will you... really find the killer if I do this?
Will it hurt?""
Julian sneered: ""Still acting? Heh, it seems you never learn till the axe is over your neck!
In that case, let's begin the memory extraction!""
He roughly shoved me onto the operating table and said: ""Do you really think I'm that stupid?
The reason you don't dare to speak is because you were jealous of Clara, and you personally threw her into that den of wolves!
You're afraid we'll find out the truth!
I wish the one who made it back alive wasn't you!
After the memory trial, you will be the main culprit behind Clara's death!
I will definitely bring you to justice!""
The doctor spoke up: ""Mr. Ford, after the memory trial, the patient may never wake up. If you're certain, please sign the agreement first.""
Julian signed without hesitation: ""I only want the memories, not the person.""
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
Soon, the longest needle pierced through my temple.
My entire body shook uncontrollably.
A strong electric current surged into my mind. I widened my eyes in terror, trying to fight back.
But my body was already bound tightly by straps, completely unable to move.
Tears slid from my eyes as my consciousness blurred.
I clenched my fists tightly, digging my nails into my flesh, forcing myself to stay awake.
""It hurts... It hurts so much...""
But I also wanted to see just how Clara, the apple of everyone's eyes, had died.
Soon, the memory appeared on the screen in front of Julian and my birth parents.
It showed the day I'd barely escaped the kidnappers.
After running back to the Summers family on sheer will, I completely lost consciousness.
When I woke up again, I was lying in a hospital bed,
and surrounded by strangers.
I was scared and helpless.
Finally, Julian slowly emerged in my blank mind.
I grabbed onto him like a lifeline, but he kicked me away viciously:
""Why you? Why did you have to come back alive?
Why didn't Clara make it?""
""What did the kidnappers look like?
What exactly happened in that warehouse?
Tell me, just tell me!""
The barrage of questions sent a sharp pain through my forehead.
I shook my head in agony, but I couldn't remember anything.
Then Julian grabbed my hair, slamming me against the wall in a fit of rage.
He spoke through gritted teeth: ""Head hurts, does it?
I'll help you fix that!
You'd better start remembering now!
Remember, damn it!""
Crimson blood trickled down my forehead, mixing with my tears.
If the doctor hadn't arrived in time, I'm afraid he would have beaten me to death.
The memory began to break off as I gasped for breath.
Julian spoke, dissatisfied: ""What the hell is this?
This isn't what I want!
You said you could extract all her memories.
I want all of her memories!""
The doctor quickly explained: ""Julian, the patient has indeed lost her memory. Extracting even surface memories is hurting her badly. If we were to extract deeper memories, I'm afraid... the odds aren't good...""
Julian didn't even hear those last few words.
He said impatiently: ""I paid you a hundred million!
I didn't hire you to play games!
Keep going!""
The doctor gave me a sympathetic look, then proceeded to operate the machine again.
Then, a deeper, thicker steel needle pierced the back of my neck.
I couldn't help but wail in agony, tears streaming down my face.
""No… please… it hurts too much…""
With the deep extraction, the screen lit up again.
This time, the memory was from when I had just returned to the Summers family.
Because I, the real heiress, had returned to the family, the engagement between Clara and Julian was rendered void.
Clara stood on the windowsill, threatening to kill herself.
I reached to pull her back.
But before my hand could even touch her, she fell straight from the second floor.
Everyone thought I had pushed Clara.
My parents punished me harshly out of rage.
A brine-soaked rattan cane landed eighteen times on my back before Clara woke, her beautiful face streaked with tears as she pleaded for me: ""Dad, Mom, Chloe definitely didn't do it on purpose. Please stop hitting her!""
Julianclutched my throat tight, his voice a menacing snarl, ""I agreed to marry you, but don't push your luck. If you ever dare to hurt Clara again, I'll make you pay for it in blood!""
My birth mother spoke resentfully: ""So what if she didn't push Clara?
Clara pleaded for her later anyway!
I should have sent her back to the countryside that day, then my Clara wouldn't have died without remains...""
""That's right... Clara was so kind, how could you leave her in that warehouse to save yourself?!""
My father's eyes reddened too.
Suddenly, the screen began to flicker violently.
My whole body started to convulse, and I was foaming at the mouth.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
The doctor shouted: ""Quick, the patient seems to be going into shock!
Get the defibrillator!""
My body jolted with the intense resuscitation.
The doctor explained: ""The patient has already suffered brain trauma. This can't go on—it'll do massive damage. She might end up a vegetative state…""
Julian roared: ""Isn't there a specific antidote for this?
Give it to her!
Money is no object, I just want the truth!""
Soon, I was forced to drink some unknown liquid.
My stomach churned violently,
but my heartbeat steadied.
I opened my eyes, staring at the stark white ceiling above, numb.
The trial restarted.
This time, more needles pierced my body,
filled with some unidentifiable drug.
The liquid surged through my veins, eventually mixing completely with my blood.
An intense pain gradually spread to every part of my body.
I wailed in despair.
But all that awaited me was Julian's cold voice:
""When you abandoned Clara to save yourself, did you ever think this day would come?
Everything you're suffering today, you owe to Clara!
It's what you deserve!""
The third memory flashed on the screen.
It was from my most desperate days, working as a hostess in a Karaoke Bar.
I didn't understand why those sleazy old men stared at me with creepy grins.
That day, a man offered me a thousand to sing for him alone.
Ignoring my fear, the manager shoved me into the private room: ""Little girl, tthe boss was paying you—that's a favor. Don't be stupid and blow it!
Make him happy, or I'll make you regret it—got it?""
I huddled in the corner, picked up the mic, and sang through my tears.
The man watched me with a grin, moving a step closer each time I finished a line.
Until I sang the line ""I love you,"" he suddenly pinned me down, responding excitedly: ""Baby, I love you too, I love you too!
Let's be together right now, I'll take care of you from now on...""
I struggled desperately.
In a daze, I saw a familiar figure: Julian.
I even thought I was dreaming.
I saw Julian striding towards me.
But he just watched me calmly.
I screamed desperately: ""Help me! Please! I'm scared—take me away, I want to go home…""
""Take me away, Julian, I'll do anything you ask...""
Hearing this, Julian finally made a move.
He paid the man off.
The man, though his fun was ruined, didn't dare argue with Julian and slinked away.
Julian stared at me, a vicious glint in his eyes, as if he wanted to rip me apart piece by piece.
""You'll do anything?
Then what about the memory trial?""
...
In front of the screen, Julian lost his patience and kicked over the coffee table in front of him.
He gave an ultimatum: ""I want to see the memories of the day Clara was kidnapped. Stop fooling me with this crap, or I can have your hospital shut down right now.""
Cold sweat trickled down the doctor's forehead.
As he added a double dose of the drug to the syringe, he explained, ""Julian, the patient has suffered psychological trauma. That traumatic memory is buried in the deepest part of her mind. I'll be as quick as I can...""
Julian strode forward, jamming all the medicine from the syringe into me. ""If double isn't enough, make it triple. My patience has limits.""
The doctor trembled as he started the machine.
This time, it felt like my veins were about to burst.
Before long, my nose began to bleed.
Blood mixed with my tears, flowing past the corners of my mouth. It was incredibly salty.
My head throbbed like it was splitting as I gasped for air.
A mouthful of crimson blood spilled from my lips—and the screen lit up.
This time, Julian and my birth parents stared wide-eyed, their gazes fixed on the screen, terrified of missing a single detail.
In the memory, Clara took my hand and said, ""Chloe, you've just come back. Let me introduce you to some friends.""
Before I could refuse, Clara had already chosen a dress for me.
Once I had changed, she eagerly pulled me by the hand and led me out.
We arrived at the underground garage.
The next second, two sacks were thrown over our heads.
Then two heavy thuds from clubs.
A muffled grunt came from Clara, and then I lost consciousness.
When I opened my eyes again, I was lying in a dusty warehouse.
Blinding sunlight seeped through holes in the sack—I caught a glimpse of the kidnapper's face.
Everyone's eyes went wide.
Julian blurted out first, ""It's a man! He looks like Clara's cousin!""
My birth mother responded, ""That's right. After Clara's identity was revealed, his family showed up… I thought he seemed fishy, kicked him out right away. I never thought he'd come back at Clara!
My poor Clara, kidnapped by her own cousin...""
The scene changed again.
Now, Clara appeared, completely unharmed.
A stark contrast to my own disheveled state, bound hand and foot.
On the sofa, a flicker of astonishment crossed Julian's eyes.

Dark. Just like down there...

''Mother...'' Her eyes fluttered open. It took her a minute to remember, she did not live with her anymore. She was a grown woman now.

Still, in the dark she remained.

Dripping. What had awoken her was not the nightmare, but the water droplets torturing a dent in her scalp, like some war captive. The aroma in the room, reminiscent of urine, dog's breath, and other bodily fluids, only fed the image.

As her mind shook off the daze, aside from the dripping and the occasional rusty creak, she could swear a sound of a muffled gurgling gently wafted through the air.

Feeling the tension in her wrists above her head, the situation gradually returned. She shook the cuffs once. Then once more.

With a sigh, she pressed her naked back against the cold concrete wall.

Her shackles felt old-school. And she could escape old-school cuffs. The method, however...

What seemed strange to her was the weight attached to her left foot. Not even the ankle- the whole appendage. It felt weighty, yet not hard. What's more, it made her ankle stiff and seemed to amplify the feeling of her pulse. The most unsettling part was the feeling of her foot being moist. And warm...

Clenching her teeth, she gripped her thumb bones and, with a push and upward twist, aimed to dislocate the joint closest to the wrist.

She had to contact her partner. Because her current predicament confirmed it. They had found 'him.'

Yet she would not commit. Sudden footsteps, light yet still audible in a quiet room, approached. Slow and deliberate, they were stealthy and measured. Someone stood near her right leg. With a deep inhale, as if to smell the air, a sudden burst of light blinded her.

The sudden, silly hope or a convenient rescue died in a flash.

 

''Perfection...'' A voice like smooth bourbon whispered. Freed from the torture of the sudden burst of light, the woman looked upon the sculpted features of the male supermodel. His flashlight now slowly examining her bare birthday suit.

''I know what you-'' Perfectly shaped fingers gripped into her lower jaw, forcing her mouth shut.

''Hush...'' He whispered. The blond artwork of the man's profile came closer. Light blue eyes, like some animal examining a curiosity, trailed from her chin to collarbone to every curvature till her waist.

''Mmmph!'' Bending her knees, kicking heels in the concrete, she contorted her body in an attempt to get away. Cover herself somehow. The woman's foot felt immobile, and at one point, she could even hear a gag-like sound from the dark.

Like some medieval ball and chain.

Yet the chiseled fingers held her like a vice.

''Flawless... Skin...'' Whispering, the handsome lips whispered in her ear. ''Perfectly proportional... Artistically curved...'' A gentle hand caressed her face, then her neck, contouring her collarbone. ''And the hair...'' There was a sound of a switchblade being drawn, as the hand that used to hold the flashlight now held the crude blade up to the woman's neck. The flashlight tossed in her lap, she swallowed heavily and tried to lean into the wall as much as she could. As far away from the blade as possible. ''Silk of a divine seamster...''

She felt how the fingers unsealed her lips, and after choosing a lock of her chestnut hair, with a swift motion, the knife severed it.

''I...'' Rattled and exposed, she swallowed. ''I know about the abductions. Them... You took them...'' Why was she whispering to him? She had no rational reason. Some primal instinct, perhaps. ''Where are they? Dorian?!'' She allowed herself to raise her voice.

A mistake.

''How many, agent?'' The buttery smooth whisper crawled in her ears, like a winter breeze, as the cold steel was suddenly pressed against her throat. ''How much CYRUP flows through your 'meat', huh?'' There was disdain, hatred, in the naturally handsome features bearing down on her.

''You-you can fix this Dor-''

A swift movement slid the blade across her neck. Not deep. Just enough to draw blood.

''Fix what?'' Scoffing, he examined the blade. ''You are all so perfect after all. And you can't improve on perfection, now can you?''

''Tell me...'' The woman felt her severed skin cry down her neck. ''Where are the other girls-''

With a click, the lights went out, as a powerful digit squeezed her lips shut.

In the lightless space, where a gurgle massaged the silence of what, for a moment, reminded her of an abandoned factory, footsteps could be heard.

They wandered in the rhythm of a barefooted drunkard in the rain.

A step. Step. Pause. Step, step. Slide. Paused- right in front of her.

''Help me... Daddy... Pl... ease...'' It was a woman's voice. It went silen-

''HELP MEEE!'' Like the cry of a banshee of old, it was the despair of someone being slaughtered. ''NOOOOOO! SOMEBODY-'' And just as sharply as it started, it cut to silence. Its echo still exploring the space for a moment after.

The agent could feel something boring through the darkness towards her. The sense of being watched.

The steps resumed, bumping into furniture and hanging chains, as they left the room once more. Abandoning it to the occasional gurgle, and drips of water droplets. The light did not return.

''They are here, agent...'' Covered in shadow, the honeyed voice whispered. ''As God intended. Imperfect... And beautiful.'' Her lips were set free. ''As you all will be one day...''

The shadowed shape leaned away and, with an athletic bounce, rose to his feet. ''Bon appétit!'' The agent heard the gentle steps of the male model leave, trailing the previous visitor's path. Even bumping into the same worktable. She sat alone again.

Perfection obscured by the darkness.

 

The silence did not last. Taking a sharp breath and gritting her teeth, she gripped one of her thumbs. The pop was dull and quick, and she could not imprison the sharp moan escaping her lips.

Leaving the other cuff on, she lowered her hands. Slowly, gently, she reached for the flashlight. And with a click, it came alive.

It was like a crooked branch on a tree. The usually meaty part of her wrist now looked almost hollow. Taking the flashlight in her teeth, the woman was determined to remedy that. Her accelerated STEM cells were already knitting her neck back together.

Biting down on the metal handle, she gripped her thumb once again. Sweat drew contours on her face, choosing the deliberately sculpted features from her forehead to her chin, down her healing neck.

She had never done this before. She was trained to, yes. But this was the first time theory met practice.

Clenching her jaw, she gripped the dislocated bone, and with a grunt-

She almost cracked a tooth. Her finger remained a straying branch. However, her left foot...

There was a loud 'gulp' sound, and a sudden sharp pain shot up her leg. On instinct, she pulled her leg closer and grasped towards the point of soreness.

''Mo... ther...'' The eye dialated upon first contact with light. The only eye.

''What the fuck...'' Taking the light source in hand, the female agent, repulsed, examined the... growth on her leg. It was like a crippled, freakish infant. Limbs- too stubby and short, if they could even be called such. It had a single lock of hair on what the woman assumed was its stomach or back, surrounded by a ring of baby teeth. It had a nostril right below its single eye, yet it was nearly impossible to understand whether it was on its scalp or face. In general, the growth had no distinction between its body parts or proportions.

It seemed to have no bones.

''Mo... ther...'' Like an ancient record player, only now did the disturbed agent realise it had spoken. But how? Its mouth was-

With a lurch of its body, another moist gagging sound vibrated her shin, as the sharp pain made itself known once more. The woman's foot had been within it. Whatever opening it had for a mouth had wrapped itself around it and, almost like an esophagus, was swallowing it deeper into itself.

''Oh God!'' Tears swelled in her eyes. Like a wet, meaty cast, the thing had made its way halfway up her calf. Like a caterpillar, its body weaved itself higher, half-inch by half-inch.

Gripping at its flabby, boneless form, the agent tried to pull the 'thing' off. Her failure painted another picture. Its mouth, where one may have lips, was molded to her leg. Like fresh scar tissue, it had merged with her.

She had begun losing feeling and motor function in her left ankle.

''No! No no no!'' Panic ensued. Adrenaline surged, accelerating her body's functions. The infant's eyes focused, its swallowing becoming louder. It's lurching- more vicious.

''Mo... ther... God...'' Muffled reflections vibrated from it upon each impact. She had no idea what to do. At first, it was her fists and nails. A dislocated bone was not considered an obstacle. Bashing and pulling it away from her, it was like hitting a sweaty leather sack. Like pulling at her own leg.

She switched to using the metal flashlight. It had barely any weight, yet the metal still painted blue marks on its form. Soon enough, her own leg began feeling the impact.

The thing had slowed.

It had not stopped.

''Shut up! Shut up...'' Why did the infant's gurgled, distorted voice remind her of that dark, desperate pit? Why now...

Raising her other leg, like a sledgehammer, she brought her heel down. It felt like she was breaking her own ankle. With each impact, she grunted. On the fifth, it stopped moving. On the eighth, it stopped making sounds. On the sixteenth, it's singular, lidless eye rolled back. It still lurched. It grew bloated.

It was vomiting.

She could almost taste the acidity of its puke. However, the woman felt the burn first. Then the tear of their molded connection right down the scar tissue seam. The flaying of her calf forced out a scream, as tears followed. She muffled it.

Grabbing at its bloody separation, she pulled it back. It felt like taking off a wet sock. It smelled like raw meat, close to expiration. Agony incarnate. She could not hold her bladder.

The thing was heavy, soft, and boneless. With a pain-fueled cry, she tossed it into the dark.

Her foot had lost a layer of skin, revealing crimson muscle below. A thin layer of yellow lymph had hardened around it. Like a wet mummy, it appeared moist and dry at once. And aside from the bleeding of her freshly skinned calf, there was no sensation in it.

''W- what the hell!?'' Hyperventilating, she felt her head grow light. Tears streamed down her face. She saw her toes. Molded into a single joint, it was like the muscles and bones had been interwoven. There were no nails, no skin, no bends. A single mitten-like joint. ''Why...?''

''Mother... Oh God...'' It had not died. Breaching the lights' barrier, akin to a worm, it slithered and lurched into illumination. It had grown bigger and seemed more structured.

It seemed to have grown half a skull.

The agent almost tossed the flashlight at it, yet composed herself. With a few deep breaths, she rose to her feet. The skinless one felt closer to a crutch than an appendage.

'Objective: escape. understand?' She meditated on the thought. A practiced method of calming her nerves. 'Objective: find an escape route. Yes.'

''Hello?!'' A distorted screech made her shiver. Somewhere to her right, where the man had gone, slapping footsteps were fast approaching. The slapping and flapping sounds made it sound frantic. And naked.

'Objective: What the fuck is going on!?' With an awkward step, she walked towards a side hallway on her left.

''Help me!?''

''Moth... Ther...'' Leaving the room upon the second entity's arrival, with a click, her flashlight went dark.

''Mother...'' She was at her mercy again. The growl of her stomach painted the memory even clearer. The deep sounds of swallowing and tearing flesh. The screaming from the room the girl had just left. That brought her back here.

She was never allowed, after all.

Strange. The woman remembered eating dinner with 'him.' Why was she hungry?

 

Her leg still bled. She couldn't move with any significant speed and mostly stayed close to some balance aid, like a wall or railing. She hadn't gone far, but it had been at least half an hour. Her STEM healing should have begun its work on her leg, as well as her finger.

Her thumb had bloated now. She couldn't find the proper angle to put it back in place. She could barely even feel the bone. Had she overdone it?

Nonsense. She could heal bullet wounds in 33 hours.

The woman had tried to push it back. She had hoped it had relocated at least partially. Yet her cry, and what it had attracted, told her the contrary.

There were more of those things in this building. Many more. A choir of screams, pleas, and calls echoed in response to almost any sound she made.

It was like a pack of bloodhounds tracking a hare. She could feel them on her heels.

She kept the trek mostly lightless. Groping in the dark, she hoped that whatever other inhabitants were here, did the same. She clicked the light on once or twice, mostly to examine her injuries and to get a rough grasp on what awaited her further.

Limping down these hallways, it seemed the agent had found herself in some sort of industrial complex. She crossed a few balconies, above, what she assumed, were manufacturing areas. In parts, replacing the aroma of sweat, urine, and stomach acid was the smell of sterility and disinfectant. The woman tried to favour those areas.

Passing room after room, hearing grunts inside. She walked over brittled glass, the shards' razor edges cut into her still skin-covered foot.

She hid, hearing bare feet stumble through hallways, out of rooms, or patrol ahead of her. They moved at varying speeds, had varying heights and shapes, and were diverse in the lines they echoed.

Shapeless shadows haunted these halls.

The agent grew despaired of looking for the glowing escape signs. They were required by law, however, it seemed they had been removed.

Perhaps deliberately.

Nearly 2 hours into her limp, she came across a crossroad. Not the most unusual thing to find, but her flashlight revealed the building plan on the wall. Illuminating the map, she learned her prison was one of the old mega complexes, which used to belong to KISR Tech. The company, which, along with its factories, went bankrupt and decommissioned in 2037.

She was stuck on the 3rd floor of a 100-floor biotech mega skeleton.

''That explains-''

''Agent Celeste! Where the hell do you think you are going?!'' Her investigation was interrupted by a scream. And unlike the monsters in shadow- a male scream. The frustrated echo guided her towards its source. ''Come back here, you flesh puppet bitch!''

Perhaps she got lucky. Or maybe it was simply how her fate should have played out. The girl cared little which.

For a split second, turning to assess the threat, her flashlight illuminated a pale-skinned, upright, bloated, hairless corpse. Its razor-packed mouth dripping saliva through incomplete lips. Something vaguely humanoid, and plenty alive.

With a click of a button, the injured woman ducked as the world went dark. Feeling a slight tug on her chestnut hair, she stepped back and turned to run.

''Alison... I'm sorry, Alison...'' The thing spoke, as it grasped in the dark. Its bare feet pattering behind the agent. ''I'm sorry... I was no good...''

The woman had gotten used to the unfeeling leg. However, moving at an increased pace, in pitch black, had its own challenges. She ran into walls. Failed to take corners. Bumped into open doors and tripped over tray carts and other appliances. Her crooked thumb complained with every impact.

In addition, the created sounds made the pitter-patter of bare feet not only increase in speed, but also in quantity. If she tripped on a steel tray cart, it was tossed against the walls, as multiple others ran right into it. If she bumped into a door, whatever was within joined the hunt.

They seemed blind enough, yet the effects of stealth had all but disappeared.

''I can hear you, you Godless mistake!'' The model's voice was growing closer. His previously composed voice now a raspy sauce of rage, disappointment, and lunacy. ''Join them!''

''Fuck fuck shit!'' There was no composure to keep here. She had joined the force to catch criminals. To help those more unfortunate. To stop people like 'her'. A different kind of 'monster'.

She clicked on the flashlight...

It wasn't hundreds. It was an amount that reached a point where any more would not have made a difference. After all, what does it matter if a hundred or half a hundred monsters hunt you from the dark?

Eyes. Glistening skin. Disproportional bodies and crippled appendages. All looking right at her. Gnawing for her. Pleading to her. And just like behind, so did in front, a choir of different tones and voices assaulted her hearing. She ducked between them as the abominations charged, clashing, tripping, and grabbing at each other in the process. A flesh ocean of bloated, barely humanoid shapes.

''What is this...'' With a whine, she squeezed past one that appeared to be cannibalizing its kin. These things were not fast. Seemed not to possess any reason either. Yet they were loud, relentless, and clearly aggressive. ''What do you want from me?!'' Screaming at them in desperation, the despairing girl tripped over a misplaced wheelchair. She lost grip of the flashlight, and it slid further down the hallway.

With a desperate grunt, the woman rolled into a sideroom as the fleshy weight of the horde crashed over her. Blood pounded in her ears. Her breath ragged and short. Her nose leaked like a faucet, as her eyes blinked at an uneven rhythm. Vision blurred.

Her stomach grumbled.

How long had she been crying?

Something shook the walls and floor.

The mass of meat pushed further along the hallway. Their goal- to snuff out the flashlight. Some did stop to stare within the dark room where the agent crouched, blocking her nose and mouth from breathing. But pushed by the rest of the wave, the suspicion was drowned by the pleading cries of... desperate female voices.

''Ob-objective: escape...'' Grabbing at her shaking shoulders, the agent mumbled to herself. Her mind too tortured to craft a logical thought. ''Objective: survive... Survive...''

Watching through the crack of the door, at the slowly drowned light source, she remembered the hatch. The gap in the planks.

''Ugly... So ugly... Disgusting...'' She bit her nail as the light cracked and went out. ''Born abomination...''

And the voices abruptly ended.

How long did she sit in that dark room, clutching her knees to her bare chest, she did not know. She listened to uneven shuffles and steps of shoeless, wet feet wandering the halls. Until, the woman thought, none remained in this immediate hallway.

She hoped...

Her nails had carved juicy welts into her toned, shaking shoulders. Composing herself with a sigh, she rose and prepared to leave. Remembering the map, the agent had a rough idea of where the exits were.

''GUH...'' A deep guttural moan vibrated the room. ''Shumashin eghtrutoy aheadn shtimlis...'' Nonensical sounds pushed through the hallway. Some MASS forced, squeezed, and crushed every obstacle in its way.

The agent heard metal trays bending, doors creaking, and snapping off hinges. The scratch of metal against the concrete. As it pumped closer, the girl backed deeper into the room, bumping into a table. As the mass came upon her part of the hallway, it stopped. ''Shmllshlik somesrup gvitmer... HEJLPSVMEE!'' It suddenly yelled and screeched. Her head rang like a metal enthusiast next to a speaker at a concert.

A straying hand touched something on the table. An old-school flip lighter. One she had only seen in movies. Yet the function was clear.

With a flick of her wrist, she heard the sound of its lid popping open. And three attempts later, the lighter dull flame came to life. The small source gave just enough light to see a fleshy bulbous form pushed through the doorway.

That thing was too enormous for the hallway.

The shadows she used to jump at, shaken into motion by her holding the lighter, had ceased to be intimidating. As the giant flesh slug-like form resumed its movements, squeezing through like paste from a tube. The young woman felt something nearly break in her.

There seemed to be a limit to the heights of one's emotional turmoil.

Closing the lighter, she waited until the doorway was free. Logic would dictate that a creature of that size could not turn with any semblance of efficiency.

Stepping over what she assumed to be a cursed recreation of leg-like appendages, she found herself back where she had come from. Now mostly cleared of obstacles.

Walking back to where they all had run from as fast as possible, she again used her light source sparingly. Hope was, that with the big thing blocking the way, none of the monsters could have been able to come back up this way.

 

Reaching for the wall, she eventually touched upon the plastic-covered floor plan. The spark, catching on the lighterwick, illuminated the map of the building once more.

The stairway should be just around the corner-

''There you are!'' The flame painted the man coming across the same hallway junction. ''Perfection awaits!'' The strong, sculpted hand wrapped around the tired woman's throat, pushing her up against the wall. She dropped the lighter; however, the unextinguished flame now gave the handsome poster face a demonic picture. Like staring at The Devil Himself! ''Fine! I know it's scary. I guess I'll help them find y-''

Grabbing the loose cuff from the handcuffs, using them like makeshift brass knuckles, she swung at the model's face. The crack of his gift of a nose unclasped her throat, as she fell to the ground, gasping. The undeniable satisfaction was a welcome bonus.

''Fuck you, you sick bastard!'' Bashing into him with her shoulder, the naked agent ran.

''Bitch!'' His steps followed. And they were faster.

So she put her vocal cords to use and screamed.

The monsters may be blind, but they follow sound well enough. To her satisfaction, she heard screams not far from her. The screaming woman ran towards them.

The model was faster.

Pulled by her long, silken hair, her head shot back, killing all momentum. Strong hands pulled her closer, grabbing at her naked form like an animal would prey. She struggled and swung. There was an impact, and a response, but it did not lessen the clutch. With a kick to her skinned shin, she wailed and fell to the ground. Another kick connected with her abdomen.

With a handful of her hair, the supermodel ignited the discarded lighter. His perfect nose, now crooked and bleeding.

''Why so stingy with your CYRUP?'' The lunatic giggled. ''Aren't you a civil servant, Agent Celeste? Share a little...''

''What are you doing here?'' The woman nearly yelled. ''Are these the human experiments-?''

''Human experiments!?'' The man yelled, his voice echoing a response through the hallway. ''Look whose talking, DOLL!'' Even angry, his features remained chiseled in marble.

It, however, was getting closer.

''Why did you kidnap and kill all those women?!'' The agent yelled on purpose.

''Kill?'' The man looked into the dark and tossed the woman the lighter with a smile. ''I haven't killed a thing.''

''Andy... Save me... Andy...'' A moaning figure stepped into the light. Its features exaggerated by the flame-cast shade. Its shape was vaguely human. One arm too many, one too short. Too many fingers, and some sprouting in the wrong places. It looked like a child's drawing brought to abominable reality.

A mistake.

The thing gripped into the blushing man's shoulders and scalp, as its maw opened. ''Andyyyyy.... HELP ME!! NOOO!'' It screamed at the model's face, as a tongue-like tentacle folded out of its gape.

''Check all you like, Anna.'' The male supermodel released the agent and spread his arms, as the monster pulled him closer. Its tongue licking the blood from his broken nose. ''No CYRUP here-''

Interrupting his caressing voice, the tentacle shot into the man's mouth and swirled around it. The surprised man gripped the monster's form, yet instead of repulsing, he pulled himself closer. The snaking tongue deformed his cheeks until eventually it slid deeper in his throat, bulging and stretching. The man's eyes rolled back into his sockets as the two interlocked in a kiss-like form, his throat swelling in waves.

The woman sat stunned. The creatures' misplaced eyeballs seemed to shoot from side to side. In some parody of the motions of thinking. And with a lifeless gasp, the man was eventually let free.

''Told... you...'' Gasping for air, the blonde coughed out some words. The monster now turned to the injured agent.

She ran. Luckily, the flesh parody was not a fast one, yet soon enough she heard the man's shoes clacking on her heels.

''HELP ME! SOMEBODY! NOOO!'' The monster screamed.

''Help her!'' With a giggle, still easing his breathing, said the male model. ''Isn't that why you're here?''

''I will burn this place to the ground!'' The woman's frustration exploded. ''You will burn, Dorian, you sick fuck! Along with the rest of your monster-''

The thought was short-lived.

''Mother...'' Her own voice tripped her over the railing. As she lost grip on the lighter, she went into a 3 story free fall. Her last thought, as she saw the half-formed meat blob: 'Huh... It grew bigger.' She was almost proud.

''Watch your step...'' Dorian chuckled as her senses disconnected.

 

''Honey... She's beautiful.''

''Oh my, she really is! Our little blessing.''

She recognized those voices.

''What do you mean, she has a skin condition?!''

''Ma'am, it's not that big of a deal. We will simply prescribe a shampoo-''

''Nonsense!''

''Mom?''

''She's perfect the way she is!''

She remembered that day.

''Why!''

''I'm sorry, mom! Please stop-''

''Why is your nose so big, huh? Who did you get it from? Don't look at me!''

''I'm-I'm sorry!''

''You ugly, ugly girl... Turn away, I said!''

She remembered the impacts.

''Where's dad?''

''He left me...''

''What? Why did he leave us?''

''One of your eyes is higher than the other. Your nose is too big for a girl.''

''Mom, I'm sorry-''

''I'm NOT your mother!''

''Mom... Please don't-''

''He left because you are too ugly! A born abomination!''

''No... I'm-''

''You need to be fixed...''

She recalled the toolbox.

''I don't ever want to hear from you.''

''Yes, mother-''

''DO NOT SPEAK! I don't want to even know you exist, understand? What a curse you are upon me... Disgusting...''

The creak of the plank hatch still grated on her ears in the dark. Those slits of light.

And then, her saviour...

 

''Garret...''

The agent's heavy lids slowly opened as she felt the flat concrete floor. There was a spotlight turned on. The back of the male supermodel was turned to her.

''Tch! You just had to break, stupid woman. You were supposed to be the last...'' With a sigh, he placed an autosyringe to his neck and injected himself. ''Fine. I guess I'll do it myself...'' He turned to face the lying agent.

She felt her body aching all over. Breathing was hard. But her mind began to work.

She played dead.

The man lifted the woman on his shoulder and began to carry her. The spotlight illuminated some kind of machine.

Taking the chance, she wrapped the handcuff chain around his neck, grabbing the empty cuff with her mangled hand. And with all her weight, she pulled.

The man panicked. Trying to flip her off of him ended up only giving her the leverage to pull herself tighter around his throat, and pull him to the ground.

They fell.

He gurgled, grabbed, scratched, and hunched. His heels trying to push away the very concrete they wrestled on. He even knocked down the spotlight, rendering the room dark once more. The struggle lasted no more than 8 seconds. The man's pulse went still in 15.

The world-famous male supermodel now lay dead and twitching on the cold floor in the skeleton of immoral ambition.

The female agent sat up. She felt weak, tired, and injured beyond belief. Her feet and fingertips tingled. But there was hope. Car headlights illuminated the hallway, which led to the entrance of the complex.

It also illuminated the horde of flesh surrounding her.

''No! No!'' She screamed, crawling up to her feet, trying to ignore the dull aches in her head, spine, and fingers.

Her very flesh.

As she got to her feet, gravity dragged her back to her knees. A severe concussion rattled her brain. Her motor functions were fading.

Crawling on all fours, she watched as 3 montsers began licking and eating... No... Merging with the supermodel's corpse. Then, with each other. They were growing bigger. Yet, the enormous shadow cast above them consumed them all the same.

It had grown larger. Like a grafted centipede tumor, the enormous blob of flesh did not appear so immobile in a big enough room. Its countless limbs carried it with the swiftness of a hunting dog.

It reached for her! Relentless...

''Comeandtastethepureessenceofgodlikepowers.'' As she crawled, it crawled with her. Yet what reached her was another.

''Mother...'' Its skull, like that of a baby and adult, now spoke as if sentient.

''Leave me alone, you disgusting fucking monster!'' She was so close. So close to salvation. And now this disgusting form of flesh was tangling in her legs. ''Abomination!'' She kicked it. And as she kicked it again, it almost seemed to let out a cry.

She froze, looking at it.

''Why do you...''

She pitied it.

The enormous shadow tossed the flesh monster towards her. It latched onto her shoulders as she felt a painful suction upon her skin.

She pushed herself forward with all her might. Too weak to fight, she struggled forward at a slug-like pace. It seemed like she had to drag two people along with her.

She needed help. She had to get outside, and they could help.

'Objective: escape!'

The rattling exhaust and police lights gave her an enormous wave of hope. Her muscles screamed with the will to survive.

The infant was consuming her.

''Garret! Garret, help me!'' She yelled over and over again. ''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' She remembered the creak of the hatch as it opened. Tears filled her eyes as she reached for the light at the end of the hallway. She had lost all sense of feeling in her lower back and legs.

She was staring through the cracks again.

''Garret! Save me...'' She cried.

''Mother... Save me...''

She had become just like she wanted. Just like everyone else.

She was beautiful now.

She was perfect now.

''Mother...''

 

''A missing person? In the Big 45?'' The voice on the radio scoffed in disbelief.

''Kidnapping.'' The older man explained, making a left turn in his police cruiser, its exhaust popping on occasion. ''20 of them. So tell me what do you have on the suspect?''

''Alright, alright.'' There was a rustle on the other end of the radio. ''You sure you need 'The' Dorian Grayson?''

''Yes.''

''The only supermodel actually BORN handsome these days?''

''The very same.'' The old detective groaned, forced to sit at a red light. ''I need files on his sudden disappearance.''

''Sure sure...'' As the light turned from red to green, the man on the other side of the comms responded. ''Well, the document is sparse. It's mostly about his father-''

''Just read it, why don't cha!''

The sound of page flipping paused their dialogue, as eventually the thin voice responded again. ''So the boy was born roughly around the time CYRUP Tech was being developed. You know the story, right?'' With no response, the voice cleared his throat and continued. ''Their joke was that the founders made the name simply by using the first letters of their own first names. And it just so happened to make sense scientifically as well.''

''Relevance?'' Exasperated the detective, as the small hairs of the bionic sniffer device on the hood dictated he turn right, before switching to left. ''Piece 'o shit...'' He mumbled.

''Relevance being, Dorian Grayson's father, Hyuell Grayson II, argued that he was the sixth founder, and that it was his tech, which the founders stole, that revolutionized CRISPR tech, and gave birth to CYRUP.'' The voice continued after a sip of coffee. ''To combat this, he launched a whole spite campaign, and eventually made KISR Tech. Named it, 'a supposed antidote to artificial perfection'. We all know how that ended.''

''What of his son?''

''Well, Dorian Grayson soon rose to fame as a 'natural beauty'. His father's antics dragged him into controversy of being the 'first' human experiment. But DNA tests showed no meddling. Not even CYRUP! That shot pushed him into the limelight. He had a pretty successful career because of it. Handsome Devil, he was-''

''What else?'' Pulling onto an abandoned road, the detective spoke.

''Not much. Around the same time, 8 years ago, when KISR Tech went bankrupt, he vanished from the public eye. His father-''

''Suicide.''

''Yes. Public news.'' The tone in the car grew as dark as the nights this time of year. ''Speculation being, like the controversy which buried KISR Tech, Dorin Grayson was 'cleaned up', as a human experiment after all. Cutting all loose ends, and such.''

''What were they developing exactly?'' The police car drove up to the Mega structure industrial complex.

''They promoted, apparently, tech which was even more revolutionary than CYRUP. The ACTUAL plans died with the founder.''

''And Dorian...'' Making the car stop, the exhaust fired once more. All semblance of a quiet approach just went out the window.

''I even heard it from here. You need a new car, Garret.''

''Yeah...'' unbuckling his seatbelt, he reached out the window to grasp the hairy bio device. It was like a fleshy smartphone, with a layer of thin, hard hair. It was supposedly more sensitive than a K9's nose.

''You think she's alright?'' Asked the concerned voice as the older detective took his biocoded firearm.

''She is. She's strong.'' The detective closed the doors and reached in to disable the radio. ''She has to be.''

''Garret! Save me!'' Before disabling the radio, a scream echoed from the building ahead.

''Call reinforcements!'' The veteran investigator ordered, raising his gun. The DNA reader unlocking the trigger. ''Celeste!'' The detective sped up to the entrance. ''Celeste?!'' The flashlight on his gun had a dead battery. ''Shit...''

''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' Her voice echoed from deeper into the hallway. ''Garret! Save me...'' It whined.

''I'm coming, Celeste! I'm coming, baby girl!'' And the detective rushed into the darkness.

''Garret! Help me! Save me...''

''I'm here, Celeste! I'm here... Celeste?''

I habe a brand new Luna.
When pressing the hot water button all is fine and it’s a bit steamy but water runs. Steam also seems to work (didn’t try with milk yet though).

But when pressing either of the coffee buttons, the pump is notably louder and it seems to not suck up water at ally the hose in the water also doesn‘t feel like anything is happening (zhe hot water hose notably vobrates when pumping). 
No water makes it into the portafilter, no pressure at all coming up.
I tried adding water with a syringe carefully but it comes right back out as if the hose is stuck somewhere and there is pressure pushing the water back out.

What can I do other than sending it back? Does this sound like it‘s a broken pump?",1,1764275705.0,quickmill,0,1.0,False

Dark. Just like down there...

''Mother...'' Her eyes fluttered open. It took her a minute to remember, she did not live with her anymore. She was a grown woman now.

Still, in the dark she remained.

Dripping. What had awoken her was not the nightmare, but the water droplets torturing a dent in her scalp, like some war captive. The aroma in the room, reminiscent of urine, dog's breath, and other bodily fluids, only fed the image.

As her mind shook off the daze, aside from the dripping and the occasional rusty creak, she could swear a sound of a muffled gurgling gently wafted through the air.

Feeling the tension in her wrists above her head, the situation gradually returned. She shook the cuffs once. Then once more.

With a sigh, she pressed her naked back against the cold concrete wall.

Her shackles felt old-school. And she could escape old-school cuffs. The method, however...

What seemed strange to her was the weight attached to her left foot. Not even the ankle- the whole appendage. It felt weighty, yet not hard. What's more, it made her ankle stiff and seemed to amplify the feeling of her pulse. The most unsettling part was the feeling of her foot being moist. And warm...

Clenching her teeth, she gripped her thumb bones and, with a push and upward twist, aimed to dislocate the joint closest to the wrist.

She had to contact her partner. Because her current predicament confirmed it. They had found 'him.'

Yet she would not commit. Sudden footsteps, light yet still audible in a quiet room, approached. Slow and deliberate, they were stealthy and measured. Someone stood near her right leg. With a deep inhale, as if to smell the air, a sudden burst of light blinded her.

The sudden, silly hope or a convenient rescue died in a flash.

 

''Perfection...'' A voice like smooth bourbon whispered. Freed from the torture of the sudden burst of light, the woman looked upon the sculpted features of the male supermodel. His flashlight now slowly examining her bare birthday suit.

''I know what you-'' Perfectly shaped fingers gripped into her lower jaw, forcing her mouth shut.

''Hush...'' He whispered. The blond artwork of the man's profile came closer. Light blue eyes, like some animal examining a curiosity, trailed from her chin to collarbone to every curvature till her waist.

''Mmmph!'' Bending her knees, kicking heels in the concrete, she contorted her body in an attempt to get away. Cover herself somehow. The woman's foot felt immobile, and at one point, she could even hear a gag-like sound from the dark.

Like some medieval ball and chain.

Yet the chiseled fingers held her like a vice.

''Flawless... Skin...'' Whispering, the handsome lips whispered in her ear. ''Perfectly proportional... Artistically curved...'' A gentle hand caressed her face, then her neck, contouring her collarbone. ''And the hair...'' There was a sound of a switchblade being drawn, as the hand that used to hold the flashlight now held the crude blade up to the woman's neck. The flashlight tossed in her lap, she swallowed heavily and tried to lean into the wall as much as she could. As far away from the blade as possible. ''Silk of a divine seamster...''

She felt how the fingers unsealed her lips, and after choosing a lock of her chestnut hair, with a swift motion, the knife severed it.

''I...'' Rattled and exposed, she swallowed. ''I know about the abductions. Them... You took them...'' Why was she whispering to him? She had no rational reason. Some primal instinct, perhaps. ''Where are they? Dorian?!'' She allowed herself to raise her voice.

A mistake.

''How many, agent?'' The buttery smooth whisper crawled in her ears, like a winter breeze, as the cold steel was suddenly pressed against her throat. ''How much CYRUP flows through your 'meat', huh?'' There was disdain, hatred, in the naturally handsome features bearing down on her.

''You-you can fix this Dor-''

A swift movement slid the blade across her neck. Not deep. Just enough to draw blood.

''Fix what?'' Scoffing, he examined the blade. ''You are all so perfect after all. And you can't improve on perfection, now can you?''

''Tell me...'' The woman felt her severed skin cry down her neck. ''Where are the other girls-''

With a click, the lights went out, as a powerful digit squeezed her lips shut.

In the lightless space, where a gurgle massaged the silence of what, for a moment, reminded her of an abandoned factory, footsteps could be heard.

They wandered in the rhythm of a barefooted drunkard in the rain.

A step. Step. Pause. Step, step. Slide. Paused- right in front of her.

''Help me... Daddy... Pl... ease...'' It was a woman's voice. It went silen-

''HELP MEEE!'' Like the cry of a banshee of old, it was the despair of someone being slaughtered. ''NOOOOOO! SOMEBODY-'' And just as sharply as it started, it cut to silence. Its echo still exploring the space for a moment after.

The agent could feel something boring through the darkness towards her. The sense of being watched.

The steps resumed, bumping into furniture and hanging chains, as they left the room once more. Abandoning it to the occasional gurgle, and drips of water droplets. The light did not return.

''They are here, agent...'' Covered in shadow, the honeyed voice whispered. ''As God intended. Imperfect... And beautiful.'' Her lips were set free. ''As you all will be one day...''

The shadowed shape leaned away and, with an athletic bounce, rose to his feet. ''Bon appétit!'' The agent heard the gentle steps of the male model leave, trailing the previous visitor's path. Even bumping into the same worktable. She sat alone again.

Perfection obscured by the darkness.

 

The silence did not last. Taking a sharp breath and gritting her teeth, she gripped one of her thumbs. The pop was dull and quick, and she could not imprison the sharp moan escaping her lips.

Leaving the other cuff on, she lowered her hands. Slowly, gently, she reached for the flashlight. And with a click, it came alive.

It was like a crooked branch on a tree. The usually meaty part of her wrist now looked almost hollow. Taking the flashlight in her teeth, the woman was determined to remedy that. Her accelerated STEM cells were already knitting her neck back together.

Biting down on the metal handle, she gripped her thumb once again. Sweat drew contours on her face, choosing the deliberately sculpted features from her forehead to her chin, down her healing neck.

She had never done this before. She was trained to, yes. But this was the first time theory met practice.

Clenching her jaw, she gripped the dislocated bone, and with a grunt-

She almost cracked a tooth. Her finger remained a straying branch. However, her left foot...

There was a loud 'gulp' sound, and a sudden sharp pain shot up her leg. On instinct, she pulled her leg closer and grasped towards the point of soreness.

''Mo... ther...'' The eye dialated upon first contact with light. The only eye.

''What the fuck...'' Taking the light source in hand, the female agent, repulsed, examined the... growth on her leg. It was like a crippled, freakish infant. Limbs- too stubby and short, if they could even be called such. It had a single lock of hair on what the woman assumed was its stomach or back, surrounded by a ring of baby teeth. It had a nostril right below its single eye, yet it was nearly impossible to understand whether it was on its scalp or face. In general, the growth had no distinction between its body parts or proportions.

It seemed to have no bones.

''Mo... ther...'' Like an ancient record player, only now did the disturbed agent realise it had spoken. But how? Its mouth was-

With a lurch of its body, another moist gagging sound vibrated her shin, as the sharp pain made itself known once more. The woman's foot had been within it. Whatever opening it had for a mouth had wrapped itself around it and, almost like an esophagus, was swallowing it deeper into itself.

''Oh God!'' Tears swelled in her eyes. Like a wet, meaty cast, the thing had made its way halfway up her calf. Like a caterpillar, its body weaved itself higher, half-inch by half-inch.

Gripping at its flabby, boneless form, the agent tried to pull the 'thing' off. Her failure painted another picture. Its mouth, where one may have lips, was molded to her leg. Like fresh scar tissue, it had merged with her.

She had begun losing feeling and motor function in her left ankle.

''No! No no no!'' Panic ensued. Adrenaline surged, accelerating her body's functions. The infant's eyes focused, its swallowing becoming louder. It's lurching- more vicious.

''Mo... ther... God...'' Muffled reflections vibrated from it upon each impact. She had no idea what to do. At first, it was her fists and nails. A dislocated bone was not considered an obstacle. Bashing and pulling it away from her, it was like hitting a sweaty leather sack. Like pulling at her own leg.

She switched to using the metal flashlight. It had barely any weight, yet the metal still painted blue marks on its form. Soon enough, her own leg began feeling the impact.

The thing had slowed.

It had not stopped.

''Shut up! Shut up...'' Why did the infant's gurgled, distorted voice remind her of that dark, desperate pit? Why now...

Raising her other leg, like a sledgehammer, she brought her heel down. It felt like she was breaking her own ankle. With each impact, she grunted. On the fifth, it stopped moving. On the eighth, it stopped making sounds. On the sixteenth, it's singular, lidless eye rolled back. It still lurched. It grew bloated.

It was vomiting.

She could almost taste the acidity of its puke. However, the woman felt the burn first. Then the tear of their molded connection right down the scar tissue seam. The flaying of her calf forced out a scream, as tears followed. She muffled it.

Grabbing at its bloody separation, she pulled it back. It felt like taking off a wet sock. It smelled like raw meat, close to expiration. Agony incarnate. She could not hold her bladder.

The thing was heavy, soft, and boneless. With a pain-fueled cry, she tossed it into the dark.

Her foot had lost a layer of skin, revealing crimson muscle below. A thin layer of yellow lymph had hardened around it. Like a wet mummy, it appeared moist and dry at once. And aside from the bleeding of her freshly skinned calf, there was no sensation in it.

''W- what the hell!?'' Hyperventilating, she felt her head grow light. Tears streamed down her face. She saw her toes. Molded into a single joint, it was like the muscles and bones had been interwoven. There were no nails, no skin, no bends. A single mitten-like joint. ''Why...?''

''Mother... Oh God...'' It had not died. Breaching the lights' barrier, akin to a worm, it slithered and lurched into illumination. It had grown bigger and seemed more structured.

It seemed to have grown half a skull.

The agent almost tossed the flashlight at it, yet composed herself. With a few deep breaths, she rose to her feet. The skinless one felt closer to a crutch than an appendage.

'Objective: escape. understand?' She meditated on the thought. A practiced method of calming her nerves. 'Objective: find an escape route. Yes.'

''Hello?!'' A distorted screech made her shiver. Somewhere to her right, where the man had gone, slapping footsteps were fast approaching. The slapping and flapping sounds made it sound frantic. And naked.

'Objective: What the fuck is going on!?' With an awkward step, she walked towards a side hallway on her left.

''Help me!?''

''Moth... Ther...'' Leaving the room upon the second entity's arrival, with a click, her flashlight went dark.

''Mother...'' She was at her mercy again. The growl of her stomach painted the memory even clearer. The deep sounds of swallowing and tearing flesh. The screaming from the room the girl had just left. That brought her back here.

She was never allowed, after all.

Strange. The woman remembered eating dinner with 'him.' Why was she hungry?

 

Her leg still bled. She couldn't move with any significant speed and mostly stayed close to some balance aid, like a wall or railing. She hadn't gone far, but it had been at least half an hour. Her STEM healing should have begun its work on her leg, as well as her finger.

Her thumb had bloated now. She couldn't find the proper angle to put it back in place. She could barely even feel the bone. Had she overdone it?

Nonsense. She could heal bullet wounds in 33 hours.

The woman had tried to push it back. She had hoped it had relocated at least partially. Yet her cry, and what it had attracted, told her the contrary.

There were more of those things in this building. Many more. A choir of screams, pleas, and calls echoed in response to almost any sound she made.

It was like a pack of bloodhounds tracking a hare. She could feel them on her heels.

She kept the trek mostly lightless. Groping in the dark, she hoped that whatever other inhabitants were here, did the same. She clicked the light on once or twice, mostly to examine her injuries and to get a rough grasp on what awaited her further.

Limping down these hallways, it seemed the agent had found herself in some sort of industrial complex. She crossed a few balconies, above, what she assumed, were manufacturing areas. In parts, replacing the aroma of sweat, urine, and stomach acid was the smell of sterility and disinfectant. The woman tried to favour those areas.

Passing room after room, hearing grunts inside. She walked over brittled glass, the shards' razor edges cut into her still skin-covered foot.

She hid, hearing bare feet stumble through hallways, out of rooms, or patrol ahead of her. They moved at varying speeds, had varying heights and shapes, and were diverse in the lines they echoed.

Shapeless shadows haunted these halls.

The agent grew despaired of looking for the glowing escape signs. They were required by law, however, it seemed they had been removed.

Perhaps deliberately.

Nearly 2 hours into her limp, she came across a crossroad. Not the most unusual thing to find, but her flashlight revealed the building plan on the wall. Illuminating the map, she learned her prison was one of the old mega complexes, which used to belong to KISR Tech. The company, which, along with its factories, went bankrupt and decommissioned in 2037.

She was stuck on the 3rd floor of a 100-floor biotech mega skeleton.

''That explains-''

''Agent Celeste! Where the hell do you think you are going?!'' Her investigation was interrupted by a scream. And unlike the monsters in shadow- a male scream. The frustrated echo guided her towards its source. ''Come back here, you flesh puppet bitch!''

Perhaps she got lucky. Or maybe it was simply how her fate should have played out. The girl cared little which.

For a split second, turning to assess the threat, her flashlight illuminated a pale-skinned, upright, bloated, hairless corpse. Its razor-packed mouth dripping saliva through incomplete lips. Something vaguely humanoid, and plenty alive.

With a click of a button, the injured woman ducked as the world went dark. Feeling a slight tug on her chestnut hair, she stepped back and turned to run.

''Alison... I'm sorry, Alison...'' The thing spoke, as it grasped in the dark. Its bare feet pattering behind the agent. ''I'm sorry... I was no good...''

The woman had gotten used to the unfeeling leg. However, moving at an increased pace, in pitch black, had its own challenges. She ran into walls. Failed to take corners. Bumped into open doors and tripped over tray carts and other appliances. Her crooked thumb complained with every impact.

In addition, the created sounds made the pitter-patter of bare feet not only increase in speed, but also in quantity. If she tripped on a steel tray cart, it was tossed against the walls, as multiple others ran right into it. If she bumped into a door, whatever was within joined the hunt.

They seemed blind enough, yet the effects of stealth had all but disappeared.

''I can hear you, you Godless mistake!'' The model's voice was growing closer. His previously composed voice now a raspy sauce of rage, disappointment, and lunacy. ''Join them!''

''Fuck fuck shit!'' There was no composure to keep here. She had joined the force to catch criminals. To help those more unfortunate. To stop people like 'her'. A different kind of 'monster'.

She clicked on the flashlight...

It wasn't hundreds. It was an amount that reached a point where any more would not have made a difference. After all, what does it matter if a hundred or half a hundred monsters hunt you from the dark?

Eyes. Glistening skin. Disproportional bodies and crippled appendages. All looking right at her. Gnawing for her. Pleading to her. And just like behind, so did in front, a choir of different tones and voices assaulted her hearing. She ducked between them as the abominations charged, clashing, tripping, and grabbing at each other in the process. A flesh ocean of bloated, barely humanoid shapes.

''What is this...'' With a whine, she squeezed past one that appeared to be cannibalizing its kin. These things were not fast. Seemed not to possess any reason either. Yet they were loud, relentless, and clearly aggressive. ''What do you want from me?!'' Screaming at them in desperation, the despairing girl tripped over a misplaced wheelchair. She lost grip of the flashlight, and it slid further down the hallway.

With a desperate grunt, the woman rolled into a sideroom as the fleshy weight of the horde crashed over her. Blood pounded in her ears. Her breath ragged and short. Her nose leaked like a faucet, as her eyes blinked at an uneven rhythm. Vision blurred.

Her stomach grumbled.

How long had she been crying?

Something shook the walls and floor.

The mass of meat pushed further along the hallway. Their goal- to snuff out the flashlight. Some did stop to stare within the dark room where the agent crouched, blocking her nose and mouth from breathing. But pushed by the rest of the wave, the suspicion was drowned by the pleading cries of... desperate female voices.

''Ob-objective: escape...'' Grabbing at her shaking shoulders, the agent mumbled to herself. Her mind too tortured to craft a logical thought. ''Objective: survive... Survive...''

Watching through the crack of the door, at the slowly drowned light source, she remembered the hatch. The gap in the planks.

''Ugly... So ugly... Disgusting...'' She bit her nail as the light cracked and went out. ''Born abomination...''

And the voices abruptly ended.

How long did she sit in that dark room, clutching her knees to her bare chest, she did not know. She listened to uneven shuffles and steps of shoeless, wet feet wandering the halls. Until, the woman thought, none remained in this immediate hallway.

She hoped...

Her nails had carved juicy welts into her toned, shaking shoulders. Composing herself with a sigh, she rose and prepared to leave. Remembering the map, the agent had a rough idea of where the exits were.

''GUH...'' A deep guttural moan vibrated the room. ''Shumashin eghtrutoy aheadn shtimlis...'' Nonensical sounds pushed through the hallway. Some MASS forced, squeezed, and crushed every obstacle in its way.

The agent heard metal trays bending, doors creaking, and snapping off hinges. The scratch of metal against the concrete. As it pumped closer, the girl backed deeper into the room, bumping into a table. As the mass came upon her part of the hallway, it stopped. ''Shmllshlik somesrup gvitmer... HEJLPSVMEE!'' It suddenly yelled and screeched. Her head rang like a metal enthusiast next to a speaker at a concert.

A straying hand touched something on the table. An old-school flip lighter. One she had only seen in movies. Yet the function was clear.

With a flick of her wrist, she heard the sound of its lid popping open. And three attempts later, the lighter dull flame came to life. The small source gave just enough light to see a fleshy bulbous form pushed through the doorway.

That thing was too enormous for the hallway.

The shadows she used to jump at, shaken into motion by her holding the lighter, had ceased to be intimidating. As the giant flesh slug-like form resumed its movements, squeezing through like paste from a tube. The young woman felt something nearly break in her.

There seemed to be a limit to the heights of one's emotional turmoil.

Closing the lighter, she waited until the doorway was free. Logic would dictate that a creature of that size could not turn with any semblance of efficiency.

Stepping over what she assumed to be a cursed recreation of leg-like appendages, she found herself back where she had come from. Now mostly cleared of obstacles.

Walking back to where they all had run from as fast as possible, she again used her light source sparingly. Hope was, that with the big thing blocking the way, none of the monsters could have been able to come back up this way.

 

Reaching for the wall, she eventually touched upon the plastic-covered floor plan. The spark, catching on the lighterwick, illuminated the map of the building once more.

The stairway should be just around the corner-

''There you are!'' The flame painted the man coming across the same hallway junction. ''Perfection awaits!'' The strong, sculpted hand wrapped around the tired woman's throat, pushing her up against the wall. She dropped the lighter; however, the unextinguished flame now gave the handsome poster face a demonic picture. Like staring at The Devil Himself! ''Fine! I know it's scary. I guess I'll help them find y-''

Grabbing the loose cuff from the handcuffs, using them like makeshift brass knuckles, she swung at the model's face. The crack of his gift of a nose unclasped her throat, as she fell to the ground, gasping. The undeniable satisfaction was a welcome bonus.

''Fuck you, you sick bastard!'' Bashing into him with her shoulder, the naked agent ran.

''Bitch!'' His steps followed. And they were faster.

So she put her vocal cords to use and screamed.

The monsters may be blind, but they follow sound well enough. To her satisfaction, she heard screams not far from her. The screaming woman ran towards them.

The model was faster.

Pulled by her long, silken hair, her head shot back, killing all momentum. Strong hands pulled her closer, grabbing at her naked form like an animal would prey. She struggled and swung. There was an impact, and a response, but it did not lessen the clutch. With a kick to her skinned shin, she wailed and fell to the ground. Another kick connected with her abdomen.

With a handful of her hair, the supermodel ignited the discarded lighter. His perfect nose, now crooked and bleeding.

''Why so stingy with your CYRUP?'' The lunatic giggled. ''Aren't you a civil servant, Agent Celeste? Share a little...''

''What are you doing here?'' The woman nearly yelled. ''Are these the human experiments-?''

''Human experiments!?'' The man yelled, his voice echoing a response through the hallway. ''Look whose talking, DOLL!'' Even angry, his features remained chiseled in marble.

It, however, was getting closer.

''Why did you kidnap and kill all those women?!'' The agent yelled on purpose.

''Kill?'' The man looked into the dark and tossed the woman the lighter with a smile. ''I haven't killed a thing.''

''Andy... Save me... Andy...'' A moaning figure stepped into the light. Its features exaggerated by the flame-cast shade. Its shape was vaguely human. One arm too many, one too short. Too many fingers, and some sprouting in the wrong places. It looked like a child's drawing brought to abominable reality.

A mistake.

The thing gripped into the blushing man's shoulders and scalp, as its maw opened. ''Andyyyyy.... HELP ME!! NOOO!'' It screamed at the model's face, as a tongue-like tentacle folded out of its gape.

''Check all you like, Anna.'' The male supermodel released the agent and spread his arms, as the monster pulled him closer. Its tongue licking the blood from his broken nose. ''No CYRUP here-''

Interrupting his caressing voice, the tentacle shot into the man's mouth and swirled around it. The surprised man gripped the monster's form, yet instead of repulsing, he pulled himself closer. The snaking tongue deformed his cheeks until eventually it slid deeper in his throat, bulging and stretching. The man's eyes rolled back into his sockets as the two interlocked in a kiss-like form, his throat swelling in waves.

The woman sat stunned. The creatures' misplaced eyeballs seemed to shoot from side to side. In some parody of the motions of thinking. And with a lifeless gasp, the man was eventually let free.

''Told... you...'' Gasping for air, the blonde coughed out some words. The monster now turned to the injured agent.

She ran. Luckily, the flesh parody was not a fast one, yet soon enough she heard the man's shoes clacking on her heels.

''HELP ME! SOMEBODY! NOOO!'' The monster screamed.

''Help her!'' With a giggle, still easing his breathing, said the male model. ''Isn't that why you're here?''

''I will burn this place to the ground!'' The woman's frustration exploded. ''You will burn, Dorian, you sick fuck! Along with the rest of your monster-''

The thought was short-lived.

''Mother...'' Her own voice tripped her over the railing. As she lost grip on the lighter, she went into a 3 story free fall. Her last thought, as she saw the half-formed meat blob: 'Huh... It grew bigger.' She was almost proud.

''Watch your step...'' Dorian chuckled as her senses disconnected.

 

''Honey... She's beautiful.''

''Oh my, she really is! Our little blessing.''

She recognized those voices.

''What do you mean, she has a skin condition?!''

''Ma'am, it's not that big of a deal. We will simply prescribe a shampoo-''

''Nonsense!''

''Mom?''

''She's perfect the way she is!''

She remembered that day.

''Why!''

''I'm sorry, mom! Please stop-''

''Why is your nose so big, huh? Who did you get it from? Don't look at me!''

''I'm-I'm sorry!''

''You ugly, ugly girl... Turn away, I said!''

She remembered the impacts.

''Where's dad?''

''He left me...''

''What? Why did he leave us?''

''One of your eyes is higher than the other. Your nose is too big for a girl.''

''Mom, I'm sorry-''

''I'm NOT your mother!''

''Mom... Please don't-''

''He left because you are too ugly! A born abomination!''

''No... I'm-''

''You need to be fixed...''

She recalled the toolbox.

''I don't ever want to hear from you.''

''Yes, mother-''

''DO NOT SPEAK! I don't want to even know you exist, understand? What a curse you are upon me... Disgusting...''

The creak of the plank hatch still grated on her ears in the dark. Those slits of light.

And then, her saviour...

 

''Garret...''

The agent's heavy lids slowly opened as she felt the flat concrete floor. There was a spotlight turned on. The back of the male supermodel was turned to her.

''Tch! You just had to break, stupid woman. You were supposed to be the last...'' With a sigh, he placed an autosyringe to his neck and injected himself. ''Fine. I guess I'll do it myself...'' He turned to face the lying agent.

She felt her body aching all over. Breathing was hard. But her mind began to work.

She played dead.

The man lifted the woman on his shoulder and began to carry her. The spotlight illuminated some kind of machine.

Taking the chance, she wrapped the handcuff chain around his neck, grabbing the empty cuff with her mangled hand. And with all her weight, she pulled.

The man panicked. Trying to flip her off of him ended up only giving her the leverage to pull herself tighter around his throat, and pull him to the ground.

They fell.

He gurgled, grabbed, scratched, and hunched. His heels trying to push away the very concrete they wrestled on. He even knocked down the spotlight, rendering the room dark once more. The struggle lasted no more than 8 seconds. The man's pulse went still in 15.

The world-famous male supermodel now lay dead and twitching on the cold floor in the skeleton of immoral ambition.

The female agent sat up. She felt weak, tired, and injured beyond belief. Her feet and fingertips tingled. But there was hope. Car headlights illuminated the hallway, which led to the entrance of the complex.

It also illuminated the horde of flesh surrounding her.

''No! No!'' She screamed, crawling up to her feet, trying to ignore the dull aches in her head, spine, and fingers.

Her very flesh.

As she got to her feet, gravity dragged her back to her knees. A severe concussion rattled her brain. Her motor functions were fading.

Crawling on all fours, she watched as 3 montsers began licking and eating... No... Merging with the supermodel's corpse. Then, with each other. They were growing bigger. Yet, the enormous shadow cast above them consumed them all the same.

It had grown larger. Like a grafted centipede tumor, the enormous blob of flesh did not appear so immobile in a big enough room. Its countless limbs carried it with the swiftness of a hunting dog.

It reached for her! Relentless...

''Comeandtastethepureessenceofgodlikepowers.'' As she crawled, it crawled with her. Yet what reached her was another.

''Mother...'' Its skull, like that of a baby and adult, now spoke as if sentient.

''Leave me alone, you disgusting fucking monster!'' She was so close. So close to salvation. And now this disgusting form of flesh was tangling in her legs. ''Abomination!'' She kicked it. And as she kicked it again, it almost seemed to let out a cry.

She froze, looking at it.

''Why do you...''

She pitied it.

The enormous shadow tossed the flesh monster towards her. It latched onto her shoulders as she felt a painful suction upon her skin.

She pushed herself forward with all her might. Too weak to fight, she struggled forward at a slug-like pace. It seemed like she had to drag two people along with her.

She needed help. She had to get outside, and they could help.

'Objective: escape!'

The rattling exhaust and police lights gave her an enormous wave of hope. Her muscles screamed with the will to survive.

The infant was consuming her.

''Garret! Garret, help me!'' She yelled over and over again. ''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' She remembered the creak of the hatch as it opened. Tears filled her eyes as she reached for the light at the end of the hallway. She had lost all sense of feeling in her lower back and legs.

She was staring through the cracks again.

''Garret! Save me...'' She cried.

''Mother... Save me...''

She had become just like she wanted. Just like everyone else.

She was beautiful now.

She was perfect now.

''Mother...''

 

''A missing person? In the Big 45?'' The voice on the radio scoffed in disbelief.

''Kidnapping.'' The older man explained, making a left turn in his police cruiser, its exhaust popping on occasion. ''20 of them. So tell me what do you have on the suspect?''

''Alright, alright.'' There was a rustle on the other end of the radio. ''You sure you need 'The' Dorian Grayson?''

''Yes.''

''The only supermodel actually BORN handsome these days?''

''The very same.'' The old detective groaned, forced to sit at a red light. ''I need files on his sudden disappearance.''

''Sure sure...'' As the light turned from red to green, the man on the other side of the comms responded. ''Well, the document is sparse. It's mostly about his father-''

''Just read it, why don't cha!''

The sound of page flipping paused their dialogue, as eventually the thin voice responded again. ''So the boy was born roughly around the time CYRUP Tech was being developed. You know the story, right?'' With no response, the voice cleared his throat and continued. ''Their joke was that the founders made the name simply by using the first letters of their own first names. And it just so happened to make sense scientifically as well.''

''Relevance?'' Exasperated the detective, as the small hairs of the bionic sniffer device on the hood dictated he turn right, before switching to left. ''Piece 'o shit...'' He mumbled.

''Relevance being, Dorian Grayson's father, Hyuell Grayson II, argued that he was the sixth founder, and that it was his tech, which the founders stole, that revolutionized CRISPR tech, and gave birth to CYRUP.'' The voice continued after a sip of coffee. ''To combat this, he launched a whole spite campaign, and eventually made KISR Tech. Named it, 'a supposed antidote to artificial perfection'. We all know how that ended.''

''What of his son?''

''Well, Dorian Grayson soon rose to fame as a 'natural beauty'. His father's antics dragged him into controversy of being the 'first' human experiment. But DNA tests showed no meddling. Not even CYRUP! That shot pushed him into the limelight. He had a pretty successful career because of it. Handsome Devil, he was-''

''What else?'' Pulling onto an abandoned road, the detective spoke.

''Not much. Around the same time, 8 years ago, when KISR Tech went bankrupt, he vanished from the public eye. His father-''

''Suicide.''

''Yes. Public news.'' The tone in the car grew as dark as the nights this time of year. ''Speculation being, like the controversy which buried KISR Tech, Dorin Grayson was 'cleaned up', as a human experiment after all. Cutting all loose ends, and such.''

''What were they developing exactly?'' The police car drove up to the Mega structure industrial complex.

''They promoted, apparently, tech which was even more revolutionary than CYRUP. The ACTUAL plans died with the founder.''

''And Dorian...'' Making the car stop, the exhaust fired once more. All semblance of a quiet approach just went out the window.

''I even heard it from here. You need a new car, Garret.''

''Yeah...'' unbuckling his seatbelt, he reached out the window to grasp the hairy bio device. It was like a fleshy smartphone, with a layer of thin, hard hair. It was supposedly more sensitive than a K9's nose.

''You think she's alright?'' Asked the concerned voice as the older detective took his biocoded firearm.

''She is. She's strong.'' The detective closed the doors and reached in to disable the radio. ''She has to be.''

''Garret! Save me!'' Before disabling the radio, a scream echoed from the building ahead.

''Call reinforcements!'' The veteran investigator ordered, raising his gun. The DNA reader unlocking the trigger. ''Celeste!'' The detective sped up to the entrance. ''Celeste?!'' The flashlight on his gun had a dead battery. ''Shit...''

''Garret, I'm here! Help me!'' Her voice echoed from deeper into the hallway. ''Garret! Save me...'' It whined.

''I'm coming, Celeste! I'm coming, baby girl!'' And the detective rushed into the darkness.

''Garret! Help me! Save me...''

''I'm here, Celeste! I'm here... Celeste?''

no ma’am, and you would be far too late if we did have any on thanksgiving. sorry to hear about your house, but why are you telling me? sure I could get you a free coffee but I can’t conjure a bear cup. did you think I would take my own personal bear cup (if I had one) and donate it to you because I feel bad for you? do you want to resell it? is that why you prefaced your question with that fun fact? why is your current priority the bear cup?

many questions to ponder. I hope she’s fed and housed this thanksgiving, but goddamn, lady!

1p8c82n,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1p8c82n/i_passed_happy_thanksgiving/,I PASSED!! Happy Thanksgiving!,"I relied on this Reddit community a lot while deciding to take the PMP exam, navigating the application process, and preparing for test day. So I wanted to give back and share my experience in case it helps anyone else.

# Preparation

When I decided to take the PMP exam, I knew nothing about traditional, agile, or hybrid project management. I had managed projects before, but never using these frameworks so everything was completely new to me.

I started with the Andrew Ramdayal (AR) 35-hour course on Udemy. I completed the full course first before even submitting my application because I wanted to make sure I understood the terminology and could write my application confidently.

My study resources included:

* AR 35-hour course (Udemy)
* AR 100 Drag-and-Drop questions (YouTube)
* AR 200 Super Hard PMP questions (YouTube)
* AR Mock Exam (via the course)
* Aspirant mock exam + drag-and-drop practice
* Ricardo Vargas’ *6th Edition Process Explained* video

I’ve been unemployed for a bit, so I didn’t want to overspend - though looking back, SH would have been helpful based on what others have said. That said, I felt confident in what I learned, so I didn’t invest in additional paid mock exams.

For practice, I built my own testing environment. I answered 60 questions at a time under timed conditions (75 minutes) to build stamina, and then reviewed all my answers afterward. This was huge for time management during the real exam.

# Application Process & Turnaround 

I completed the AR course, submitted my PMP application, and heard back the very next day—super fast turnaround, which was a huge relief. 

For the application itself, I tried to incorporate PMP terminology wherever I could and then used AI to clean up or refine my wording. AR also has a helpful video on using AI specifically for the PMP application on Youtube, and I definitely recommend watching it.

Once I was approved, I dedicated three weeks to focused studying and practice questions—pretty much full-time.

# Time Prep for the Exam and Day-of Strategy

Time management was my biggest strategy. The exam timer starts at 230 minutes and counts down, whether you're taking it online or at a testing center.

I set two personal checkpoints:

* **First checkpoint: \~155 minutes (+/- 5 minutes)**
* **Second checkpoint: \~80 minutes (+/- 5 minutes)**

I stuck to these no matter what - even if I didn’t get to review all my flagged questions. And I **NEVER left a question unanswered**.

During practice exams, I usually had 8–15 minutes left to review. On the actual exam, I had maybe 5 minutes - and around 10-20 flagged questions - so pacing truly matters.

I took all my breaks. I walked around, ate trail mix, drank water, took generous sips of a strong coffee, stretched, used the bathroom, even adjusted my thermostat LOL. Don’t skip your breaks- they really help reset your brain.

For the breaks, once my timer hit 155 or 80 minutes, I clicked “End Section” to pause the testing time and begin the break. Your screen will switch to the selfie you submitted earlier, along with a 10-minute countdown.

At around the 2-minute mark, I sat back at my desk, took a breath, and gave myself a pep talk - reminding myself that each section is a fresh start. I went in with a positive mindset no matter how the previous section felt.

# Taking the Exam Online at Home

I took my exam online at home yesterday - which, based on what I read here on Reddit, I wasn’t sure was the best choice, but I went for it anyway.

For the online setup, you’re only allowed one monitor *-* either your laptop screen, your desktop monitor, or an external monitor. I used an external monitor connected to my laptop. Since my laptop was plugged into the charger, I was able to close it and rely fully on the monitor. I also used my Logitech webcam, which handled both the camera and microphone.

**Check-In:**  
You can check in 30 minutes early. If everything is approved quickly, your exam can actually start early. Mine began about 15 minutes before my scheduled time.

**Setup:**  
The first 15 minutes involved:

* System test
* Uploading photos of myself, my ID, and my testing environment
* Waiting for the proctor 
* Once the proctor approved me, they immediately launched my exam.

**Tutorial:**  
Before the exam starts, you can complete a quick tutorial on the tools. I highly recommend doing it - super helpful to understand how to review flagged questions and navigate.

**Whiteboard:**  
There’s no physical scratch paper, but the online whiteboard is surprisingly useful.

* Top half = typing
* Bottom half = a Paint-style drawing board It’s janky but effective. 

**A huge perk:** the whiteboard does **not** reset between questions. You can keep your notes, equations, or mnemonics up for the entire exam. It’s definitely worth practicing with the tool on the Pearson Vue website beforehand.

**Other Tools:**

* Highlight
* Strikeout
* Increase/decrease font size (Ctrl + / –)
* Comment section (didn't use it)
* Calculator (similar to the basic computer ones)

# Difficulty of the Exam

To be honest, I really thought I was going to fail. The questions were much harder than AR, Aspirant, or any other practice materials I used. Those resources felt easier and more straightforward compared to what was on the actual exam.

I had:

* Very few pick-multiple questions
* Zero drag-and-drop (which I was bummed about)
* Few CPM and EVM Questions
* Some of charts/graphs to use

The exam focused heavily on mindset and situational judgment and honestly, that’s what saved me. A lot of the tips and tricks I practiced didn’t even apply to the scenarios I saw. 

**This exam tests how you think, not what you memorized.**

# On Practice Scores & Confidence

During my practice exams, I focused more on whether I was *passing*, not the exact percentage. For me, passing (getting a 70% or higher) meant I was on the right track. The numbers helped me gauge my readiness and gave me the confidence to schedule my exam, but at the end of the day, the real PMP is simply **PASS or FAIL**.

Try not to obsess over the percentages - trust me, I know it’s hard. If you consistently feel like you’re choosing the right answers and your score range feels solid, trust yourself and take the exam. I’m not an overthinker and I wasn’t going to wait until I hit some arbitrary “85%+” threshold, because I knew I’d never feel fully ready if I did that.

# Final Thoughts

I hope this is helpful. My brain is still fried and I’m honestly in disbelief that I passed, but I’ll take it! If you have any questions, feel free to drop a comment and I’m happy to share more about my experience. And if anything else comes to mind, I’ll update this post.

The chocolate drink being retired surprised me the most because the video Bryan did on it was one the best examples of clear communication he’s ever done. I’ve taken it every morning as a replacement for tea or coffee, and will miss it. If there was one product I’d urge him to consider keeping, it would be this. 

I get that it’s now being sold via his protein powder, but many of us already have protein products we use that work, and are reluctant to get his longevity protein as a result.

Also, if blueprint is supposed to provide healthier options, it’s a shame there is no longer a healthy coffee/ tea alternative. 

Anyway, it’s his company he can retire whatever product he likes 

If I want an alternative brand for nac, chocolate powder, and the mushroom drink blend, what is an alternative product in each category, that is equal or at least comparable? 

I hope that we get longer justifications soon, the confusion is: does the data suggest these products aren’t worth it, or did he drop the products because they weren’t selling well / or did he just want to offer fewer products to make things simpler / or did competitors  offer similar products so it wasn’t worth him selling them  ?",8,1764274861.0,blueprint_,7,0.9,False

So bit of context- me and this guy were dating back when we were 18/19 while we were in a program together and when it ended, after a year, we broke up because we live in different countries. Now we broke up on super good terms, we knew we would come to an end so no hard feelings whatsoever. We texted maybe a little but a few months after the break up, we went no contact, knowingly or not, we just haven’t spoken since.

Yesterday he texts me saying he’s coming to my country to visit and asked if I’m around to meet up just for coffee. This obviously came out of the blue for me because we haven’t spoken in so long, and I genuinely haven’t thought of him. I texted back saying I’m unfortunately not available, thinking we’ve got nothing to say to each and honestly I’d rather spend my weekend in front of the tv with my dog. He replied and seemed like he did want to find a time when I can so I offered as a last resort that I’m free Sunday morning before I get busy. He offered to meet me nearby, and I said to myself that I can’t go to him because I need to be close to my area so that solved it. That way it felt to me that he’s the one putting in the effort and not me. And I was beginning to be fine about catching up with him because I feel like he’s more of a friend now than an ex, and it’s like meeting an old friend.

However! He texted my best friend (from the same program) with the exact same text he sent me!! Which kinda threw me off cause Idk, felt like the message to me was a bit special and also they weren’t really friends back then, they only talked because she’s my best friend and I dated him so it’s not like they talked independently of me. They’re not gonna meet up and it felt like more laziness of copying and pasting a message. And honestly it felt like more of an attempt to meet as many people as possible from the program before he has to go back to his country.

Anyway so yeah, we did fix a time for Sunday morning but I’m not entirely sure??? On one hand, sure maybe it’d be nice to catch up, but on the other hand, I’m kinda iffy about the idea of talking after so long and updating him about my life which I’m a little private about and then go back to no talking again. It feels weird to be updating him with details that I find difficult updating regular people in my life, why would I want this person from the past get to know this version of myself, you know? I don’t know how to explain it but it feels weird to me, I might be overreacting.

So I’d love some help!! To meet him? To not? Please help, let me know what you’d do in this situation! Xxx",2,1764274860.0,relationships_advice,2,1.0,False

For quite a long time, I was wondering why my espresso shots were turning out poorly. The main suspect was always the built-in grinder of my coffee machine. Still, I hesitated to buy a standalone grinder because of limited space and cost.

I also brew pour-over coffee, so I already had a Timemore C3S hand grinder. My friend recently bought a Comandante, which inspired me to upgrade my own setup. I considered a Eureka grinder, but due to space limitations, I ended up getting the 1Zpresso.

Since buying the 1Zpresso, I haven’t used the Sage grinder at all. The difference is huge — the grind consistency is incredibly good. Now I’m wondering: is the Sage grinder really that bad, or is the K-Ultra just that good? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

# Notes on My First Week Using Cerebrolysine

## Initial Use (Day 1)

**Injection setup:**  
Used a 10 mL syringe with a large needle to draw, then switched to a fine needle for injection. Administered 5 mL into one thigh/buttock, switched needles, and injected another 5 mL into the other side. No visible particles or residue; solution quality appeared excellent.

### Immediate Effects
- Slight jittery, anxious feeling—similar to too much coffee, but without loss of fine motor control. Mostly mental.  
- Noticeable mental clarity.

### Over the Day
- Persistent sense of being “on.” Not unpleasant, just distinctly different.
- Slightly reminiscent of a microdose-level LSD experience; hard to describe.
- Thought patterns felt unusual. Social interactions felt faster, almost as if I were anticipating branching-response “scripts.”
- Strong sense of humor (at least subjectively).  
- Improved memory.  
- Wider field of vision and more vivid colors.

### Night
- Extremely vivid and strange dreams.  
- Restlessness.

## Advice for First-Time Self-Injection
- Block off plenty of time. The mental hurdle of inserting a needle into yourself is significant.  
- Always use a fresh needle. The moment a needle touches anything, it’s no longer sterile—discard it.  
- Otherwise you risk infection, pain, or abscesses.  
- Wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything involved in the injection.  
- Inject slowly. It’s a large volume.

---

## Day 3 Impressions
- Memory continues to be improved.  
- Better recall of names.  
- Driving performance feels enhanced.  
- Music feels deeper, more emotionally resonant.  
- Overall experience of the world feels less “flat.”

---

## Day 6 (First Day Off — 5 Days On / 2 Days Off Cycle)

### Positive and Neutral Effects
- Adjusted to the widened visual field; visual sharpness is improved (may or may not be related).  
- Dreams are now less chaotic than the first night.  
- Overall sense of fatigue, but in an emotional way—similar to the aftermath of losing someone close.  
- Driving feels significantly improved. It’s like navigating a timeline with multiple “lanes” and having better foresight.  
- For context, I’ve trained regularly on supersports bikes for years—~50k km—so I’m familiar with performance demands.  
- Increased spontaneous happiness. Small things, like light shining through a gap, trigger noticeable sparks of joy.  
- Reduced approach anxiety; rejection feels less significant.  
- Higher productivity; I’ve started tackling tasks I ignored for years.

### Harder Parts
- Memory retrieval is more vivid and emotional. At the gym, past events replay almost like flashbacks.  
- Not all of these memories feel positive. I’m realizing ways I’ve failed in life, wasted opportunities, or hurt others.  
- I had framed myself as the victim in many situations. Re-experiencing events makes me question that narrative; I’m surprised friends were as tolerant as they were.  
- Considered whether these are hallucinated (GAN-like) reconstructions, but the consistency and logic make them feel plausible.  
- I strongly dislike injections.

# My Question
I feel like I’m not using the full potential of this medication. I’ve even slipped back into watching Instagram reels. If my brain is currently in a heightened learning state, I want to make use of it—but I’m not sure how. I tried starting a new language but couldn’t stick with it.

### Current Habits
- Good nutrition, including magnesium citrate and glycinate  
- Targeting 10 hours of sleep  
- Sports  
- Dancing  
- Seeking varied experiences, spending time in nature

Today is my first off-day and I already feel less sharp—like I’m sliding back into my baseline stupor.

Any ideas for what I could be doing to support my brain during this cycle?

1p8bxsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycle/comments/1p8bxsj/six_months_with_my_honda_activa_what_my_mileage/,Six Months with My Honda Activa: What My Mileage Data Actually Reveals,"When I purchased my Honda Activa back in May, I decided to do something most scooter owners never bother with—track every single drop of fuel using the tank-to-tank method. Six months, 38 fill-ups, and 7,662 kilometers later, I've got the kind of real-world data that manufacturers never want to share. Here's what I discovered.

https://preview.redd.it/sb3t71w0xu3g1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=a285bded9a156f54a84459ccd6d788ba90bfa783

# The Raw Numbers That Shocked Me

Before diving into the deep stuff, let me hit you with the headline figure: my Activa averaged 48.78 km/l over six months. That's not just good—it's legitimately impressive for a scooter that spends most of its time navigating Pune's chaotic traffic. I've spent ₹16,358.97 on fuel over this period, which works out to approximately ₹2.14 per kilometer.

When you first see that number, it feels abstract. But put it this way—I could ride my Activa for 48 kilometers on the cost of a cup of coffee at any decent café in the city. That's the real-world advantage of choosing two wheels over four.

# Why City Traffic Is Weirdly More Efficient Than Highway Riding

This is where things get interesting and honestly quite counterintuitive. I classified my rides into two categories based on when I refueled. If I filled up near a weekend and didn't refuel until the following Monday or Tuesday, I was clearly out on a highway adventure (roughly 70% highway, 30% city). Otherwise, it was regular daily commuting (20% highway, 80% city).

The results completely flipped my expectations: **city rides averaged 49.07 km/l while highway rides came in at 47.01 km/l.**

https://preview.redd.it/cc8zcjfywu3g1.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d8926b36e7ea863c8ac509a7833676e388b4a97

I spent an entire afternoon trying to figure out why highway riding, which theoretically should be more efficient at consistent speeds, was underperforming. Then it hit me. On highways, I tend to maintain higher speeds—sometimes 60-70 km/h on open stretches. The Activa's engine isn't really designed for that. It's happiest chugging along at 40-50 km/h in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Meanwhile, city riding, with all its stopping and starting, somehow works better with the engine's natural efficiency band. There's a lesson here about working with your equipment rather than against it.

# The Fuel Brand Saga: Which One Actually Performs Better?

I've used fuel from five different brands across my tracking period: BPCL, IOCL, Shell, HP, and Nayara. The performance differences weren't dramatic, but they were definitely measurable.

https://preview.redd.it/bn8istudxu3g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=742c72261e70848222ef372f18b65c148707cd84

**BPCL came out on top** with an impressive average of 54.19 km/l, though I only used it three times. More importantly, it was also the cheapest at ₹103.88 per liter and delivered the best cost-efficiency at ₹1.92 per kilometer. The best single fill-up of my entire six-month period was with BPCL on July 14—I managed 56.44 km/l covering 232 kilometers of city riding.

**IOCL finished a strong second,** which is significant because I used IOCL fuel nine times. It averaged 51.66 km/l and at ₹103.85 per liter, it was essentially the same price as BPCL. This consistency made IOCL my go-to brand by the end of the study period.

Then there was **Shell**, which was notably more expensive at ₹105.13 per liter but delivered one of the lowest average mileages at 48.06 km/l. When you work out the math, I was spending ₹2.18 per kilometer with Shell versus ₹1.92 with BPCL. Over the course of a year, that's a difference of several thousand rupees.

**HP and Nayara** brought up the rear, both averaging around 46.7 km/l. Now, here's the thing—HP was available at more locations, so I ended up using it 11 times. If I'd stuck exclusively with BPCL or IOCL and avoided Shell, I could have saved approximately ₹4,022 over the six-month period.

# Monthly Performance: The Pattern That Emerged

The first month was my worst, which makes sense given the break-in period. May saw 44.82 km/l as the scooter settled in. June improved slightly to 46.97 km/l, and July—despite those outlier issues—showed 47.57 km/l.

Then something changed in August. My mileage jumped to 48.99 km/l, and it stayed solid. September remained strong at 48.95 km/l. **October was the outlier—in the good way—with 52.79 km/l**, my best month by a significant margin. November stayed respectable at 51.92 km/l as we headed into the winter season.

The improved efficiency from August onwards probably reflects my growing confidence with the scooter. I was smoother with acceleration, better at anticipating stops, and generally gentler on the throttle. That's the real story: the machine got two months to break in, but the operator took significantly longer to optimize.

# The Weekend Warriors Show Their Hand

Ten of my thirty-eight fill-ups qualified as ""weekend trip"" fill-ups based on my classification system. These weekend adventures covered 1,816 kilometers across mostly highway stretches—everything from quick getaways to longer drives out of the city.

What surprised me was how these trips averaged only 47.01 km/l compared to the 49.07 km/l of regular city commuting. You'd think the steady highway speeds would crush the city traffic efficiency, but the reality is that the Activa's engine finds its sweet spot in lower speed ranges. Highway riding, even though it might feel more efficient, actually demands more from the engine.

The good news? Even at 47 km/l on highways, a full tank gets me over 200 kilometers comfortably. For weekend trips, that's more than enough range.

https://preview.redd.it/nr8k7e4fxu3g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3ed8b40e3c9fe9a17c18ce635313badc43fe80c

# Cost Efficiency: The Real Story

Numbers on a spreadsheet are one thing, but what actually matters is the rupee impact on your wallet. My average cost per kilometer came to ₹2.14. That means every 100 kilometers of riding costs approximately ₹214. On a monthly basis, assuming 30 days of riding at my average 42.57 km/day usage, I spend about ₹2750 per month on fuel.

But here's where it gets interesting. If I'd been more deliberate about always using BPCL or IOCL, avoided Shell entirely, and stuck to city commuting instead of highway adventures, I could have optimized that to ₹2.00 per kilometer—a 6.5% reduction. Over a full year at my current usage, that's a difference of ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.

More importantly, the gap between my best and worst fill-ups was enormous. My most efficient kilometer (with BPCL in city riding) cost ₹1.60, while my worst (on Highway riding with Nayara) cost ₹3.82. That's a 139% variance. This tells me that fuel brand choices genuinely impact your operating costs, and they're worth being deliberate about.

# What This Means If You're Considering an Activa

If you're thinking about buying a Honda Activa or already own one, here's my bottom line after six months of obsessive data tracking:

**The real-world performance lives up to the hype**. The 48.78 km/l I achieved is legitimate, not cherry-picked. It wasn't achieved by riding at 35 km/h in ideal conditions. It's the genuine average across monsoon season, peak summer, city traffic, highway trips, and everything in between.

**Fuel brand matters more than you'd think**. That 5-8% difference in mileage between top and bottom performers translates to real money over time. It's worth seeking out BPCL or IOCL pumps rather than grabbing whatever's convenient.

**Your riding style is probably the biggest variable**. I improved my efficiency by about 10% just by getting comfortable with the scooter's characteristics. Every new rider should expect the first 1,000-1,500 kilometers to be their least efficient period.

**Highway riding is fun but not what this scooter's built for**. It'll do it just fine, but city commuting is where the Activa truly shines. If highway touring is your primary use case, you might want something else.

# What's Next?

I'm planning to continue tracking through the full year mark. If my usage patterns remain consistent, I should hit 10,000 kilometers around March 2026. By that point, I'll have full-year data across seasons, potentially new insights about winter efficiency versus summer performance, and enough data for genuinely predictive conclusions about long-term ownership costs.

For now, I can say this with complete confidence: if you want a reliable, efficient, no-nonsense commuter that won't break your budget and won't make you feel guilty about your environmental footprint, the Honda Activa delivers. And that's not marketing speak—that's what six months of meticulous data says.

**Final statistic to take away**: 7,662 kilometers, ₹16,358.97 spent, and I'd do it all again. That's the real-world Honda Activa story.",2,1764274524.0,motorcycle,3,1.0,False

Different tamp pressures  
Different distribution patterns  
Checked dose accuracy (18.0 g every time)  
Checked scale accuracy  
Tried different cups under the spouts  
Tried different ratios (1:1.5, 1:2.2, etc.)

**Questions:**

1. Where do you feel the issue is?
2. Is this normal behaviour for the Smart Grinder Pro? Is it a bad acquisition if my goal is espresso only?
3. Could the Gaggia Classic Pro OPV pressure be affecting results?
4. Could this be hidden channelling even if I do not see it?
5. Is this grinder simply too jumpy between settings?
6. Are there diagnostic tests I can run to isolate the issue?
7. Should I be using grind settings above 2, change internal dialing, or is my unit calibrated unusually fine?

**Goal:**  
Get a stable extraction around 25–30 seconds, 18 g in → 36 g out, with consistent flow and balance flavour.  
  
Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",1,1764274439.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
