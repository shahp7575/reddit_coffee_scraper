How do I react?,"So we have been dating for a short time now, things started out casually and we were mainly using each other for sex for a few months. Eventually I gave him an ultimatum and we ended up getting together. 

Ever since then, I feel like he doesn't spend enough time with me. Obviously now that we are actually dating my expectations are much bigger. For context, we live in a pretty big city, his apartment and office are far away from my apartment and university so we usually see each other in the evening. When he's got work the next day he doesn't sleep over at my place because he'd have to wake up super early to get to his work place. Okay, I get that. 

However, I crave more time with him and I have expressed that. That's why we made plans and agreed he'd come over Friday night and sleep over. I was excited, I cooked dinner and I told him I'm going to be making pancakes for breakfast. 
Fast forward to the next morning, we woke up and cuddled in bed for a while. Then we got up and I made us coffee, he had a few phone calls and told me he's going to go home because he has a lot of work to do. I felt bad because I had planned a breakfast and expected we'd spend like at least half the day together. I didn't say anything though because I didn't want to overreact and he left.

Like 30 minutes later he calls me, I asked him if he got home and he told me he's in the store buying stuff because his best friend will be coming over. I asked what they'll be doing and he told me his bff called him and asked him to hang out and he agreed. I felt really stupid hearing that, it made me feel like he just didn't want to spend time with me. I'm also upset he didn't consider I was planning on making breakfast. If he agreed to hang out with his friend then clearly he doesn't have that much work to do.

I'm really upset and I don't know how to approach the situation. What should my approach be?

1fxd3dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fxd3dj/graduated_cna_and_no_one_cared_eek/,graduated CNA and no one cared- eek ,"title probably explains it 

Hey all- I‚Äôm meant to be sleeping because I‚Äôm inbetween two back to back shifts and suppose to be up in an hour or so, but my thoughts are loud.

I‚Äôve attempted many trade schools, school has never been easy for me, and homework is difficult for me to sit down and complete. 

Everyone around me knows this. This last year I decided I wanted stability and to do something of meaning for others with my job, I‚Äôve always loved helping people and on a whim decided to take the last money I had (while flat broke) and go through cna school. 


About two weeks ago I became certified. 
I‚Äôve been working as a na/now cna for almost 10 months in SNF (vent/trach,LTC,Rehab, Memory care)

I was meant to graduate in may but was to scared to schedule my final exams, and my little brother was meant to be graduating highschool that month and my family made it clear they would not be celebrating it with me if I did pass that month as to not ‚Äúover shadow‚Äù his time.  So I waited.

Well, I worked up the courage and scheduled my final exams against the deadline this fall and passed skills and written with perfect scores first try. 

I‚Äôm proud of myself! but I‚Äôm so sad. 
I spoke to my partner last spring about hopes of becoming certified, and thinking maybe I actually am smart enough and can commit to my education (nursing school in the future?) 

I told my partner, family and friends I wanted to have a party and celebrate when I passed. Everyone said it sounded fun and I was excited.
I ended up moving out of state w my partner right before my test and had to travel back in state to take my test- so I‚Äôll be going back to Oregon where my partner is soon and I‚Äôm hesitant to bring up that I‚Äôm sad.(they are truly so kind and I‚Äôm sure I haven‚Äôt communicated wanting to do something when I come home)

Now I‚Äôm certified and I want to celebrate and no one seems to care. Texted and called my siblings and got back a ‚Äúoh nice‚Äù about getting my cert. my parents offered to take me to the movies to celebrate while I‚Äôm in town but then they  didn‚Äôt feel like it later that night. my friends said congrats over text but that‚Äôs about it. I hate to fall into pity for myself, after all it is just CNA. But I worked hard and it just feels like I took longer than everyone expected. 

Am I being silly? I want to throw myself a small party for just myself at home but it all kind of seems pointless now, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd hurt my partners feelings if they noticed I just decided to celebrate alone. - But underlying I‚Äôve never graduated from anything, and I‚Äôm just damn proud of myself for pulling through. I love my job, I love my career.

And I finally did something for myself, to better my life and situation, I just feel like it‚Äôs worth being proud of.

I want to buy myself a cupcake and candle, hang some streamers. Take myself to coffee and get myself a card and some flowers and a nice pair of scrubs. have a kitchen table party and take some lil grad photos w my cert.  üíÄ

1fxd0bo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxd0bo,"Osteria di Passignano, Tuscany ","Had the recent pleasure of going to Tuscany and visiting Osteria di Passignano, which was in the neighbouring town. I'm British, all my previous 1 and 2 star experience has been in Britain, this is pertinent later.

It's been almost a week and I'm not sure how I feel yet , so shall break it down, might help

Location, room.
It's in a town, funnily enough, called passignano. A collection of buildings around a monastery. Even on a cloudy day it's stunning. Inside, it's an old building and quite charming, with local towns emblems on the walls. As you can maybe see by the pics though, our corner table had different lighting than the others, and ultimately was just a bit dim. No big deal.

Staff. 
Generally and genuinely lovely. A couple in particular were really personable. 

Drinks.
It's in the middle of Chianti, it's hard to get bad wine. It's in the middle of Chianti... so I drove, there's no taxi service (from my tiny hill top town to this tiny hill top town anyway) so my wife had a tasting flight, whilst I had 2 small glasses throughout the meal. All of the wife's flight was delicious, especially and unsurprisingly a ¬£160 a bottle tempranillo, it almost deserved to be a course on its own. That kind of was the vibe of the pairing, the wines were delicious, but didn't have that pop that I'm used too, didn't seem to work as the additional ingredient to the dish. I love when something comes alive on the plate because of the paired wine, and it just didn't happen. However, I'd happily drink all the wine again. 

As a driver, I didn't really have an option beyond just drinking wine and water, I've never had an non alcoholic pairing before, I'm not sure I want one. Maybe the 'continental' thing is just to drink drive?

The food.
We had a few days in Florence, then tuscany, then Pisa. Had some excellent food throughout, a general theme was the best food was very simple, e.g. some pan roasted rabbit with olives in Pisa. Exceptional 

Food here carried a similar theme, there's a big kitchen garden, the bottom dish of pic 4 was some salad from there. With a tomato jelly, fresh clean and delicious. The other two dishes here were a sesame whip, and a broccoli mouse in some bread, which weren't as strong. 

Pic 6 was some breaded and fried aubergine puree, with an aubergine juice and parsley sauce, with some cooked and raw aubergine. This is where my Britishness started getting in the way, maybe I'm a bit too used to creamy buttery sauces, but aubergine juice and parsley tastes as you'd expect, not bad, just not delicious. The less was less, not more, for me here

Pic 7 was some crab and prawn ravioli and tartar. Clean, sweet and delicious. Possibly the strongest dish

Pic 8 was mushroom ravioli, with fried mushroom and mushroom puree. Somehow, didn't taste all that mushroomy, just kind of bitter.

Pic 9 was pigeon with balsamic and a date, onion and potato cake. Very dense and sweet, but also very one dimensional. I appreciate the Italian tradition is to have dishes separately, maybe pasta and a veg sauce, followed by some meat and cabbage. Rather than a big Sunday roast like the UK. But I really wanted some contrast here

Pic 10 and 12 was a huge tiramisu the wife had, best she's had, then the victorious photo after

Pic 11 was a chocolate desert I had, I'm not the biggest coffee fan. Was excellent.


I don't think there was anything wrong with the food, I just don't think it was to my taste. 

Other customers.
I know a restaurant can't really control this, there were Italians in there, wasn't just tourists. But I've never seen so many people wearing jeans, but weird to me. There was a table of 12 or more Americans, I've never seen so much food and drink sent back to the kitchen, not in a complaint way, just didn't want it. So wasteful and, to me, disrespectful.

Anyway, that's that. Side note, if anyone is going to Florence you should go too osteria pratellino. I wish it were my neighborhood restaurant, a celebration of the simplicity of Italian food. Main course of skirt steak and chard, excellent. My starter was celery stuff with beef mince, breaded and fried, delicious.

As a foreigner, getting a verified account required me to sign up with Naver and then message them a copy of my passport. This process was a little finicky. My wife tried first, but the name she signed up for on Naver didn‚Äôt exactly match her passport (we‚Äôre from the US so three names, and for Naver that meant my first and middle got mixed together in the given name field), so she was denied. I tried next, knowing what happened to her, and was verified after about a day. After that I was able to find the reservation system on Naver and book a time slot. This took a little work to figure out, since I don‚Äôt speak korean, but we got it sorted. If you are booking for two people keep in mind that there are different bookings for one or two people. This initially tripped me up because you cannot book two of them (one per ID), so to book two people you need to book one two person table. 

**Cafe**

I went at 10:00(AM) on a Saturday, and it wasn‚Äôt super busy, but it also wasn‚Äôt deserted. A brief wait in line to get in, and a very short wait for food. They have a lot of Sumeru and Natlan, graffiti theme was fairly prevalent. You order through a vending machine after checking in, but there was someone there who stepped us through it.

*A note on getting in: You don‚Äôt enter through the front of the building, you go around to the alley behind and go down a stairway to get in. This is where the check in desk is. You need to have your Naver reservation open for them on your phone when you get there, and hand the phone over for them to finish the checkin.*

[Sumeru and Natlan with a dose of Wanderer drinking coffee, basically the theme at the moment.](https://preview.redd.it/25vehdwop3td1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a723811aad35cf48ca5b49eaf2e9602c9873b54)

I wasn‚Äôt very hungry so I only got a drink and desert. They were fine, but the little standees were very cute. Food was fine, the drinks were pretty good.

[This blue drink was fairly good, the waffle was a little tough but pretty tasty.](https://preview.redd.it/sf1w9xxpp3td1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c00c9a44024c0af148c08e77356718f20c15d8e4)

**Windows and Decoratoins**

The windows are almost all covered in written messages. I think they‚Äôre all from guests. I didn‚Äôt add anything, but I saw another group doing so.

[Window Drawings, mostly in Korean](https://preview.redd.it/4hzwu164q3td1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fc6cfcd049b11b481c56fb8fbbe9b403e3daeda)

[It‚Äôs hard to take photos of this, I‚Äôm sorry](https://preview.redd.it/x8nls264q3td1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65dd1181dec8f23acb38d7b09a10492a854fd27a)

They had a birthday decoration setup on one of the floors.

[I didn‚Äôt fully understand what was happening here, I think people were writing their own little notes and drawings, but I couldn‚Äôt actually figure it out](https://preview.redd.it/7tzluslaq3td1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb60bf1395a1f7127885168be563a97a077e23f8)

I didn‚Äôt take pictures, but they had a few claw machine style games set up here as well. I didn‚Äôt try them, but they had plushies.

**Merch**

They had a fair bit of merch you could buy, but it was focused on plastic sleeves and large acrylics. They also had some clothes, notebooks, and lots of keychains.

When checking out they gave us a postcard and a random plastic character card. I got Kachina. It‚Äôs the Blaze to Natlan image on the postcard.

I‚Äôm a Paimon fan, so I got the photo album from the latest event.

[Paimon Photo Album, I had just done the event with Paimon‚Äôs album and needed this.](https://preview.redd.it/9ws5hhjmq3td1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f830ce618145af0cce4c094782c3d76515562e8a)

Overall it was really fun. They have lots of art on the walls (which I didn‚Äôt include here, I have some pictures of it if people are interested). It does require a tiny bit of work to get the reservation, but IMO worth it if you have a couple free hours.

For me, it did literally nothing. No extra energy, but did not calm me down either. Just nothing. So I don't drink much of it, just sometimes, because I do like the taste.

I started Elvanse not long ago. Had some coffee at an unusual time for me, an hour or so after I took Elvanse, and got an energy burst. Not a large one, and it only lasted for maybe 15 minutes max, but it was definitely there. I could not understand why at first, but I had gone up from 30 mg to 50 mg just over a week ago, so I thought maybe body's just getting used to the meds.

It took me about a week to figure out for certain that it was definitely the coffee - if I have a cup of strong coffee within 1-4 hours after taking Elvanse, I get a short energy boost, the more time after the meds, the less. But it does spike the blood pressure as well, so I only have coffee early in the morning or late in the evening now, to avoid this.

Anyone else with a similar experience?

Have I finally discovered what coffee feels like for regular people?

I happened to have two coffee cups in my hands that shattered, so I got charged with assault with a deadly weapon and assault with attempt to disfigure. There‚Äôs more to the story, but my attorney told me I‚Äôd have been better off shooting him, legally anyway. 

During pretrial, I got a concussion that ended my career and ability to work. I also wasn‚Äôt able to aid in my own defense, but in Arizona having brain damage isn‚Äôt enough to be found incompetent. My lawyer knew this but he wanted to buy me time to rehab from my TBI. It took 5 years to hit ‚Äúeh, good enough.‚Äù Even though I was defending myself, my fianc√© and her dog (previously, my roommate tried to light the dog on fire twice), I signed a plea deal because I was facing a sentence of 7.5-15 years. Or I could plead out and face no jail time just a few years of probation. 

My probation is finally over and I‚Äôm free! First thing I did was book a flight to see family I haven‚Äôt seen in 5 years and friends I haven‚Äôt seen in a decade. I‚Äôm so excited to get the fuck out of Arizona! I still have to pay my fines, but I can leave and do whatever I want. I‚Äôm glad this chapter of my life is mostly over.

How long did it take before you saw any progress? Would you recommend me buying the ""Intensive and Progressive Online Course Bundle"" straight away or to just try one of the meditations? There's so much to choose from so I feel kind of overwhelmed and don't know where to start... 

I'm also wondering if there're people going to the live retreats by themselves? I don't really have anyone in my life that's interested in,  or even open to this kind of work, so if I would go to a live retreat it would most likely be by myself. It makes me kind of stressed out because I don't really find it easy to connect with new people and it just gives me anxiety when thinking about all the coffee and lunch brakes.

I ordered a pumpkin spice frappucino, venti with oat milk, coffee, and no whipped cream.

The barista starts making it, I first have to remind him that it's oat milk as he was going to put cows milk in the drink despite reading the sticker. Then he goes for the ice without putting coffee. I remind him that I asked for it with coffee. He pumps the coffee without looking at the glass and only one pump of coffee goes in. I tell him as much. He says a venti only gets 3 pumps of coffee, I say normally they put 5 but either way as you weren't looking only one pump of coffee actually went into the drink.

He's irritated now and I'm exasperated. He takes the drink out of the blender, picks up my glass, all the way up to his mouth spits in it then pours the drink and gives it to me. 

The only thing he got right was no whipped cream. I don't know, maybe I came off too bossy. But for a drink that cost me ‚Ç¨7.60 I want them to at least follow the recipe and instructions that are clearly printed on the sticker.

I'm just so disappointed and it sort of ruined my Sunday morning. 

It's a small starbucks at a mall. I was the only customer being served, so there wasn't a mad rush. There were two baristas, a girl who took my order and then went to the back and the boy who made my order. I was too shocked to react, so I didn't say anything. I couldn't really believe my eyes so it took me a good minute to react.

For context, my partner has a disability which means she can‚Äôt do most things independently. If she wants to go for a coffee for example, she needs someone to go with her.

My partner doesn‚Äôt really do anything wrong but the nature of her disability makes doing fun and spontaneous things very difficult. It also means I have to do a lot of stuff for her like take her to auditions (she‚Äôs an actor).

I also recently went travelling for about 3 months with a friend (a long term, pre-relationship life goal) that kind of reminded me about who I was as an individual and what parts of my identity I feel like I miss.

I feel like there‚Äôs some resentment within me about being in a relationship that it‚Äôs stopping me being who I am as an individual. But I feel like that‚Äôs something I am responsible for. Again, this isn‚Äôt anything my partner does, our relationship is supportive and loving.

1fxcict,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1fxcict/i_am_at_my_witts_end/,I am at my witts end.,"30 year old male.

Okay so the last 6, months has been tough but I have struggled with symptoms on and off for nearly 10 years. I have never found a concrete answer for why I just don't feel right. 

I have had numerous tests over the years and more specifically over the last 6 months. I have had a number of bloods tests which all appear normal, eye tests, EKG's for my heart. Heart monitor for a week. Had an brain MRI with and without contrast. I'm waiting on a heart scan to check the structure of my heart due to then hearing a systolic murmur.

Seen cardiologist and neurologists and my doctors so far they sre always pinning it on anxiety. Although I accept I have had anxiety the anxiety came after the symptoms. I get worried when I feel terrible like any normal person so then doctors visits I always appear anxious but it's because I feel terrible dizziness, lightheaded like I feel faint, pale face, fatigue, sensitivity to light, painful neck and back. My sleep is hit or miss but even when I sleep well I wake up feeling terrible and spend all day yawning, wanting to lie down. The dizziness is horrible always feel like when in upright everything is worse. It's making my life impossible to live I can barely do my job anymore even after 5 months off. I always suffered the next day after exercise I would be way more tired. Even when my symptoms weren't as bad id struggle the following day and I'd end up drinking loads of coffee just to keep functioning.

I understand there is no specific test for chronic fatigue syndrome. And it's usually a matter of ruling other stuff out. 

But at this point I just want a diagnosis that explains why I feel terrible. I know a lot of people will say it's anxiety and once you have been labelled with anxiety it's very hard to shake it off. 

When I say I really don't feel well within myself I mean it.  At times the best way to describe howI feel is like my body is flooded with inflammation and sometimes my brain feels like is not getting enough blood or oxygen. 

Following my heart scan that I have coming this week, and a final blood test for my cortisol levels. I feel like I am running out of ideas of what it could be and I'll just have to accept anxiety. But I feel like it's impossible for me to live a normal life struggling with these symptoms. 

Any ideas? I'm trying not to be insensitive to suggest that I have chronic fatigue I'm just at a loss. ",5,1728205992.0,cfs,7,1.0,False

He‚Äôs great, and we usually get along really well. However, his mom (late 40sF) has been a point of tension lately. I work as a barista and am also studying part-time. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but I enjoy my job, and it helps pay for school.

His mom is very career-focused and has a ‚Äúhigh-powered‚Äù job in finance. From day one, she‚Äôs been making snide comments about my job, like, ‚ÄúWhen are you going to get a real career?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that just something people do as a hobby?‚Äù I usually just brush it off or laugh awkwardly to avoid confrontation.

A few days ago, we went to his parents‚Äô house for dinner, and everything was going fine until the topic of work came up. His mom made another passive-aggressive remark about how ‚Äúcoffee-making is a great skill for high schoolers but isn‚Äôt really sustainable for adults.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore, and I replied, ‚ÄúWell, I guess it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm not relying on someone else to support me while I figure out my life.‚Äù The room went dead silent.

Here‚Äôs why you might want to give it a look:

üïπÔ∏è **Levels**: 10 handcrafted levels in one episode, offering 2-3 hours of gameplay. If you‚Äôre into blowing things up for fun, this should do the trick.

üî´ **Weapons**: 7 weapons to choose from. It wouldn‚Äôt be much of a shooter without them.

üëæ **Enemies**: 9 pixel-art enemies standing between you and a decent day. Shoot first. Don‚Äôt ask later.

üé∂ **Soundtrack**: A dynamic soundtrack. If you‚Äôre into music while dodging bullets, you‚Äôll probably enjoy it.

üéÆ **Gameplay**: Semi-random placement of objects, pickups, and enemies. No two runs are exactly the same. More variety, more explosions.

üëæ **Style**: Classic retro FPS. It‚Äôll remind you of the old days, assuming that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.

üí∏ **Price**: It‚Äôs $4.99. About the price of a coffee, but it‚Äôll keep you entertained longer.

üåç **Languages**: 9 main languages support...

üñ•Ô∏è **Platforms**: Available on PC (Windows).

**Links**: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779730?utm_source=rdtsund8) | [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCIyGkXNjlA)

I (36F) recently relocated by my family and transferred my job at the end of July. I work for a large retailer that gets repeat customers/contractors so I am used to interacting with all sorts of people and dealing with various situations. During one of my shifts a few weeks ago I had this awkward exchange when one guy told me I'm cute suddenly when he was walking by and then came back to drop the compliment. It's been almost two years since I left my ex, I've dropped over 20 pounds recently and was thrown off kilter by the forward compliment, I'm not used to them from guys closer to my age or while I'm in ""work"" mode and suffering from a migraine. (Tonight I'm happy to say I'm now in a healthy weight range with a healthy bmi). Couple days later he came by my desk, apologized for the other day but restated he really does think I'm cute and would like to go out and get coffee sometime. He gave me his card and wrote down his name and number before handing it to me ( I was stumped about that part at first being it is his business card). Now of course I had a busy work weekend and I only messaged my BFF about him and sent a picture of his card to her in case she wanted to look him up. Then when she began bugging me the next week about if I had messaged him yet I nervously sent him a general hello message while stating who it is. Everything began real smooth, we messaged a bit, he brought me coffee at work, we went on our 1st date which was him inviting me to his Uncle's large 60th birthday party.  It was a lot of fun and very casual. Went on a UTV ride to the pond where we went on a paddle boat with his dog swimming in the water.  We returned and played volleyball with his cousins until we couldn't see the ball then finished the night by going out to a nearby haunted attraction where by the end of our time there he had pulled me for a kiss.... the 2nd date was a miss. I was invited to join him at his church the next morning and try it out but he didn't reply to my message when I arrived, ""Here, walking up,"" until I had already left after having sat through the service alone and being it is a large place I struggled to spot him anywhere and was under the impression that he was going to meet me by the door and be looking for my message. I felt a bit rejected/duped so I headed out to my plans to give my brother my moving boxes... which by the time that finished I noticed messages from him asking where I was and inviting me to breakfast then asking if I'm joining them. After clearing that up a little ee agreed to a 3rd date this last Monday after we had both finished with work for the day. The night went great, parked at his place and walked to a local Chinese restaurant where we both really enjoyed the food. From there we put our leftovers away at his place and I enjoyed a ride on the back of his Harley. That turned into a movie and kissing, along with a plan for a double date for Friday. What is nice is the fact we are both newish to the area, we both relocated to be by family so his business card is from when he was in the last state with his business. It had been a few years since his last relationship so I felt good that this time I wasn't unknowingly walking into a relationship with a guy going through a divorce (my last ex wasn't very straightforward with me). We are both independent people and not particularly needy so Tuesday and Wednesday went by with no word. My day off on Thursday came and around 2 pm I managed to get out a couple messages guessing at which Barndominium by my work he is currently remodeling, it was my homework to figure it out since he seemed sure it is on my route to work. Then I rembered he had asked for a cute picture I had of me with my horse, nothing flashy, just a cute pic so I sent that. The day goes by, I get busy helping my brother haul his camper with my truck, my brother is teasing me and I inform him that the guy agreed to go on a double date for Friday night with him(my brother) and his wife to a local haunted attraction with live music. The night goes by, no reply, morning comes and I see nothing still so I drive to work and decide to send him a message inquiring about our plans. My shift was starting at 8 so I figured this was enough time to get some response. Instead of wording it as a double date I reminded him that I'm going with my brother and his wife to it, asked if he could let me know if he's coming by 6... the end of my shift. 
Now I don't look at my phone a lot at work but just as my radio ear piece was notifying us of a customer coming from windows I recognized his form but didn't look straight at him and was immediately with another gentleman that needed my assistance. He was speaking with the other manager, my anxiety was a bit high where i felt my hands shake...  my last relationship was 7 years so feeling this vulnerable didn't feel good. I dove right back into my work and never looked up as at this point I was feeling a bit like he was ghosting me and lost interest. Just felt like too soon to be seeing him and I had not been at work for an hour yet. Not until much later did I see that I had unread messages so when I attempted to grab lunch at 2:30 I found a message from him at 8:16 am saying he is 'leaving town around 3 to pick up equipment he needs for Monday.' I simply replied, 'k'. Now we are heading into another week, no reply to any of my other messages, I'm working the whole weekend with thankfully Monday off.... running 7:30am-8pm on Sunday so I'll be spent.  But I'm just confused and it isn't like I won't see him because he is a customer at my desk. It's been a while since I've really put myself out there. Like maybe 10 years at this point since I wasn't even looking for a relationship when I met my ex. Now here I am, going from having these great times to being in this awkward situation with seeing him at work after realizing he seems to have lost interest suddenly and cancelled on me.. and I get the feeling he forgot we had a date that night or just didn't care. I don't need an explanation and I have avoided these situations easily at my last location but when he asked me out I didn't realize he was a local contractor rebuilding himself in these parts, I didnt recognizehis face. He could have been a weekend warrior just doing some side projects but instead... I foolishly let myself get into this mess.  I certainly don't want issues at work or to be given some explanation while there. Just not sure how I can keep this from becoming a problem. I am just not sure how I can keep things casual and if he's looking for an end, to give him an end where we can just both continue on like nothing happened. I just really don't understand how we went from the conversations on the couch, the great night we both enjoyed to him going on silent mode. How would any of you handle this? I'm not interested in a confrontation, most definitely not at work.",1,1728203821.0,dating_advice,3,0.66,False

In addition, I play some games such as: God Of War 5, Genshin Impact, Heroes Of The Storm, Cities Skyline, GTA V,.. Maybe will try other recent games like Black Myth Wukong..

Currently I am using Dell G7 7588 laptop (i7 8750h, GTX 1060 MaxQ, Ram 32GB 2666mhz, SSD 2TB), use it regularly (\~12h/day) and always plug it into the power outlet, connect the laptop to a 32inch 2K external screen with the keyboard and mouse also connected externally, I have used it for more than 5 years, it still runs well and has no problems, but because the task increasingly requires high performance, I want to replace it with another powerful and stable laptop moreover, to meet the need for continuous work like the G7 laptop that I have used continuously for the past 5 years.

I also often bring my laptop to a coffee shop to change the space, find new inspiration to work.

I have consulted many review videos through channels such as: Jarrod'sTech, Mash IT, GizmoSlipTech, Hardware Canucks, ShortCircuit, Lucas Ishii, Adrenaline... But still can't decide because there are 2 options below:



**Alienware M16 R2 (Price: $2,224):**

- CPU: Core Ultra 9 185H

- VGA: RTX 4070 8GB GDDR6

- Ram: 32GB 5600MHZ

- SSD: 1 TB

- Display: 16‚Ä≥ QHD+ (2560\*1600) 240Hz, 3ms, ComfortView Plus, NVIDIA G-SYNC + DDS, 100% sRGB

*Advantages:*

+ Compact machine weighs about 2.4kg and total weight is about 3.1kg (+charger)

+ Long battery life

+ Performance remains stable when unplugged

+ Has NPU

+ Runs stably for a long time without throttling

*Disadvantages:*

- VGA performance is almost 2 times lower than 4090.



**Alienware M16 R1 (Price: $2,766):**

- CPU: i9 13900HX

- VGA: RTX 4090 16GB GDDR6

- Ram: 32GB 5200MHZ

- SSD: 1 TB

- Display: 16‚Ä≥ QHD+ (2560\*1600) 240Hz, 3ms, ComfortView Plus, NVIDIA G-SYNC + DDS, 100% DCI-P3

*Advantages:*

*Disadvantages:*

- Large and heavy power supply (1.4kg)

- The machine weighs about 3.25kg and the total weight is about 4.65kg (+charger)

- High throttling ability

- High temperature and noise



The price difference between the 2 laptops is $542.

The pros and cons that I have provided may be wrong, please give me your comments and advice on which laptop I should choose to meet my needs: durable, stable, continuous use, continuous charging, good use for the next 4-5 years. 

(I also read about the Intel 13th and 14th generation CPU issue but it probably doesn't affect the HX series on laptops)



If you have owned one of the two laptops above for a long time, please let me know your performance, stability, and satisfaction after using it!

1fxbwk9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxbwk9,China Open Review!,"Now that China's biggest tournament is almost over, I'd like to share a fan perspective of the event having attended 8 days.

Location: 8/10
The tournament is in Beijing's Olympic park, served with a subway connection and plenty of major highways. There was parking and double overflow parking with shuttle buses to transport fans. The taxi dropoff was right next to the main gate and there was plenty of traffic police to keep everyone moving.

Food and Beverages:¬†7/10
The lineup for food and beverages was diverse and supply was plenty. Prices ranged from 60 RMB (8 USD) for boxed meals with sides and drinks to 400 RMB (55 USD) for top-end restaurant food. There was only one coffee vendor and waits got up to three hours for a single cup during the busiest times. The quality of the food was decent and there were plenty of special promos for tennis-related meals.

Fan Engagement:¬†7/10
The tournament had fun activities for fans but the amount of people there meant they ended up always crowded. I got roped into playing pickleball with some friends sponsored by the Chinese Tennis Association who were also running mini tennis introductions. The official media crew interviewed me three (!) times for separate videos on separate days which was fun. The fan zone was good and there was a large projector screen showing centre court for those without tickets. There was also an autograph signing space for players coming off the practice courts.

Player Lineup:¬†9/10
The lineup at the China Open is only rivalled by Grand Slams. This meant that almost all of the tennis on the outer courts was top-level and left everyone excited to watch. On a side note, it's always great watching the juniors and their level scares me.

Ticket Pricing:¬†10/10
For the quality of tennis, the ticket pricing was outstanding. No complaints. The prices for diamond court are for the nosebleed seats which I thought had an excellent view (pictured above), the price for front row, padded seats is roughly X4 more.

Ground pass (all but the main two stadiums):¬†50 RMB (7.80 USD)
Lotus Stadium (Includes all outer courts):¬†100 RMB (14.25 USD)
Diamond Court (Pre semifinals):¬†280 RMB (40 USD)
Diamond Court (Semifinals):¬†380 RMB (54.14 USD)
Diamond Court (Men's Final):¬†580 RMB (82.64 USD)
Diamond Court (Women's Final):¬†480 RMB (68.39 USD)
VIP/Hospitality Package (Full Day):¬†4080 RMB (581 USD)

Atmosphere and Crowd:¬†7/10
Anyone following on social media would have seen that centre court was empty for day sessions during the start of the tournament. The attendance of course picked up as the tournament progressed and every night session since Monday has been full. Chinese fans are intense and there was plenty of hype for all the stars. Behaviour was generally good but Muchova was copping plenty of trash last night and some fans started clapping after each first fault.

Overall, this was an excellent tournament that was weel organised and has very fairly priced tickets for what will always be a stacked field in each of the tournaments. Any questions please ask away!",20,1728203280.0,tennis,2,0.92,False

I know govt officers who work hard for 8 hours and sometimes more. If they say that its too much, its destroying their mental peace and health, we are OK with reducing it to 6?

Then there is the variation in individuals. There are people who get stressed out with 6 hours of work, and there are those who embrace 12, and many in between the two.

What about policemen? Absolutely stop them from working more than 8 hours? They are dealing with crimes and law and order, it makes sense to not stress them out right? Right now, we know many of them work 12 and 14 hours. We can stop that, and hire more cops? Does govt have the money to pay their salaries?

What is the way to identify when something is too much?

A few nights ago, I spoke to a guy in a group setting under one of the societies events. It was nothing deep but I think it was his first time speaking to a hijabi about religion and life in general, and we click I guess, he was funny, genuine and ambitious. Many qualities I want for my future husband. He was really interested in Islam and the concept of Hijab. But because he wasn't a Muslim, I thought it would be impossible anyway so I patted myself and walked away. But then yesterday, he texted me randomly to meet up for a coffee and I don't know what dawned on me but I actually said yes at first. And after that, I went into this spiral of regret+dilemma. See the thing is, I am known amongst my friends as one of the most anti-dating girl ever. I lack knowledge (so much to learn) and I appear very outspoken and cheerful but my principles is I only wanna get to know someone to marry so if a Muslim guy had asked me something like that, I wouldn't even hesitate to decline within seconds (because I think I am not ready yet). I have never dated, let alone be with a guy one-on-one, I want my future husband to approach me properly and I want to give him a proper answer as well, not just *""we'll see how the relationship goes""*.  But this guy *almost* had me compromising that long-held principle before I eventually texted him an hour later saying I had stuff to do. Prior to that, my mind was even doing mental gymnastics to justify why it was okay to go like, *""he doesn't see me that way, it's just a friendly chat""* and *""Maybe I can hand him my extra Qur'an""*, if I heard my friends saying that, I would have slapped them. After calling my beloved brother for a reality check, he kindly advice me what my options were, either: bring a friend with me OR don't go. Embarrassed to let my friends see this side of me, I decided not to go.  Worse is, a part of me wished he was a Muslim (I would still have to say no but at least we might have a chance later) but I know by rejecting this guy's advances now, he would be gone.  

This was really a test, and I am humbled by how hard it was for me despite being so firm about it before. I guess, if he's good for me, Allah would bring him closer and soften his heart to do it the right way and if not, then that's that. Some of you may not think this was a big deal since nothing actually really happened but I knew I would be more lenient as time goes by and I don't want to cheat the experience (dating and chatting etc) before meeting my future husband, I want to save my heart and experience for the man that's fated to me. I am grateful that Allah helped me put doubt and discomfort into the idea of going, so what if he's gone? I am still young, energetic and have so much to learn about my religion. InshaAllah pray that I meet a patient, gentleman, ambitious and romantic husband that completes me. ",34,1728202600.0,MuslimLounge,9,0.95,False

We recently met again at a friend in common‚Äôs party, talked for a little while, exchanged numbers and that was it.

About two weeks ago, he texted to ask me if I‚Äôd like to go out and catch up. I said, yes, absolutely, and we‚Äôre going out for a coffee on Monday.

Now, I know for a fact he‚Äôs gay, but he‚Äôs also religious and, as far as I know, still in the closet. While we were texting, he mentioned something about wanting to live his life and do the things that he‚Äôs missed out on because he‚Äôs leaving religion. Cool.

But then, two nights ago, while we were talking about the plans for Monday, he randomly told me he was in bed already and sent me a shirtless pic, in bed. And now today, we had to change our plans and we‚Äôre going somewhere else for coffee, and at the end of the conversation he texted: ‚ÄúI like the idea of having coffee with you. And whatever else happens :)‚Äù.

He‚Äôs clearly flirting with me, I think. He‚Äôs driving 3 hours to meet me here. I‚Äôm super stoked, honestly. But I‚Äôm not the most experienced guy ever when it comes to this kinda thing, so I want to invite him to my house, but I‚Äôm not sure how? Like, I was thinking of telling him that I have a sofa bed if he doesn‚Äôt want to make the 3 hour drive back, but I feel like that‚Äôs the opposite of letting him know I‚Äôm down to do something. At the same time I don‚Äôt wanna seem desperate and straight out ask him if he wants to spend the night with me.

1fxbq0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxbq0l,My Toughbuilt Mini-Kitchen,"Howdy all.  I wanted to share my weekend project of building the mini camp kitchen of my dreams.  For a little background I‚Äôm a degenerate with the financial literacy of gambling addict and long term planning skills of a goldfish, so I live in an apartment in LA and daily my overland rig, a soft top wrangler 4 door. 

I can‚Äôt store anything in my Jeep or my local homeless community will help themselves to it, so I‚Äôve been lugging around a duffle bag with my camp kitchen goods for the last few years.   But this weekend that all changed forever.  I bought the TB small organizer, the bamboo work top, the roll bar attachment and an LED strip light and had some fun.

The finished product is a fully organized kitchen that can be carried with one hand. The strip lights give it a nice glow when it‚Äôs closed and illuminate the interior perfectly for packing and unpacking.  The lights are attached to the underside of the worktop and I drilled out a small hole to pass the power chord out from underneath the cutting board.  This allows me to power the lights from a small craftsman inverter than runs off my power tool batteries.  I can run two lights simultaneously off one battery so I do have a few options for additional lighting as well.

The organizer can carry everything you see unpacked on the table the exception of the roll of paper towels.  In one case I‚Äôve got a small cast iron pan, camp stove with pot and cup, a French press with 4 bags of oatmeal inside, two craftsman batteries and the inverter, two full sets of silverware, a spatula, lighter, the roll bar attachment, a thermos with tinfoil and sandwhich bags inside, a small selection of spices, sugar, two bottles of hot sauces  one bbq sauce and a honey mussy, ten packets of instant coffee, once bag of ground coffee, a bottle of water, charging chords for an iPhone or usb, some carabiners, and flat head screw driver for releasing the cutting board.  

So I now have a grab ‚Äòn go kitchen for camping that makes it so much easier to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to getting out of the house.  Years ago I was watching a video of two guys that play guitar and they both shared a sentiment that guitarists trying to get better should eliminate any barrier that prevents them from playing.  In their case this was regarding guitar pedals and they were advocating that players build a formal board that‚Äôs organized and plug and play because it would means less time setting up, more time playing, and less reason to decide you just can‚Äôt be bothered to go through all that fuss to play.  Thats the same for camping and really many of our hobbies as adults.  The planning, the setup, the hassle can cause us to give up and not go.  So my goal with this kitchen is to put myself in a place where it‚Äôs just seconds for me to be ready to take off for the night, or to wake up early and make a coffee by the beach as the sun comes up.  

Anyway, that‚Äôs how I blew a sad and lonely Saturday night to ease my worried mind.  I‚Äôm dreaming of my next night living out of my Jeep far away from the troubles and trials of our daily existence.  I hope my post was some inspo for you to treat yourself and indulge in the healthy hobbies that make you happy while you still can.  ",3,1728202454.0,ToughBuilt,0,0.81,False
1fxbpy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1fxbpy8/ppp_per_working_hour/,PPP per working hour?,"I was looking on PPP (GDP) in the EU and Ireland came up second. I was suspicious about it because I don't think the average Irish have higher purchasing power than a Swiss person. 

The results are probably skewed because Ireland is tax haven for big corporations which inflates the GDP.

I'm looking for more true PPP, maybe by working hour? For example how many cups of coffee can the median working hour buy. Or use some other globalized known product. 

Maybe to use the big mac index with the median salary in the country? I just don't think PPP GDP really shows what is the purchasing power in the country. ",2,1728202444.0,AskEconomics,1,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

What can be the cause of this, the varicocele itself before the surgery was quite big, but now if im not wrong it seems even bigger.Though pain mainly comes from the incision site, no rough pain from testicle or veins.Can the reason for the enlargement be blood clots ?

Another thing - i can see 2-3 really small dark blue patches(2mm) on top of my penis where it connects to the groin area.

Also, can i already drink coffee ?(4 days have passed since the surgery)
