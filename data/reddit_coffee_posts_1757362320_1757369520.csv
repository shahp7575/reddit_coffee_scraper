I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing the heaviness from my eyes before shuffling toward the bathroom. Cold water splashed over my face, sharp and bracing, chasing away the last traces of fatigue. I gazed at my reflection In the mirror, a faint shadow of stubble crept along my jaw. Brown eyes half-lidded, and my blonde hair stood in electrified disarray.

After scarfing down a banana for breakfast, my phone buzzed. Right on time, I thought, pressing it to my ear.

“Hey, sleepyhead,” came a familiar singsong voice, dripping with sarcasm. “I’m outside. You ready to go?”

“Yeah, just about,” I replied, my voice still heavy with sleep. “Just need to grab my bag—I’ll be down in five.”

“No problem, bud,” the voice shot back, teasing as always.

I couldn’t help but crack a smile as I hung up. I grabbed my hiking bag, gave it a quick once-over to make sure nothing was missing, then slung it on my back, locked the door, and headed outside.

James was waiting on the curb in his Tacoma. As I approached the truck, I noticed an open can of Monster Energy sitting in the cupholder. Knowing him, he’d already drained half of it.

“Hey there young man,” James called with a wicked grin as I got closer. “How much do you charge for an hour?”

After tossing my bag in the back and climbing into the passenger seat, I smirked and shot back, “Fuck off.”

Satisfied, we began the long four-hour drive to the Sunshine Coast Trail.

I was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. The Pacific Northwest has always been my home—a place of towering evergreens, mist curling through the valleys, and the kind of crisp, resin-scented air that clears your lungs with every breath. For as long as I can remember, those deep woodland greens have given me comfort.

It wasn’t until a few years ago, though, that I began to explore the land more deliberately. Hiking started small: modest 6 km (3.7 mile) trails like Jugg Island and Buzzsaw Falls, the kind you can finish in a morning and still be home in time for lunch. Gradually, my ambitions stretched farther. I found myself drawn to more demanding treks—like Black Tusk, with its jagged silhouette stabbing the skyline, one of the first that truly tested me.

Each year, I raised the stakes a little higher. Each trail left me hungry for the next. This trip was no exception. We had planned it months in advance.

The longest trail in Canada, the Sunshine Coast Trail stretches a whopping 180 km (112 miles), winding through a remarkable variety of landscapes—ancient rainforests thick with moss, rugged alpine ridges, quiet coastlines, and hushed streams tucked into shadowed valleys. What sets this trail apart is its hut-to-hut system. Scattered along the route are roughly sixteen backcountry huts, each offering weary hikers a roof and a place to rest before continuing their journey. It was the beginning of September, where the weather was just starting to cool, and summer relented to fall.

The goal was to complete the hike in ten days. It should have gone off without a hitch—*should have been* the key word.

The Tacoma rumbled onto the highway, its tires drumming a steady rhythm against the asphalt. Morning light spilled through the windshield in golden bands, flickering as we passed stands of evergreens. The city fell away behind us, its concrete and noise replaced by winding roads, mist-hung valleys, and the occasional glimpse of ocean winking silver through the trees.

We rolled the windows down, letting the air rush in—cool and damp, carrying the faint tang of salt from the coast. James nursed his drink, one hand on the wheel, while I leaned back against the seat, letting the hum of the engine and the blur of passing scenery pull me into a quiet calm. The farther we drove, the more the world seemed to loosen its grip: no emails, no buzzing phones, no deadlines. Just the open road and the promise of what lay ahead.

“How’s Kelly?” I asked after a few moments of comfortable silence.

“She’s great!” James lit up instantly, his voice warm and unguarded. “We’re still figuring out when to hold the wedding. And she’s only a year away from finishing her master’s in engineering. I swear, man, she’s the smartest person on the planet.”

I could hear the pride in his voice, and I was genuinely happy for him. Still, a flicker of envy stirred in my chest. He was engaged; I was still single. He owned his apartment, I rented mine.

I know they say comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn’t help myself. James had always seemed a step ahead. In the last couple of years, I could feel him drifting further from me, which is part of why I leapt at the chance to do this long-ass hike together.

He immigrated to BC from Newfoundland when he was seven. On his first day of elementary school, I saw him sitting alone, absorbed in a set of plastic dinosaurs. I walked over, asked if the T-Rex could beat the Triceratops, and just like that, we hit it off. Nearly twenty years later, we’re still best friends.

At 6’5 and nearly 230 pounds, James was hard to miss. A true Newfoundlander through and through, with thick brown hair covering most of his body and a beard that seemed to grow faster than he could shave, he looked less like a man and more like some wild thing dragged in from the woods. Though he was on the bigger side, a near decade of playing rugby ensured his cardio was on par, if not better, then mine.

The rest of the drive passed in an easy blur. James and I talked about everything and nothing—the newest video games, ridiculous animal facts, half-baked political takes. The conversation wandered without direction, the way it always did, but that was the comfort of it. With James, nothing was ever off the table.

About an hour from the trailhead, we rolled into a lonely gas station off the highway. The neon sign buzzed faintly in the morning haze, promising fuel, coffee, and sugar in equal measure.

“Want anything?” I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt.

“Another Monster and some beef jerky would be great,” James said.

I snorted. “With a diet like yours, how are you still alive?”

He didn’t even blink. “Spite.”

I shook my head and pushed open the door while James stayed behind to fill up the truck. Inside, the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and cleaning solution. I grabbed a Monster, jerky, a couple protein bars, candy, and two muffins, piling them into my arms before dropping everything onto the counter.

The cashier looked ancient, her face a map of deep lines, her thinning gray hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head. She moved slowly, methodically, scanning each item one at a time. While she worked, I let my eyes wander. Behind her, tacked to the wall, was a cluttered community board, its surface crowded with fading flyers and curling papers. One of them caught my eye—a missing-person poster, tacked crookedly to the corkboard. Unlike the faded garage-sale ads and yellowing church notices, this one looked fresh, the paper still crisp, the ink dark. Two faces stared back at me.

 One was a man, he looked to be in his early fifties, shaggy black hair streaked with gray and stuffed beneath a baseball cap. The photo had been snapped mid-laugh, probably at some game—his wide grin a frozen moment of joy.

Beside him was a younger boy, maybe eighteen. His photo seemed more candid, taken at a beach. Shirtless, slightly pudgy, his ghost-pale skin stood out against the sunlit backdrop, a sharp contrast to his shoulder-length black hair that clung damply to his neck. His eyes were wide, unguarded, brimming with an innocence that felt almost out of place against the somber context of the poster. There was something unfinished in his gaze, like the promise of a life that had barely begun.

Beneath their photos, bold block letters read:

**MISSING**  
Ronald Varg (52) and son, Steven Varg (18).  
Last seen: July, traveling Sunshine Coast trail  
If you have any information, please contact—

“Such a shame,” came a withered feminine voice, jolting me out of my thoughts.

I looked up. The cashier had paused mid-scan, her wrinkled hands hovering over the register. “They came in here a couple months ago,” she said, shaking her head slowly. “Seemed like such nice folks. Damn shame about that bear attack.”

My eyes narrowed, refocusing on her. “You think a bear got them?”

“That’s what they’re saying.” She leaned forward slightly, as if letting me in on a secret. “They found their camp about three-quarters of the way up the trail. Tent ripped wide open—huge hole in the side. Bits of bone, clothing, dried blood… scattered all over the place, but no bodies.”

There was a strange lilt to her tone, a spark of excitement threading through the horror. Out here, I guessed, stories like this were currency. Company was rare, and tragedy—even second-hand—was something to talk about.

She straightened up, shaking her head again. “If it wasn’t a bear,” she said, her voice trailing off into something almost gleeful, “then I don’t know what could’ve done that kind of damage.”

“I guess I’ll keep my bear spray close by at all times,” I said with a half-hearted chuckle, eager to steer us away from the topic.

The old woman gave me a knowing nod, her expression unreadable. She slid the last muffin across the scanner, the machine beeping sharply in the quiet store. “That’ll be twenty-six seventy-eight,” she said.

I pulled a couple crumpled bills from my wallet, trading it for a thin paper bag that sagged under the weight of caffeine and sugar. The cashier handed me my change with papery fingers, her eyes lingering on me just a moment too long, as if she wanted to say more but thought better of it.

“Have a good hike,” she finally said, the words carrying a weight that felt more like warning than farewell.

As I stepped back into the morning light, James was just sliding the fuel hose into its holster. He noticed me coming and lifted his brows in a quick, wordless greeting.

“Got everything?” he asked once I tossed the bag of food onto the back seat.

“Yeah,” I said, shutting the door. Then, after a pause: “Oh, by the way… we have bear spray, right?”

James gave me a look—head tilted, brow furrowed, like he was trying to figure out if I was joking. We climbed into the truck.

“Of course. Picked up a brand new can a couple weeks ago,” he said. “Why?”

I told him about the cashier, the missing persons poster, and her story of the shredded campsite halfway up the trail. As I spoke, James kept his eyes on the road, his usual smirk fading into a more thoughtful line.

When I finished, he let out a long breath through his nose, then glanced at me, one hand tightening slightly on the wheel. “Sounds like a hell of a way to go, doesn’t it?”

The rest of the drive we tried to outdo each other with tales of the worst ways to die—being eaten alive by swarms of insects, flayed and left in the desert, boiled alive in some ancient bronze cauldron. Each story got darker, more grotesque, but we laughed anyway, the way people laugh when they know the subject should be off-limits. The truck groaned as James threw it into park. We had made it.

James hopped out of the truck and began rummaging through his bag.  
“Two seconds, buddy,” he muttered, digging around with the focus of a man who had buried treasure in there. “Promised I’d give the old battleaxe a call when we got to the trailhead.”

With a small grunt of triumph, he pulled out a satellite phone. It wasn’t anything fancy—scuffed casing, bulky antenna, the kind of tech built for utility, not looks. He began thumbing the buttons before stepping a few paces away for reception.

James stepped a few paces away, holding the bulky satellite phone like it was some sacred relic. He jabbed at a few buttons, waited, then spoke, his voice low and clipped so I couldn’t make out every word.

“What are you wearing?” he growled, a shit eating grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yup, all good so far, no issues. Yep… yep, we’ve got the food, the gear… everything’s set.” He paused, listening, then nodded. “Don’t worry babe, we’ll check in every couple day. Love you too.”

He ended the call, sliding the phone back into his bag with a satisfied nod.

I watched him, noting the faint tension in his shoulders as he exhaled. It was the kind of precaution that reminded me we weren’t just heading into a normal hike. Out here, the wilderness had its own rules. Then we set off.

When planning a long, multi-day hike, every ounce counts. Too much weight on your back and every step becomes a slog. James and I had tried to plan for everything, weighing each item against its necessity.

My pack was a carefully curated collection of essentials: food—mostly canned, dried, smoked, or bagged goods like trail mix and candy—water bottles, a couple changes of clothes, lightweight tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, first aid kit, small hatchet, can opener, and bug spray, and a water filter bladder.

It was a simple yet brilliant design: fill the bladder with water, hang it from a tree, connect the tube to your bottle, and in ten or fifteen minutes, you had clean, safe drinking water. The thing was almost magical in its simplicity, a little slice of civilization in the middle of the wild.

James’s pack told a different story. Where mine was organized and precise, his seemed to reflect his personality: big, bulky, a little chaotic, but somehow perfectly functional. He had his own food stash—energy bars, beef jerky, a half-empty bag of chips he insisted “was essential”—plus a tangle of ropes, a small cooking skillet, and a sleeping bag stuffed into a compression sack that looked like it had seen better days.

Despite the differences, it worked. Our packs balanced out in weight, and more importantly, they reflected the balance between us—my meticulous caution, his laid-back confidence.

Together, we were ready to take on the trail. After about an hour of walking, we arrived at Sarah Point Shack, the first of the shelters offered along the route. Perched atop a rocky ridge, it overlooked the Salish Sea, the water stretching out in endless silver-blue waves. I could already imagine the sunset painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson, though that moment was still hours away.

The shack itself was small but sturdy—weathered wood, a tin roof, and a simple porch that jutted over the cliff’s edge. It was quiet here, almost reverent, the kind of silence that made you hyper-aware of every creak in the floorboards and whisper of the wind through the pines.

James set down his pack with a grunt and stretched his arms above his head. “Not a bad spot for a first stop,” he said, scanning the horizon with a grin. We stopped for a quick sip from our water bottles, the forest quiet around us. That’s when I noticed James’s eyes light up.

“Oh! I completely forgot to show you!” he said, nearly bouncing with excitement. He dove back into his bag like a kid on Christmas morning and pulled out a flare gun.

“Where the hell did you get that?” I asked, a wide grin spreading across my face.

“Cabela’s,” he said, almost shyly, as if admitting it was a guilty pleasure.

The flare gun was a striking sight: a bright blood-red barrel, a warm brown stock, and a bright shade of yellow on the hammer.

James held it carefully in both hands, his grin never fading. “It’s already loaded,” he explained, as if reading my mind. “For emergencies.”

“That safe?” I asked, one eyebrow arched. “What if it goes off in your bag?”

James shrugged casually. “Then I’ll probably burst into flames,” he said, deadpan.

I stared at him for a moment, half horrified, half amused. “Alrighty then,” I muttered, shaking my head with a grin.

He just laughed, tucking the flare gun back into his pack like it was the most normal thing in the world. The forest around us remained quiet, oblivious to us. We set off down the trail once more. It was nearly 10am, and we wanted to cover a good distance before nightfall. Most of the time, we walked in silence, letting the forest speak for itself.

Birdsong drifted down from high in the canopy, bright and melodic, though the dense mossy trees often hid the singers from viewic, though the moss-draped trees often hid the singers from sight. Sunlight filtered through the leaves in shifting patterns, warming patches of the trail while leaving others in cool shadow. We lost the path more than once—the trailhead wasn’t always clear—and had to double back in search of it. The thick, trees made navigation difficult, every direction looking much the same. I could imagine a less experienced hiker getting turned around in here. The earthy scent of damp soil and pine filled the air, grounding us in the rhythm of the hike. Around 1 p.m., we passed Bliss Portage Hut, eight kilometers behind us, and by 4 p.m., we had reached Manzanita Bluff, another eight kilometers further. We were making solid progress, the miles accumulating steadily beneath our boots.

Just after 6 p.m., as darkness began to settle over the forest, we decided it was time to make camp for the night. Although it had rained only a few days before, a fire ban was still in effect, so we set up our tents quietly, the wet earth soft beneath our feet.

Dinner was simple—muffins and cold chili—but it filled the void. My body was completely drained, every muscle aching, and I used a splash of water to rinse the sweat from my forehead. The cool trickle was a small mercy against the heat that still clung to me from the day’s climb. Around us, the forest grew hushed as the last light thinned, shadows stretching long between the trees. Night was coming quickly, and tomorrow’s trail would demand every ounce of strength we could gather.

We passed the time with cards under the soft glow of James’s electric lantern. After he threw a half-serious fit about losing every round, we finally surrendered the game and called it a night.

Outside, the moon hung in its third quarter—a perfect balance of light and shadow. Its pale silver glow spilled across the forest, tracing the canopy in delicate highlights while the valleys below sank into darkness. It looked serene, like the skys own lantern suspended in the vast black, steady and unhurried. The stars around it glittered brighter in the absence of its full light, together casting the night in quiet, tender beauty—half moonlight, half mystery.

With groggy goodnights, we slipped into our tents, the forest breathing softly around us.

I lay there in the dark for a while, the fabric of the tent pressing softly against me, my thoughts drifting to the two missing hikers from the poster. Their faces, frozen in photographs, mingled with the quiet sounds of the forest outside—rustling leaves, the occasional distant call of an owl.

I clutched my hatchet tightly, feeling its familiar weight against my side, a small comfort in the vast unknown around us. Slowly, the exhaustion of the day tugged at my consciousness, and I drifted off to sleep, the shadow of unease lingering just at the edge of my dreams. Hours passed, and I slept fitfully, half in dreams, half in the quiet awareness of the forest around me. Then I woke.

At first, it was just a faint rustling, almost like the wind brushing against the tent, but it carried a rhythm that didn’t belong to the trees. A pause. A shuffle. Another pause. My heart rate quickened, and I clutched my hatchet tighter, every nerve alert.

Outside, shadows shifted across the tent walls. A low, almost imperceptible snap of a twig made me freeze. I strained my ears, trying to tell if it was an animal—or something else. The forest, which had seemed peaceful and welcoming by day, now felt vast and unknowable, every sound amplified in the darkness.

I told myself it was nothing—a raccoon, a deer, maybe even my imagination—but a small, persistent chill threaded down my spine. Sleep didn’t come easily again that night, and the memory of the missing hikers haunted the edges of my mind, mingling with every creak and whisper of the forest. After wheat seemed like an eternity of sitting there, straining my senses, I herd nothing. Eventually I succumbed to exhaustion and lapsed into blissful unconsciousness.

I awoke just after sunrise and stepped out of my tent, greeted by the sight of James relieving himself onto a nearby bush.

“How’d you sleep?” he asked, craning his neck toward me, urine still streaming between his legs.

“Alright,” I replied, my body still heavy with sleep. I stretched my arms and back, muscles aching from the day before. “Did you hear anything last night?”

James shook his head. “Nothing at all,” he said, finally finishing and zipping up. Then, with his usual grin, he added, “Let’s grab some grub, then hit the trail.”

The next couple of days on the trail passed in a steady, almost meditative rhythm. Step after step, the forest unfolded around us—towering evergreens dusted with moss, ferns brushing against our legs, sunlight filtering through the canopy in shifting patterns. We walked, talked, and paused at intervals to drink and snack, letting the world slow down to the pace of our boots on the trail.

Each day we covered roughly thirty kilometres, our legs aching but our spirits buoyed by the sheer beauty around us. Streams tumbled across the path, their water crystal clear, and we often stopped to fill the water filter, then fill the bottles. Birds called from hidden perches, their songs punctuating the quiet of the forest, while distant waterfalls added a soft, constant hum to the background.

Despite the physical toll, the days felt almost peaceful, the kind of immersion that only long hikes through untouched wilderness can bring. Conversation drifted freely—jokes, memories, speculations about the trail, and plans for the nights ahead.

By the end of the third day, our progress had brought us to Elk Lake Hut. Nestled beside the still, reflective waters of the lake, the hut looked even smaller and more inviting after the long hours of walking. The lake mirrored the surrounding peaks and trees, creating a perfect, almost surreal frame around the simple wooden structure.

We dropped our packs with a collective sigh of relief, the tension of the trail momentarily slipping from our shoulders. For a moment, all that existed was the gentle lapping of the water, the croaking of frogs, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the quiet satisfaction of making it this far. Elk Lake Hut would be our home for the night, a small sanctuary in the heart of the wilderness before we pushed onward.

The inside it was simple, but it carried the kind of rugged charm that only backcountry shelters have. The walls were raw timber, their knots and grains catching the light like scars in old skin. In the center, a small wood-burning stove squatted on a metal plate, its surface blackened from years of use. A half-empty box of matches and a bent fire poker lay on top. Along two walls were wooden bunks, one next to the other. Each was fitted with a thin foam pad, the kind that made sleep possible but never luxurious. Carved initials, dates, and little messages were scrawled into the wood next to the beds—testaments to the people who had passed through before. *“2017 – Mike was here”* sat beside *“Cold as hell but worth it”*, and beneath that, a crudely drawn moose.

The windows were streaked with dirt and condensation, but through it you could catch the glimmer of water, still and dark under the fading light.

“Not bad, not bad,” I muttered, more to myself than to James, running my hand along the rough timber wall. “Why don’t we start a fire in the stove and have ourselves a cooked meal?”

“Sounds good to me,” James replied without hesitation, his stomach giving a dramatic growl at the mention of food. He smirked, patting his gut. “If you wanna chop up some wood, I’ll cook it up. First, though, I gotta call my girl.”

I wandered toward the treeline, scanning for dry sticks, while James ambled down toward a small dock that jutted out over the pond. The dock was old—boards gray and splintering, nailed together more with stubbornness than integrity. I watched him idly from the corner of my eye as I hacked at a branch, the sharp crack of wood splitting filling the still air. James pressed the phone to his ear and started pacing the dock, muttering something under his breath, probably waiting for a signal.

Then it happened. Without warning, one of the boards gave way with a sickening crack. His leg plunged straight through the rotten timber.

“Fuck!” James bellowed, lurching sideways. The satellite phone flew out of his grip, arcing just long enough for both of us to realize what was happening before it splashed into the dark water below.

“Shit!” I dropped the sticks and sprinted toward him, but James had already wrenched his leg free with a savage tug. Before I could tell him to leave it, he leapt straight into the pond after the phone.

The water came up to his chest, sending ripples racing across the surface. He froze for a second, sucking in a huge breath, then plunged his head and shoulders under. Bubbles foamed up where he disappeared.

“James!” I shouted, skidding to the pond’s edge, heart hammering.

Seconds later, he erupted from the water, gasping and sputtering, hair plastered to his face. In one dripping fist, he held the satellite phone triumphantly above his head like some absurd prize.

“Got it!” he croaked between coughs, water streaming from his beard and clothes.

“You good, man?” I asked, trying—and failing—to stifle the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

“Yeah, I’m good,” James grumbled, dragging himself out of the pond, boots squelching in the mud. He held the dripping satellite phone like it had personally betrayed him. “But I think this thing is fucked. Waste of three hundred bucks.”

“Let me handle dinner tonight,” I said, trying to soften the sting of his embarrassment. “I don’t have any rice to put it in, but I do have oatmeal. Maybe it’ll suffice?”

James barked out a laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah, maybe. Worth a shot.” He sloshed past me toward the hut, leaving a trail of muddy footprints. I clapped him on the back as he went, his wet clothes squishing with every step, and he gave me a sheepish grin before disappearing inside.

I turned back to the dock, hatchet still dangling loosely in my hand. That’s when I froze.

Across the pond, half-hidden in the trees, a figure was watching us.

It stood unnaturally still, its skin pale as bleached paper, like it hadn’t seen sunlight in years. From where I stood, the distance blurred its features into something unsettling—like a face you know is human but can’t quite recognize. My stomach tightened, a cold ripple running through me.

The figure then turned abruptly, vanishing into the dense treeline with a hurried shuffle.

I stood there for a long moment, the forest suddenly too quiet. The ripples on the pond smoothed into glass. Only the distant call of a raven broke the silence.

I got the fire going in the stove, the first lights of flame crackling to life before spreading into a steady warmth that filled the tiny shelter. James had stripped down and draped his wet clothes—pants, shirt, socks, and boots—across a chair beside the stove, Hopefully, it wouldn’t be long till the fabric dried. He sat slouched on one of the bunks, the battered satellite phone in his hands, poking at it with the kind of stubbornness only born from pure frustration.

“She’s going to be so pissed,” James muttered. “She probably thinks I was attacked by Bigfoot or something.”

“That’s a good way to go,” I teased, stirring a can of pork and beans on the stove until the edges bubbled. “Ripped apart by a mystical beast. Beats dying of old age.”

James snorted but didn’t look up. I poured a portion into a dented tin bowl and handed it to him. He accepted it with a grumble of thanks before digging in.

“Leave it in the oatmeal for a couple days, might do the trick,” I said, half-joking, half-serious, nodding toward the phone.

James gave me a sidelong glance. “Oatmeal resurrection, huh? Worth a shot.”

I cracked the stove door open, tossed another stick onto the fire, and listened to the wood snap and hiss. The hut was warm now, almost cozy, but my eyes kept flicking back toward the window—out into the darkening trees where the pale figure had been.

Later that night, after we’d eaten and James had finally given up on the phone, it lay in a baggy of oatmeal next to his cot. We lay in our bunks listening to the stove’s steady crackle. Sleep came slow.

Somewhere outside, a twig snapped.

My eyes snapped open. The sound was sharp, deliberate, too heavy for the usual night creatures.

For a long moment, nothing followed. Then came the rustle of underbrush, faint but deliberate, circling the hut. I held my breath, straining to hear, heart thumping so loud I swore it would wake James. A low creak groaned against the outer wall, like something brushing past the logs. I lay still in my bed, still as a corpse. Eyes glued on the window on the other side of the hut.

Then slowly, impossibly, a pale face appeared at the glass.

It wasn’t sudden—it eased into view, like someone pressing forward out of the shadows. The skin was chalk white, almost glowing against the black of the forest behind it. No hair. No eyebrows. Just large sunken eyes.

It didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

It looked unreal, like something pasted onto the night itself. My body screamed to wake James, to shout, to run, but all I could do was stare. Then, slowly, the face drifted away from the window.

And did something worse.

The door rattled. Someone—*something*—was trying to get in.

That broke me. I tore free of the sleeping bag, hatchet in one hand, flashlight in the other. My voice cracked the silence: “James! Wake up!”

James jolted upright, confused, as I charged the door like a madman. I wrenched the lock free and threw it open, the beam of my flashlight cutting through the dark. James stumbled up beside me, wearing nothing but his boxers, wielding the fire poker in one hand, lantern in the other, looking like a half-asleep caveman. “Jesus, man,” he muttered, rubbing his face. “What the *fuck* are you doing?”

“The door,” I hissed, pointing at it with the hatchet. “Someone tried to open the door. I saw—” My words faltered, my chest tightening. How could I even explain what that face looked like? It didn’t feel human.

James squinted into the trees, holding up the lantern in front of him, unimpressed. “I don’t see shit. Probably a raccoon or something.”

I didn’t answer. My grip on the flashlight trembled, the circle of light jittering across the treeline.

Then, faint—so faint I almost thought I imagined it—came the sound of *something* retreating deeper into the woods. Not the four-legged scramble of an animal. Two feet, crunching over leaves.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. Every crack, every creak, every branch scratching against the hut’s walls set my nerves on edge. My eyes remained glued to the window, waiting for the visitor to return.

“Damn it!” I woke with a start. Beams of morning light were bleeding in through the windows. James sat on his bed, satellite phone in hand, frown etched across his face.

“Come on, you piece of shit, work!” he muttered, glancing in my direction.

“Oh… morning,” he added distractedly, not noticing my tension. “Sleep okay?”

I tried, and failed, to shake the last vestiges of sleep from my head. “Not really,” I admitted, rubbing my eyes.

I nodded toward the satellite phone. “Still not working, huh?”

“Nope. Might need to be put more in the oatmeal,” he muttered, glancing up at me with a hard look. “We… going to talk about last night?”

Heat rose to my face. Embarrassment hit hard, but I knew I couldn’t let it slide. If I stayed quiet, I’d look like a lunatic.

“Look, man,” I said with a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair, something I did when stressed, “I’m not crazy. I saw something.”

James stared at me skeptically, eyes locked on mine, searching for any sign that this was some elaborate prank at his expense. After a long beat, he nodded. “Okay… so what was it you saw?”

I hesitated; grateful he was at least listening. “Not exactly sure,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “But it was… skinny. Pale.”

James cracked a wicked grin. “Very original.”

“I’m serious, dude,” I snapped, irritation starting to flare.

James wiggled his fingers at me and pulled a ridiculous face. “It was Slenderman, huh?”

I threw my hands in the air. “I know how crazy it sounds—I’m not making this shit up.”

James put a finger to his ear, mimicking a microphone, and in a mock-reporter voice said, “This just in: local hikers found fucked to death by cliché monster.”

I groaned, running a hand over my face. “You *do* realize this isn’t funny, right?”

James just shrugged.

 “I’m serious, James. I saw it. It was *there*.”

James leaned back against the bunk, still smirking, but the humor in his eyes faltered slightly.

I just roll my eyes, “whatever dude, lets just get going” and began gathering up my belongings.

The next couple of kilometers were slow and exhausting. Not only was I sleep-deprived, but every few feet I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that pale figure lurking behind the trees. Each time, there was nothing—just the swaying of branches and the occasional rustle of unseen wildlife.

By the time the sun was beginning to tilt toward the horizon, around 5 p.m., we were still eight or nine kilometers shy of the next hut. My muscles ached, my pack felt heavier than ever, and yet a small sense of relief began to creep in.

Maybe I hadn’t seen anything at all. Maybe last night had been a trick of shadows and fatigue. For the first time all day, I allowed myself to relax, telling myself this

It felt like just another uneventful stretch of the trail. We set up camp and made do with a simple dinner of protein bars and ketchup chips. Later, we played cards under the weak glow of the lantern. James gloated with every win, his laughter echoing faintly in the stillness, but my mind was elsewhere.

As the shadows stretched long and thick around our small campsite, a creeping unease settled over me. The forest, which had seemed quiet and familiar all day, now felt alive with unseen eyes. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a shiver crawling up my spine. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

“Are you going to be okay?” James asked, genuine concern flickering across his face.

“Yeah… yeah, I think so,” I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed my unease.

“Well… I’m hitting the hay. If you get eaten alive by this monster, try not to scream too loud—I don’t want my beauty sleep interrupted,” he joked, lightly jabbing me in the arm.

I forced a weak smile, but my eyes drifted to the dark forest surrounding us. The shadows seemed alive, the trees shifting just enough to suggest movement. It felt like the eyes were everywhere, watching my every move, waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. My guard felt impossibly thin, and the night stretched out ahead like a living thing. I slipped into my sleeping bag, trying to convince myself I was just being paranoid. The forest outside seemed impossibly still, but every so often a branch would crack, a leaf would scrape against another, and my pulse would spike. James’ even breathing soon reminded me that he had already dozed off. I envied him, or at least the illusion of peace he seemed to have. I tried to close my eyes, to block out the feeling of eyes pressing in from the darkness.

A few sleepless hours later, the urge to piss became impossible to ignore. I tried to push it down, telling myself to wait, not wanting to step outside into the dark, watching woods. But it was a losing battle.

I muttered a curse under my breath and quietly unzipped my tent flap. Heart thudding, I peeked out, sweeping the flashlight beam across the forest. Shadows stretched and twisted, but nothing moved.

The waning gibbous moon sagged in the sky like a bruised eye, its swollen face leaking pale light across the forest. The glow wasn’t comforting—it was sickly, strained, as though the moon itself were wasting away. Shadows stretched long and crooked under its watch, twisting the trees into warped silhouettes. Every patch of silver light felt like exposure, like being dragged under its gaze, while the darkness between seemed to crawl closer, eager to swallow what the moon abandoned.

Slowly, I stepped out of the safety of my tent, every nerve on edge, and moved to relieve myself, ears straining for the slightest sound. The forest felt impossibly still, yet every instinct screamed that I wasn’t truly alone. After I finished, I turned to head back to my tent—and froze. The beam of my flashlight caught it, partially hidden behind a tree. Its bald, egg-shaped head tilted slightly, pale and wide eyed, staring straight at me.

“Fuck!” I shouted, the flashlight shaking in my hands. My grip tightened around the hatchet, every muscle coiled, ready to charge if it stepped closer. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the usual night sounds fading into an unnatural silence.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears, each heartbeat a deafening drum. The figure didn’t move—just watched, impossibly still, as if assessing whether I was a threat.

Then, a bony hand emerged from behind the tree, followed by a weak, quivering voice: “Please… I’m lost.”

If I hadn’t just peed, I probably would have soiled myself right then.

By now, James was emerging from his tent, lantern in hand, rubbing sleep from his eyes. His gaze fell on the figure, and he staggered back in terror. “Fucking hell!” he screamed. “What the fuck is that?”

“Please don’t hurt me,” the creature said, its voice fragile. “I haven’t seen another person in so long… please. I mean you no harm.”

My pulse still racing, I forced myself to take a step forward. Summoning every ounce of courage, I shouted, “Come out where we can see you!”

Ever so slowly, it emerged from behind the tree, pale features fully revealed, its movements deliberate and cautious. It looked like a walking skeleton, skin stretched taut over bone, caked in dirt and mud. Its body was completely hairless—no hair on its head, face, or body, not even eyebrows. like Cormac McCarthy’s infamous character, the Judge, if he was liberated from Auschwitz.

I noticed, uncomfortably, that it had no clothes, leaving its thin, frail form fully exposed. The sight made my stomach churn, but I forced myself to focus, trying to understand whether it truly meant any harm. “Who… who are you?” I asked, voice steadier than I felt.

It gestured to itself, long, bony fingers curling awkwardly, and rasped. “My name… is David Varg,”",1,1757369371.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1nc1fpr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nc1fpr,What other nationality do you think your country shares parallels with?,"I’m from Brazil, and I just watched a documentary about the history of the United States. I was really surprised at how many parallels exist between Brazil and the U.S., especially when it comes to the era of slavery.

Both countries were built on massive waves of immigration (European, African, and later others), both had slavery as a central part of their economies for centuries, and both were among the last Western nations to abolish it (the U.S. in 1865 and Brazil in 1888, actually the very last in the Americas). Even after abolition, both nations struggled, and still struggle, with deep racial inequalities that affect politics, culture, and social dynamics.

Another interesting parallel is the amount of revolts and internal conflicts in both countries. Brazil had events like the Malê Revolt (1835), the Cabanagem (1835–1840), and the Canudos War (1896–1897), while the U.S. had the Civil War (1861–1865), slave rebellions like Nat Turner’s (1831), and later civil rights struggles. In both cases, these uprisings showed how marginalized groups resisted oppression and how the state often responded with violence.

There’s also a regional parallel worth mentioning. In Brazil, the Northeast was historically richer during the colonial period due to sugar and other resources, but over time, the Southeast and South became more industrialized and economically dominant. Similarly, in the U.S., the South was economically dominant in agriculture and slavery, but the North later became the industrial and economic powerhouse, creating social and political tensions that shaped the country.

Beyond that, both countries share similarities in being continental-sized nations, with strong regional differences, a history of frontier expansion, and an economy tied for a long time to resource exploitation (cotton, sugar, coffee, mining, etc.).

So it made me think

1nc1erx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nc1erx/just_my_opinion_on_daddygotcoffee/,Just my opinion on DADDYGOTCOFFEE,"The coffee community thrives on authenticity, passion, and shared knowledge, but Justin Piercy, known as @daddygotcoffee, often falls short of these ideals, raising questions about his contributions and motives. While he’s built a following of nearly 30,000 on Instagram with his “tired dad” persona and daily coffee reels, a closer look suggests his platform prioritizes monetization over meaningful engagement, offering little in the way of genuine insight and instead leveraging his audience for profit.
One of the primary criticisms of @daddygotcoffee is the lack of depth in his content. His videos and posts focus heavily on basic brewing tips and gear reviews, often presented in a casual, relatable style. However, these offerings rarely go beyond surface-level advice, catering to beginners without pushing the boundaries of coffee knowledge. For a community that values the nuances of specialty coffee—such as bean origin, roast profiles, or advanced brewing techniques—Piercy’s content feels repetitive and overly simplistic. His emphasis on “simple and repeatable coffee recipes” might appeal to novices, but it lacks the rigor or creativity that seasoned coffee enthusiasts crave.
More concerning is the apparent commercialization of his platform. Piercy’s Linktree is a virtual billboard of affiliate codes, offering discounts on brands like 1ZPresso, Comandante, and Ascaso espresso machines, all tied to the code “DADDYGOTCOFFEE.” His website, daddygotcoffee.com, further promotes “well-made merch” alongside coffee reviews, signaling a focus on monetizing his audience rather than fostering genuine community dialogue. While affiliate marketing isn’t inherently wrong, the heavy reliance on promotional deals—often without transparent disclosure—can feel exploitative, especially when paired with content that doesn’t challenge or educate the community in meaningful ways. This approach risks turning his platform into a sales funnel rather than a space for authentic coffee culture.
Additionally, Piercy’s persona as a “coffee dad” feels more like a calculated brand than a genuine contribution. His Instagram bio, “V tired dad expanding your coffee horizons,” and his family-centric content are undeniably relatable, but they often overshadow substantive coffee education. Posts featuring his kids or lighthearted reels may drive engagement, but they do little to advance the community’s understanding of coffee craft. Critics might argue this is intentional—a way to mask a lack of expertise with charm, keeping followers hooked while directing them to affiliate links or merch.
The coffee community is evolving, with many calling out platforms that prioritize profit over purpose. Piercy’s content, while accessible, often feels like a missed opportunity to engage with the deeper questions facing the industry, such as sustainability or supporting small producers. Instead, his focus on gear and basic tips aligns more with selling products than sparking meaningful conversations. For a community built on connection and expertise, @daddygotcoffee’s approach can feel like a letdown—less about elevating coffee culture and more about capitalizing on it.
In short, @daddygotcoffee’s lack of insightful content and heavy reliance on monetization strategies undermine his credibility. The coffee community deserves creators who prioritize education and authenticity over exploiting wallets, and Piercy’s platform, while popular, often feels more like a hustle than a help.",0,1757369233.0,espresso,0,0.29,False

I actually get along great with my two roommates, although we’re definitely more acquaintances than friends. 

the issue has arisen that I want to use my freshman year to hard reset some of my habits, to avoid some of the depressive episodes I experienced in high school. things like eating healthy, working out more, studying better and most notably getting up earlier. I’ve been going to bed around 10 pm and getting up around 5. I use the time before my 8 ams to shower, run to the gym, get ready for the day, etc. 

so far I have done everything possible not to disturb my roommates-stopped making coffees in the room, changed my alarm sounds, fixed my desk lamp to be dimmer and not pointed at them, the works. it should be noted that one of my roommates is in a loft with all of his things underneath and I am on the bottom bunk with my other roommate. 

my roommate on the top bunk has made several remarks about me using my bed to put on shoes ( I now use the floor or the ottoman so it doesn’t shake) and closing the door too loudly (I literally stand there for 5 extra seconds now to control how quickly the door closes). I found these to be reasonable requests, until today when my roommate requested I stopped making my bed, or waited until later to do so. 

I totally understand that not everyone has the same routines as me, but I was up front about my sleeping habits from the beginning and making my bed is important to me. it keeps me from crawling back into bed after going down the hall to the bathroom and I love coming back from the gym or class to a nicely arranged room with a made bed! as far as I can tell, I’ve been very careful NOT to disturb my roommate, and I don’t see how placing a quilt and a pillow on my bed is bothersome? at the very least, I’m trying everything I can not to shake the bed or make noise. I have been accepting of leaving the lights on or having guests over later at night, because I can block out the light and sounds in order to go to bed, because I understand my habits are not aligned with theirs. I don’t understand why my roommate can’t just roll back over and go to bed, if I were to accidentally wake him?  

I know I should just follow his request, but I really really like making my bed, and he doesn’t seem to get why I don’t want it to wait until after my first class or something. am I horrible for not really caring if my roommate is woken up, because I’ve done pretty much everything in my power to prevent him waking up and I don’t want to sacrifice the progress I’ve made on my good habits??

What else is there that doesn’t cause weight gain, fatigue or anxiety?","Lexapro was my first antidepressant and it was the best thing ever until unfortunately some of the side effects made me quit. I was the BEST mentally while I was on it. I was always known as the “anxious girl”, then life happened and I became the anxious depressed girl. Lexapro changed that, and even now, years later, I still can’t believe that I had a period in my life when I wasn’t depressed or feeling like I would die due to irrational thoughts at any given second.

Unfortunately all that happiness and “stability” went down the drain when I started gaining weight caused by the sudden insatiable appetite and the constant fatigue. The weight I gained was so fast, and very ‘resistant’ to be lost when I tried to. The fatigue and sleeping a lot was also so bad that I would miss all of my morning and noon classes and had to switch to night classes. My roommates used to say I was like a dead person because my alarm would wake up everyone in the house except me, and I was never like that. I spoke with my doctor, made me change the timing of my dose (took it in the morning instead of before bed) and gradually increased it. Still nothing, just made the fatigue worse. I would reach the 3rd cup of coffee to ‘wake me up’ and it just wouldn’t work, just almost gave myself heart attacks and sweats. I felt like a zombie.

Anyways we shifted to Wellbutrin, it gave me really bad heart palpitations and brought back my anxiety, and I would sweat like crazy even at freezing temps. He upped my dose, and unfortunately my blood pressure would rise and that was scary so I asked to change it all together.

Shifted to Brintellix, I felt like nothing. During the trial and errors we had once the side effects were showing with Lexapro, my anxiety came back, and my depression came back. Also Brintellix was expensive and felt like I was taking a placebo pill, even after “giving it a chance” for two years.

I eventually quit antidepressants all together, but I am at a point where I feel being unmedicated isn’t for me, as I am mentally back to square one, but fatter. I miss Lexapro..without its side effects. I feel like I need to go back, but I’m curious if anyone had a similar journey and finally found something that actually worked for them without the weight gain, brain fogs or fatigue.",1,1757368915.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

The county road narrowed to gravel. My truck rattled with every bump, headlights sweeping over fields that hadn’t seen a plow in years. Cornstalks stood in brittle rows, pale husks that whispered in the breeze but never bent. The deeper I drove, the more it felt like the world was falling away behind me. No other cars. No farmhouses with their warm porch lights. Just silence.

When I finally spotted the silos, I thought for a moment they were water towers.

Three of them, lined up against the horizon like watchtowers. Rust streaked their sides, but even from the distance I could tell they hadn’t been built like the ones I grew up around. Too tall. Too narrow. They looked like teeth rising out of the earth.

I pulled the truck onto what had once been a gravel lot. Now it was weeds and patches of cracked dirt. Killed the engine. Reached for my work bag and the Division-issued tablet.

The silence pressed in.

No crickets. No owls. Not even the tick of cooling metal from the truck. Just the faint hiss of wind against steel.

That’s when the first trickle of unease hit. Normally, you arrive at a job site and there’s something. A buzz of flies. A distant bark. Here there was nothing alive.

Still, money was money.

I walked toward the first silo, boots crunching through scattered gravel. The closer I got, the more details stood out.

The access door wasn’t rusted through like the rest of the structure. It was solid, heavy steel, with a digital key reader bolted beside it. New, shiny. Not the kind of thing you’d find on a farm that had been abandoned decades ago.

And scattered at the base of the door were insects. Thousands of them. Beetles, wasps, grasshoppers—carcasses piled like driftwood, dried husks brittle enough to crush under my boot.

I bent down.

They weren’t decomposed. Just hollowed. As if something had sucked them dry all at once.

I stood, pulse quickening. Swiped my badge across the reader. The lock chirped green.

The door groaned open, releasing a breath of air that hit me like a slap.

Not mildew. Not the rot of stored grain.

Something metallic. Damp copper with a sweet, rotting undertone.

I gagged, pulling my sleeve over my face, and raised my flashlight.

Inside, the first silo wasn’t what I expected.

No concrete walls. No metal ladders bolted to the sides. Instead, the interior was lined with something else—dark, fibrous material like insulation, except it rippled faintly in the flashlight beam.

The floor dipped inward, forming a shallow basin. Black residue pooled at the bottom, clinging like oil. My boots made a wet sound with every step as I descended.

At first, I thought the walls were tricking my eyes. The striations looked almost organic, like the muscle diagrams in a medical textbook.

But then I felt it.

A faint vibration under my palm when I touched the surface.

I snatched my hand back.

Tried to focus on the job instead. Pull out the voltmeter. Log the structural details. Snap photos for the report.

That’s when I noticed the junction box bolted into the wall.

It was humming.

I froze, the voltmeter shaking in my grip.

There was no grid out here. No substations, no live lines. And yet when I tested the circuit, the needle twitched—twenty-two volts, pulsing irregularly.

Almost like a heartbeat.

That was enough for Silo One.

I got out fast, logging a few shaky notes into the tablet before slamming the door shut. My boots crunched over another carpet of insect husks as I crossed the lot toward Silo Two.

The wind had picked up. Only it didn’t sound like wind. It had weight to it, a low resonance that seemed to vibrate in my chest.

I tried to shake it off. Told myself it was nerves, or maybe the emptiness of the place playing tricks. But as I approached the second silo, I noticed the weeds around it bent in strange patterns, spiraling inward toward the base like something had sucked them flat.

The lock reader flickered red, then green.

The door opened too easily.

The air that rolled out of Silo Two was heavier, thicker, as if I’d stepped into the exhaust of some unseen engine. My flashlight caught dust motes hanging in the beam, except they weren’t dust. They looked wetter, like tiny threads of mist that clung to the light instead of drifting away.

I forced myself inside.

This basin was deeper, nearly twice the drop of the first. A metal catwalk circled partway down before giving way to sloped walls. The lining here was even stranger—bulging in places, like bubbles pressed against thin rubber.

I swept the beam across the far side and froze.

One of those bulges twitched.

Only for a second, but enough to send a rush of cold sweat prickling across my scalp.

I took a photo, hands trembling so badly the flash streaked white. Logged another note: structural instability, wall deformation. Wrote it clinically, like the words could keep me detached.

But when I crouched near the edge of the basin, something else broke the illusion.

There was fluid at the bottom. Not pooled water, not oil. Thicker. It glistened red-black, like blood diluted with engine grease. And in that slurry floated pale fragments.

I leaned closer.

Bones.

Not whole ones. Shards. Ribs. Teeth. Something that might’ve been a finger joint if I looked too long.

The smell rising from it made my eyes water.

I pulled back fast, gagging into my sleeve. That’s when the Division tablet pinged.

At first I thought it was just a battery warning. But the screen had changed.

A file had opened itself, synced automatically. The header read:

HARVEST ROOM 2 — MEMBRANE INSTABILITY DETECTED. DO NOT APPROACH BASIN.

The timestamp was old. Fifteen years.

I stared at it, pulse thudding in my ears. Then the wall groaned.

It wasn’t the creak of old metal. It was low, guttural, like a throat straining to draw in air.

I scrambled up the catwalk and stumbled through the exit, slamming the door behind me.

Outside, the silence felt worse.

The wind hadn’t followed me out. The air was thick, pressing down on my eardrums like I’d climbed too high in a plane. I rubbed the side of my head until it popped faintly, but the pressure didn’t ease.

All three silos loomed in the field like sentinels. The third stood apart from the others, slightly larger, its outer skin less corroded—as if something inside kept it from rusting.

I told myself to leave. Just get in the truck, file a partial report, and be done.

But the tablet buzzed again in my hand. Another file auto-synced:

HARVEST ROOM 3 — UNSTABLE. CONTAINMENT FAILURE. TERMINATION ATTEMPT ABORTED.

And below that, in red:

SITE TO BE ABANDONED. DO NOT RETURN.

I looked up at the third silo.

The lock readers were twin units, one above the other. Both flashed green the instant my badge came near, as if the place had been waiting for me.

The door unlatched with a metallic click.

The smell was stronger here.

Not just copper and rot. Something sweet too, cloying, almost floral. It filled my throat until I had to breathe shallow, teeth aching from the taste of it.

My flashlight cut across the chamber and my stomach flipped.

The basin dropped like a well, plunging far deeper than the other two. And the liquid inside wasn’t dark. It glowed. A faint, molten red pulsing just beneath the surface, rising and falling in a rhythm that felt too regular to be natural.

The walls vibrated harder here. Not just a hum, but a full-body resonance that crawled into my ribs and echoed in my skull. My pulse staggered, as if my own heart was trying to sync with it.

I gripped the railing of the catwalk, knuckles white.

The tablet buzzed once more.

Another Division log, dated twenty-three years earlier:

“Membrane integrity compromised. Biomass adapting. Recommend burial of site. Termination unsuccessful.”

The words blurred as my vision swam.

Then the glow in the basin shifted.

Ripples spread across its surface, and from below came movement. Not random, not fluid. Deliberate.

I backed up. My flashlight beam shook across the chamber just as something broke the surface.

Not a hand. Not exactly.

A cluster of pale digits fused together, webbed with veiny strands, rising in a clump like roots torn from the earth. They flexed once, stretching toward me, before sinking back with a wet slap.

My breath hitched. The walls groaned again, and this time they answered me.

With my own voice.

“Termination unsuccessful.”

I dropped the tablet. The sound of it clattering on the catwalk seemed swallowed instantly, like the air refused to carry it.

The voice came again, wetter, bubbling through unseen throats.

“Termination unsuccessful.”

Then another phrase, this one jagged, as though replayed wrong.

“Recommend… burial… of site.”

Every word I’d read off the tablet echoed back in my voice, layered and overlapping until the chamber roared with it.

Railing vibrated in my grip. The walls stretched like tendons pulling tight.

I ran for the door.

It slammed shut before I reached it.

The locks clamped with a final, mechanical thunk.

And behind me, the basin began to stir.

The basin roared.

It wasn’t the sound of water or machinery. It was the sound of pressure being released, like a hundred lungs gasping at once. The red glow swelled brighter beneath the surface, illuminating the walls until every fibrous striation shone like veins under skin.

My chest seized.

I pressed myself against the locked door, fumbling for the key reader, slamming my badge against it. Nothing. The lights on the panel were dead.

The basin rippled again, more violently this time, and from its surface rose something bigger.

It wasn’t a shape my mind wanted to hold onto. Not a creature. Not even parts of one. It was a tangle of limbs that weren’t quite limbs, clusters of pale matter pressed together like wax melted and reformed wrong. Eyes blinked open across its surface, scattered and unfocused, each one rolling toward me before vanishing again beneath folds of slick tissue.

I staggered back along the catwalk. My boot slipped on something wet.

It wasn’t the fluid. It was condensation dripping from the walls.

The walls were sweating.

I shined my light across the chamber and saw it: beads of moisture gathering in the fibrous ridges, running down in rivulets, soaking the basin below. And as the liquid fell, the thing in the pit shuddered like it was being fed.

The chorus of voices deepened.

Not just my words now. Others.

Snatches of sentences I couldn’t understand. Fragments of language that slid over my ears without meaning, like listening to a tape played backwards.

But layered beneath it all was still my own voice, repeating every note I’d spoken since stepping foot on the property.

“Membrane integrity compromised… structural instability… fluid basin—”

I clamped my hands over my ears. It didn’t help. The vibrations were in my skull, in my bones. My pulse stumbled, syncing again with the rhythm of the walls.

“Stop,” I gasped. My own voice answered me instantly:

“Stop. Stop. Stop.”

I stumbled toward the door, ramming my shoulder against it until the frame rattled. My flashlight beam jittered across the catwalk, over the railing, and froze on the basin again.

The surface was rising.

Not splashing upward. Lifting, like the liquid itself, was pushing free from gravity.

A mound swelled toward me, layers of pale matter pressing against the surface before tearing loose in clumps. Something wet slapped against the catwalk near my feet — a chunk of it, writhing blindly, sprouting tendrils that reached for the nearest solid surface.

I kicked it. Hard.

It split open like a sack, spraying fluid that burned when it touched my skin. I screamed, clutching my arm where the droplets landed. They seared like acid, eating through the sleeve of my jacket.

The voices roared in response.

Walls convulsed, flexing inward as though the whole chamber had lungs. Every bulb of the overhead lights popped one by one, showering sparks, until only the red glow from the basin lit the space.

And in that light, the walls stretched.

Fibers peeled apart. Tendons split.

Behind them was something darker. Something moving.

Shapes pressed forward from the lining, straining against the thinning membrane. Human silhouettes at first — faces, shoulders, arms — but wrong. Too many joints. Heads caved inward where mouths should’ve been. Each figure opened wide and collapsed back into the wall like clay pushed into water.

The catwalk vibrated violently under me. I fell to my knees, palms scraping steel, just as the door behind me gave a sharp, metallic click.

Unlocked. Either the pressure drop tripped the mechanism—or it wanted me out.

I didn’t think. I just ran.

The night air hit like a bucket of ice water.

I tumbled out onto the gravel, boots sliding through piles of insect husks, lungs heaving as I gulped the open air. The door slammed behind me with a finality that made my stomach lurch.

I didn’t look back.

But I didn’t need to.

The vibrations followed me out.

The ground beneath my feet thrummed like a plucked string, subtle at first, then stronger, shaking loose pebbles from the lot. The silos groaned in unison, metal skins flexing outward as though they were swelling.

A low, wet moan rolled out across the fields.

It wasn’t coming from the silos.

It was coming from below them.

I sprinted for the truck, gravel spraying under my boots. Every step made the ground feel less stable, as though the dirt itself had hollowed.

When I reached the driver’s side door, I yanked it open and froze.

The windshield was coated.

Not with dust. Not with rain.

With condensation.

It had beaded across the glass in spirals, dripping inward across the dash like the truck itself had started sweating.

I reached to wipe it and my hand recoiled instantly.

The condensation on the windshield pulsed under my fingertips.

Not a trick of the eye. It throbbed—slow, regular—as if there were a faint heart beating somewhere inside the truck. I jerked my hand back and the moisture trembled, each drop jittering toward the defrost vents in thin lines, like it was following warmth.

“Not happening,” I whispered, and my breath came back to me in a dozen murky echoes that weren’t mine, rolling out from the silos behind me like the place was practicing my words.

I slid behind the wheel, key half-in, half-out of the ignition, and looked at my own face in the glass. I looked pale, sweat-slick, a man who knew he was in the wrong place long after the last exit.

I turned the key.

The starter coughed, caught, ground. The engine turned over, but the sound was off, muffled—like a blanket had been stuffed into the manifold. I feathered the gas. The RPMs climbed and fell in uneven waves. The condensation veined backward, drawn into the dash vents. My heater fan gusted once in protest, sputtered, and died.

I shifted to drive.

The wheels spun.

Gravel should’ve sprayed. Instead, the truck eased downward, like it had parked on bread dough. The ground had gone soft; the tires were sinking into a layer that shouldn’t exist—loam loosened from the inside out, air pockets collapsing in slow breaths. I killed the engine, grabbed my bag and the Division tablet, and shouldered the door so hard it rebounded.

The frame had swelled.

I kicked until the seal broke with a wet sound. Not metal tearing—something sticky letting go. I spilled out, skinned a knee on rock, and scrambled up. The silos loomed in my periphery, all three of them flexing ever so slightly, skin pulling over something that wanted out.

“Run,” I told myself, and something under the ground said it too, a second later, in my voice.

I ran.

The lot gave way to scrub and brown stalks of last year’s corn. The rows made corridors that funneled me toward the county road. I kept the tablet because it had a map and the map was the only sane thing left. When I glanced down, new files were syncing—old logs surfacing as if some dead modem below had shaken awake.

HARVEST—ROOT MANIFOLD P-6

Termination attempts failed. Irrigation lines contaminated. Do not pressurize. Do not introduce heat.

A second note, older.

FIELD TEST: BIO-RECLAMATION

Controlled environment recommended. Rural sites underperform. Contaminant displays chemotaxis. Avoid saline spills.

Chemotaxis. Movement toward chemicals. Toward salts. Toward heat.

I felt suddenly and intimately aware of my own sweat.

I cut between rows, boots punching into soil that didn’t hold. The land wasn’t collapsing; it was giving, then firming again in slow beats, as if something far below squeezed and released in cycles.

The field fence showed up as a shadow line. I hit it at speed, caught the top wire, and the barbs bit into my palm. I tasted blood immediately. The iron tang fogged my nose. For one heartbeat the earth around my boots went still, attentive.

I dropped over. On the other side, the ditch lay dry, cracked into plates. Beyond that, the road: two ruts of broken asphalt, the world’s smallest lifeline.

Something thumped behind me. I turned.

The closest silo’s door was open a crack—just wide enough to show a sliver of red throbbing in time with my pulse. Air rolled out of it like heat off a furnace, but the night was cooling; my breath misted. The warmth came from inside the ground.

I ran for the road.

Two steps down the ditch and the plates buckled. Not like old clay breaking; more like a scab being pulled off skin. Underneath, the dirt swam. My ankle sank to the shin and the earth gripped, patient and warm. I ripped my leg free and left my boot behind. The earth took the boot quietly, with a sound like a relieved sigh.

Bare sock instantly wet.

I scrambled up the far bank, clawed at dry weeds, and hauled myself onto the roadbed. Asphalt felt obscene in its solidity. I wanted to kiss it. I turned north—the way I’d come in—and started a limping run.

The road hummed.

Not in my chest. Through my feet.

Each patch of asphalt held a slightly different pitch. As I moved, the tones rose and fell like the road was playing itself, following a melody only it knew. I didn’t think the song was for me.

A cluster of lights winked to life far off to my left. Not vehicles. Not farmhouses. Low, warm, and pulsing from the ground. I realized I wasn’t looking at lights; I was watching breathing in the distance. The irrigation network. The old lines. The Division logs had warned about pressurization. Somewhere under these fields were miles of tubing and conduits, turned into arteries.

I slowed when I reached the turnoff for a derelict farmhouse. The porch was half-fallen, the windows blind. A black rectangle of basement door yawned at the side, the kind made for rolling potatoes into cool dark. My first thought was shelter. My second was that it would be exactly where something wanted me.

The tablet pinged again on its own. I didn’t touch it. The screen brightened anyway.

AUX POWER: PUMP HOUSE

If membrane breach—

The rest was corrupted letters stacked on letters.

I swept the field with my eyes and found the pump house: a squat concrete cube with a rusted hatch and a dead utility pole beside it. No wires in. Nothing to feed it. And yet the hatch shimmered with condensation even from here.

The road vibrated under my feet in a chord that made my back molars ache. It pulsed once. Twice. The third pulse didn’t stop. It sustained until it wasn’t a pulse anymore but a hold, a long throat-singing groan that seemed to come from everywhere.

“Help,” I said out loud. Stupid, automatic. The field answered a second later: Help. Then again, deeper: helphelphelp, smeared into itself, the way a crowd becomes a single word.

I stood in the road with an arm that stung where the fluid from Silo Three had kissed my skin through my jacket. The burn was worse now—spiderwebbed veins lifting under the surface like fine red wires.

The pump house hatch had a manual wheel. The concrete around it was wet in a perfect ring. The air above it shimmered faintly, like heat haze.

Don’t introduce heat, the log had said. Don’t pressurize.

I went anyway.

The hatch wheel took both hands and every bit of leverage I had. It resisted at first, then turned in sticky increments. The smell when it broke seal wasn’t rot; it was sweet and hot, fruit left in a car under summer sun. Steam rolled out. It fogged my forearms. The red lines under my skin brightened like something answered.

Inside was a short metal ladder and a little room with a control panel. The panel lights were dead but the metal sang. Not sound—vibration. A language I wasn’t born to understand and my bones understood anyway.

There were four valves. Someone had painted letters that were flaking: INTAKE, RETURN, MAIN, VENT. Each one wore a padlock that had long since eaten itself. The locks hung like rotted teeth.

I ran my fingers over MAIN. The metal was warm enough to make my fingerprints feel slick.

The tablet pinged again. I didn’t look. I knew what it wanted to tell me: leave it, get out, do not engage. The sensible choice was to obey.

But the road hummed harder and from the direction of the silos a new note rose—a high, thin keening. The sound of something learning. I didn’t want to find out what it learned next if I turned my back.

I braced and spun MAIN as far as it would go.

It fought me for half a turn, then yielded and swung, half-closing with a groan. The humming shifted pitch in the floor, from low to mid. I reached for INTAKE and did the same. Steam kissed my face. I gagged. The sweetness had sharpened to chemical flowers.

The field outside reacted. I felt, more than heard, a ripple pass underground like a muscle tightening. Somewhere in the distance, one of the low, warm “breathing” lights dimmed.

“Oh,” I said, because I am prideful and stupid and cannot help it even when the ground is alive. “You don’t like that.”

My voice came back—not from the field this time. From the pump room’s walls: Oh you don’t like that oh you don’t—

I spun VENT all the way open.

The shift almost knocked me off the ladder. Air whoomped through the chamber, directionless, like an organ bellows had been punched. The humming faltered and for a second there was silence so complete I could hear spit crackle in my throat.

Then the silence ended.

Everywhere at once, the field inhaled.

The pump room walls flexed inward the smallest degree, a lover’s breath against skin. The ladder trembled under my palms. I tasted copper and felt the red veins under my forearm pick up the rhythm of something not mine.

I slammed the hatch closed and spun the wheel three times. The concrete under my boots thrummed. I backed away on shaking legs, out into night air that no longer felt like air at all but the space inside a lung.

I ran for the road again, this time without a plan. North, toward the state highway, where there would be signs and shoulders and problems I understood, like worn tires and loose lug nuts and bored troopers.

I didn’t make it far.

Headlights washed the corn ahead of me in flat beams. Not mine. A van rolled slow from the dark, no markings, paint the color of nothing. It stopped with surgical precision exactly where the ruts of asphalt met what had been two stop lines in some other decade. Its engine was quiet and wrong, too—no pistons; a polished hum.

Two figures climbed out. Not full suits, but respirators. Hoods. Not uniforms, exactly—just clothes that were designed never to be remembered. The taller one held a device shaped like a stud finder and pointed it at the ground, then at me. The smaller one spoke first, voice soft through the mask.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

“I know,” I said. “I tried not to be. It didn’t take.”

The taller one lifted a hand, palm out, like to soothe. “You’re injured.”

I glanced at my arm. The red had deepened to a hard, bright color. Lines had gone from spidery to branching. They converged at the wrist, pulsing slightly under the skin like roots pressed under plastic.

“I need a hospital,” I said. It sounded naïve even to me, like asking for a glass of water while the house burned.

“You need containment,” the tall one said. “We can help with that.”

Behind them, the van’s rear doors opened themselves. The inside was white. Clean. It looked like mercy. It looked like an autoclave.

The small one’s device chimed; they angled it toward the fields; the pitch rose. The corn in the beam of the headlights seemed to lean without wind.

“Please,” I said, and hated the word.

“Please,” the field said back, a second later, in my voice.

All three of us turned toward the sound.

It didn’t come from the silos. It came from the ditch, right at my feet. The cracked plates had softened again; beneath them, something bright as a slow ember moved, gathering itself.

The tall one swore. “It’s in the lateral lines already.”

The small one—maybe they were kinder, maybe they were just quicker—reached for me with both hands. “We have to go now.”

I stepped toward them. The ground stepped too. The asphalt rose a fraction under my toes and then settled, like a tongue tasting.

“I’ll go,” I said.

The field said: I’ll go. Then: I’ll—go—go—go— in corrupt chorus, as if the word had become a lever and the land wanted to see which way it pulled.

The tall one’s hood snapped toward me. “Have you spoken much?”

“Not to it.” The lie tasted like pennies. “To myself.”

Their eyes were not visible behind the clear shield of their mask, but I felt the judgment anyway: fool, tinder, spark.

The small one glanced back at the van. The doors yawned wider, the interior light brightening, as if a pair of lungs had flared in a chest. I thought of the logs—Avoid heat. Avoid pressurization. I thought of the pump house valves and the way the light had dimmed when I bled pressure.

“What are you doing out here?” I asked. Not to stall. To know. Because if I was going to be erased, some part of me needed one more fact before becoming fewer facts.

The tall one didn’t answer. The small one did, in a voice so even it had to be practiced.

“Cleaning.”

The road thrummed. The van’s tires creaked as if the asphalt were chewing on them, slow and speculative.

The small one took my elbow. The contact burned and soothed at once. “Come with us.”

I took one step. The ditch at my side sighed and the cracked plates sloughed away, revealing a gleam of red in the muck like a pilot light catching. The tablet in my other hand vibrated hard enough to buzz through my bones. A new line had appeared over the old logs with no date and no origin.

THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED SITE.

The small one saw it over my shoulder and their breath fogged their mask. For a second, whatever face lived under that hood was only eyes.

“Move,” the tall one said, brisk now. Not to me. To the small one. Push. Pull. Triage. That tone belongs to people who get obeyed when clocks run out.

I took another step toward the van and realized why everything in me had rebelled at doing the sensible thing.

The van was warm. Not engine warm. Field warm.

Air seeped from the rear in a steady faint exhale. The interior light pulsed so slowly no human eye should have seen it—except mine did, because I’d been in the silo where the walls taught my heart to find that rhythm. The tall one’s hand was on the door. Gloved. Steady. If they noticed the pulse, they didn’t care.

They weren’t afraid of contamination. They had brought it a long time ago and learned which parts wouldn’t kill them quickly.

I stepped back.

The small one didn’t let go. “Don’t,” they said, and the word broke in the middle. A human sound, a crack where fear lived.

“I can’t,” I said.

“I can’t,” the field said from the ditch in a perfect imitation, and the tall one flinched just a fraction.

Decision is a small thing. It fits in the time between two vibrations.

I yanked my elbow free, hurled the tablet into the ditch, and ran.

It was not bravery. It was not intelligence. It was choosing the piece of ground that hated everything equally instead of the white box that had picked a side.

The ditch took the tablet like a donation. It hissed. The red ember flared, then dimmed, then flared again like a swallowed heartbeat learning where it lived now. The road bucked under me, a horse in a bad mood. The van’s hum deepened as the tall one cursed and slammed the doors; the small one called my name—my real one; I don’t write it here—once, soft in a way I will remember longer than what the silos smelled like.

I ran blind toward the black space where the county road met the state highway. The humming moved with me, then ahead of me, then to both sides at once, and then I stopped hearing it because hearing is a mercy and the body subtracts mercies when you need legs more.

There were no other cars.

There was a sign: JUNCTION 17, an arrow as earnest as a child. I followed it on a ruined ankle with a shirt stuck to my back and a map in my head of valves I would not live long enough to close.

I don’t remember the exact moment the humming left my bones. I only know that at some point the air changed from sweet to clean, and the taste of copper in my mouth became only blood and not something wanting it. The night normalized. The crickets came back, a little at a time, each one a pinprick of ordinary.

I walked until I saw a gas station that had shut its lights an hour earlier and the graveyard shift guy who had decided to smoke in the dark anyway. He looked at me the way you look at a drunk on the side of the road, then the way you look at a wreck.

“Hospital?” he asked.

“Map,” I said, because my mouth was a stranger and maps do not send people with respirators.

He gave me both. I washed my arm in the restroom until the skin went white and the red lines under it didn’t. They pulsed faintly in the mirror. I watched them for a long time, then pulled my sleeve down and bought coffee I didn’t drink.

I wrote this because sleep doesn’t come anymore and because the contractor email I sent bounced back with a message that said the company never existed. The Division didn’t reply; the message failed and then the failure quietly erased itself from my outbox while I was watching. Someone called my phone from “Unknown” and said nothing, and the silence on the line was warm.

If you drive that way, don’t. If you’ve got a friend who hunts for abandoned places and whispers their coordinates to you like gifts, tell them you want living gifts: a bar with sticky floors, a diner with a neon sign that lies about being the best in the county. Telling them “no” is a kind of love.

And if you live somewhere with old farm lines running under your yard and your sump pump has started to sound like breathing, don’t introduce heat. Don’t pressurize. If a van without logos parks at the curb and the people inside are kind in the practiced ways, shut your door.

I still hear it when the house is quiet. Not all the time. Not even every night. Just enough to remind me it isn’t finished learning.

I run the tap for a minute to clear the line. The water comes cold, clean, and indifferent.

I turn it off and listen.

The silence that follows is only silence.

Until it isn’t.

1nc18fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiassistedauthors/comments/1nc18fi/crave/,Crave,"Nora was notoriously cautious about tech. She used Neuralink for messaging, calendar reminders, and grocery orders, but the idea of merging her brain with a flavor-enhancing app seemed…extravagant. Everyone at work, though, was raving about BurgerWave’s new “Neuralink Flavor Subscription.”

“They taste better before you even order them!” her coworker whispered, eyes glazed over like she’d discovered the world’s greatest secret. Fry grease shimmered on her fingers in Nora’s imagination. “You’ve gotta try it.”

Nora hesitated. What could possibly go wrong? Yet the curiosity clawed at her. She installed the add-on, feeling a thrill as the Neuralink synchronized. The first bite was exquisite. Her tongue hummed with every spice, every seared edge. The pleasure didn’t come from chewing. It came from inside her head, a deep, humming satisfaction that bypassed reality. She inhaled imaginary fries at her desk, tasting salt and crunch in vivid hallucinations. The app whispered: More.

At first, it was just fun. Fries at midnight. Burgers for breakfast. She even laughed at herself, marveling at how real it all felt. But soon, cravings became insidious. She smelled burgers in her dreams, felt phantom buns on her lips. At the office, her coworkers devoured actual meals while their Neuralink circuits fed them continuous reinforcement, eyes flickering, hands trembling.

One Friday, Nora tried to skip lunch. The craving hit her like a physical blow. Water tasted like grease, salad like dry ash. She caved, inhaling a BurgerWave combo in five minutes flat. Yet the hunger never left. Her Neuralink overlay flooded her senses with phantom smells and textures until she was shaking. More. Eat more. You’re not satisfied.

Communities collapsed in parallel. Medical centers overflowed with the malnourished. Children with empty eyes wandered after phantom fries. Adults gorged themselves endlessly, weight fluctuating wildly, hearts straining. The implant didn’t care; it only amplified the craving, deepened the addiction. Nora sometimes glimpsed the horror outside her window—neighbors clawing at doors, mouths full of burgers—but the hallucinations inside were louder, sweeter, impossible to resist.

Investigative journalists leaked internal documents: BurgerWave had partnered with Neuralink to hack satiety pathways. The algorithm ensured no user could ever feel satisfied. Governments debated bans, but lobbyists stalled legislation. Riots erupted. Mobs clawed through restaurant windows, screaming, shoving burgers into mouths even as their bodies convulsed.

Nora’s apartment became a shrine to her obsession. Empty wrappers piled high. The neon glow of the Neuralink HUD reflected off her sweaty skin. She shook, biting into a burger, then another, then another, never slowing, never stopping. The whispers had escalated to commands. More. Always more.

Her body finally gave out in a violent, food-induced seizure. She collapsed, convulsing while shoveling burgers into her mouth, eyes locked on the hallucinated perfection the Neuralink promised.

Outside, a glossy BurgerWave ad played on giant screens: happy families laughing, biting into fries, ketchup smiles glistening. A cheerful voiceover intoned: “BurgerWave. The taste that never ends.”

In a sleek boardroom, Neuralink executives sipped lattes and grinned at charts. “Coffee next,” one said. “Then soda. Then entertainment. Everyone can crave, forever.”

The city burned with hunger and obsession. The flavor never ended. Neither would the craving.",1,1757368823.0,aiassistedauthors,0,1.0,False

I developed PET a few years ago and it was making my life miserable. I finally got to see an ENT who brushed me off and told me it was ""just Eustachian Tube Dysfunction and there's nothing you can do.""  He added ""I don't know, maybe google it?""

Anyway, I did. Stumbling across this subreddit was what made me realize I've actually been suffering from PET (which seems to be a subtype of ETD).

Once I learned it was PET I did some research into what exactly it is. Now I'm not a doctor so forgive me if this isn't 100% accurate, but I understood it to be the failure of the Eustachian tubes to stay closed, either because of tissue atrophy, or dehydration of the mucous membrane. (imagine a sticky straw... if you press on it, it stays closed. Imagine a dry straw, if you press on it, it opens).

I knew tissue atrophy was more complicated, so I decided to pursue the mucous membrane first. My ears had been flared for over two weeks at this point and I was desperate. I took an electrolyte packet. My ears instantly leveled out. The next day, I woke up with PET symptoms again, so I took an electrolyte packet, and the symptoms leveled out again. I got low sodium electrolyte packets and took them every morning for two weeks-- the PET symptoms stayed away except for short durations after intense exercise.

So I looked back at my medication history, particularly around the time that the PET symptoms started. I realized I had switched birth control (to Yasmine) about a month before the symptoms, and that it had diuretic ingredients. Additionally, my doctor told me that anecdotally some of her patients have reported ""ear issues"" on certain birth controls. I asked to switch to another birth control pill.

I continued to have PET regularly for about a week. Then it became only for short durations after exercise, coffee, or ice water. Then I started to be able to do these things without episodes. Lately I still get autophony if I drink ice water or sometimes when I yawn (and it freaks me out), but it seems to go away within a few seconds. I'm hoping as I stay off Yasmine that the symptoms will continue to improve.

This has been life-changing. If you are on Yasmine or other birth controls, I'd really recommend talking to your doctor. If you are not on birth control but are on other medications, it still might be worth talking to your doctor about these being possible causes.",2,1757368703.0,PatulousTubes,0,1.0,False

No need for sympathy or for anyone here to dissect it. I know my mistakes, I know hers. A year later, I can admit it’s better this way.

1nc12ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1nc12ox/breaking_into_energon_trading/,Breaking into Energon Trading,"Hi r/Commodities,

  
I’m a fresh Cybertronian grad trying to break into Energon trading. Feels like a real career lane with upside if I can get a foot in the door and not blow up on a Decepticon basis swing my first week.

Quick take on the market: post–Great War rebuild = steady demand, with Autobots spending on infrastructure and Decepticons posturing with “strategic stockpiles,” so there’s a structural bid. The curve flips between sleepy contango when field ops are quiet and spicy backwardation when raids hit—roll yield matters, and storage/Space-Bridge capacity is the hidden edge. Basis gets weird across mine-mouth cube, refined liquid, and the fancy AllSpark-adjacent blends thanks to conversion losses and raid insurance.

About me: I did Mechatronic Finance at Iacon Institute (minor in War Economy). I interned at a mid-tier Autobot shop on nights—PnL recs, a subspace-signal harvester for quotes, and coffee strong enough to strip paint. My capstone modeled the Energon term structure under Decepticon shocks (level/slope/“Decepti-vol”), and a carry + CTD roll captured decent paper Sharpe before bridge tolls took their tax.

Tools I actually use: Teletraan-1 datapads with Powerglide Query modules and unholy Matrix-Lookup chains; CybertronScript with Vector Sigma arrays for small schedulers; and AllSparkQL for the data lake (I can Seeker-join until Primus tells me to stop). Risk-wise I get the basics—VaR (Value at Ravage), stops, and not martingaling myself into scrap.

Where I’d sit: Autobots feel like a flow/infrastructure house—mission vibes, real optionality, heavy on KYB (Know Your Bot). Decepticons are sharper, more PnL-first, allegedly better payout grids, allegedly worse HR—high beta to raids, which could be fun if you like volatility.

On the physical side (Decepticon lift Earth → Cybertron): the chain is basically field extraction → cube/liquefy on Earth → shuttle to Space-Bridge nodes → time-windowed repatriation to Darkmount. Throughput gets rationed by Shockwave Logistics, and tolls float off a war-risk index. The unit stack is Earth wellhead + refining + lift + bridge toll + insurance + sabotage reserve + lunar anchorage demurrage, marked vs CIF Darkmount. Ops watch-outs: cycle time Earth→Darkmount, bridge-slot utilization, convoy attrition/shrink (the Quintesson quota tax), and discharge cube integrity. The hedge I’d run is long physical vs short Cybertron fronts, sprinkled with war-risk options and a rolling buffer to monetize backwardation without bricking the tanks.

A few starter edges I’d try: a raid-probability nowcast from subspace chatter + sensor anomalies to size front-spread hedges; cross-grade arb between cube and liquid around refinery yields; and a bridge-locational spread model that prices latency, tolls, and sabotage risk into routing.

Things I’m hoping the hive mind can help with:

1.) Better to start on an Autobot physical/logistics desk to learn “molecules” (cubes) or jump straight to a Decepticon prop seat if I clear the interviews?

2.)Real talk on WLB vs WfC (Work-life balance vs War for Cybertron) by faction—am I booking a chassis rebuild every quarter?

3.)Comp red flags like “% of book after railgun losses” or deferred cubes vesting in Beastformers/Combiners?

4.) Book recs beyond Trading the Curve and Options, Vol, and Mecha—already did When Genius Burned Out My Optics.

5.) Best “Why Energon?” answer that isn’t “number go up” or “I like pressing buy when it’s shiny.”

Day one, I’ll handle confirmations, recs, EOD PnL, exposure buckets, and clean data until it gleams. I’ll babysit the curve through Andromeda hours and ping early on Quintesson-induced shocks (swing-producer headlines). I can also ship small tools fast—a clean contango/backwardation holo-dashboard with roll attribution, a basis heatmap by grade/bridge/region on a tactical HUD, and a tidy post-mortem template so we don’t repeat dumb stuff.

Open to DMs, resume roasts, or being told to pivot to Stasis-Pod REITs. Not investment advice—definitely a cry for mentorship. Roll yield, not roll out.",2,1757368425.0,Commodities,1,0.75,False

Peach Creek Community Pool



Saturday, June 3, 2006, 9:00 PM



It was a Saturday night at the Peach Creek Community Pool. Only two people were there at the empty pool. These people were the two lifeguards, Quentin Jones, and his girlfriend, Candace Jones. Quentin dived into the pool to join his girlfriend, Candace. After this, Candace swam off and got out of the pool, while Quentin stayed. Candace went down into the changing rooms, while Quentin stayed to relax in the pool, until he heard something nearby in the pool. Back in the changing rooms, Candace dried her hair, while back in the pool, Quentin climbed up the diving board to dive into the pool again. However, before he could dive, a giant, marine reptile appeared in the pool below him. Just as he dove, the marine reptile jumped out of the water at him, and caught him in its big jaws mid-air, and swallowed him whole before going back down into the pool. Candace was still in the changing rooms and heard something. She went up to the pool and didn’t see her boyfriend who had just been eaten by the water monster. “Quentin?”, she cried. She didn’t get an answer and then headed down into the pool’s viewing port. The giant marine reptile then showed itself and head smashed against the port glass. This scared and horrified Candace, who upon seeing this screamed in terror.

State Office



Sunday, June 4, 2006, 6:00 AM



The next morning, at the State Office, Ed, May Kanker, Kevin, and a meeting of State Office officials were watching a live report that was sent by Double D from the sewer bunker anomaly site on the status of the anomaly. “Magnetic field remaining consistent at 5 Tesla!”, Double D reported while filming. “There’s no sign of this anomaly weakening and closing yet!”, he continued to report. “Let’s make a demonstration of this”, he carried on. The anomaly sucked in a metal tank. “Woah! Did you see that?”, he asked his audience. “What an idiot!”, Kevin remarked, unimpressed by Double D’s sense of humor. “Double D might be a dimwit, but he’s got a big brain”, Ed explained to the State Office official.





6:05 AM

Kevin then turned the live video off and decided to discuss the sewer anomaly with the State Office official meeting. “Alright, so let me get this straight: the woods anomaly was temporary, while the sewer anomaly is currently showing no signs that it will close any time soon”, Kevin said. “Maybe when the anomalies close, they never just disappear completely. Maybe when the anomalies close, they just disappear temporarily.” “But wouldn’t that mean that the creatures would have to have come through the anomalies before?”, Kevin asked. “They may have indeed and they could’ve been recorded in all of the ancient myths, and legends throughout ancient history as mythical creatures. We are tasked with predicting and containing these anomalies and therefore, we cannot rule this theory out as a possibility”, Ed explained to the meeting. “Wait a minute! Our official anomaly-containing nor controlling methods have not yet been finalized!”, Kevin told Ed. One of Kevin’s assistants handed Kevin a letter. “Lifeguard murdered at the Peach Creek Community Pool”, Kevin read. “By the sound of this, it looks like there could a possible new anomaly incursion”, Kevin told Ed, and May, who were shocked at hearing this.



Hospital



6:10 AM



“Do you not remember anything that happened yesterday?”, Double D asked Edd as the latter packed his stuff and prepared to leave. “Nope. I sure don’t”, Edd responded. “Your near-death experience in the sewers helped me realize that we could get killed because of what we do and it got my priorities straight”, Double D told Edd. Marie came in the room well-dressed. “Wow! Look at you!”, Double D commented. “You look good, Marie”, Edd told the Kanker. “Thanks, boys”, she responded. Edd was about to leave the hospital. “Thanks for coming dude, but you didn’t have to”, Edd told Double D. “Can I give you a ride back home?”, Marie offered. “No need for that. Already got a girlfriend named Ella that’s picking me up. Just returned after 2 years researching diseases in South America.”, Edd told the blue-haired girl. Edd turning down the offer hurt Marie’s feelings and shocked both her, and Double D. “Sounds like Edd’s got catching up to do with Ella”, Double D joked. Marie was angry at this comment and smacked him in the face with a pillow. “Sorry, Marie”, he apologized. “You do look good, Marie”, he told the angry Kanker.



Peach Creek Community Pool



7:15 AM



The team had arrived at the Peach Creek Community Pool. The police had also arrived at the swimming pool and had secured it as a crime scene. One of the police officers stayed with Candace, who was traumatized, and silent from what happened the night before. “I believe that Candace murdered her boyfriend. She claimed that her boyfriend was killed by a giant marine reptile, but I don’t believe her. That doesn’t make any sense. She had to have been lying”, the detective explained as he walked with Ed, and May. “Can I talk to Candace”, Ed asked the detective. “About what?”, the detective asked back. “Look, this is going to sound crazy, but what Candace said was true. The killer was not her, but instead, a prehistoric marine reptile predator that crossed between the distant past to the modern day”, Ed explained. “May, I don’t want this innocent girl to be arrested, and accused of a crime that she did not commit”, Ed told May. “Okay, I’ll take care of it”, May responded.



7:25 AM



Marie, Double D, and Ed had arrived at the Peach Creek Community Pool. “I’m surprised that the creature even came through the anomaly considering how toxic the pool water was due to all the chlorine in it. “Maybe it sensed the toxicity in the water and swam back through before the anomaly closed after it killed the lifeguard”, Edd suggested. Marie walked off as they discussed the situation. “So why are you just now mentioning Ellie? You never mentioned that you had a girlfriend this whole time even you always gave us the impression that you were single”, Double D said. “I gave an impression I was single?”, Edd asked confusingly. He then dived into the pool, splashing Double D.



State Office



8:00 AM



At the State Office, May argued with Kevin about the situation. ” “Peach Creek PD have charged Candace with the murder of Quentin Jones.”, May explained. “I refuse to clear her name and intervene in this situation because if she is in prison she won’t be able to expose the truth about her late boyfriend’s death to the media”, Kevin explained. “That’s horrible!”, May remarked, disgusted at Kevin’s response. “Letting the girl go free and spread the truth about the incident would cause mass chaos, and disorder throughout the country, and maybe even the world”, the stern man continued. “I promise I’ll drop the charges against her as soon as the anomaly incident is over and under total control”, he continued on. “We don’t know how long it will take to get the anomalies over and under total control, though”, May added. “Imagine the panic that Candace would cause by telling others about this current creature incursion. Being a government official comes with making tough and difficult decisions.



The Creek



8:10 AM



At the Creek, people were having summer fun. Several kayakers paddled in the water. Other people at the Creek enjoyed themselves on its banks. A few dipped their feet in. However, unbeknownst to them, the giant marine reptile from the swimming pool lurked beneath the waters of the Creek. On the surface, the kayakers paddled, but were soon horrified at the gruesome sight of a mass of digested flesh, and bone, which had floated up to the surface from the depths of the Creek. The other Creek-goers that were on the Creek’s banks also this unsightly mass and were horrified upon seeing it as well. The Creek became a place filled with screams and horror.



State Office



8:20 AM



Meanwhile, at the State Office, Ed, May, and Kevin were discussing the flesh-bone mass found at the Creek. “The DNA tests done by our scientists confirm that this fleshy, bony mass is the remains of Quentin Jones”, May explained. Kevin continued to look at the photos of what was formerly a lifeguard. “It’s a bolus. That means that the creature swallowed Quentin whole and then vomited up the parts of him that it couldn’t digest”, Ed explained to May, and Kevin. “What kind of creature was responsible for this abomination?”, Kevin asked. “Some kind of marine reptile”, the professor responded. “I wonder how Quentin’s remains ended up in the Creek. That’s 20 miles away from where he was killed at the swimming pool. How did it get there?”, Ed pondered. “Maybe there was never an anomaly incursion and Candace did indeed murder her boyfriend, and dumped his remains in the Creek”, Kevin suggested. “Dude. She would literally have had to swallow him whole and drive 20 miles to vomit him up into the Creek. That’s fricking impossible”, Ed explained, doubting Kevin’s belief. “Well, you better explain this crap with a better theory then”, Kevin demanded. “Hmmmm…. the creature that appeared in both the swimming pool was the same one that appeared in the Creek”, Ed said. “Maybe the anomaly has a fixed location in the past, whereas the side in the present is mobile. If my theory is correct, then it means that the anomalies can move from one location to the other”, Ed theorized. Ed’s theory on the mobile anomalies understandably concerned Kevin and May.



The Creek



9:20 AM



An hour later, the State Office, and it’s soldiers had secured the Creek. Ed had traveled by motorboat across the Creek. At the banks, he met up with May, and Captain Jonny 2×4. The rest of the anomaly team had also arrived. Marie and Edd were analyzing water samples, while Double D measured the water level of the Creek with a stick. “We have divers searching the Creek, but unfortunately they haven’t found any sign of the creature or the anomaly”, May explained to Ed. “I would like some maps and locations of every nearby decently-sized body of water”, Ed told May. “Why”, the Kanker asked. “Just testing out an idea of mine”, Ed answered excitedly. “Before the anomaly operation, I spent hours in long, boring meetings longing for something interesting”, May said. “Well, I guess you have got what you wished for, but it sadly backfired”, Ed noted before heading off.



9:25 AM



“Hey, Ed!”, Double D called out to the other Ed. “I’ve found something I think you would like to see!”, Double D continued. “The Creek is landlocked and between the time now and earlier when I measured the water level, the water in the Creek has fallen by a foot. “That means that the only explanation is that the Creek’s waters are pouring out through the anomaly, which in turn, means that the anomaly is still open, and is somewhere deep down in the depths of the Creek”, Ed explained to Double D, and to Edd, who had just come over from another part of the Creek’s banks. Meanwhile, as they spoke, the giant marine reptile was swimming, and lurking in the waters of the Creek.

9:30 AM

Back on the banks of the Creek, Ed was alone, and sat silently thinking to himself about the current situation. “You want a coffee, Ed?”, May asked, who had just came over to him. “Sure”, Ed accepted. “Thinking about Helena again are you?”, May asked the Ed. “How did you know?”, Ed asked. “I attribute my insight on people to my job as a civil servant”, May said. “I’m always seeing Helena everywhere”, he explained to the civil servant Kanker. “It’s strange that Edd hallucinated Helena of all people when he was bitten of all the people he could have seen instead. I know that your on to something Ed and that you know the truth”, May said. Before Ed could respond, he saw steam rising up from an area of the Creek. “The steam is warmer water that is coming through the anomaly into the Creek as the tide on the other side is coming in. We can accurately track the anomaly down by going into the steam”, Ed explained. The diving soldiers began preparing for another diving mission into the Creek in search of the anomaly. Ed and Edd geared up to join them. May was reluctant and said “I’m afraid of the paperwork I would be forced to fill in if Ed died”, before the two Eds went out onto the Creek in a motorboat with the divers.



9:40 AM



Meanwhile, on the banks of the Creek, Double D, and Marie prepared to wade out into the Creek to collect more water samples. “Why is Edd always getting the exciting parts of the job and we’re stuck collecting water samples? How boring!”, Double D complained. “Edd looks better at it than you would”, Marie amusingly joked. “Just because I’m the brains of the team doesn’t mean that I suck at brawn, excitement, and action”, Double D remarked.



9:45 AM



Ed, Edd, and the divers reached the area of the Creek that the steam came from. They prepared to gear up and go into the warmer waters. Ed, Edd, and the divers dove into the waters of the Creek and began searching for any sign of the anomaly. “Edd doesn’t remember anything he said to you when he was bitten by the Arthropleura yesterday”, Double D said. “I’m still angry with that jackass because he knew when he asked me out that he was already taken”, Marie explained. “But he was poisoned by the Arthropleura at the time and so that likely affected his judgment”, Double D explained. “That is true”, Marie remarked, unable to argue with Double D’s point. “You should move on from Edd asking you out when he already had a girlfriend”, Double D said. In the Creek, the marine reptile swam through the waters, lurking unseen. The divers and the two Eds continued to swim through the waters in search of the anomaly.



9:50 AM



Marie and Double D had waded out into a different, shallower, part of the Creek. They analyzed the water and took more samples. Nearby, a flock of geese were suddenly scared off by something in the Creek. Double D saw the same thing that scared the geese off, which caused him to stop what he was doing, and stare in horror. “Marie!” There’s something behind you!”, he alerted the blue-haired Kanker. She turned around to see the giant marine reptile behind her, circling her, and stalking her in the water. Meanwhile, back in the depths of the Creek, Ed, Edd, and a diver were swimming through the waters. Suddenly, the diver swam through the anomaly. The two Eds stopped to stare at the anomaly for a few minutes. After this, they swam back up to the motorboat waiting for them on the surface.



9:55 AM



Meanwhile, the large marine monster continued to stalk, and circle Marie Kanker in the waters of the Creek. Marie kept calm and silent against the prehistoric predator. The marine reptile eventually disappeared. “Where’d it go?”, Marie asked once the marine menace vanished from sight. “Stay still. Don’t move a muscle”, Double D told Marie. The two then looked around in search of any signs of where the marine predator could have gone.



10:00 AM



Back at the anomaly, Ed, and Edd returned to the waters to study, and stare at the anomaly again. Back at the other, shallower part of the Creek, Marie, and Double D were absolutely certain that the giant marine reptile was far enough way for it to be safe for them to make a move for the banks. The two ran to the banks, when all of a sudden, the predator rushed towards them as they ran through the waters towards the bank. Once they reached the bank, the marine monster suddenly leaped out of the water, and onto the banks at them. The predator cornered the two against a metal fence and snapped its jaws at them to keep them trapped. Fortunately, the water monster couldn’t get any closer to them due to having sluggish body movement on land. “What are we gonna do?”, Marie asked nervously. “This”, Double D told her with a plan up his sleeve. Double D grabbed an oar from a nearby boat and used it to beat the marine reptile back. “Stay back, sea monster!”, he yelled. Suddenly, the marine reptile launched an attack against him. Double D was able to stop him and Marie from becoming sea monster snacks, and drove the oar into the creature’s jaws. This badly injured its gums and prompted it to flee back into the Creek. The giant marine reptile then swam off into the Creek and left the two alone.



10:05 AM



The giant marine reptile arrived in the deeper part of the Creek and swam back through the anomaly. Ed watched this from a safe spot and stared at it again for a few minutes. The anomaly eventually weakened and closed.



10:10 AM



Back on the banks of the Creek, Ed, and Double D discussed the creature incursion. Nearby, medics tended to Marie. “The marine reptile predator is a Mosasaurus, a mosasaur from the Cretaceous period. Mosasaurs were giant, predatory marine sea predators that swam through the Cretaceous seas, and sported razor-sharp teeth that they used to eat their prey”, Double D explained.” “While this Mosasaurus is still dangerous, it’s too small to be a fully-grown adult. May came over and she, and Ed watched as the State Office pestered Edd, and the diver about the disappearance of the diver that swam through the anomaly. “What happened to the other diver?”, May asked. “He swam through the anomaly and never came back”, Ed told her. “Why did he not come back through from the other side of the anomaly?”, May asked. “I don’t know, but since the anomaly closed, he’s never coming back. He’s trapped on the other side in the past”, Ed told her. “That’s not good”, May said with a worried look on her face. “Thanks for saving my life”, Marie thanked Double D for saving her from the Mosasaurus. The two then hugged each other.



State Office



11:00 PM



An hour later, Ed, Edd, and May had returned to the State Office. In Kevin’s office, Ed explained his theory in detail to Edd, May, and Kevin. His theory was on how and why the anomaly changed locations from the swimming pool to the Creek. “The anomalies are the temporal equivalent of earthquakes and this current anomaly that we’re dealing with is running on a temporal fault line on which both the Peach Creek Community Pool, and the Creek is located on”, the professor explained. Of course, Kevin was highly skeptical of the temporal fault line theory. “I believe it was all simply just a coincidence”, the office guy remarked. “I wanna accept that this whole anomaly incursion is over and that we just got off easy with this one”, he continued. “But what about the diver who got lost through the anomaly? I don’t think this is over, Kevin”, May said. “This anomaly could reopen on any fault line at any minute. I recommend that we send troops to secure every large body of water between the Creek and the coast”, Ed warned Kevin. “That would cause too much commotion from the press”, Kevin argued. “When and if the anomaly appears, it will be somewhere on the fault line of this map”, he further warned Kevin.



Cul-de-sac



11:10 PM



At a house in the cul-de-sac, a mother by the name of Paige Johnson, was washing dishes. “Hey, kids! You wanna play outside in the backyard for a minute?”, she asked her two young children. “Okay, mom!”, the brother and sister both said before going outside together to play. The mom headed down into the house’s basement with a basket of laundry. She began loading it into the basement’s washing machine. Once all of the laundry was loaded into the washing machine, she left the basement. Unbeknownst to her, water began to appear, and started to flow across the basement floor. The basement was eventually flooded up to a foot. About to go outside and into the backyard with her kids, Paige noticed a trail of wet footprints she had left from returning from the basement. She went back down into the basement to find that the increasing amount of water had caused it to flood and that the basement’s water levels were now at least a foot high. She rushed back up into the house from the basement. The rising water reached the basement’s electric plugs and shorted them out. A large, aquatic bird with sharp teeth snapped its jaws in the water, and loudly shrieked while doing so.



Peach Creek Metropolitan University



1:15 PM



At the Peach Creek Metropolitan University, Double D was alone in the canteen. He was looking over the Mosasaurus profile on his database. John and Gideon came over to see what Double D was reading. “Mosasaurus, huh? Cretaceous sea marine predator. One of the largest marine reptiles of its time, ranging from 56-59 ft in length, extinct 65 million years ago”, John read. Double D closed his database off to John and Gideon, and left. “You do know it’s DVD night and your turn to get the pizza, right?”, John asked. However, Double D quickly handed over the pizza money to Gideon, and quickly left. “What has happened to our best friend, Double D?”, John asked, shocked. “Maybe he’s still angry with us over the fake dinosaur prank we pranked him with at Lake Garcia State Park. Or maybe he has a girlfriend?”, Gideon suggested. “No! That can’t be right!”, the two simultaneously dismissed the two theories. “I’m curious how and why he has changed. He has bizarrely lost interest in your marathons and has this weird sudden obsession with dinosaurs”, John noted. “Maybe Double D found some archeological dig he wants to keep to himself”, Gideon suggested. “No because that would be selfish. We need to watch Double D more closely now than we ever have. He’s up to something”, John said.



State Office



1:20 PM



At the State Office, Edd walked through the main offices. He saw pictures on a TV screen from the sewer anomaly site of the anomaly and the Arthropleura. This sparked a memory of him entering the sewers and getting bitten by the Arthropleura, and of him seeing Helena. He then looked over in shock at Dr. Ed, who was in the office across talking with May Kanker.



1:30 PM



Edd was out in the hallways thinking to himself. Edd walked behind him and noticed Edd was in distress. “What’s wrong, Edd?”, he asked. “Well, I remember what happened a few days ago after I was bitten by the Arthropleura. I saw Helena in front me”, he told Ed. “Why aren’t you telling anyone that you know Helena is alive?”, Edd asked. “I’m keeping it secret because she hasn’t contacted me directly”, Ed claimed. “I’m upset that you already knew this and didn’t tell anyone before the sewer incursion!”, Edd said angrily. ” I’m sorry, Edd. She is probably a cruel, and uncaring woman because she didn’t do anything to help you when you were bitten, and how she let me grieve over her”, Ed said. “Helena had her reasons, Ed”, Edd claimed. “More than anything, I want to know the truth, but I feel that it’s probably better for us not to ever know than to face the potential painful truth”, Ed explained. “I agree not to tell the others about Helena, but if it were up to me, I would willingly go after her. You’re not alone, Ed. I want to learn about Helena, too”, he told his professor friend.



Johnson house



1:40 PM



Meanwhile, at the Johnson house, a plumber came down with Paige down into the flooded basement. “These water levels are extremely high. You’re lucky they haven’t flooded the entire house! Whatever the water level, I will see what I can do to try and fix it!”, the plumber said enthusiastically. The plumber then went into the water to check the submerged washing machine. The light from the anomaly shined under the waters but neither the plumber nor Paige saw it. “The washing machine is not responsible for this flood, ma’am”, he noted to Paige. He suddenly heard a splash nearby. “Is that your dog, ma’am?”, he asked. ‘Erm, we don’t have a pet”, Paige told him before going back up into the house. He continued to look around the flooded basement. The plumber eventually came across a Hesperornis. Before the confused plumber could say anything, the Hesperornis went into a frenzy, and started attacking him. The bird caused him to fall into the water and then jumped in to attack him until he reached the stairs that led out of the basement. During the aftermath of the Hesperornis attack, Paige came in as the plumber recovered, and began to leave the basement. Suddenly, the Hesperornis pulled the plumber into the water, and killed him. Paige screamed in horror during the attack.



State Office



2:00 PM



Back at the State Office, word had leaked out about the Hesperornis attack on the plumber in Paige Johnson’s basement. ‘I’m convinced that the report on the attack was faked or exaggerated”, Kevin cynically and skeptically remarked. “I don’t think so, Kevin. The report claimed that a large reptile was responsible. That sounds like our guy”, May told him. “I guess that the house is on Ed’s fault line and therefore, he was right”, Kevin said.



Johnson house



2:40 PM



Back in the flooded basement, the Hesperornis swam back through the anomaly. The lost diver that was trapped on the other side of the anomaly had apparently died and his corpse floated through the anomaly into the basement, and to the surface. At the same time, Captain Jonny 2×4, and his men had arrived in the cul-de-sac, and at the Johnson house by car. “There is a second body in the basement”, Jonny 2×4 told his men, and they secured the perimeter, and headed single-file into the house. His men entered the basement and retrieved the late diver’s body, but before they could take it away, their captain stopped them in their tracks. “Hold up, guys!”, he ordered. Jonny noticed a handkerchief with the name “Helena” written on it. He took the handkerchief and called May on his phone.



State Office



2:45 PM



At the State Office, May, and Kevin were discussing on how they were going to cover the current anomaly incursion up. Suddenly, May received a call on her phone. “Jonny and his men have found the lost diver’s body in the basement”, she informed Kevin. Upon hearing this new information, Kevin became even further upset.



Cul-de-sac



3:30 PM



May drove to the Johnson house. She entered the cul-de-sac and pulled up at the house. “Hello, May!”, Captain Jonny greeted. “Hi!”, she greeted Jonny in return. “The body was that of the same diver that went through the anomaly in the Creek. He seemed to have died from shock”, Jonny explained. The captain then showed May Kanker the handkerchief. The diver’s body was loaded into an ambulance truck, while May continued to look into the name that was written on the hankie: “Helena”. Upon realizing what this meant, May became shocked, and distressed. Ed and Edd had also arrived alongside May and were on the stairs watching the soldiers clear the flooded basement. May entered the house and walked towards Ed. She then showed Ed the handkerchief and caused him to realize that she knew about Helena being alive as well.



4:00 PM



May and Ed talked at the back of the house. “Look, Helena’s aunt would have given us similar messages for birthdays and Christmas. That message we found on the diver is a message from Helena that says that she is waiting for us on the other side of the anomaly just as she was in the sewer incursion last time”, Ed explained. “I wanna know why you lied to me and the whole team about Helena, Ed”, May demanded angrily. “I was in such shock learning she was still alive a few days ago”, he tried to justify. “I’m still very angry with you, Ed. You didn’t consider the benefit of Helena’s more extensive knowledge on the anomalies could grant us. You were also very selfish and arrogant in daring to choose what the team should, and shouldn’t know”, she said. “This whole thing is personal because she’s my wife”, Ed again tried to justify. ‘That is no excuse, Ed. Your stupid decision affects the whole team and if you cannot bring yourself to understand that, I will kick you out of the entire anomaly operation”, she told Ed firmly, and angrily.



4:10 PM



Outside the house, Marie, and Edd were unloading equipment. Neither one of them said a word to each other. “Look, I remember what happened when I was poisoned and I understand why you’re so pissed with me now”, he told Marie. However, Marie was still upset at him. “You were willing to cheat with me on Ellie”, she angrily told him. ‘Me and Ellie are no longer close”, Edd apologized. However, Marie was still angry with Edd. I just liked you at first but I don’t anymore. Kevin had arrived by car escorted by the police just outside the Johnson house. “Hey, Kevin!”, Captain Jonny greeted him. After saying hello to the captain, he walked into the house.



4:30 PM



Twenty minutes later, the team held a meeting in the living room of the house. “Alright, gang. The truth about Helena has slipped out of Ed’s mouth. Helena is in fact still alive and is living on the other side of the anomaly”, Kevin told the rest of the team. “How are we gonna to explain to her how much everything has changed in the present? Last year, we got a new fourth season of Spongebob Squarepants!”, Double D comically joked. “This is serious, Double D. This is no time for jokes!”, May told him. “We must get her knowledge on the anomalies because she is 8 years ahead of us on understanding them in that regard. Her deeper knowledge in the anomalies could have great benefits for us in controlling the anomalies”, Kevin declared. “Our team will go through the anomalies to find her when she wants to make contact and I want you, Ed, to be the one who who goes through the anomaly in that basement to find her. You will however not be going in there alone. You will get a military escort as you go in. This will protect you and Helena on the other side of the anomaly”, he explained to Ed. “Really, Kevin?”, he asked reluctantly. “If you refuse, I will remove you from the anomaly team and send in the military to find Helena themselves”, he told Ed firmly. ‘Okay, fine. I agree to go through the anomaly in search of her, but two conditions: one, I go in alone, and two, if she refuses to come back, which she probably will, she won’t be forced to. “I’m not sure if we should trust him in this mission of finding Helena, Kevin”, she worryingly told Kevin. “I’m confident that Ed won’t risk the consequences of betraying the team a second time”, Kevin said. “Remember, Ed. Your loyalty is to us and not to Helena”, Kevin warned him.



5:00 PM



Ed had geared up in the flooded basement to swim through the anomaly and to begin his mission in finding Helena. “You will be reeled back in the present like a fish by that rope around your waist after two hours”, his friend Edd told him, who was also in there the basement. “Take this against any creatures you encounter on the other side of the anomaly”, Edd said as he handed him a harpoon gun for protection. “I think you’ll need it, buddy”, Edd told him. Back outside the house, Kevin, and May were talking. “No. We are not doing that!”, May fiercely demanded against whatever Kevin told her. Back in the basement, Ed had fully geared up, and was about to enter the anomaly. He dove underwater and towards the anomaly as Edd, Jonny 2×4, and May watched from the stairs, and began to feed out the rope.",0,1757368420.0,ededdneddy,0,0.5,False

1nc10h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nc10h6/psa_black_sulphur_springs/,PSA; Black Sulphur Springs,"Last weekend, and the proceeding days, have affected me in ways I’m not sure I can see unless I write them down. Only accounting for this week, today was like every other day. I woke up, went to work, hated it, and came home to silently but concerningly observe my boyfriend’s behavior. It has been extremely routine, and we haven’t talked much. 


 When I get up for work, he’s already left. When he arrives home after me, he’s been, well… soaking wet. Dripping through the house, then, he’s already in the bathroom showering, and goes to bed immediately after. His demeanor seems content, and it has been considerably hot out recently. It would be possible that he’s been sweaty and tired for 6 or 7 days. It would be possible to me, if I’d spoken more than a few words to him in that time. 
	

The few brief conversations we have abruptly end the same way; 

“I’m tired but, we should go back to the hot springs this weekend.” The last thing I want to hear. 


 Black Sulphur Springs is just a few hours away from our house. It’s a bit of a local secret, and usually not busy due to it being at least a 2 hour drive on switchback logging roads. There’s a small shack over the deepest pool, and a few shallow outdoor pools that connect into a creek. An ideal camping get away, and I’m praying I will never have to go back. 


 I’m going to try to convey the course of events while at Black Sulphur Springs, as best I can. I already feel like I’ve lost some of it, but I think I need help. 
	

 I didn’t get off work until 6:00 last Saturday, and we got a bit of a late start so we didn’t make it there until around 10:00pm. It was getting dark, and we pulled up to the campground closest to the springs to see if anyone was in the shack, or outdoor pools. We didn’t see anyone, but could hear sudden splashing and a man’s voice; “Come see for yourself!” In a non-threatening tone. Must be occupied.
	

 We decide to go to farthest camp site, just over a small hill. The walk is only about 10-15 minutes. We like the privacy. 
      

 It doesn’t matter how many times I’ve been camping, or how many guns my boyfriend brings, in this case two. It’s always been a slightly stressful experience for me. I’ve got anxiety, could even say paranoia. I’ve always been able to have a good time though. Even when constantly scanning my surroundings and listening to every twig snap through the night. Arriving at night did not help, but I was happy and excited to finally be there. 
	

 Everything was going great at first. After we set up the tent and blankets, got the fire going, we were so excited to try out our new camping chairs. I splurged and got a camp recliner, which turned out to be less of a chair and more of an almost vertical hammock.  Almost impossible to sit in and not look at the stars, as it sucks you in while letting your ass and lower back nearly scrape the ground. He tries to cheer me up, in case I’m scorned over my $80 purchase;


“You can sit in my chair when you want to look at the fire.” It worked, I chuckled and was a little relieved knowing full well I was taking his chair. 
	

 Before he pulls his chair out of the bag, I see a glimpse of the label; “Little Adventurer”. Right as I exclaim my findings, he pulls it out and flicks it open in one motion. The chair is probably a foot tall and two feet wide. 


“Weird name for a camp chair.” I say smugly, but inevitably take the toddler seat. 
	

 We made hotdogs and joked around the fire for about an hour, as it grew darker I became slightly more jumpy and restless. 


“Wanna check out the hot springs? It might be empty now.” I asked with anticipation. 


“Sure, let’s grab some firewood on the way back. I didn’t bring any but most of those other camp spots were empty.” 
	

 We headed down the road with our flashlights, the night was quiet and calm. There was actually only one other camper, one in an RV. As we approach the main parking lot and entrance to the springs, we notice a car parked in one of the exits of the parking lot. It was pointing as if it were leaving the parking lot, but empty and not running. 
	

 As we came closer, we noticed all the windows were down. He pointed his flash light at the car, and we see there are no windows at all. They’ve all been broken. As we make it around the front of the car, we see the windshield is completely collapsed and the driver side mirror is dangling by its wires. 
	

“Holy shit.” He said, more interested than concerned. 
	

“What’s that stain?” I noticed something brown had poured out of the passenger side and down the outside door panel. 
	

“Blood?” 
	

“Could be coffee” I say, “looks like a roll over?” 
	

“How did they get it here though?”
	

 He had a valid point, if you rolled anywhere on this road for 20 miles in either direction, you would not be getting the vehicle back. If you did, why would they drop it here?  The car was pretty much empty, no blood or coffee on the inside.


 The campground had been quiet this whole time so we were hopeful the shack was empty, but we heard quiet splashing as we approached. 
	

 “Should we just try in the morning?” He asked.
	

 I nodded, and we took another bewildered look at the car before heading back.  We collected large sticks, and he barbarically carried a few small stumps back to the camp to burn as well. We never strayed far from the road, not that I would have. The woods were honestly so quiet, and peaceful. No twigs snapping in the distance, no fire crackling but ours. The creek was so distant, the hill almost completely silenced it.
	

 We found ourselves whispering the rest of the night, as if to not offend the dead silence. Until, that is, we hear a familiar voice in the distance; “Come see for yourself!” Initially I was not concerned but began to internally question If I would even be able to hear the other camper from their campsite across the hill. It didn’t happen again, so I chose to keep it to myself. 

	
 The closer it got to bedtime, the more I began thinking about how long I’ll lay awake. Hyper-focusing on every snap, crunch, and whistle of the forest and imagining the best defense mechanism for every possible scenario. It all feels pretty normal to me, but he didn’t seem to think so, and confronted me about regularly scanning the areas beyond the fire with my flash light. 


“Just turn it off, it’s fine there’s almost no one else here. “


“I know...” I turn off the flashlight. 


 “Plus, if any critters come out, I have these if we need them.” He motioned to his revolver in his bag, and his lever gun placed beside him. 


“I know, are they loaded?” 
 
 I asked, knowing that I hoped they were in case of emergency, but was also uncomfortable. Because they are loaded guns. They just make me nervous, like everything else. 


 “There isn’t a bullet in the chamber so they can’t go off, once I cock them they can be fired. They won’t be though.” he chuckled slightly at the end.He showed and demonstrated with the lever gun, which was comforting. 
	

“I wish you’d put one in my chamber.” I joked.

	
 I had to lighten the mood the only way I know how. He snorted and shoved me, asking if I’m ready for bed. I agree, and we go to sleep in the tent. 
	

 He put the revolver in a built in pouch in the tent on his side, right by his head. He laid the lever gun on the ground next to him. My side of the makeshift blanket-bed faced the fire, and the door. The amber lighting and not being next to effectively a giant blind spot, made me feel content.  
	

 I fell asleep shockingly fast. Sometime later I woke up for a moment, the lighting from the fire was at half mass. It is so, so silent and still out. The fire is the only noise I can isolate, and even it’s quiet. It’s ideal, and I doze off again. 
	

 I remember waking up again from a noise, somewhat startled and my eyes fogged over. Almost a little grumbling sound, maybe? It’s silent for a couple seconds and my eyes barely adjust, when I hear it again. I can immediately identify the noise as the zipper of the entrance of the tent, right by my feet. It wasn’t at a hurried pace and only unzipped maybe an inch or so. I couldn’t look down, paralyzed in fear. I swing my left arm rapidly against his chest to wake him. 


 “What?” He whispers groggily.  


 “Something is unzipping the tent” I say, not looking at him, or at my feet, but straight up at the ceiling of the tent.  


 He grabs his lever gun off the ground, kneels with it for a moment, and exits the tent. This is when my memory gets the fuzziest, I was sitting up at one point, waiting for him to return. I was laying down at one point too, looking at his side of the bed, empty. Then I awoke suddenly, the fire completely out, I look to my left and see him laying next to me. Sleeping, peacefully I watch him for several minutes, I must have groggily decided it was a dream and didn’t want to wake him. 
	

 The dead silence is broken again, by rain. It is gentle at first, but rapidly grows harsher. He wakes up briefly, we look at each other for a moment, and fall asleep, this time, for the rest of the night. 
	

 He wakes me up in the morning after he’s started the fire, we make some breakfast and I half jokingly bring up my dream. 
 

 “I had a weird dream, well I think it was a dream.”


 “Oh?”


 “Yeah, uh I thought I heard someone unzipping the tent, and woke you up?” 


 “Oh, nope I don’t think so.”


 “Okay, cool you would definitely remember, you went outside and checked. In the dream.” 


 “Yeah you’re good, I wouldn’t ever leave the tent.”


 “Good to know.” We laugh off the absurdity, and during a pause he goes back in the tent. He grabs his lever gun, when he comes out he motions to me, 


“See, if I would have had-‘


 He pauses for just a moment while looking down, and I already knew what he was going to say. 


  “there’s one in the chamber.” I can tell he’s serious, not overly concerned but was telling the truth.


 “You grabbed the lever gun too, in the…dream.”


 “I wouldn’t have gone out of the tent…it is weird though.” He tries to sound reassuring.

 	
 We make our way to the hot springs, it’s about 6:00 am so we’re hopeful it’s empty. Once we make it to the parking lot we see the white and green trucks that say “Law Enforcement” on the side, and several officers putting caution tape around the car, some taking pictures. We pass by them, they look us over but say nothing. 
	

 The shack is empty, so we soak for about an hour. By the time we were done, the parking lot was still just as busy with work instead of recreation. We passed by and one of the officers briefly asked, “You guys alright?” 
“Yep!” We both reply. 
	

 He beats my pace back to the camp, a little rude but it’s not a habit. We just packed up and left. We listened to the radio the whole way back, and didn’t really speak. He seemed fine though, I wasn’t concerned until we got home.
	

 We unpacked, and he spent a few hours throwing up in the yard. I suppose he didn’t want to keep our only bathroom occupied. Thoughtful. Which made me feel even more sympathy for him. I tried my hardest stand with him. I didn’t make it very long. 
	

 I felt so bad, I repeatedly tried to give him water, but I could never be out there for more than a few moments. It made the air around him thick and reek of decay. It was like, roadkill and rotten eggs. His body contorts and his ribs flex at max capacity when hurling, It looked so strenuous and painful. I couldn’t stand it for more than a few minutes. I asked a couple times if he needed to go to the hospital, always refused, per usual. 
	

 Next thing I knew he showered, and went to sleep. I wish I could say that’s a good thing, but that’s all I’ve actually seen him do. That and our brief conversations that end in him asking to go to the hot springs again. He goes to work, I’m assuming he must eat lunch at least. He does hum, a lot. More than before, and music that I didn’t know he really enjoyed. Songs that we never listen to, anyway. 
	

 This was supposed to be the end of a desperate attempt to get this all down as vividly as possible, but it’s taken me two days to write this in my free time. In those two days, the only new or interesting development was last night. 

 I decided to go online and see if I can find anything  on recent car accidents near Black Sulphur springs. I didn’t find any, but I did see a few deaths throughout the years, “accidental deaths” but I read a few obituaries.I noticed a considerable amount of them were single people. 20’s and 30’s, and single parents with children missing in the same county as well. 

 What I already knew to be true was the massive forest fire that engulfed the hot springs and surrounding areas in the past. The land, except near the water, was still barely recovering after over 70 years. Which I still find odd, considering a forest that I grew up near burned 20 years ago when I was a child. It’s not very far north of there, and its recovery is astonishing. 
	

 I don’t know what to make of any of this, except a sense of urgency to get it out of my head, and maybe some validation that I’m crazy. Maybe something, said by anybody, can convince me not to go back to Black Sulphur Springs. I need a real reason, and he thinks we are leaving after work tomorrow.

My workplace got a coffee maker about three years ago.  The coffee dude told us that we should not put things on top of this model.  So the receptionist makes a little paper sign and sticks it on top of the coffee machine.  ""PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ON TOP OF THE COFFEE MACHINE"".



For years people follow this little rule.  Recently, the sign blew off and got dirty.  Receptionist tosses the sign and says she will make another one when she gets around to it because obviously everyone knows the rule by now.

1nc0yb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1nc0yb3/mismatches_or_red_flags_discernment_after_a/,Mismatches or red flags - discernment after a relationship,"Hi all,
I’m continuing to reflect on my last relationship of two years and trying to take the lessons to heart. It’s possible there were early incompatibilities around pacing and emotional warmth. I’m not trying to just list grievances, as I know there are two sides to everything, but as I’m going through the list of receipts I’d really appreciate an outside perspective.

I did self-advocate throughout the relationship, but in retrospect, I wonder if he was emotionally unavailable - either to me or just in general.

I often felt insecure in the relationship, and I’m trying to understand how much of that is mine to own, versus how much was due to a mismatch… or even borderline emotional abuse. The insecurity led to trust issues, jealousy, and a ripple effect where I started reading his behavior through a lens of rejection. Eventually, I needed a lot of reassurance just to feel secure in the relationship. That inability to “take his feelings at face value” became one of the reasons for the relationship’s end. Now I wonder how much sooner I should have walked away.

Here are some early moments that made me uneasy — in each case, I advocated for myself:

	•	Early lack of reciprocity in warmth/flirting: On our third date, I joked about being distracted by him while parallel parking. He didn’t reciprocate the energy, and that was a pattern.

	•	Frequent date cancellations for the first 6 months. We barely saw each other.

	•	Not wanting to sleep next to me because it disrupted his sleep. He asked me to sleep on the couch. 

	•	Resistance to doing things I liked: Video games I played, watching rom-coms, going places in my city. He often said “hard pass” or complained when he did go along. I planned dates, but many ideas were dismissed unless I gave lots of options.

	•	Disrespect during shared time: Leaving trash at my favorite coffee shop, complaining at the grocery store, scoffing at restaurants I picked.

	•	Resistance to other relational needs: Asking him to move the bed so I could get out, waking up together, attending work events, meeting my parents — many small asks were met with frustration or refusal.

	•	Restaurant incident early on: I picked a place; he looked at the menu, scoffed, and left. Second place had hookah — “too smoky.” Third place had some other issue. He laughed it off eventually, but I felt like I couldn’t win.

	•	Naming imbalances = “scorekeeping”: When I pointed out patterns like me doing all the driving, I was accused of keeping score. 

	•	Complaints about not meeting my friends — after he’d declined all previous invites. Then canceled when I finally scheduled something, and got upset when I didn’t show more understanding.

	•	Critiquing small things about me: Not saying “bless you,” how I did empathy, being “on my phone,” or not being affectionate or supportive enough. I was often misperceived — even sighing was seen as “lashing out.” He once said I was using him as an emotional punching bag. Generally he underrepresented the things I did do and over represented what he was doing in a way that he felt resentful about.

	•	Teasing & name-calling: Making jokes about my instant coffee, calling me “Butterfingers,” mocking me when I had brain fog. Once called me a “sperm receptacle” and said he was “just joking.”

	•	Shallow or conditional compliments: He once said he hoped I’d never get fat. I remember asking on our one-year anniversary, “Do you even LIKE me?”

	•	Criticisms near the end: He said I was emotionally retaliatory, manipulative, jealous, robotic, distant, nonchalant, passive aggressive. And yeah — by that point, it was hard for me to stay open and loving.


I know this sounds like a terrible relationship, but I’m not trying to villainize him. There were also happy memories. He could be compassionate and listen well. Eventually, some of these behaviors changed.

But here’s the thing: when things finally felt better — when we had worked through so much and I thought we were closer than ever — that’s when he started sabotaging the relationship again. Lying. Disrespect. Name-calling. Rehashing things I’d done “wrong” a year earlier, even after I had changed.

I’m not looking for pity — I’m looking for reflection. Which of these things are just part of navigating differences in relationships, with boundaries and communication? Which were true red flags I should have walked away from immediately?

Or is there someone out there who could have handled this type of energy no problem?

Thanks for reading.

We have been talking on Hinge for a few days and he asked me out for a coffee date. I realised that when I looked on my profile I didn't have any pictures of me waist down. I'm a plus size girl and while my weight has been a huge sense of insecurity for me I've been trying to love myself for me more. But dating is a whole other factor. He's conventionally attractive and thin, and I am actually terrified of the first meeting. I've been in relationships before but those people were people I met irl and we were friends before we started dating, but online dating is a huge jump for me. Am I deceiving him by not showing the whole me? Is he expecting something or somebody else? I'm terrified of a bad reaction towards my size and if this would be a traumatic experience. 

Am I overreacting?

1nc0tib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nc0tib/aitah_for_letting_my_children_hear_a_voicemail/,AITAH for letting my children hear a voicemail from their deceased half brother.,"Hello Reddit, I'm a long time lurker who's enjoyed this site over coffee, first time account creator as I've hit a wall where I can't get a straight answer from my family and figure “hey, the Internet is famously impartial.” OK so really I just got back from a family dinner and may be unwinding a little. 

Usual background rules I've seen are names are changed, ages are correct and I'm in the UK. I (M38) met my first partner Thea (F) when we were both eighteen and had our boy Jamie together, while we didn't last as live in partners we were still on friendly terms as co-parents until a tragic car crash that took Jamie (M8 at the time) and Thea (age 27 at the time) from this world. I took their passing hard and it took a few years with support from my family and now wife Sarah (F39) to open up to the world again. 

With Sarah I have two more beautiful children, Tommy (M8) and Chloe (F5). Now onto tonight, we were having a family dinner with my parents, brother, his wife and my nieces when conversation moved to Jamie and Thea (not led by me but I'm happy to share memories when they come up). My kids are aware of them in general and as an atheist/agnostic family we say they passed away however I hope if there is a world after they are together. 

My kids were a bit more curious than they've normally been after hearing little stories over dinner so I played them a voicemail I had recorded and saved of Jamie calling from his mom's phone cheering that he’d got a white belt and his karate school had agreed to teach him (I know basically his mom had asked for classes and they'd said yes) but it was still a big thing to Jamie and told Tommy and Thea while they wouldn't meet Jamie in this world he'd have loved them. 

Sarah gave a quick thank you for dinner and packed the kids in the car for our drive home, I also said a quick goodbye with my mom crying at Jamie's voice and my dad telling me to apologise to Sarah, once we got home we put the kids to bed and then Sarah basically told me off saying I was confusing our kids and it wasn't appropriate to discuss the dead at their ages.
So I guess I'm asking AITAH for oversharing the memory of my first son with my kids?

I was the BEST mentally while I was on it. I was always known as the “anxious girl”, then life happened and I became the anxious depressed girl. Lexapro changed that, and even now, years later, I still can’t believe that I had a period in my life when I wasn’t depressed or feeling like I would die due to irrational thoughts at any given second. 

Unfortunately, all that happiness and “stability” went down the drain when I started gaining weight caused by the sudden insatiable appetite and the constant fatigue. 
The weight I gained was so fast, and very ‘resistant’ to be lost when I tried to. 
The fatigue and sleeping a lot was also so bad that I would miss all of my morning and noon classes and had to switch to night classes. My roommates used to say I was like a dead person because my alarm would wake up everyone in the house except me, and I was never like that. I spoke with my doctor, made me change the timing of my dose (took it in the morning instead of before bed) and gradually increased it. Still nothing, just made the fatigue worse. I would reach the 3rd cup of coffee to ‘wake me up’ and it just wouldn’t work, just almost gave myself heart attacks and sweats. I felt like a zombie. 

Anyways we shifted to Wellbutrin, it gave me really bad heart palpitations and brought back my anxiety, and I would sweat like crazy even at freezing temps. He upped my dose, and unfortunately my blood pressure would rise and that was scary so I asked to change it all together. 

Shifted to Brintellix, I felt like nothing. During the trial and errors we had once the side effects were showing with Lexapro, my anxiety came back, and my depression came back. Also Brintellix was expensive and felt like I was taking a placebo pill, even after “giving it a chance” for two years. 

I eventually quit antidepressants all together, but I am at a point where I feel being unmedicated isn’t for me, as I am mentally back to square one, but fatter. I miss Lexapro..without its side effects. I feel like I need to go back, but I’m curious if anyone had a similar journey and finally found something that actually worked for them without the weight gain, brain fogs or fatigue.",2,1757367683.0,lexapro,1,1.0,False

* 8:00 PM: Dinner at [**Lucin Kantun**](https://lucinkantun.com/)

* 10:00 AM: Massage at **Excelsior Spa** (book in advance)
* Afternoon: Old Town after the rain lifted
* Late lunch at [**Nishta**](https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Restaurant_Review-g295371-d1216374-Reviews-or330-Nishta-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html), amazing vegan/vegetarian spot

**Tips & Tricks**

**Cash & Coins**  
Bring a coin purse, you’ll get loads of change back. We brought cash to exchange but never found a bank that was open when it was convenient for us so ended up taking out cash via ATM, which was not fun with fees/exchange rates. Wish we had planned this better!

**Driving**  
Roads are narrow and drivers go fast. Having a rental car was convenient, but expect tight turns and aggressive passing. We also had some trouble navigating in Hvar, being directed down sidewalks on two occasions. Be careful! Roads in Hvar were especially harrowing. VERY tiny, fast drivers, and the one to our Airbnb was 1 mile down a steep, unpaved cliff that Ubers would not drive to.

**Language & Hospitality**  
Everyone spoke English and was incredibly polite. Honestly, I’m surprised by posts suggesting otherwise. We had nothing but warm, welcoming interactions. Croatia is very tourist friendly!

**Pizza**  
Best pizza we’ve ever had! And that’s saying a lot, coming from people who know NYC and Italy well. Croatia does it better.

Worked together, families vacationed together, talked all the time, borderline emotionally involved. Both married happily. Basically few years ago coworkers family and mine were away on vacation, and the day we got home he told me we can’t be best friends anymore. Yada yada, I dealt with that poorly but whatever. I was open with my spouse about it but I do not believe coworker was open with his spouse as much as I was. 

Took it hard, developed closer friends at work, and one girl specifically (31f). Became bff, cried together over things, relied on each other, supported each other. I started getting a feeling she had been becoming close with my ex best friend (40m) and she denied they text or talk very much. But she seemed to know everything he was doing, where he was working, always chatting at work. Things I used to do with him. His name comes up many times in her conversations.. so I took it upon myself, as I should not have, to snoop when she gave me her phone to order coffee. I decided to peek at her text to prove to myself that they don’t communicate often. But there it was, they had been talking shit via text 1 hour prior, from across the room. And the texts went further and further back, so often it reminded me of MY friendship with him. 

Now I’m mad at myself for snooping, more angry that she didn’t defend me when ex-best friend said something rude, and mad at him for making a comment that was hurtful. We were attached. Like I said yes, too much and emotionally attached to the point it interfered with his marriage. We created space and distance and navigated through it differently. BFF (31f) was there for me as support. And now she’s basically taken my place at HIS side as his new bestie and my feelings are hurt AF. 

No, she doesn’t know I snooped. But she knows something is up and probably assumed I saw something because I handed her phone back and completely changed my demeanor. 

ETA- I’m hurt that my actions interfered with someone else’s marriage. Nothing ever happened but I underestimated the toll emotional attachment can take on relationships. I own that. I’m ashamed. But I’m trying to figure out how to navigate friendship with 31f. ",1,1757367314.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Strange is rather subjective and their observations don’t really bother me. I’m confidant enough to feel I’d have a relationship if I wanted one - which I do, but that thought is really just a thought at this point. I’m very independent and I spent a good part of my earlier adult life following the Grateful Dead & Floyd, owning a little coffee house/art gallery with my Hubs (passed 5 years ago), who was also a musician in a Reggae band for 30 yrs., so my style is very eclectic and based on my daily moods - goth, punk, hippie, whatever. I’m involved with the local music scene and love drum circles and free-style dancing. I’m never at a loss for attention from men. I have always had very long hair and stayed out of the sun so I have no wrinkles to speak of. No one ever guesses my age any older than 40 and I know I’m attractive. But I usually keep these guys at an arms length, emotionally, because having been in a relationship for so many years, I’m just starting to think about that. Lately, someone I’ve known forever started hanging out with my group of friends. We get along very well and have some kind of spiritual connection. I haven’t thought of him romantically but I adore his friendship. I say and do whatever I want - I don’t really care what others think. He’s much the same. He even ate shrooms and went traipsing around the woods with me at night (I like to keep it spooky)! I’d say, the only area we don’t see eye to eye on is politics… Which hasn’t been an issue since we’re really only friends. Last week he rode his Harley down to Alabama to visit his daughter and he’s been texting me while he’s away. Which isn’t unusual. Except yesterday, one of his texts sounded subtly flirty, and has got me a little worried and confused, because it’s gotten under my skin and I don’t know what to think. I certainly don’t want to screw up our friendship by reading something into his text if there was nothing to it. In the text he brought up a experience when we were out hiking a favorite trail and after eating our packed lunch which consisted of a bottle of wine, I ducked into the bushes to relieve myself since we were a number of miles in the forest. I was wearing a long hippie skirt and he asked if I wanted him to hold onto my skirt so I could manage my panties, which I only took as a friend helping a friend thing. But I replied, I’m not wearing any. Apparently, it’s been on his mind for him to bring it up. I replied, I was a poor kid and didn’t always have panties to wear, and I sometimes slip into old habits. I then texted that I was a little drunk when I told him my secret and he replied, “back in the day I woulda taken a look.” As I was trying to process that, he then wrote, “I should have”. So, there it is. That string left me wondering if I should say something. Because, like I said, it’s gotten under my skin and thinking maybe… I just haven’t dated anyone yet and don’t want to screw thongs up if I’m wrong or limit myself off I’m right.

For reference I'm f27 and diagnosed and take the lowest dose of Vyvanse 3 days per week for the last year. Before this I was not on meds. 

When I started the Vyvanse I found that it really helped me nor want other stuff; I found it easy to work all day and didn't drink any caffeine on it. As the year progressed, ive found myself craving more and more stimulants/stimulating things, both on and off meds. 

Some examples: craving drinking coffee or other caffeinated drinks even on Vyvanse. 1 dessert no longer feels like enough and I often feel a strong desire for a second dessert. Regrettably I took up social smoking (cigarettes, once a month or so at social functions with other smokers) last year since I don't drink and now (as expected) I find myself craving cigarettes. Its like my brain gets a bit of stimulants and goes MORE MORE MORE. It wants to be hopped up on Vyvanse, caffeine, sugar and nicotine. 

Not sure if relevant but I exercise regularly and haven't really found that it reduces this. Prior to Vyvanse I drank several cups of coffee per day except for a one year decaf period, in which I felt great but still craved coffee daily. I also have a satisfying social life and hobbies.

Any advice? Not sure if I should ask for different meds or try to do a dopamine detox or not. The rate of craving increase has worried me and I've gained 10 lbs over the last year.

If anyone’s in the market for handmade rustic furniture, I’d love to share my family’s work with you. We’ve run a woodworking business here in the Valley for over 20 years, and my dad is the brains and talent behind it all. He’s a former NYPD cop turned comedian and carpenter — so as you can imagine, he’s both creative and meticulous.

He’s built **thousands of custom pieces** over the years — kitchen tables, coffee tables, benches, bookshelves, bedframes, vanities, record cases, and more. If you can dream it, he can build it. Every piece is high-quality, unique, and built to last — but also affordable.

On a personal note: my dad was recently approved for a kidney transplant, which is a huge milestone for our family. Once he has the surgery, he’ll be out of work for a while, so I’m trying to help him ramp up sales in the meantime to give him a little cushion to heal and rest.

If you’re interested, I’d be happy to send you photos of his work or even set up a visit to his workshop in North Hollywood. The pieces are beautiful, the craftsmanship speaks for itself, and supporting him would mean the world to us.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and for considering our little family business ❤️

1nc0g3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nc0g3s/story_about_how_my_familys_negligence_destroyed/,Story about how my family’s negligence destroyed my spine irreversibly,"Most of my family's biggest problems can be traced back to the fact that, on too many occasions, too many people said “it'll be fine” and shrugged it off instead of effectively solving the problem. My spine is one of them.

When I was 7-8 years old, the most enjoyable way to spend my time was playing games. I played on an old PC that was placed on a coffee table against the wall, and I sat on a square footrest, not on a chair with a full-on backrest and armrests. They tried to suggest an armchair, but our armchairs were too big because they were typical living room furniture, they had very deep seats. To lean back, I would have to move back and straighten my legs, which would put me too far from the keyboard and mouse. A 7-8-year-old child does not think about the long-term effects of sitting in a hunched position, so I went back to the footrest anyway. I sat on it in a hunched position for several hours a day. My mother was happy because at least I wasn't misbehaving like the rest of my peers, and the house was quiet because I was busy playing Sacred Gold and Cultures - 8th Wonder of the World. From the age of 10, my knees were too high and the coffee table began to feel uncomfortable. Armchairs “for adults” were still uncomfortable, so I just didn't use them. Due to the lack of ergonomics, I gave up PC gaming for a few years. I preferred Playstation because at least I could sit cross-legged or on a couch and it was a bit more comfortable, but my spine still suffered. My parents also had their own budget PC in their bedroom, but I had limited time to play there. 

Then, on my 13th birthday, mom asked me what I would like as a gift, so I replied, not caring about the long-term consequences ofc, that I would like either a kid-sized 50cc dirt bike, (which was and I bet still it is a considerable luxury among “popular kids” in rural areas and small towns) or my own PC. Mom probably thought that if I rode that bike I would break a limb in an accident and if she bought me a computer to have lower risk hobby. The latter also resulted in me not developing socially in any way and having very big problems with my peers. I didn’t ever play with voice chat because first few times talking to a computer seemed so weird for my family that they entered the room and asked if I am feeling okay since I am talking to noone. Not talking seemed better than explaining myself everytime so I’ve on voice chat literally only 2 or 3 times. Asperger's syndrome further exacerbated these problems. 

With my own PC, I started spending much more time at my desk, and shortly after receiving this gift, I decided that the office chair (similar are advertised as meant for kids 6-12) I used only for doing my homework was absolutely awful and uncomfortable. It was definitely too small, and the lumbar support became more harmful than beneficial. A year later, I started complaining that my back hurt, but the rest of my family said I was a hypochondriac, that I only thought there was something wrong with my spine and that I should go outside (to whom, since no one liked me?) and that I was too young to complain about my back. At 15 the pain was sometimes so severe that I would get up from the computer on my own. I just didn't talk about it cause I knew my thoughts could be gaslit in a split second, just like on every other topic. They gave me a new chair (a real office chair for adults) when I started saying that the one I had before (children's chair) was uncomfortable. **The poor quality and too small size of it were a stronger arguments than the severity of the changes in my spine.** The chair came from my parents' room, where they had their PC but didn't use it, so they got rid of PC and the desk. Their chair wasn't new, rather worn out, but at least much better than the children's one. Huge difference. In the meantime, mom, grandmother, and stepdad still didn't want to take me to a neurologist, physical therapist, or orthopedist because they assumed that “it was because of the computer” and that if I went outside to play soccer, everything would be fine and I would be cured. I used it from the age of 15 until I was 20, when I started earning my own money and bought myself a new one, on which I am sitting right now writing this. When I bought it my old chair had the foam compressed so much that it felt like sitting on a stool, and the front of the seat (just under the knees) was so torn that you could see the wooden base under the foam. It wasn't until I was 22 that I went to see my family doctor for a referral and I've heard the same exact thing as above. The family doctor literally said that I was too young to complain about my spine and told me to go to the pool (I can't swim), play soccer (I'm traumatized by being bullied by young soccer kids), or stretch (stretching hurts more).I got angry and had to start undermining her authority before she would write me a referral for an X-ray.

After the X-ray, the radiologist wrote in the notes, “visible subchondral sclerosis in the lumbar spine.”

The only known treatment of subchondral sclerosis is a joint replacement surgery.

I don't see any potential for improvement since I found out about it. Since I’ve been using current chair the pain isn’t so bad. I would even say that the pain decreases slightly with each passing year the longer I use it, but I won't say what brand it is because someone might accuse me of advertising. The pain only affects me when I lift heavy things, so I won't be able to do most crucial exercises in gym, which is a shame because I would like to work on my physique. Barbell squats are one of the most important strength exercises, and I am now 100% unable to do them. New chair reclines pretty far away, so spine isn’t encumbered that much as in sitting position and seat reclines at the same time so It's my new default position to sit. Surgery in a private clinic is crazy expensive, and although the public health service in my country is of a high standard, the queues are absurdly long. I had already started donating blood for charity, because donors who have donated a certain amount of blood are given priority in queues when registering for appointments and surgeries. Only 2 donations more and I will finally cross that treshold. The only visits I could afford right now would be to a physical therapist or orthopedist. If a neurologist were to start discussing the types of artificial disk available for transplantation, I would begin to question whether it was worthwhile to schedule an appointment with him.",1,1757366904.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1nc0fz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1nc0fz1/would_i_be_the_ah_for_going_low_contact_with_my/,Would I be the AH for going low contact with my mom after she unknowingly caused a traumatic childhood?,"**Y’all, this is going to be a long one.**

I (22F) and my mom (47F) are like frenemies, and we aren’t close at all. For your reading pleasure, here’s ALL of the context:

My mom had a horrible childhood. She was abused in every way possible by her parents and other family members, with whom she now has no contact. Even my dad (46M) doesn’t know the entire story or the full extent of the abuse. The only extended family I had regular contact with growing up was on my dad’s side.

Mom doesn’t have great mental health. She was never introduced to the concept of mental health. To her, it’s either: “God is blessing me, and that’s why I’m happy,” or on the flip side, “I’m sad, so I need to pray it away.” (I also believe in God, but I believe He wants us to take care of ourselves and our bodies—including our brains.)

Mom started her downward spiral after my younger brother (18M), was born. I distinctly remember sitting in the backseat of the car at dusk, watching my dad drive toward the huge black silhouette of a building. He told me, “That’s where Mom is staying.” My five-year-old self didn’t realize she had just had a breakdown and was being held in a psychiatric hospital.

After she was released, she started going to her “stress doctor.” We kids didn’t question it. Things were pretty okay until she stopped going to her appointments. By the time I was eight, she was getting more and more upset at smaller and smaller things, particularly with my dad. She would take me out to coffee as an eight-year-old and vent about how angry she was with him, how he reminded her of her family, how everyone was being abusive toward her, and how she was afraid her family would come hurt her at night. I remember trying to calm her down, telling her that Dad wasn’t a bad person, but that only made her more upset. She accused me of not believing her, of turning against her. That, of course, upset me, and I soon learned that anything said during one of her “fits” or “rants” would result in me being gaslit, manipulated, or emotionally battered. Not great.

*(Edit: A big part of my childhood revolved around “tone of voice.” If I gave Mom any feedback about something she said that hurt me, I had to phrase it a certain way. If I didn’t, my hurt got lost in a whirlpool of Mom crying that I hurt her worse with my tone, that I didn’t love her, that I was falling into darkness and sin, and that I needed to beg God for forgiveness because I had taken revenge on her. Looking back, there never was a “correct” tone of voice. I could never get it right. As punishment, my feelings were invalidated. I often hid afterward so I could cry in peace, because if I cried in front of her, she would ask what was wrong, I would tell her, and the cycle would start all over again. For years I thought something was wrong with me because I could never say it right.)*

I didn’t even know this was abnormal until I was about 14, when I started observing more of my friends’ parents. I saw how healthy a mother-daughter relationship could be. When I was at church camp one summer, Mom had a psychotic episode—she jumped out of a moving vehicle and hit a cop. She was put on a psychiatric hold and spent about a week in a hospital. That’s when I learned Mom had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and PTSD years earlier, diagnoses she refused to acknowledge or treat. She believed doctors were out to get her and that my dad wanted to put her in a permanent facility—which was not true. My dad was incredibly loving and patient with her, even though I never saw her do the same for him.

The turning point in our relationship happened when I was 16. I brought up how she used to take me into the car to vent about her trauma. She immediately escalated—calling me a liar, saying it never happened, claiming my tone of voice was wrong, insisting I must be trying to take revenge on her, and that I must not love her if I was saying those things. I tried to explain that I didn’t hold it against her, that I just wanted to work through it together, that I loved her. That only made her blow up into a crying, victimized rage. The cycle went on for HOURS, until I was a confused, sobbing mess on the hallway carpet, screaming at my mom that I did love her and didn’t understand why she was doing this. All I saw was an ice-cold fire in her eyes, and that’s when I understood: anyone who challenged her version of reality would be emotionally pummeled until their willpower was gone. I had seen it happen to my dad, and now it was happening to me. This repeated itself for two years, each time worse than the last.

Fast forward to October 2024 (when I was 21). Mom had yet another major psychotic break (number five). It was 5 a.m. after Halloween. There was freezing rain outside (35°F), and Mom wasn’t in her bed. None of the cars were gone. Her shoes and winter coat were still hanging up, but she was nowhere in or around the house. As my siblings and I waited for the cops to search, we acknowledged to each other that she was probably dead.

She was found walking on the side of the freeway 20 minutes later—no shoes, no coat, ice-cold to the touch, miles from our house. She had left at 1 a.m., saying she heard someone screaming for help. The cops were amazed she was alive. They took her to the hospital, where she stayed for three weeks.

After she returned, she seemed much better. She was taking her meds, sleeping well, and saying she’d continue with them. Unfortunately, that didn’t last.

Now, many of you might blame my dad at this point, and that’s understandable, but here’s the thing: my dad is the most resilient person I know. (I thought he had been stuffing down his emotions for years, but it turns out he’s actually very good at regulating them.) He wanted to wait until all three kids had moved out before confronting Mom, so only he would deal with the fallout. He didn’t realize we were already suffering. That only became painfully clear a couple of weeks ago.

Up until recently, only Dad and I got the worst of Mom’s abuse. That changed. My brother called me upset one weekend, describing the exact same things I went through as a child—plus worse. Mom, in the middle of a fit, picked up a knife and gestured with it toward him, saying that’s how his “tone of voice” felt to her. Dad came downstairs and stepped in when he saw it happening. That seemed to push him to FINALLY confront Mom with reality—that she was abusive because of her unresolved trauma, and that her kids would leave and never come back if she didn’t change.

Now, to the present. I’m in a bad financial spot. Medical debt is mostly to blame. My lease is up at the end of this year, and I find myself being pushed to move back in with my parents. For obvious reasons, I REALLY want to avoid that. My sister (19F) and brother (18M) also want to leave as soon as financially possible. I’ve been looking for roommates online, but that hasn’t gone anywhere.

Dad believes it would be best for me to move back in, saying it would be the quickest way to pay off my debt. He asked me today what it would take for me to agree. I don’t think he understands just how damaging that would be. Mental health isn’t a struggle for him, so it’s very difficult for him to put himself in my shoes. My siblings agree it would be a bad idea. Dad also wants us to participate in an intervention, explaining to Mom why we’re moving out, why we’ll probably go low contact, and why she won’t see future grandkids if she doesn’t change. I don’t know if I’m ready for that.

I’ve struggled with my own mental health over the years, but unlike my mom, I acknowledge it and actively take steps to improve so I don’t hurt others. Breaking the generational curse, as they say.

I’m at a loss. How do I get into a better financial spot without compromising my mental health? How do I help my siblings get out so Dad can have a proper intervention? Do I even want a relationship with my mom after everything? I love her, but I don’t know if she’s even in there anymore. I feel too close to the situation to make sense of it. Is there even a “good” option? They all feel like bad ones.

Would I be the AH if I removed myself from this situation completely?

I know this is a lot to take in, but any advice or perspective would be appreciated. Thanks, y’all.",2,1757366896.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

I’m 24F and just moved to Watford a week ago and I’m looking to have a social life here but don’t really know where to start. 

If anyone is in the same position and would like to meet up and hang out or go to a social event together so it isn’t as intimidating please send me a message! 

Or if anyone knows any good events/ places to meet people I’m open to any suggestions! 

I like to do most things, sports, video games, crochet/arts, coffee, beer etc etc 
I’m not very picky and would be happy to just hang out and do whatever! 

I also speak Spanish, Portuguese and German so if anyone would like to do a language exchange I’d also be so excited for that! 😁 


Thankyou everyone ☺️

I'm still not getting super great sleep quality so I'm assuming that's why. It's also possibly a side effect of me chugging coffee lately to try and offset the loss of nicotine. Or maybe I jumped back into exercise too quickly.

I was a classics major a long time ago so my interests lean towards Greek and Roman philosophy and history. Other areas of interest include the ancient near east, the americas pre contact, and medieval and renaissance history and art. 

The group could certainly expand beyond those area if others members wanted to lead discussions, select books, etc. 

Shoot me a message or post a reply if you’re interested. The group would likely get started in October. Initial discussion ideas are the works of Seneca, Epictetus, or Plato. ",5,1757366379.0,RapidCity,0,1.0,False

I woke up the next morning, feeling refreshed from yesterday’s work spree. I still had a slight throb of pain in my thumb, but it wasn’t necessarily enough to be annoying. I tipped my legs over the side of my bed and began attaching my prosthetic. It was a simple model, but it was all I could afford. It went just about my knee, and was a decent replacement. After that I changed into my uniform, and I heard a knock on the door. I gave a quick “Come In.” to whoever was on the other side. It was the head butler, Reginald. He’s an Irish fellow, about 50 or so. He’s about what you’d expect a stereotypical butler to be like.  
“Good morning. The mistress would like to see you.” Reginald told me. I let out a quiet, disgruntled sigh. Whatever this was, I bet my boss would likely berate me for it. I told him I’d be out in one second, and once I was ready, headed out the door and down the stairs. Mrs. Callenbourogh was in the kitchen, stirring the cream into her coffee. She always likes her cup sweet.  
“Ah, good morning. My husband will be down shortly. We’ve got exciting news for you.” She said, setting down her cup to fetch her husband. I sat at the other end of the table, somewhat confused. She sounded strangely excited. Normally when she summons me it’s when I’m in trouble. A minute or so later, Mrs. Callenbourogh came back with her husband in arm, his eyes glimmering but still reading as groggy. The two sat down at the opposite end of the table, sharing a smile.  
“Now, Rose. You’ve been working with us for quite some time now, and your work clearly shows. I’m surprised I haven’t seen it sooner. Your services in the garden have made our house the crown jewel of this neighborhood.” Mr. Callenbourogh praised. I couldn’t help but blush slightly at the sentiment. I rarely ever received compliments upon this.  
“We know you don’t have much in terms of education, but I-we figured we would help you.” His wife said. I was a bit confused at this. The Callenbouroghs have never taken my college into consideration. Hell, I don’t think my bosses even have a degree and got all their riches from inheritance.  
“What do you mean? Are you going to help me pay off my loans?” I asked. My bosses let out a small hint of a chuckle before passing a flyer over to me. I looked down at it, and my eyes widened. It was a gardening competition, held right in the neighborhood where my employers lived. The prize was monumental. It was almost double my tuition. I looked back up at the Callenbouroghs, their smiles wider.  
“We’re going out on vacation for a few days, and we’ll be back just in time for the day of the competition. That means you’ll have all the control of the garden you want. You better make it look nice.” The man explained to me. I looked back down at the flyer. This was an opportunity I just couldn’t miss.  
“I’m on it.” I told them. The Callenbouroghs gave me more compliments of praise before saying they had to go. They already had their stuff packed and nearly made themselves out of the door before giving me one final goodbye. Iris also managed to give me a tiny wave before holding back onto her mothers hand. I watched as the family drove away in their newest car, and I was left alone. Not entirely alone, at least. Many of the family’s maids and butlers had either gone with them on their own accord, or dropped off for time at their own home. The only person I knew who still remained was Reginald. He was going to help me. Because I have only nine days until the competition, and I’ll need all the assistance I can get.  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
Later that day, I sat down to have a chat with Reginald. I asked him to order many new flowers. Ones that we didn’t already have. I’ve heard red pansies and dahlias were all the rage nowadays, and with my college degree on the line, I hesitated no less on winning. Reginald agreed to my orders, and they came about another hour or so later. Our servicemen work quickly like that. I couldn’t contain my excitement once I saw the pots. I dashed out of the house and into the garden, Reginald hot on my heels. I grabbed the box from an out-of-breath Reginald.  
“Just call me if you need anything.” He panted before walking back into the house. Now was my time to prove to my bosses-to prove to everybody in this town I had something. I already had all my tools and equipment out. I began my work by picking the spot where I wanted them. I ended up deciding on a plot surrounding a statue of what I think was Athena? I’m not so invested in mythologies or fantasy worlds. I think our world is already “magical” enough. I probably spent the next 30 minutes or so planting a circle of pansies around the base of the statue, losing myself amongst the groove of the flowers. My college professors often reported that my green thumb seemed to take over my mind sometimes. Planting new growths was something I hadn’t done in months. Today it felt as though they were dancing with me. I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt different. After I had finished with that circle, I moved onto another statue, this time surrounding it with the dahlias. I felt that same rhythm again. I clasped my dirt-caked gloves together in the prideful daze of my new growths. As I was going inside to put back my tools, I heard humming coming from the other side of the wall. I never knew my next-door neighbor liked gardening too. I don’t get to interact with many people outside of my workspace unfortunately.  
I decided I’d at least give the person a “hello”. So, grabbing a ladder and positioning it on a scarcer portion of the garden wall, I climbed upwards until my upper body was over it. When I looked down, I saw a man crouched down on a garden bed. He looked about thirty or so, stocky but tall, with short dark brown hair kept under a broad hat.  
“Uh, hey!” I exclaimed from my position. The man looked up from his work, startled at first. He then returned to a more neutral expression before standing up and seeing me properly for the first time.  
“Morning lady. Say, I’ve never seen you before. Do you do work for the neighbors?” He asked with a deep voice and small southern drawl. I nodded, shielding the sun with my hand.  
“What exactly are you working on there?” I asked him. The man looked back down at his work before answering my question. “Lily of the Valleys. Quite the exquisite bunch this time of year. I’m in preparation for the competition you see.” He replied. I hesitated a little. Turns out my competition wasn’t so far away from me after all. But I took the chance to bite back a little. I looked over the other man's garden and saw he was mainly a topiary based garden. He had a few moderately impressive sculptures there, but not much in terms of flora.  
“Looks as though you and I will be competing.” I said, “Good luck with those new plants of yours…” I paused on his name.  
“Oh right. Where are my manners? Call me Finnegan. Wishin’ you luck too.” The man answered. “What about your name?” I looked back down at the wall, and found a weaker looking rose, likely not saveable easily. I trimmed the stem with a small cutter I had in my apron and tossed it down in front of Finnegan. I even gave him a little wink before climbing back down the ladder. This made me curious about our other competition. Would they have gardens similar to this? Or Finnegan's? I knew many homes would be going all out, but oftentimes the owners have their servants do the job under careful eye. But this garden was under my control. I knew what it could do. Now all to do was to push the limits.  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
A few hours had gone by since I was out in the garden. After my talk with Finnigan, I decided to head back inside and do some more research on who exactly was entering. I found a link on the flyer to a website, and input it into my laptop. The website wasn’t too fancy and outlandish, but professional nonetheless. I looked into the “Competitors” tab. Apparently, whoever entered had to enter in via the website. Guess that explains why the Callenbouroghs wanted to keep it a surprise. The tab had a record of whoever entered in the contest. That’s when I noticed something odd when I scrolled down. Besides my bosses names, there were only 3 other houses entering. It felt really strange, considering the grand prize. I couldn’t help but feel a little of the weight of pressure lifted from my shoulders. I also found out through my search that Finnigan owned the house and worked in its garden as well. I assume he’s the hard working type who likes getting stuff done himself. I looked at the other two houses. I didn’t know exactly who they were, but the little info I got told me they were similar to most other garden-based homes in the neighborhood. I closed out of the website and shut down my laptop shortly afterwards. I heard footsteps approach my position from the counter and saw Reginald approach me.  
“Greetings madam. Is everything suitable for you?” He asked. I nodded, but asked him to make some dinner for me in about half an hour. He left and I was left back in the study alone. I’m not huge on company. I’ve always been a more solitary type. Half an hour had passed, and right on schedule Reginald came back to tell me he had my dinner prepared. I walked out of the room with him and into the kitchen. Out on the table, he had some prepared meals settled in for me. All of this stuff felt really out of my comfort zone. Of course, being raised middle class and ending up as a domestic worker for rich people, you don’t experience much luxury yourself. I ended up sticking with a salad bowl. Looked appetizing enough. As I sat and finished off the salad, I couldn’t help but feel like I was getting hungrier. It was such a strange sensation. I had Reginald make me a secondary bowl, but that one almost didn’t help either. I ended up eating around five entire bowls before feeling moderately satiated. I just assumed my hours in the garden tricked my brain into feeling fuller. After my weird experience with dinner, I decided the best thing for me to do was to get some rest. I was going to do more exerting work in the garden tomorrow after all.  
As I was heading over to my room, I passed by Iris’s room, which had its door ajar. I decided to check up on her flower when I realized it was gone. It’d been taken out of the vase. The water was still inside of it though. I groaned slightly. I really hope Iris hadn’t taken that flower with her. Feeling somewhat irritated, I grabbed my phone and dialed my bosses, hoping I wouldn't disturb them. I heard Mrs. Callenbourogh's voice on the other end.  
“Ah Rose! Good to hear back from you. How’s the garden been?” She asked. I told her how my day went and how progress was doing. Before she hung up I asked her about the flower. Mrs. Callenbourogh went to talk to Iris about the flower, leaving for a minute with near silence before returning to my end.  
“She said she didn’t take it. She says it’s in her room, right in that glass vase.” The mother replied. My stomach dropped a little. If she didn’t take it, and I hadn’t touched it all day, what happened to that flower?  
That question pondered in my mind for a while as I was getting ready for bed. But I didn’t think much about it. Maybe Reginald or one of the other servants remaining might have taken it by accident. I let all my thoughts about today’s weird activity subside while I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom.  
But then something stranger happened. As I was ready to head out, I saw something weird. Specifically about my eyes. My eyes were a natural golden-hazel mix. At least that’s what they usually were. I noticed today they seemed to fall on the more yellow side. Not too big of a concern. I’ve heard hazel eyes have a tendency for uneven hue distribution. What was really weird were my pupils. They started looking..oval. The top sides looked squished in and the sides got longer. I swear I must’ve been experiencing some weird case of pareidolia; where your eyes make shapes out of something in dim lighting. But that didn’t make any sense either, because I was in a perfectly well lit bathroom, and the flaw was in my eye. I tried shaking the thought off, repeating that I was just seeing things, and that I was tired. As soon as I got myself under the covers I shut off the light and my eyes.  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
EIGHT DAYS  
I couldn’t sleep all that well last night. Right in the middle of the night I'd grown this horrible chest pain. I believed that it was just me sleeping on my back funny or something similar to that. I took a normal dosage of pain meds, which seemed to do the job. When I checked in the bathroom mirror, my eyes still looked pretty much the same as they had yesterday. I sighed a little, praying to god that I didn’t have some benign form of a cataract going on. I decided to head downstairs for a bit of breakfast, hoping I could make something for myself quickly. I remembered yesterday and how famished I felt at dinner, despite me being fine a few hours earlier. I didn’t seem to have put on anything at all. Maybe it’s just a weird metabolism phase. I have no clue what’s going on with me. Whatever it is, I hope it doesn't get worse.  
I was about to sit down and start eating some toast I'd cooked up within a minute or two, but felt no need to eat. Not in the general, normal sense. I couldn’t even eat at all if I wanted to. I tried getting closer to the plate, but jerked backwards before I could reach it. I even tried putting the toast close to my mouth, but just as it got close enough for me to bite, my hands jerked away before I could. It was like my body was forcing me to starve. After trying and failing to get at least one bite in, I just gave up and put on my gardening equipment.  
I decided today I was going to weed-kill the lawn. I noticed a few dry, brown-looking spots lain here and there yesterday as well. When I stepped out onto the garden’s front steps, I noticed just how good of a day it was. The sun was clear, with few clouds in sight. There was a breeze, but not enough for me to have to work around it. That sun though for some reason..felt strangely replenishing. I faced my head upwards, closing my eyes and letting the subtle warmth fall upon my face. I don’t know how long I was standing there for, because I’d been snapped out of my trance by a familiar voice calling my name. I looked to where it was coming from and saw Finnegan’s head peeking over the wall.  
“Hey Rose. You uh, doin’ alright?” He asked. I gave him a thumbs up and told him I was just enjoying the nice weather. Finnigan gave a small nod in return.  
“Dare I say, that’s quite a stunning thing you’re makin’ there.” He remarked, “You’re in the competition too, aren’t you?”  
“Yep.” I told him. “I’m hoping I’ll be able to finish paying off my scholarship and earn my degree.” I hesitated for a bit, deciding if I should tell this guy I only met yesterday about my accident. He seemed kind so far.  
“That’s quite a goal. No wonder you’re going full drive on that thing.” Finnegan said. “I wish you luck.” He paused, disappearing over the wall, likely going back to his work. I decided I should get back to mine. But now I had this one question nagging at my thoughts.  
Why was Finnegan in the competition?  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
I don’t know how long it was, but I finally got the lawn de-weeded. We use a good weed killer. The kind of stuff that won't wreck your lawn but it’ll get the job done. Of course, not all of them came out easily. The stray ones were the thing you had to yank out. We rarely get those, but every now and then they pop up. I kind of liked that part. The satisfaction of a job well done hasn’t put a halt in my step. Today though, it felt different. For some reason, I had this depressive urge to not pull them out while I was doing it. It felt like a secondary primal sense. I did it anyway though. After all, my future was practically on the line here, and I had to make everything look its best.  
When I was done with the weeds, I headed back inside, and I just sat there in the living room with dead silence as my only company. Why am I feeling like this? What the hell is even happening to me? I sighed and reluctantly picked up the phone and called the local doctor’s office. I set an appointment for tomorrow, just in case this thing got worse. I told the receptionist over the line about my chest pains this morning, my weird eyes, and the insatiable hunger I had the night before. Right as I hung up, I felt another round of chest pains come and heave. The feeling made me uneasy, and it was as if something was writhing inside me. I saw a servant walk in the room and asked him to bring me some more pain meds. I positioned myself back on the couch, seething air through my gritting teeth as another painful move ushered itself through me, this time deeper in my abdomen. The servant rushed back in with the bottle and I quickly downed three pills. I didn’t even drink water, I just wanted it over so badly. Finally, after a minute, the pain died down and I let out a sigh of relief.  
“Are you sure you’ll be fine, mam?” The servant asked. I let myself up and told him I was fine for now. If I needed anything, I’d call him or Reginald. I basically decided to toss the towel at that point and take it easy until tomorrow.  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
The sun had begun to lower itself over the horizon, and I was inside of the house. I had another swift chest pain surge through my body half an hour ago, this time heading upwards. The meds had finally done their job and I could relax. I was on my laptop once more, reading more about the competition. A few more details had been released since yesterday, and I found out more about the two houses I had little knowledge of. There was Mrs. Sherry, a widower whose display primarily consisted of dark colored flowers and those often associated with mourning. Too dark and sad, I thought. Sure, some of her stuff would be impressive, but nothing would personally stand out. Then there were the Millers. A couple from Argentina who had a personal vendetta for succulents and topiaries. Not many flowers in their display though. I didn’t learn much else about Finnegan, mainly his garden was praised for its mass vegetation. After learning more of what I could about the competition, I closed my laptop.  
It was dinner time for me, and my insatiable hunger turned back stronger than ever. I don’t even remember how much I ate, it was all just a blur before I felt satisfied enough. I stumbled back to the couch, still feeling mild pain in my chest. Reginald approached me shortly thereafter.  
“Are you feeling any better Rose?” he asked. I nodded slowly, letting out a sigh. “I just..need to rest. I think the shift in responsibilities just has me feeling off.” I said. Reginald seemed to understand before asking about the wall. The garden wall with the roses on it. My body jerked upwards. Shit. I’d completely forgotten to tend to it today. The weeds and the chest pains distracted me.  
“Don’t worry Rose. I sent out a servant to tend to it for you. All I told him was to water it.” Reginald assured me. Or at least that was what he was trying to do. I rushed over to the window closest to the garden, and there the servant was. He was a slightly pudgy fellow, with short, thick blond hair. I’ve seen him before, but can’t quite recall his name. He’s seen me do work in the garden some times, and occasionally tries to offer a hand, but I doubt he had any prior experience. I watched as he took the garden hose to the wall and sprayed it in a back and forth pattern. The garden hose! He’s always seen me turn on the sprinkler, not the hose. My face grew even more concerned when I saw how much water he was using. The roses were plenty watered enough, but he went about two or three times in an area before moving on to the next. I landed my face on the couch cushion and let out a groan. If I found that rose wall over-hydrated tomorrow, I’d kill that man.  
“Is something the matter, Rose?” Reginald asked, walking closer. I stumbled over my words for a second before being able to answer him.  
“I just..you see how hard I work on that wall, right? It’s what makes this place really stand out. And he’s just..ruining it.” I clenched my fist to relieve some of my anger at the servant outside, who had come down from a ladder he was using for the upper half of the wall. I let out a sigh as I got up and faced Reginald.  
“Could you tell the servant to head back inside? I’m gonna go ahead and get some rest.” I told him. While I was walking over to my quarters, I heard Reginald usher a quick “Good Night” before I was out of earshot.

1nbzzw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1nbzzw0/detailed_trip_report_august_31st_september_5th/,Detailed Trip Report - August 31st - September 5th,"My wife and I got back from our first trip to Paris on Saturday, and we had an amazing time.  This sub was very helpful as I was working to plan the trip over the last several months, so I wanted to share our trip report to hopefully help others.  **This report is organized into three parts - Part 1 will be General Notes, Part 2 will be our Itinerary, and Part 3 will be our Packing List.  There is a lot of information here, so if you just want to see a certain part, you can scroll to it.**

**Part 1: General Notes**

1. Our goal for this trip was to have a relatively relaxing time and not try to do too much.  The way I'm presenting the Itinerary will look very structured, but in reality, we only had time slot tickets to one attraction in Paris (which we slept through) and only had one dinner and one lunch reservation booked before we arrived.  Most of what we did in the city was fairly spontaneous.  The days in Reims and Versailles were planned in advance, though.
2. For any distances that were too far to walk, we used Uber rather than the Metro.  This was partly just our personal preference and partly because my wife came down with a cold the day we arrived and we just felt it would be easier.  The main reason I wanted to share this was because I've seen mixed reviews of the reliability of Uber on this sub.  With the exception of one ride, I found Uber to be fast, convenient, and reliable.  It was obviously more expensive than the Metro, but it was not any more expensive than Ubering around a large city here in the states.
3. We stayed in the 11th Arrondissement.  I loved this neighborhood - so many amazing restaurants all over the place.
4. I know a lot of people come on here asking about pickpockets, scammers, etc.  I see that content on social media too, but I always felt like it was potentially overblown.  **I wanted to share that I never felt threatened on the entire trip anywhere we went, and we had no issues with pickpockets.**  We were approached by bogus taxi drivers when we left the Gare de Lyon after arriving in Paris, but we just ignored them and kept walking and they left us alone.  **I've seen this said on here before but wanted to reiterate that, in our experience, if you remain alert as you would in any other major city, you shouldn't have any issues.**
5. The people we met and interacted with were very friendly and helpful.  Similar to the pickpocket/scammer thing, I noticed a lot of people commenting on the sub that they were worried about people not being nice or that they were surprised at how nice the people were.  **Seems like common sense, but in my experience if you greet someone in French and treat them with respect, then you'll be just fine.**  My French is terrible, but it was more than enough to get by and have positive interactions with people.
6. I'm not listing this in the itinerary, but we stopped back at our hotel most afternoons for a quick nap.  Given that my wife wasn't feeling 100%, this afternoon break was important to ensure she didn't overdo it.  However, even if she hadn't been sick, given all the walking we did and all the food we ate, an afternoon break probably would still have been a good idea.  

**Part 2: Itinerary**

|Date|What we did|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Aug. 31|Arrive at Gare de Lyon |Made our way out of the station and saw an EXTREMELY long line waiting for taxis.  We bypassed this and ordered an Uber.  The Uber app provided step-by-step instructions on where to go to be picked up which included pictures.  Within 5 minutes, we were in the car and on the way to our hotel. |
|Aug. 31|Check into hotel|We stayed at the Moxy Paris Bastille - I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located.|
|Aug. 31|Picked up medicine|The Pharmacies in Paris are fantastic.  We went in two, and in both the people were very helpful.  I showed the pharmacist pictures of the medicine we would have used in the US, and they found us the French version.|
|Aug. 31|Dinner at Robert et Louis|Fantastic dinner.  I thought about the duck and the sauce it came with the rest of the trip.  Creme brûlée was also delicious.  My wife had a steak, which she said was also very good.|
|Sept. 1|Breakfast in hotel room|I went out and walked until I found a boulangerie (didn't have to walk far).  I grabbed some pastries and espresso and took them back to the hotel.|
|Sept. 1|Musee de l'Orangerie|We had tickets for 9 AM but slept in too long to make this.  We ended up there around 11 AM and had to wait about 25 minutes to get in.  We did not have to buy new tickets, which was nice.  The water lilies did not disappoint, and I really enjoyed the Picasso and Modigliani works as well.|
|Sept. 1|Explored Jardin des Tuileries|Really pretty, walked around, grabbed more coffee and just enjoyed it sitting by a fountain.  We were going to walk over to the Louvre, but it started raining pretty hard so we ran across the street to some covered storefronts.|
|Sept. 1|Lunch at Le Bon Georges|Fantastic - we had the deviled eggs, pork pate, shared a steak, and ended with chocolate mousse.|
|Sept. 1|Galeries Lafayette|Very cool/nice - we knocked out our souvenir shopping for people back home here.  |
|Sept. 1|Fancy Starbucks|Generally we try to avoid things like Starbucks when we are in a new country/city, but this place was pretty cool, and since it was very close to the Galeries, it was a convenient place to call an Uber from.  |
|Sept. 1|Light snack at hotel before bed|After that huge lunch, we could not eat a full on dinner.|
|Sept. 2|Breakfast at boulangerie near hotel||
|Sept. 2|Notre Dame|We got here around 11 AM and got in the line for people with no tickets.  The line was continuously moving, and the wait to get in was only as long as it took us to walk through the barriers.  Walking through here was an incredible experience.  We also paid to go into the Treasury, which was pretty cool.|
|Sept. 2|Explored Jardin du Luxembourg|We walked here, which was a bit of a hike.  Before we entered the gardens, we stopped for coffee and macaroons and rested for a bit.|
|Sept. 2|Arc de Triomphe|The view from the top was amazing, and I'd like to point out that my wife showed what an absolute champ she is here.  When we got to the ticket counter, there was a sign saying the lift was out of order.  Despite her not feeling well, we still climbed the stairs all the way to the top.|
|Sept. 2|Dinner at Le Petit Italien|Showed up between 5 and 6 and were sat immediately.  As with everywhere else, the food was delicious.|
|Sept. 2|Drinks at Bisou|I enjoy making cocktails, so I really liked this place.  They don't have a menu - they ask you what you like in a drink and then make you a custom cocktail.  I think all cocktails are a flat $14.  Both my and my wife's drinks were really good.|
|Sept. 3|Train to Reims|Left from Gare de l'Est - very easy station to navigate|
|Sept. 3|Tour of Veuve Clicquot|We really enjoyed this.  We did the two hour cellar tour, which included a lesson on the different grapes used and the various notes you may pick up in champagnes made with those grapes.  Then you go into the cellars to learn about the process of making the champagne.  You end with a tasting of four vintages - ours were two 2015s, a 1995, and a 1998.  Each was paired with a different local cheese.|
|Sept. 3|Lunch at the Veuve cafe|More champagne and burgers - we were both feeling pretty good after this lol.|
|Sept. 3|Visited Reims Notre Dame Cathedral|Very cool and much less crowded than the one in Paris.|
|Sept. 3|Light snack at hotel before bed||
|Sept. 4|Versailles|My biggest advice to people going here is to get one of the golf carts to explore the gardens.  I knew the gardens were big, but I had no idea just how massive they really are.  If you are trying to do the palace and the gardens in a day, there is no way you are going to really get to explore the gardens without a golf cart.  Plus, I think most if not all of them come with GPS trackers and a little speaker that provides narration of what you are driving past as you drive around the gardens.|
|Sept. 5|Spent the day relaxing/packing to leave the next day||
|Sept. 5|Rock concert/dinner at La Maroquinerie|Turnover was the headliner, and Glixen was the opener.  This was definitely a highlight of the trip.  The venue is very cool - upstairs is a restaurant/bar and downstairs is where the show was along with another bar.  The restaurant was really good.  It felt like a very local experience, and seeing how a band that I and my wife love here in the states is also very loved halfway across the world was just a really cool experience.|
|Sept. 6|Flew out of CDG||



**Part 3: Packing List**

I think we were both pretty happy with what we packed.  I think we both felt like we blended in and didn't look too touristy without going outside of our typical style.  I'm including brands so you can look the items up if you want to get an idea of the look we both went for.  I'm not listing obvious things like socks, underwear, etc.  The idea behind this list was to have a few things we could mix and match so we were reusing items but not wearing the same outfits.  We did this to try and cut back on the amount we had to carry with us.

* My list
   * One pair of black jeans (Abercrombie)
   * One pair of slacks (Flint and Tender from Huckberry)
   * One pair of tennis shoes 
   * One pair of leather boots
   * One rain jacket (performance shell, not a stylish trench coat or anything - I was very happy to have this a couple of times when we got caught in the rain)
   * Two collared shirts (one short sleeve and one long)
   * One chore coat (Relwen)
   * One shirt jacket (Faherty)
   * Three plain t-shirts (Free-Fly brand - they pack well and the fabric doesn't get smelly if you wear them more than once)
   * Once set of pjs
   * Two baseball caps
   * One pair of sunglasses
   * Toiletries (I brought a bar of soap, but ended up just using the shampoo and shower gel provided by the hotel; really only needed toothbrush, toothpaste, contacts, and deodorant)
* Wife's list
   * Two pairs of linen pants (Abercrombie)
   * One pair of trousers (Gap)
   * One cropped black tee
   * One rain coat (performance shell)
   * Two cardigans, one black, one white (Quince)
   * Three dresses (Anthropologie and Quince)
   * One pair of tennis shoes
   * One pair of flats
   * One pair of Vans
   * Two short-sleeve sweaters (Abercrombie)
   * Two long-sleeve sweaters (I think these were also Abercrombie)
   * One pair of sunglasses
   * Toiletries
* Shared list
   * Various medications (Pepto, Immodium, Emergen-C, Melatonin, ibuprofen, etc.)
   * Two outlet adapters
   * Phone chargers
   * Trip packet (I always print an itinerary and all train/attraction tickets in case I have trouble pulling up a ticket I need for some reason)
   * Book/kindle
   * Crossbody bags (Lululemon - these worked great, but I didn't really use mine - I was carrying a backpack with our rain coats and water bottles and just kept my phone and wallet in my front pants pockets)

If you've made it this far, congratulations, I'm impressed!  I hope this was helpful.  We had a great time on our trip; I loved the city, and I am looking forward to going back and exploring more in the future.",19,1757365841.0,ParisTravelGuide,4,0.95,False

NY sour is one of my all time favorites and at the time of creation was experimenting with a lot of different clarification ideas, happened to see both of these elements online somewhere and had to put them together.

My recipe for singular cocktail:
Elijah Craig Straight Rye 1oz
Suntory Toki 1oz 
Twisted Alchemy lemon juice .75oz
House made 1:1 simple .75oz 
Mix then add to 
Whole milk 1oz

I made in larger batch and let it rest for about 24hr but in smaller increments like a single drink you can go anywhere from 30-45min up to 2-3 hours to create the separation and then strain through coffee filters or cheese cloth to remove the curd, I used coffee filters for clarification of this particular cocktail.
Experimented with egg whites during clarification process in the past but didn’t with this batch. 

Foam was made with an immersion blender 
About 12 oz Swanson Cab and then 2 bar spoons of Soy lecithin added to a container with space/air for you to be able to whip and create the foam

1nbzrz3,https://i.redd.it/hr1fabvc90of1.jpeg,Did our first popup event with a Flair 58+2 - never again,"We did our first event at a carnival with over 1000 attendees. Let’s just say- lesson learned. 

I imagined I would have been able to push a drink out in 2-3 minutes each, but did not prepare to be backlogged so much that each customer would have to wait 30 mins before getting their drink due to the orders in queue before them. 

We had 1 person taking orders and payments, another grinding, me pulling the shots, one more mixing the drinks. Luckily we had two portafilters  that I’d exchange right after purging the shot. 

Lesson 1: get a grind-by-weight grinder. The process of measuring beans, grinding, then distributing and tamping takes way too long. 

Lesson 2: Don’t use a Flair. The most annoying part about the flair is the purge that needs to be done after every shot. 

Lesson 3: Refilling the kettle and then waiting for it to come to temp takes too long. I was waiting anywhere between 2-5 minutes depending on the water volume. My kettle also has this weird issue where it pauses around 45 degrees before ramping up again towards 100. One way to minimize this was to not fill as much water so it never drops below 50. 

Lesson 4 for the future: Once I have a proper light commercial espresso machine, I’ll aim to dispense drinks as I get the order instead of collecting the orders all at once. Turns out people would rather wait in line to order rather than wait after they’ve given their money. We’re lucky our audience was accommodating and had other things to do at the carnival while we prepared the drinks. 

Positives: got a good number of coffee bean orders and good exposure to our brand. The drinks came out phenomenal.

“We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” Trump wrote Monday morning. “Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”

Hanks, who has portrayed service members in movies like “Saving Private Ryan” and “Forrest Gump,” has supported Democrats, including former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Ahead of the 2024 election, the actor told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that if Trump were to secure a second term, it would indicate that the U.S.’s “journey to a more perfect union has missteps in it.”

The West Point Association of Graduates alumni association announced in June that Hanks would be recognized for his work in several movies where he played U.S. service members and his advocacy for building the World War II memorial on the National Mall. Hanks also supports service members through the profits of his coffee company, HANKS for Our Troops.

Robert A. McDonald, chairman of the alumni association, said in June that Hanks has “done more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family” than many other Americans.

The actor’s ceremony to receive the Sylvanus Thayer Award, which is awarded to an “outstanding citizen” with a record of service exemplifying “Duty, Honor, Country,” was set for Sept. 25.

But over the weekend, retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the West Point Association of Graduates, announced to the staff the ceremony would no longer take place.

The cancellation, Bieger wrote in an email to staff first reported by The Washington Post, allows the Academy to focus on preparing cadets to serve in the United States Army. POLITICO has not verified the email.",2,1757365245.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

I’ve never been a coffee person. I don’t know why, considering the amount of caffeine I usually have in my day-to-day, but coffee as a taste has never been one that I have particularly enjoyed in any capacity. Now smell, that’s a different story; the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the morning was always one that I loved. I remember when my father took my brother and I to a pre-opening shift for the Dunkin' Doughnuts he used to be a manager for. 3AM, dark and empty, and watching Metalocalypse on one of the screens that usually would be for news or sports or something universally accepted. It was funny because it counted as the ‘take your son/daughter to work day’ that our schools had, despite the fact we were heading home by like 11.



While it’s not a Dunkin', this Starbucks reminds me of that rather fondly. That’s where I’m writing this, in an attempt to get out of the house more to avoid Aik’ithula and her superiority complex. Now I don’t know what happened to the town during the fog, but there was foliage. *Everywhere*. The buildings were covered in vines and these green and blue flowers. These were roses, too. I don’t know if green and blue roses occur in the wild, I’m not a fucking florist; but these were growing out of the vines that were just climbing up all the walls of most of the buildings. I could see shop owners, police, firefighters, even regular passersby helping in getting these flowers down.



So I decided to park on the side of the road and help out with the Starbucks I’m currently at. Uncharacteristic, right? But I don’t know, I guess a part of me had this sense of nostalgia; like ‘This was once *my* home *too*, right?’. So I asked if and how I could help, and who else did I bump into but Ol’ Sheriff D.W Irons and a few of his cops that I recognized from the other side of my cell. After a few jokes at my expense (because I guess assault’s a joke when it’s The Collective being beat up), I got handed a pair of gardening gloves and some sheers and told to ‘Take my anger out on the vines’. 

	

I gotta admit, these flowers were pretty. Unnatural I’m sure, but really pretty. Blue’s been a favorite color of mine, and seeing it on a flower I liked was really nice. Asking Ol’ D.W about it, he said that while he wasn’t around for the last time there was fog like this, The Collective said that the prior ones were Orange and Green. So I guess the fog is new to everyone here but those Collective Cornballs. Repeating myself again, I know, but these are really pretty.



I kept one of each from the destruction and have them in a water cup sitting next to me at the table I’m at. Realizing about now that I know *exactly* who would know anything about these flowers. But that’d require going back home and talking to her, and I don’t know if I wanna do that; I just got done obliterating a bunch of vines and I just feel in a wondrous state of peace that I don’t wanna ruin. But I’m gonna have to head back eventually, this Starbucks closes at 9:30. 



Just sat back down to update since I’m still here, I just bumped into an old friend of mine. I call him Uncle Verne, although to be fair he was never actual family to me. He was my father’s boss back when he worked down at the news station. Apparently he’s still working the news station up at the top of the hill in Pahrump, and invited me to go take a tour of the place sometime. Without really thinking about it, I agreed to visit tomorrow morning. I don’t know why, but I feel like that was a mistake.



Not like an earth-shattering mistake. But I feel like I’m getting too cozy with this place. I’m not here for long, just until the new owners show up to take the house off my hands. I guess I just don’t want to get to close to anything here if I’m gonna have to leave it. Saying that, I already know I fucked up with being friends with Gary and I *guess* Jasper? I don’t like goodbyes; never have, never will. But I already promised, so the least I can do is head over there and see what the old station’s like. I don’t know. 

I’m gonna leave early from the coffee shop. Not cause I’m excited to head home, but because if I don’t other places are gonna close; and I’d like to have options on where to get dinner since I’m a little too lazy to cook. Not to mention I’m gonna have to get extra for Gary and ***I fucking guess*** Aik’ithula. Let’s see how the Demoness handles McDonalds. TTFN.",1,1757365174.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1nbzoym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nbzoym/does_this_happen_to_you_and_how_can_i_cope_with/,Does this happen to you and how can I cope with this?,"Hey everyone,

I want to start this by saying that this is my first post ever on reddit. I wanted to make one for a while here but never really knew how to tackle what I wanted to air out and was not really familiar on how things worked. I sort doomscrolled a bit on the subreddit before joinning and i feel like its time for me to share this because it is quite literally running my life.

I am 21 years old and I just graduated from university and I realized that i missed out on so many opportunities because I was anxious. I was scared of looking ridiculous, of not knowing what to say of things being awkward of not being liked of being seen as a total idiot and honestly just not doing things right. I realized this was an issue when I went on an exchange program 2 years ago. I went to south korea, i had planned everything and really went above and beyond to make it happen. I research the country, its culture, the language and where and what to see and do. I ended doing very little there. I did attend any student gatherings organized by my school and missed out on making friends. I only went to 1 or 2 and felt totally out of place, all my attempts at making friends were total failures. I went back home with phone numbers and ig handles but 0 balls to reach out. I didn't even have the balls to set foot in a restaurant that didn't have a tablet or kiosk to order from because of how scared I was of inconveniencing the shop keeper or looking like a moron whilst ordering. My entire day was planned around making sure i didn't inconvenience people or ask for anything. I missed out on so much and really regret not making the most out of it. That exchange was the trip of a life time, it was a familly effort, everyone had pitched in to help and i feel like I wasted everyones money and time. I lied to my family and friends back home about how amazing my trip was, how i made so many friends and tried this and that when in reality I did not do most of what I told them. This is running my life. Even at home going to an administration and not having researched exactly what I have to do or say is a nightmare for me. Its horrible because my life is going by and I am not enjoying it. There are so many things I want to do and can't. When I was in seoul I wanted to get my hair done and I researched salons, prices, different styles and techniques and when i finally mustered up the courage to the dm a hairsalon and asked for a style, the person on the other end laughed at me for not knowing that a specific hairstyle I wanted was not cool anymore. I felt so stupid and discouraged and honestly felt like a pile of crap. I wanted to do so much but felt alone, out of place and not enough. Even back home, I feel a surge of anxiety asking anybody for anything. Even the price of coffee from a vendor. I feel so envious of people i know and online that have the confidence to go about their lives and manage even in foreign countries to live and do so much even if everything is foreign to them even when they don't know the language. It feels so natural to them, being social and meeting new people and just living comes naturally and feel horrible not being able to do so myself.

All of that to say that I am starting my masters program in january in South korea again and I feel like this is my moment to do things differently and finally overcome this. Finally live and do all the things i have in line for me. Going to a cafe not knowing how to order or what's on the menu and figuring it out. Going to a hairsalon not knowing how to communicate with my hairdresser but figuring it out. I am so done having anxiety govern my life and me just trying to catch up. I want to be able to picutre myself doing something and not chicken out because i am scared of looking ridiculous. I want to be able to walk to the gym in my town and sign up and go workout without overthinking it.

Standing before the heart of the city, I stared into the golden glow of our fake sun. But it wasn't a ball of light when I first thought, the light goes on seemingly forever to each side. It's hard to tell if it's a mighty wall to protect what's inside, or a dome to keep something from escaping. It didn't stop me from entering nor leaving, the blinding light creates a challenge for the seeing if that's what counts as it's way to stop those who dares approach. Regardless of my sight or what this brilliant glow intends, I venture towards where my city should be. My footsteps were loud, being left in a deaf world makes creaks and rustle sound like thunder and earthquakes. My heartbeat was calm, beating like it should. But each pump feels like it could shake the world if the rhythm goes off even by a second. Even my breathing feels like it doesn't belong outside my lungs, my breath sounds like a hurricane ready to destroy no matter how slow I tried to exhale. I ponder if I should hold my breath but I do not believe in my ability to hold it so I tried everything I can to keep the storm calm with normal slow breathing. Giving up on my eyes to comprehend this strange world, I make my way towards the city center with the help of my hands. Hands with limited reach compared to the gift eyes give us every day that are taken for granted, feeling nothing till my eyes become of use when they make out an odd shape. It was a large shape, standing tall over my stature with ease. Even though this giant shape has been bathed in this warm fake sunlight, it feels cold when my outstretched hands close in. Mere steps away from one of the many questions I pondered, I can now confidently say what this strange shape truly is that has been plaguing my mind since the moment I first placed my eyes of its blurry misshapen form from afar. 

What stands before me is a golden cross.



\*Gasp!!!\* I woke up and shot straight up in my bed, covered in sweat and panting like I was holding my breath. 

“Another nightmare?!” I sat in my bed, pondering what had been haunting me last night. I was shaking with my hands holding my head, unable to think of what scared me other than I was scared. I need to get up and get ready, but I don't want to. There's been days, most days where I don't want to go but reason won me over. Today fear is winning me to stay still and not leave, I look at my clock that now says 7:34. I could easily make it if I get out now, but I don't want to. A memory of Rachel warm welcoming smile popped into mind, washing away any fear and doubt I had. Finding a reason to go to work, I got out of bed slower than usual. My morning went by quicker and in a total blur, I headed to the bathroom, shower, brushed my teeth, dress, ate breakfast and got ready to leave. I check my clock again which now says 8:06, I can still make it just fine. I took a second to reach for the door knob, not wanting to leave the safe place I needed to keep away the nightmare. I grabbed the door knob, and walked out into the new day, or into hell.

Walking down the familiar street I known felt wrong, as if I were being watch from the shadow. I feel exposed, I want to turn back and hide under the sheets of my bed, I don't want to be outside. I feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me and I hate it. I quicken my pace away from what hell is out here when my city should be. I might be going crazy now, I thought I saw a glow behind the buildings. That doesn’t matter now, Random Shack is up ahead, I went into a dash as fast as I could to go to my second home where I could hide away from the terror of which I neither know nor wish to know. Just a few more steps, just within reach, I reached for the door and forced myself inside and shut the door behind me and held it shut so nothing could come after me.

 “Oh? Good morning Ethan! Quit the entrance today. Are you that excited for work that you ran all the way here? Or do you think sprinting to work till get you that employee of the month?” Rachel said cheerfully after being surprised from my sudden entrance. I didn’t hear her greeting, more like I couldn’t. I stood there trying to catch my breath and with the pounding of my heart made it impossible to hear anything, and honestly I really didn’t want to hear. 

“Ethan?” Rachel asked but to no answer. Failing to calm myself, the fear that was outside continued as I forced the door behind me to stay closed even harder the more I thought about it. Beads of sweat now falling off my chin then to the floor where I stared, now fearing that something might crash through the doors where I stood now became a greater concern. Legs feeling like jello and needing to run again crept into my mind, now begging to run away was what my entire body was shouting at me to do. I closed my eyes tightly, seeking courage to let go of the closed door and make a run for it, getting a last few quick breaths in for my mad escape before suddenly…..

“Ethan!?” Rachel asked again while putting her hand on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see Rachel right in front of me. It was so warm and soothing for her to be so close to me, probably the only other time she was this close besides when we first met and I shook her hand. Staring right into her beautiful blue eyes washed away any fear I had brought with me into the store. After what anyone would agree to be way too long to be staring at anyone, I regained my consciousness which felt like I had lost since yesterday and finally answered the concerned women right in front of me.

“...Oh, s-sorry. Yeah. I’m fine, just. Had a bad morning, that’s all. I-I’m fine, really, sorry for worrying you.” I’ve said the most amount of words to Rachel in one go the entire time I’ve known her, and slowly let go of the door with aching hands relieved to do so.

“Alright, if you say so. Must be a terrible start to your day, then. You’re pale as a ghost and sweating like crazy. Either you saw a ghost, or you realized you were going to be late and were about to ruin your perfect attendance.” Rachel said, trying to cheer me up, and it worked. I don’t think there’s much she could do to make me feel worse than just a few moments ago.

“Everything alright over there? I heard the door being slam shut, and it’s way too early for that to be an angry customer storming out just yet.” Rick asked and he made his way from the back towards us.

“Ethan saw a ghost, or maybe he found a bug in his coffee? The scared little guy hasn’t said much, but I can’t help but to worry about what had spooked him this badly. He didn’t seem like the type to be scared this bad.” said Rachel.

“Well it is true that you didn’t show up like usual, but you never really showed up looking like you found $20 on the street. Tell you what, you can grab one of my snacks from my secret stash and you can have 5 extra minutes on your break!” Said Rick now trying to cheer me up. Not nearly as effective as Rachel, but I still appreciate it.

“Well aren't you lucky! Well, besides the whole having a not so pleasant morning, but Rick always has the best snacks. Maybe I should show up like you did to get me some free snacks! Everyone knows that college kids run off of snacks, coffee, and the cheapest meal plans we can find.” Rachel said like her usual cheerful self. 

“Let me know if you need anything. And take it easy, it’s best if you put what happened earlier behind you. Ok!?” Realising that not only that I haven’t moved from the same spot this entire conversation, but this is also the longest I had ever been in a conversation. Still be it her doing most of it, but progress. Both Rick and Rachel headed to where they are needed, leaving me alone at the door made the isolation feel worse than ever. That fear never left, making it hard to do anything. I don’t know how long or how I even did it, I made it behind the register. I felt better by being in a place I know quite well for a little bit, but being left alone with nothing but your thoughts and fears didn’t make being here any better. 

Opening the store and letting the early birds in as usual, but I couldn’t recognize anyone coming into the store. I couldn’t make out anyone, everyone’s face and body just looked like messed mashed blobs with no color to them. I tried to look for the two people I knew but they were nowhere to be found in the sea of colorless shaped and distorted voices. I didn’t know if I was working or doing anything, everything just went by so fast that I really couldn’t comprehend if anything happened or not. I stared out into the store with passing blurs going in and out, trying to grasp onto anything that I could understand but I always end up at the same isolated spot where I sat as everything at the store moves on without me. The buzz above me was loud, louder then ever. It sounds more like the screams of the damn, I might actually be in hell right now. I was going insane but I didn’t say a word. I don’t know if it was either because I didn't want disturbed what’s normal left of the store, or if I physically couldn’t. What felt like seconds to minutes passed, I felt like something within me was about to snap when-

“Alright, break time!” Rick said, patting my back and snapping me out of a trance I was stuck in. I don’t know how hours passed but I wasn’t worried about that, I now have an excuse to leave this suffocating prison for a chance to breathe.

“I’ll show you where I keep some of my good snacks if you wa-”

“No thank you!” I said rushing past Rick, probably too harshly. But at the time I didn’t care, I needed to get out of here. 

“O-Oh, ok. Guess he’s not a big snack guy?”

Again I sat in a spot where I should be fine, where I should be comfortable. My usual spot where I smoke away my  first half of the day and get ready for the next. Thinking of what I could be doing instead of this, but not now. I sat with my knees to head in a ball feeling like I’m being watched all over again. A looming fear crawling back inside where it shouldn’t belong. Now I sat hopeless not knowing what to do or why this was happening. I wanted to disappear, me or whatever was out there to go away. I tried to pray but I couldn’t get the words out, or think if I was even going to say it properly. I held myself tighter wishing for all of it to go away till I heard the door open beside me.

“Ethen?” It was Rachel, someone I hadn’t realized I wanted to see but was so grateful for her to be there right beside me.

“Is everything ok? You looked out of it the whole day and rushed out the moment you could. Clearly something is wrong and you’re not telling.” Rachel said as she made her way right next to me and sat quite close to where I’m currently curled up. 

“You may not like it, but you have people who would gladly hear your worries and help in any way we can. Rick is holding down the fort for now, so we have time to get anything off your chest if it’s really bothering you this much!” She really is such a sweet person, and honestly I’ve been waiting for this moment forever, one moment with just the two of us alone together. One chance to be alone with the prettiest, kindest, and most lovely individual I know. Open up to her and form a bond that will grow stronger with time. To have both sides to truly know and understand the other’s struggles and joys, one which I’ve dreamed and fantasized for quite some time. It would be so easy to tell her, so simple to say “I had problems sleeping”, or “I’ve been having the strangest day” anything. I didn’t even need to tell her the full story, one bit and she’ll understand and comfort me the best she could. More than what I needed, but what I craved deeply.

“......I’m sorry Rachel. I’ve probably worried both you and Rick today. It’s….something I’m dealing with. I don’t want to get either of you to get involved. Thank you for worrying about me so much, I really do appreciate it.” Those words came out so easily, the most I’ve said without fumbling my words. The most normal sentence I’ve been wanting to be able to say to her, but not the words I wanted her to hear.

“......Ok Ethen. But if you ever change your mind and want someone to talk to, you have two pairs of ears who will gladly listen.” Rachel said as she stood up. Before heading back inside she gave me one more reassuring smile. Not the smile I wanted, but it still warms me from the cold isolation that surrounds me.

I waited until Rachel's warm smile could no longer keep away the cold and fear before heading back inside. I walked past Rick who seemed a bit worn out from dealing with the store all on his own. When he saw me he quickly changed his tired look to that of worried concern. 

“You good, Ethen?” you now when someone like Rick means what they say when there’s no jokes or puns to what they are saying. He always cares but only in times like this does he show it in full force.

“Yeah, I’m good. Sorry.” I didn’t even look him in the eyes. I really felt bad for putting him through all of my crap, but I was still thinking about how I failed my one chance with Rachel that I couldn’t even properly say sorry to my only friend. I continued my way to the register, glad to know that one of the eyes that are on me are ones that I know and are glad that they are there. I was still paranoid and scared, but the rest of the day went on like normal. I could see the faces of the afternoon customers and I could hear their rants and sly remarks like usual. Time went by faster than normal, which I don’t know if it was a blessing or a curse. Both Rachel and Rick came by to check on me, I lied to them again and said “I’m fine”, keeping then at arms length for hopefully someones own good. End of the day was here and the three quiet employees of Random Shack did their last tasks of the day before closing.

“Ok Rachel, you can head on back and get some rest for school.” It’s not often to see Rick to act like a gentle father, but he would be a great dad to have growing up with.

“Thanks Rick, but I’ll stay around for a bit. Gotta make sure everything’s alright, I think it’s best for me to stay just a bit longer.” Even the kind Rachel never asked to stay past her work hours, I must be one hell of a mess for her to go out of her way twice for someone like me.

“If that’s what you want, then I’ll allow it. Just make sure you don’t do anything crazy, it’s already putting my boxers in a bind to make sure one of our employees is alright.”

“Don’t worry Rick, I’ll be out of the way.” Having Rachel in the last few moments of closing the store was a blessing I didn’t know that I wanted. She stood by the door quietly watching over me and Rick doing the last of the tasks for the night, asking if I needed help even though he still has stuff he needs to bo. I really do appreciate what both of them are doing, I wish I can return the favor in any way I can. With Rachel watching me work I didn’t get the sense of needing to look impressive or needing to be perfect in what I was doing when Rachel was there watching me, I just felt calm and at peace with her there. Like the sun peeking out over the clouds from a cold day to warm me up, probably the only time I enjoyed doing work in my life. After finishing the last of our nightly tasks Rick said his lines like a tradition that must be upheld, but with less enthusiasm then normal,

“And with that, the Shack is closed.” No one can blame him for not ending off with a high note, especially me who caused the whole awkward problem. But I was kinda hoping to hear Rick's usual self before parting ways for tonight.

 “Ethen. You're probably sick and tired of hearing this all day, but are you sure you don’t want either of us to walk you home. Neither of us mind for tonight, we’re more than happy to help in any way we can.”

“It’s true. I may not have anything fancy or a magic spell to cast away your problem, but I’ll gladly do what I can if you need it.” While it is true I was getting tired of hearing the same worried concerns the whole day, I did want to stay with them just a bit longer. Away from the impending fear I can’t bare to face, the unknown that haunts me. I so desperately want the three of us to be here as long as I can, but today my mouth and body refuse to listen to me, almost like it doesn't understand what’s about to happen when I leave the only pillars I can lean on.

“Thanks you two. I really do appreciate you saying that. But I’ll be fine, I don’t live too far from here. I’ll be home in no time. You guys head home and get some rest. I’m sure I’ll be back to normal by tomorrow.” That last bit was a lie, I knew that was a lie yet I still said it. I said so many lies today I might as well name a new sin after me. I hate it, and I don’t understand why I did that. I don’t want to leave, I don’t want to go back home, and I know for damn sure that I wont be ok tomorrow, if I can make it to tomorrow. Both Rick and Rachel looked at each other then looked back at me knowing there’s no point in arguing and will let me be.

“If you say so. But if you change your mind, you know where I live, yeah?”

“Goodnight Ethan, I hope a goodnight sleep will be what the doctor ordered.” I nodded my head then walked back home, I wished that of once they weren't such nice people and pressured me into saying what I been wanting to say this whole day. I didn’t look back, I wanted to but I didn’t. My body refuses to look back on the only people who care, slowly feeling their warm pressens fade away as I walked further away till it’s fully gone. Now standing in front of what should be my home, feels alien. I’ve never stood in front of anything that felt so unwelcoming. I made my way inside, how? I would like to know, my body has been doing everything all on its own to the point where I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else was controlling it. I did my nightly duties in a trance, like my mind was still processing how I managed to walked through the front door. It’s only until I stood in front of my bed where I was able to move my body the way I wanted to, only to be replaced by fear. I curled up back to a ball right next to my bed, not wanting to move or know what was about to happen. I subconsciously turned off the light like I was about to go to sleep, but that’s the last thing I wanted to do. Deep down I know that if I close my eyes, the worse will happen. That be it I never awake again or something else was anyone's guess. All I do know is that I should get up, turn on the light and wait out the night. But fear has a stronger hold than reason, holding me down in that one spot in the dark. Like it knows what will happen if I close my eyes and sleep one last time. I tried to make a last ditch effort and force myself with everything I had to get up and out of the bedroom, but failed miserably as I slipped and bumped on the side of my bed. Somehow my face brushing against the side of my bed was enough for me to succumb to fatigue and tiredness, my eyes grew too heavy to keep open as I fell asleep on my bedroom floor and faced whatever was in store for me……….

My name is Jess, I’m 16, soon to be turning 17 in December. I’m in college currently and I work a job 3-5 days a week. 

We live in a 2 bedroom flat, and I have 3 siblings.

The 2 youngest shares a bedroom, soo doess the parents. so i sleep in a pullout bedroom in the living room. over the past 2-3 years, i’ve grown into the bed, and i love it. but i get woken up every morning to put it up so they can go in there, fair enough. I use tv to listen to yt while i sleep due to some trauma that wont allow me to sleep in quiet rooms.
I need some advice.

In july, when I finished school. my mother changed alot of things. Positively. now; she changed it again and it’s like im 14 again. 
July:
Allowed on my PC whenever I finish chores, without asking.
Bed at any time reasonable, (always normally 12-1am)
Bed made by 10. mornings and night.
etc.

Now:
Ask everytime I want to go on my PC, no pc before work. (i start work at 5pm and never home till like 10pm.)
bed at 10 PM (11 when i have work.)
and sleep in a room with no TV, pitch black darkness, etc so i wont be able to sleep.

Is this normal behaviour and rules to give to a 16yearold..?

i get 50 pound a month alongside my work money, do 2-3 chores a day, and i can go out.

i make her coffees like 3 times a day, wasting any free time i have, sometimes the only free tome i have, to do this. 

but in return, i get her asking me to do this that everything every few moments then complains when im tired, but im tired because of the overwhelming  amount of things i have to do.

I work remotely, and I went to a coffee shop to work for a few hours this morning. While I was there, a group of Space Force officers sat down near me. I couldn’t help overhear some of the conversation, and some of it was brainstorming about how to get their flight to show up to work on time / stop them from leaving early. Of course I know there are big culture differences across the branches, but it didn’t occur to me that that extended to not showing up to work with apparently no consequences.

1nbzcxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nbzcxx/wife_was_messaging_another_guy_am_i_overreacting/,Wife was messaging another guy. Am I overreacting?,"So I wasn’t going to post this, but I’m starting to think maybe I need a little straightforward talk without the therapy fluff. I’ll try to keep it short since I know these posts can be lengthy, but it may still be pretty long. 

The long and short of it is, I’ve been married to my wife (F/32) for about 5 years and we’ve been together for about 13 years (I’m M/36 for context). 

Around the time we got married, she expressed interest in women and started loosely identifying as bi-sexual. As such, she began toying with the idea of introducing other women into our relationship. We had a few threesomes, some were great, a couple I could’ve done without. 

That activity went dormant for a while and then in July of this year (2025) she randomly popped back on the radar and said “you wanna find a girlfriend.” Of course I wasn’t offended by the suggestion, so I agreed. She was a little more pushy than before though, and I had assumed she meant find a girlfriend for both of us. Turns out she meant find a girlfriend for myself and date her extramaritally (with her consent). 

This felt super weird, so I didn’t immediately act on it. Over the following week, she kept asking me if I’d met anyone and kept trying to give me advice on meeting women (super weird, but alright then *eyes her suspiciously*). 

Eventually, when I wasn’t landing anyone, she suggested that we have a threesome with a mutual friend and pushed for it to happen within the week, citing that it had been a long time and she was thinking about it.

So we did it, it wasn’t great, unfortunately, the mutual friend wasn’t really either of our types, but we made it happen. 

The very next day, my wife sits down with me and asks me how I feel about opening the relationship completely or at least swinging. I asked her if that’s something she’s been wanting and she responded that “want” was a strong word, just something she was considering, or open to. I then asked her if she had someone in mind, or if there was a couple she was considering swinging with and she replied that there wasn’t, “just something that crossed her mind.”

I told her if that was something she truly wanted, then I would try to meet her halfway, but truth be told, that gut checked me something crazy. Because in all of our years she never mentioned anything along those lines and was actually pretty adamant that she wasn’t interested in other men. 

A few days later, we were sitting outside our son’s school and I asked her again if there was someone else she was considering, or wanting to be with and she replied, “No, I would tell you if there was,” so I held her face, looked her in her eyes, and told her that for some reason in my heart, I couldn’t bring myself to believe that and I believed there was someone. Then I asked her to just tell me. She stood her ground and said there was nobody else and I had nothing to worry about.

We talked about the situation some more and she told me that the fact I was even open to meeting her halfway was enough for her, and she was no longer interested. She was just happy to know that I would have consideration for her desires on that level. 

A few more days went by and I just couldn’t find peace in the fact that she said there was nobody else, so I did something I’ve never done before. I went through her phone while she was in the shower (which now I regret, because ignorance really is bliss).

I found messages between her and her mom where she told her mom that she’d been talking to a guy she met at the grocery store and things got sexual quickly via instagram DMs. She even told her how she lied to me and felt bad about it. So I went to her DMs and found the messages, but all the questionable parts had been deleted and the messages seemed spotty like parts were missing. So the messages appeared to be business as usual with nothing obviously nefarious present. 

I jammed her up about it, and initially she tried to deny it, but then I showed her what I found on her phone and she couldn’t say anything else. 

She actually looked frustrated that I found the evidence, and she was upset that I went through her phone, because truthfully, it was uncharacteristic of me. 

But eventually, she apologized, told me everything in detail (after some pressure), and then said she ended things after she spoke to me the first time, because she realized it “wasn’t what she really wanted.”

For context, the guy approached her at the grocery store, they exchanged instagrams, and she began talking to him online. They met one time at a coffee shop and they only spoke online outside of that. She swore that she never slept with him and he was so pushy about sleeping with her that she started to feel cheap. She did admit however that their conversation became explicitly sexual before she cut it off and she told him that if I was okay with it, she would sleep with him. 

I feel like there’s so much more to unpack but I don’t even know how to fit it all in one thread. 

But since this discovery, I have been struggling. The fact that after all this time she let some guy make contact with her and began sexting him behind my back while still being present at home.  The fact that she was willing to sleep with him after a week and had the balls to ask for my permission to do it at that point. But to top it off, I asked her POINT BLANK and she looked dead into my soul and lied about it. 

We have 2 kids, we own real estate, we have joint business ventures. I can’t just up and leave, but I am going through it because now I question everything I thought I knew. My trust is shaken and I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to make it back to a good place, but I feel like I have to, for the sake of my kids and the other parts of our life together. 

Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated! ",12,1757364362.0,Marriage,30,0.84,False

The idea is to create a conversation group where we can talk about the ideas are very influential in online forums, and have started to have a big impact on modern politics, and the ideologies of the tech billionaires that pull the strings.

Most of our local activist and intellectual communities tend to focus on traditional progressive issues like LGBTQ+ rights, climate change, homelessness, voting rights, etc., but there aren't any focused on how Jordan Peterson and manosphere influencers are leading young men towards the alt-right, or ways that our local communities can help address the Meaning Crisis, or the impacts of AI on our ability to think, educate, and have normal relationships. These conversations happen all the time on Reddit, and the solution to most of them is to ""touch grass"" and work on building community. Here's a way you can do both at the same time!

It takes place at TN Valley Unitarian Universalist Church on Kingston Pike on the 2nd Sunday of the month starting at noon after the regular service (which you don't have to attend!) It starts out with a bring-your-own-brunch social from 12-1, followed by an ""open space"" discussion based on that month's topic. 

Free childcare services will be provided so that the parents can easily attend and have an adult conversation. It's an intergenerational group that brings together Gen-Z, Millennials, and Gen-Xers. Boomers are allowed but not encouraged, since they tend to end up dominating these spaces with their excessive free time, and it kills the vibe.

In an ""open space"" we get into small groups, each group has a different conversation prompt, and people are encouraged to mix between different groups as their interest takes them. It makes it easy to meet people, and less awkward if you need to come late or leave early.

The ""bring-your-own-brunch"" means you don't have to worry about making food for other people, which is the worst part about a potluck! You can even schedule a delivery order if you want. There are plenty of outside tables to dine al-fresco and enjoy the fall weather. Coffee, tea, and lemonade will be provided, along with some cookies and other snacks. It's the best brunch deal in town!

This Sunday the 14th we're discussing ""The Loneliness Epidemic"" since that's one of the main problems we're trying to solve here. [On the event page](https://73977386.view-events.com/calendar/73977386/event/270951515/2025-09-14) there are links to the Netflix documentary ""Join or Die"" as well as several YouTube videos about the topic.

Review:

Coffee is a masterful sport. I first purchased these beans in an attempt to understand James Hoffman just a little bit more, and maybe have a glimpse into what he prefers as a roaster. I must admit I was a bit naive to think that a single cup could actually inform me, but in a lot of ways I guess I am just hopeful.

The cup was impressive. I had a cup just last week when I first received my Hario Switch, and in that cup I remember a sweeter profile, with a nice acidity and an almost honey-like complexion. I brewed a 15 g/225g batch, with a 4-minute-immersion-then-flip-the-switch method (not splashing any coffee grounds out or in) and I was happy with the final result.

Today, I switched to the Chemex 3-cup, thinking it would bring better extraction results. It was a learning lesson, but I think the beans still made a flavorful impression on me.

After opening the bag, I jostled some of the dark brown beans and breathed in an aroma that reminded me almost of mushrooms, umami-like and earthy. Upon grinding to a medium-fine ground, I was again reminded of great, chocolatey, woody mushrooms. In my notes, I wrote that there was a “nuttiness and absoluteness to them” which I couldn’t aptly describe. All I could look forward to was the transformation that’d take place once I brewed.

After brewing, I immediately noticed the aroma of black tea. After quick research, I found that coffee and black tea can taste similar, but from a different chemical reaction. In black tea, polyphenols like catechins oxidize to form compounds like theaflavins and thearubigins, that contribute to tea’s astringency. Coffee has its own polyphenols (mainly chlorogenic acids), which break down during roasting into quinic acid, caffeic acid, and related compounds. A different path to a similar astringent quality.

You can go deep with coffee, and especially with beans like these. I mean, when you grind beans that smell of deep-earth chocolate, shifting into a sweet, woody, earthy aroma, then brew a cup that smells like grape juice and tastes of licorice and black tea with lemon: it’s clear this coffee isn’t missing complexity. Not at all. In the end, it settled into punchy tobacco, spice, and had a clean, apple-like finish. Thank you, Mr. Hoffman!

Review:

Coffee is a masterful sport. I first purchased these beans in an attempt to understand James Hoffman just a little bit more, and maybe have a glimpse into what he prefers as a roaster. I must admit I was a bit naive to think that a single cup could actually inform me, but in a lot of ways I guess I am just hopeful.

The cup was impressive. I had a cup just last week when I first received my Hario Switch, and in that cup I remember a sweeter profile, with a nice acidity and an almost honey-like complexion. I brewed a 15 g/225g batch, with a 4-minute-immersion-then-flip-the-switch method (not splashing any coffee grounds out or in) and I was happy with the final result.

Today, I switched to the Chemex 3-cup, thinking it would bring better extraction results. It was a learning lesson, but I think the beans still made a flavorful impression on me.

After opening the bag, I jostled some of the dark brown beans and breathed in an aroma that reminded me almost of mushrooms, umami-like and earthy. Upon grinding to a medium-fine ground, I was again reminded of great, chocolatey, woody mushrooms. In my notes, I wrote that there was a “nuttiness and absoluteness to them” which I couldn’t aptly describe. All I could look forward to was the transformation that’d take place once I brewed.

After brewing, I immediately noticed the aroma of black tea. After quick research, I found that coffee and black tea can taste similar, but from a different chemical reaction. In black tea, polyphenols like catechins oxidize to form compounds like theaflavins and thearubigins, that contribute to tea’s astringency. Coffee has its own polyphenols (mainly chlorogenic acids), which break down during roasting into quinic acid, caffeic acid, and related compounds. A different path to a similar astringent quality.

You can go deep with coffee, and especially with beans like these. I mean, when you grind beans that smell of deep-earth chocolate, shifting into a sweet, woody, earthy aroma, then brew a cup that smells like grape juice and tastes of licorice and black tea with lemon: it’s clear this coffee isn’t missing complexity. Not at all. In the end, it settled into punchy tobacco, spice, and had a clean, apple-like finish. Thank you, Mr. Hoffman!

My boyfriend is currently unemployed and there seems to be no end in sight to our job slump/economic woes, so I'm looking for something that pays the bills in the event that my boyfriend doesn't have work by the end of the year.

I've applied at a few places that fall under the fast food classification and pay $20 an hour, but each one has turned me down sadly.

I don't think I'm severely overweight but probably at least a little. I have lunch and dinner and I snack here and there throughout the day. The crux of my problem is I love to snack on unhealthy foods like cookies and muffins during the day, and chips and candy in the evening. I hate myself for it. I hate that sugar and carbs and sodium are what brings me comfort or my go-to when I need that dopamine hit when I'm bored or just to wake me up. I tried to mix some protein powder into my coffee to help curb it but it just made me feel like a zombie? Like... I'm not starving but my energy is so low (and it's already low to begin with). I usually meal prep lasagnas and pies to take to work for lunch since it's easy but I started having salads with chicken breast instead. It's pretty recent so we'll see if that makes a difference. But again, I know it won't if I keep snacking on the same things. And yet, I don't know what else to do... The funny thing is my body won't let me starve myself. If I'm hungry and I don't eat, I get cramps. 

I started going to dance classes 4 years ago and have been loving it. I still go 2-4 times a week. When I first began, the goal was to hopefully lose some weight but if not, at the very least maintain where I was and not get bigger. Recently I was reminiscing and was watching videos of myself from when I started, originally to see the progress I've made as a dancer, but then I noticed that I had gotten bigger, as in the exact opposite has happened from what I was hoping for. To be fair, I didn't go up a pant size, it's one of those things that probably no one notices but it's so glaringly obvious to me. I haven't had to buy a new wardrobe, but I feel like that's imminent. I'm also getting married next year and already bought a wedding dress that I absolutely love, and I'm so scared that I'll get too big for it by the time of the wedding. I try it on every few weeks just to make sure it still fits.

I've never identified as skinny, even when I was a teenager and I was the smallest I had ever been. And yet I've had family members, my mom, past boyfriends, friends call me fat, even then. Even when I knew I wasn't fat, it still stung to hear it. It doesn't help that I am now the biggest I've ever been. I'd love to blame it on hormones but I won't lie, it's my diet (I'm sure hormones play some part in it but probably not as big as I want to admit).

Not sure if this also plays in a part in it but I have ADHD. Maybe snacks is what gives me that stimulation that my brain wants? Regardless, I just don't know how else to managed my boredom other than snacking... Like, when I'm at work, the only thing I'm looking forward to is sitting on the couch watching a movie and eating chips. If I have a day off with no errands to run or dance classes, I can be on that couch all day with snacks and be perfectly content. I don't know how to change that.

Young man coming here with minor financial woes and looking for advice - it’s nothing too serious and I am luckily not in debt but it is a situation I would like to get out of in the near future or else I will be stuck permanently poor. Please give your thoughts and be kind if possible, I am self-conscious and aware that I am maybe not making the best personal decisions with my finances.



26 yo Male working in Vancouver at a government job. It is a fully remote job and I could technically move - however, my family/friends/partner all live in metro Vancouver so I have a strong desire to stay. This is important to me, although I realize it limits my options.



I make 75k annually, but post pension, deductions and taxes it works out to around 50k a year. I rent a one-bedroom apartment by myself on the Eastside for 2500 a month, working out to 30k annually (60% of my take-home). I love my apartment and my lifestyle - I live within walking distance of my loved ones and all my needs, so I do not need a car. I have a fulfilling life that ultimately I am happy with, but money has become a serious issue for me.



Living on my leftover 20k, I eat and spend around $100 a week on groceries. I end up spending a couple hundred a week on social activities, like eating out with my girlfriend or getting coffee with my family/friends. Both of these together eat up most of that remaining portion. I only pay for one other recurring bill aside from rent/utilities/insurance, $50 a month for a gym membership. Then there are one-time purchases like travelling, or repairing things, etc.. that never seem to go fully away. So the long and short of it is that I can just barely make ends meet but never get ahead or really save. I have $15k in my savings / emergency fund and it has remained basically this much for the past year that I have lived here, so in actuality it has devalued due to inflation.



I am hesitant to change my lifestyle because I am enjoying my life very much. However, I feel that if I don’t change something I will face constant anxiety about money and never get ahead. Rent is the biggest issue. I have always lived by myself since I was 18 (albeit in different provinces at times), and I am nervous about sharing a place with anyone but my girlfriend; however, she lives with friends and has a locked in rent <$1000 and is not eager to change since it would increase her rent significantly to move in with me. We have also been together less than a year so it feels premature and risky to suggest moving in together. I looked around my neighbourhood (which I adore), but can’t find anything significantly less than what I am currently paying to have my own place. I am also quite sad with the idea that I can be a career professional but still need to share a rental in order to survive. I grew up on the dream of renting a nice apartment by myself, but perhaps it is just out of my reach?



I love my job and ultimately I will earn more over time (increasing by around 5-7k annually pre-tax) assuming I am not cut, but it will be years before I make 6 figures. I take advantage of all the tax breaks and deductions I can. I don’t do any part time or side-hustles, but I also feel they probably aren’t the best use of my time and energy. Maybe if I could make an extra 10k a year or something it would be worth some time investment.



What do you suggest I do? I realize I may be living beyond my means, I am looking for advice based on what you’ve read about my lifestyle and values that could help me out. I’ve made legitimate cuts to things like eating out and opting to cook more often with my partner and split expenses more equally between us, but I feel that any savings I make in other areas of my life are overshadowed by rent.",1,1757363603.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,4,1.0,False

Gypsy talks about Rod not loving Deedee, Gypsy’s written letter of a “perfect” man that Ken checked all boxes for, Gypsy’s $$ cut in half due to Mia’s college, sex talk and Jeff feeling like he’d take a bullet for Gypsy.","
These emails are from Into The Weeds podcast. They have a YouTube channel you can go to where they read Gypsy’s emails. 1980Millenial Commentates on YouTube also has read some of my Reddit posts of Gypsy’s emails on her YouTube channel as well, sometimes people find listening to someone read them out loud to be easier. 🩷


**PLEASE READ** these emails are from October 2019 - March 2020. These emails are between Gypsy and Jeff. They started dating November 2019, Gypsy and Ken broke up October 2019. This is before she dated Ryan, but after she dated Ken. You do NOT need to guess who talks between who, as I have it all written at the bottom in the descriptions :) 


.

.

.


1.  Gypsy makes up a nickname for Jeff, “Dre Me J”… Dreamy J. She says she can be his background dancer, to complement his shirt, wearing cut off jeans, cut off pats jersey, while he raps. She’ll be tweaking to the beat. Then says, “say this fast! Boots n pants boots n pants n boots n pants”. 


2.  Gypsy talks to Jeff about why Ken left her due to the opinions of others, she says Ken felt like he was doing the right thing by letting her live her life. Ken told her he needed to act selflessly but Gypsy felt it was the opposite of what was needed, specific to her as an individual, therefore making a choice that cost him. She realizes the negative opinions can be danverous, so she wants the relationship between her and Jeff to be private and not tell anyone. She feels better not that the chapter with Ken is closed and thanks him for understanding her quest for full closure. 


3.  Gypsy says to Jeff this is her life lesson of the week. Gypsy’s hair is orange and a mess. She says she learned a lesson because months ago she cut her beautiful dark hair, mid back length and had plans to make herself blonde so Ken would be more attracted to her. She says it was stupid. So now Ken is gone and she already bought the stuff for it so she decided to do it. When looking at herself in the mirror with her failed attempt to become blonde, she felt pathetic and realized she shouldn’t have felt the need to change herself in order to be perceived as attractive. The person she was with should’ve saw her as attractive to begin with. She likes her dark her and it’s going to stay that way. She says, “stay tuned for more Gypsy fuck up and learn from it lessons”.


4.  Gypsy lectures Jeff about not smoking a cigarette and hopefully he’s wearing a nicotine patch. She talks about her possibility of being released from prison early. She then goes into detail about what to expect when dating behind bars, “expect the unexpected”. She says good communication is key, so phone calls, meeting in person and letters are crucial. The next topic, for serious relationships only, is sex, but her facility does not have conjugal visits. She says everyone deals with this differently, some abstain, some have hall passes, some don’t talk about it. She says it’s important to talk about so there isn’t unrealistic expectations and being open with your partner about what they consider infidelity is key. She says there’s a lot of chicky chicky bow wow that goes on in prison, and no, she’s very straight and it’s been a LONG LONG LONG TIME. She says getting creative with applying a sexual connection can be very fun, but needs effort. She says there’s time when she has the guy do their thing and she just moans on the phone. She says these are two issues that everyone has because of the circumstances. She then talks about how Ken used to visit but not video chat, but they winged it as best as they could. She says she will take him off as her SO, so he can’t get special visitation time, it doesn’t remove him, just makes him a friend. So he got demoted :P 


5.  Gypsy says to Jeff when talking about when she is out of prison , “There is nothing specific that I need guidance with, I meant just in general because I know I'm gonna be new to the world around me and things that i have not yet encountered I will need someone to help me adjust to the everyday experiences. I'm not sure what just yet but it’s nice to have someone tell you, you don't use a bar of soap to wash your laundry. I'll never forget that lol I feel like the first few months will be a training session for life. oh wait there is one thing I can think of,....money I don't know how much things cost and how much a paycheck will get me. what is minimum wage? do people rent apartments to felons? I have placed $480 in a savings account that I can't access until the day of release. is that enough to buy clothes, shoes and hygienes?”. Jeff said something sexual to her, Gypsy responds that she’d love to do it hundred times but she would be grateful for once, as it would be first with a partner anyway. Gypsy says Jeff made a pretty bold statement saying he would take a bullet for her. She knows he’s deeply passionate about her getting her freedom. She also brings up how she will use Jeff’s letter as a character witness for her parole hearing for early release. 


6.  Gypsy says to Jeff, “That emotional support is a paramount in the relationship because I need someone to help be my balancer. Just the same, l am good at being equally as emotionally supportive, when it falls in vice versa. It’s funny you mentioned, in both the email and the letter you wrote about taking care of each other when sick, I have been told I have a very nurturing quality. Meals in bed, with cuddles. Guidance is another thing I need, so I don't mind if you are more of a leader. I believe in partnership and everything should be 50/50. I am a very affectionate lover, also I do have a high sex drive, so once I get a taste of the real deal, I'm sure I'll become glued to your hip, or glued to something else *wink* hopefully you can handle me, I'm not going to be a ""starfish"" lol I want someone to share in the experiences that I have yet to have myself.
There is a reason why its called ""sharing your life"" with another and its because you are literally are sharing the ups, downs, achievements and failures. to have your partner share in that, and hopefully he/she gets even the smallest happiness out of it, then all the work is worth it. :-) Having a mutual willingness to be a positive for one another with the do basic values such as trust and respect as well as to strive for self improvement is a must, and that's what I would expect out of any relationship that I would go into. Just as you would like to see me happy, I would like to do the same for you. I think you are a wonderful person who should be appreciated and cherished.” 


7.  Jeff says to Gypsy, “As far as you giving me body blushes believe me you do plenty. I won't lie there's been plenty of times where l've closed my eyes and thought of you while umm... taking care of myself . I wouldn't hate doing it while you're on the phone. Honestly the phone, the pictures, the stories, the using our imaginations... it's just something I'm not used to, but I also understand that it's something I have to get used to for now. It isn't a bad thing, it's just a fact of what this is. The point I'm making is that sometimes it may sound as if I'm uncomfortable, when that isn't it. It's just different to me. Everything about this is different to me. I have asked myself a thousand times ""how did this get to this!?"" lol. But here you are all the sudden. And I love it. I find you exciting, and unique. And like I've said, I understand where you are and how long it might be, and that's okay. Let's just stay on this ride and see where it goes!! I've said it before, it isn't what you've gone through in life that intrigues me. It's the person you've become, and are becoming since then. The past is the past, and it can't be changed. The future is anything and everything we want to make it.” Jeff also says, “So to just get directly to the point and the fun stuff. I often think about what it would be like to be with you. I'm glad you called feeling frisky the other night. It's most certainly one of those things if we were in person would have gotten to by now. First as far as what kind of sex would we have. Well I'd imagine it depends on how the mood strikes us. It can be slow and passionate one day, and loud and crazy the next. Some times just jump right out of the shower while l'm watching tv. Come out drop your towel and sit on my face. I'm certain it would taste absolutely amazing. But I imagine when you first get out. I can't imagine how amazing that day would be. When I'd finally have you alone at night. Slowly stroking your hair, pulling your face close with both hands.. Very slow and passionate kissing. Letting our hands drift, and explore each other. You climbing on top of me moving around slowly. Just letting our bodies get to know each other. Just getting familiar with each other, how warm you are, how soft you feel, continuing to press my lips against your big beautiful pouty lips. It always seems to slip my mind to tell you about how amazingly soft your lips look. You have this adorable kind of naturally pouty face. I won't lie I look at least a couple pics of you every day. Even if they're the same pics. You really are so beautiful. Then there'll be other nights where idk maybe you're stirring sauce on the stove in the kitchen and I'll just look at you, and have to have you. I'll just pick you up, and bring you to the bed. We, can worry about the sauce on the stove after. It isn't important until we smell something burning.... so no butt stuff is absolutely fine. Not something that's ever been an interest. Turn ons well the first thing that comes to mind is that I would go absolutely crazy if you were on top of me, stuck your tongue in my ear while moaning. It's a move best saved for the um, grand finale. Turn offs, basically the only thing I can think of is the starfish. If you don't know what the starfish is i'll send you a picture of one, just look at it and think about it Lmao. Don't feel dumb if you don't see it right away. Anyways.... that was all fun to write out and think about. You do know how I feel about your scars. You can wear anything you want around me (preferably nothing). But most importantly just be completely comfortable. That's what's most important. Never feel obligated to do anything ever. If you ever need to slow down, stop or whatever just tell me. I think you already know that would be my attitude towards you, but I think it's important to say.”


8.  Jeff says to Gypsy, “Thave fantasies of being right there when you walk out. The hug, I think for like the first week you're out l'd just walk around with your arms around my neck, and legs wrapped around my waist. Or on a serious note. What you'd be wearing, or what I might have for you in a bag to change into since you just told me about 10 minutes ago they actually have rules about what you're allowed to wear when you walk out. It really went down that way when I found out about your story, and what my initial attraction to you was. I just wanted to stand in front of anyone, and everyone who has the anything bad to say to you or about you, and push anyone out of the way that ever tries to stop you from living the exact life you desire to live. I don't recall ever so literally having such a ""take a bullet for you"" type of feeling towards anyone.
Like I said, men are naturally protective of their woman. Not that I think you can't take care of yourself. You might think you're a pushover when you talk about yourself and interacting with the other women in there. I think you come off as a pretty tough chick who isn't about to take anyone's shit in life and live it the way you see fit. And I have wanted to see that since day one of finding out about you. Only now, I hope to see it at a much more up close and personal view.” Jeff also talks about his trip to visiting Gypsy, talking about what food she wants him to bring, he refuses to just bring McDonald’s. Jeff then talks about a dream and says, “About a week ago the only part of the dream I had was you giving me attitude saying ""if you want me to be your girlfriend then you need to stop talking to all those hoes"", "" This was in person and you were in your khakis in my room. I
promise you there are no hoes. I guess in the dream I was asking you to be my girlfriend maybe?”.


9.  Gypsy says to Jeff, “I was just kinda taking the chance calling because i am feeling frisky last night and wanted to see where the mood could take us. perhaps tonight you could persuade me to try again. Just tell me all about that oral presentation. *wink* In the mean time, I'll think of you. <3 mmmm that pic of you has me desiring you. If I was able to, I would send you a pic of me wearing nothing, with my hair down (obviously once it is fully long again) statistically placed covering me, so you still dont see every inch of me, I'm saving that for our first moments really alone together. I'm the kind of person I'm so shy at first, then once you have seen all of me, after that I'll walk around the house naked all day long totally chill. Remember what I said about my scars in one of the emails that l'm very insecure about them? and yes, I remember your response, however I didn't think that you would potentially be the one to see me like that. You are so handsome and desirable my mind can't help but think about what it would be like. My curiosity has me wondering if you are gentle and romantic, or rough and dirty? is there anything you don't like? oh 2 things you need to know about me, #1 NO ass stuff, with the exception of spanks. #2 I personally need both pen and stim, to make me ""purr""
BTW I have a little round scar on my upper tummy just below my left ribcage,
four small half inch scars around my tummy, a 3 inch scar on my right front thigh, and two light colored scars on my neck. the scars are not as ugly as scars could be, but i sure don't look perfect, for this reason i dont normally wear lingerie that is just a bra and panties as I normally op for the outfits that cover the tummy area. anyways. as always I am anticipating our conversation tonight. *muah*”.


10.  Gypsy says to Jeff, “Honestly, I never know what we are going to talk about when I call, or where the conversation will end up at, we could start with talking about pizza end on the price of tea in China lol Hmmm as for your reward for abstaining from smoking a month straight, I might tell you a story, Maybe one set straight out of one of my fantasies or one specially created. I wanna make YOUR body blush this time <3 You have told me that I need to be your guide when it comes to content regarding the more explicit details. Just say what you want when we talk, its ok I promise. I am just bashful, however when I have had too much coffee and my confidence is sky high, I'll call you and tell you what's on my mind and to get a literal rise out of you teasing you with all that talk. :-) maybe I'll let you hear me moan a little, I mean ""purr"" :-) It is now Christmas Day and I am up early getting ready. another girl on the wing did my make up which omg she did an amazing job!!! she is teaching me the tricks of the trade so I can do it myself.
Today’s lunch is our holiday meal, after that I may just curl back up in bed and watch a few movies. I hope your holiday is cheerful and I will look forward to Fridays call, maybe I would have received the rest of your emails by then,..hopefully lol
until then, Goodnight *muah* *cuddles close with my head on your chest* ”. 


11.—The ONLY reason I posted this is because I hate when Gypsy acts like she’s queen of health— Jeff talks about his 2 mile run he did, he is a runner, but that’s it isn’t the mark where he wants it to be. He feels weak and soft and kinda angry at himself over it, as he feels like he lost progress. His normal 2.5 jog is usually done in 23-24 minutes but today he did it in 30 minutes. Gypsy then tells him good job, but then asks him if he does ab workouts. She says she learned when you work out the upper you have to work out the lower equally. She challenges Jeff to do 30 consecutive crunches, she does that in an average session, then whatever he does she’ll match it. She tells him he has a good starting point as he doesn’t have a lot of belly fat, so he’ll tone up really well without a huge amount of effort. She says, she’ll study hard for her math gradually, if her works on toning his core muscles. He can send her pics of his progress. And she’ll show him her graded assignments. That would give her incentive to do her homework. Gypsy then says, “I know exactly how you feel, last year at this time I was preparing my parents to meet my fiancé and a year later I'm left by that same fiancé and preparing to meet a completely different guy! If anyone can relate about how unpredictable life is, that is me. I'm glad you will have something to calm your nerves before our visit, I don't get that luxury. lol Its completely understandable if you feel shy with the more X rated conversations. That might be something that might be too fast pace right now and its ok if it is, there is no pressure behind anything I say. I sometimes just express my desires from time to time and It gets easier with time and comfortability with each other. For now, if its a little intimidating and ahead of our speed then perhaps just talking about what is desired without the intent to arouse the other, is a start. <3 like all good things start slow,..at first *wink*. p.s | can't tell that one ear is larger then the other. maybe the left ear is the one I should nibble on *wink* if it makes you feel better to know, I had my measurements taken and the only thing symmetrical on my body is my ankles lol everything else is off by like an inch lol. Keep continuing to stay healthy. Make that appointment for your physical please???.” 


12.  Jeff says, “Be still my beating heart. I got a message from you on a Saturday!? I don't think that's ever happened. Can I hold you up against a wall? Like are you asking me if I could, or are you just asking me to? I don't see any physical reason why I couldn't. Honestly you're probably so tiny I wouldn't need the wall. Then flip you so I can taster your delicious *wink* while you taste mine. Then flip you back so we can taste each other. You're in for a long night when you walk out of there!! So make sure you polish off whatever coffee you have left over that morning!! Then we can stop for a Red Bull.” 


13.  Gypsy talks to Jeff about relationship and wondering his desires. She also brings up the food she wants him to bring before he visits her, she says, Ok as for food, there is a HyVee or Walmart which ever you prefer, very near by about 5 minutes from your hotel. This is what I would like please, McDonald's Fries, Corn (not on the cob) lol, Chicken poppers , Mac n Cheese, Planter's Salted Cashues. You’re gonna have to put multiple items in one container to make them fit. Also very important, bring paper plates into the visit with you, you don't have to bring spoons and forks they have those already inside the visiting area. and that's all :-) Now moving on to what you were saying about that protective instinct. Yes, I can imagine that men have that natural programing to be that way. Most have it, but there are a few that do not, those types of men are normally abusers. I took a class last year, it was on coping skills dealing in trauma, and some things I won't lie, I really related to. In one session we talked about relationships, and why people like me, are more likely to ""self sabotage"" a good healthy relationship. For me and others like me, something good and healthy seems like a danger zone and an abusive relationship seems safe, because it’s what I know and it's familiar. In my relationship with it was good and healthy but I always had insecurity racing though my mind, wondering did he really go home alone after work? as well as other things. I would fight the urge to play the ""yoyo game”. “ Jeff says to Gypsy, “So I'll send a longer message tomorrow. I had to take care of myself twice last night after the way you left that conversation. I'm just making sure my account is still active lol.”, Gypsy responds, “your account is still active, the prison doesn't terminate accounts due to content, the pics or emails just get rejected due to content. I received a handsome close up pic of you that you sent. other then that, its the only one I received. I'm so curious to know why you thought your account might be suspended... I'll just ask you the next time I call. Twice huh? wow I must have really made you excited. *wink* I had you in my mind all night, Even in my dreams. mmmmmm I was purring last night *lays in bed blushing* Ok Mr. Smitten *muah muah* BTW can you hold me up against a wall just curious... *wink*”.


14.  Gypsy tells Jeff that her life changed over night because of The Act. She says she became a public figure and to this day, women would tell her that their sister, daughter, mother just loves her, looks up to her and wants her autograph. She doesn’t understand why. She is nothing but another human who has made a major mistake. Not someone to hold to a higher standard. Her “image”, is one that was pretty for TV, but she would break under stress with interviews and the weight of judgment from everyone. Even her parents were a source of stress. She grew to hate the attention and felt pressured to gain more. So she would hide away from everyone and everything in a little phone booth in the corner of the day room, spend hours and hours talking with Ken doing Facebook quizzes and going on phone trips to the store. She told him all her secrets and desires for life as he opened up his secrets no one else knew. In one conversation, she confessed he was her soulmate and went to explain why this is true, which now will tell Jeff. She says to Jeff, “When I was living with my mother, before I ever met I created my perfect guy in my mind. I drew pictures of him, I
still remember the drawing, I gave him dark hair and green eyes. Soon after, my mother and I were shopping at the mall, we went into a Abacrombie and Fitch store and I remember looking at the colognes. I caught the scent of one, and took a bottle of it from the store. It was called Fierce. I took it home and thought to myself this is will be the scent he wears. I began to write a list of qualities he would have and said that I would say yes to the guy who met these traits and who would buy me a Tiffany's ring. (I think it was more the little blue box I wanted more then the actual ring lol) anyway So fast forward 10 or so years, and here is 6'1 24yrs old dark hair, green eyes. First visit with him, I caught that familiar scent again, it was none other then Abacrombie's Fierce. The first of many ""signs"" His personality had all the traits I listed even down to our love for Husky dogs. Then in October of 2018 he proposed with the promise of a Tiffany's ring without me ever telling him that whole back story. I only told him about me ""creating my soulmate"" after the fact.”, Gypsy then says, “I am not one to through out the pitty me card, but facts are facts. In my life My father didn't love my mother, so he left to follow his heart, but left me with a mother who was left broken and bitter. She only ""loved me"" when I did as told. She never dreamt of a day I would grow up to be beautiful and happy. I was led to believe my father abandoned my mother and I. All I ever wanted in life was to be loved, truly loved for who I am as a person. To not be used for personal gain but rather be seen for the value in my love in return. So, when Ken came into my life, I thought FINALLY! Someone sees me, Someone truly loves me, knowing every flaw and every detail. Never once did he use me, exploit me or was ever unjust to me in any way. I felt happy, appreciated”. 


15.  Gypsy says to Jeff, “just need to vent for a little bit, l'm so stressed out..so my monthly allowance is dropping drastically due to financial strain because of Mia's college. I'll be living $100 a month and that's for phone minutes, laundry time,
and my parents taking care of me
combined with $500 a month which was more then enough to stock my locker with food and hygiene idems and phone minutes, now down to $100. I do have back up hygiene idems so that's all that matters. it just worries me ya know. could you live on 100 bucks a month?! the struggle is real! :- AND IM STRESS EATING THE FOOD I NEED TO CONSERVE!!!”.

Names and some things changed for amenity

DISCLAIMER: her and I are both mentally Disabled and on ssdi. which adds on to why I don't want to get cops involved.

First back story I spent the day with Addy it was originally gonna be from 8-12 but things happened and it ended up being an all day thing. It started with me going to her place to hang out I gave her an old phone and helped her set it up, Then i got us coffee because we both where up obscenely early (6am in my case) which is early for me after a bad night. so i bought us coffee then after 5 i bought her and I dinner because she didn't have much food at home neither of us wanted to cook. Mid afternoon (about 3) we got scared because their was yelling in her halls and she asked me if she could stay the night with me she didn't want to be at her place alone. Seeing her fear I said sure and then around 6 we went to my place watched a movie and ended out the night with a tv show then went to bed.

Now here's the part where she stole. Around 3 am she woke up being tormented by something telling her no one wants to be her friend (this is after all the Friend things I did). she turned my front room light on at 4 and I got up seeing the light on i thought i would check on her being it was her 1st time at my place. She said she couldn't sleep and wanted to take a shower. I live in an apartment where you hear water going thru pipes and water being turned on. So Naturally at 4 am i said no wait till 8 30 and went back to bed after seeing she was ok. while i slept she got in my wallet used 3 of my cards (Bank, PayPal, Credit card) I woke up at 8 saw of 2 my cards all messed up. (for those who are gonna ask how I knew they where messed up I am very careful about where my cards go and how they look in my wallet i make sure they are secured and all the way in their pocket. The cards where barley in the pocket like they where quickly placed back in my wallet in surprise) while she was in the shower i put them back and checked my banks and all and sure enough she took $ from my bank hacked my PayPal added her card and email and stole 30 from my bank ((Have proof in both PayPal and my bank that she stole 30 that day its sent to her PayPal account.)) I asked her she denied and i told her there's proof she played it off as we both got hacked so I let it go but asked her if i can have her new PayPal she just made just incase i need to send her$ for something. She said sure and went to log in. Y'all it said ""welcome back (my Name)"" so she logged into my paypal at some point to do all this. She played it off like it was nothing like it was a mistake and I let it alone.

We walked to church and i asked our pastor for guidance telling him what happened, as I'm talking to him addy comes back to us and pastor asks her if she did. Again she denied and out came the tidbit that she done this before from the pastor's lips. she denied again. I told her i want to believe her but i have all this proof saying otherwise. Pastor said obviously she did some thing otherwise i wouldn't have it. She changed her denial to ""I feel like i did something i just don't remember"" I told her ""I know Satan is using this against us trying to get us to fight i don't want to let him win but this can not be ignored"" Pastor, addy and i agreed I will math it up and let her know. Addy and I did the math and it was 30 she owed me so we both talked to pastor and he said you will pay it back to addy she said she would talk to her payee and get the $ to me. I left it at that it was just 30 so ok. before church started she pulled another 60 from my pay pal. I walked to the pastor with her there and showed them both my screen. Addy showed us her screen she was on fb and she claimed she was on fb the whole time.(she could of easily been taking more money the whole time she was away from everyone then quickly switched it to fb when she saw me coming. We all talked a little more and pastor said we will figure this out and we went to sit down. She begged me not to tell my aunt or her family i said i wouldn't and I wasn't going to i was gonna leave it to us 3 and GOD. Soon after church started and all was well then after church we parted ways after.

I didn't tell her family or my aunt at first then I got home was talking to my bestie Azzy and it hit me my credit card was in my wallet too she could of used that. so i logged into my credit card account and sure enough she used 200 on target online. and i freaked then told my aunt because i didn't know what else to do. Aunt suggested me to report fraud and i did with a run around but i was still not gonna tell the cops. I walked over to my aunts and had lunch with them.

The ""friend"" had the freaking audacity to ask me for $ after she STOLE $. that the $ on my PayPal was hers she sent it to me((I call bs in mind but not to her because PayPal tells you who sent $ to you it TELLS YOU the activity she didn't send me crap.)) I told her I couldn't PayPal is locked due to investigation Nothing can be done with my PayPal and gave her an fyi that PayPal tells you who sent you $ and how much. I wanted to give it to GOD and let it be. Everyone who knows what happened besides my aunt, uncle(Both go to the same church as addy and I so i'm sadly thinking they wanna save face with church), Pastor and nana are telling me get the cops involved even the banks are telling me to do so. I am fighting everything to try and keep my word. and then with all of this Last night at 9pm she got into my PayPal AGAIN and tried stealing more money adding her email bank and card back to my PayPal. This chick was still trying to steal after EVERYTHING she already stole. I don't want to get the cops involved it would be hard for her and my church. What should I do? WIBTAH?

1nbyxhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nbyxhk/should_you_choose_the_best_vacuum_sealer_avid/,Should You Choose the Best Vacuum Sealer Avid Armor USV32,"Avid Armor USV32 has been a game changer in my kitchen setup. I got this machine a few months ago, and it has genuinely revolutionized how I handle food preservation and preparation. As someone who loves working with liquid-rich dishes and experimenting with sous vide cooking, a quality vacuum sealer was at the top of my wishlist. This chamber vacuum sealer has delivered on almost every promise, though there are certainly details worth pointing out.

**Sleek Build and Compact Design**  
The first thing that sets this vacuum sealer apart is its design. With dimensions of 12 inches by 11.5 inches by 3.5 inches, it fits comfortably on my kitchen countertop without looking bulky or out of place. The black stainless steel casing offers a polished, sturdy look that blends well with other kitchen appliances. Additionally, the clear glass lid is a favorite feature—it lets me peek inside during use, which ensures everything is positioned correctly before sealing. Although it’s compact, I will admit that its weight of 26.4 pounds caught me off guard. It’s not something I’d want to move around constantly, so it has a permanent home in my kitchen.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
The automatic operation makes this machine ridiculously easy to use. There’s a one-touch control system that simplifies the entire process, making it beginner-friendly. I never had much experience with vacuum sealers before getting this one, so I didn’t know what to expect. It took just a couple of tries to feel like a pro. The dual sealing wires seal bags quickly while maintaining a positive, leak-free seal. However, I did notice that positioning the bag correctly is critical. Misplacement can lead to imperfect seals, which can be something of a learning curve for a newbie.

[Check Avid Armor USV32 price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b07ylgrzfj/)  

**Performance for Liquid-Rich Foods**  
One standout feature of this vacuum sealer is its ability to handle liquid-rich foods with precision. I’ve used it to seal soups, sauces, and even cocktails for parties. The high vacuum pressure ensures that no leaks occur even with the messiest, runniest marinades. It’s especially handy for prepping meals for sous vide cooking. I’ve marinated cuts of meat in this machine, allowing the vacuum pressure to intensify the flavors quickly. The results? Perfectly tender, flavor-rich recipes every time.

**Versatile Accessories**  
One of the unexpected perks of this chamber vacuum sealer is the included vacuum accessory hose. It lets me work with external vacuum containers and jars, which comes in handy when dealing with delicate or dry goods. For someone who preserves jams or stores dry coffee grounds, this feature adds an extra layer of functionality. The hose fits seamlessly into the port located under the seal bar, and connecting it to approved containers is straightforward. That said, I wish the machine included a few starter containers in the box. I had to source those separately, which was slightly inconvenient.

**Highlights**  
- Excellent for preserving liquid-rich foods like soups, sauces, and marinades.  
- Compact yet durable stainless steel design with a clear glass lid.  
- Straightforward one-touch controls for beginner-friendly operation.  
- Accessory vacuum hose adds versatility for containers and jars.  

**Negatives**  
- At 26.4 pounds, it’s a bit heavy for frequent moving.  
- You need to purchase external containers separately for the vacuum hose feature.  
- Precise bag placement is necessary for consistent sealing, which may take some practice.  

**Competitive Options**  
Since I’m a big fan of testing products, I’ve tried a couple of other vacuum sealers in the past, including models from FoodSaver and Nesco. Compared to those brands, this chamber vacuum sealer has a significant edge for liquid handling. Many conventional external vacuum sealers often struggle with soups or sauces, as they can cause messy spills while sealing. On the other hand, the chamber design in this machine avoids that entirely. FoodSaver models, while compact and lightweight, don’t come close in terms of versatility and power. Nesco, while relatively affordable, didn’t deliver the same quality when it came to long-term durability.

**Quality for Price**  
This chamber vacuum sealer isn’t a casual purchase. However, it justifies its price with performance, durability, and additional functionality that you won’t get with most standard vacuum sealers. If you were hoping to run a small business or preserve bulk food items regularly, this machine would be a rock-solid investment. While there are more affordable basic options out there, they miss the professional-grade features that this model delivers. It all depends on your needs, but for anyone serious about food preservation at home, the price is well worth the quality.

It's freaking 2025 and I’m literally SHOCKED at how many companies are *actively* hiring remote MOBILE APP TESTERS—most with schedules so flexible, you could be reviewing code in your pajamas or while chilling at the nearest coffee shop. How is nobody screaming about this?! 🤯

Here’s the plot twist: I found **10 legit companies** openly seeking remote app testers, and I had to triple-check because this feels WILD. Let me break it down before I faint.

- **GoodNovel** (yes, the mobile reading empire) launches constant opportunities for testers. Their careers page? It's a jackpot. I actually found out about them here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and I checked four times to make sure it's real.  
- **Testlio** shocks me—global access, slick onboarding, and they don’t care WHERE you’re grooving to their test scripts.  
- **Applause** used to sound scammy, but people cleaning up their kitchen are literally finding bugs from their iPads.  
- **uTest** allows anyone to join. Like, your cousin could be deep-testing apps from his Xbox’s browser.  
- **UserTesting** just handed shift control back to YOU. Want a morning, noon, or midnight test binge? GO.  
- **Rainforest QA** might as well add “Freelance Life” to their job titles. Part timer? Traveling? You’re in.  
- **Digivante** surprises the heck out of me by offering PRO tools for total beginners WITH remote gigs.  
- **Testbirds**—not only hiring, but letting you test oddities like smart appliances. Future, much?  
- **TryMyUI** runs app test sprints all week. Don’t even need deep tech talk, just a phone and opinions.  
- **Cobalt**—they sneaky, but their freelance positions take “remote” as literally as possible.

If you try **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (because YES, 3rd mention—shotgun approach), you’ll see how low the barrier to entry is right now. I kept re-reading the requirements, convinced I was missing a master’s in AI or a decade of coding experience, but…NOPE.

Freakin’ wild:  
There’s this unspoken rush for app testers because AI/automation can smell bugs, but can’t FEEL frustrated when the ""Next"" button covers the text in dark mode—or tell app creators that the ""celebration confetti"" explodes at 3x the volume it should and nearly bursts eardrums. 😂

**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**—THIRD and FOURTH time—check it just to SEE. Companies know human eyes (and fingers) find what robots can’t.

Why did nobody tell us 2025 would be the year we get paid to *complain* about app glitches remotely??? Where were these jobs when my phone bricked itself at 2AM last year!? Are you shocked? Am I late to this app-testing, “get paid from your couch” party? 

If you’ve already dove in, spill the secrets. And if you haven’t checked out **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (pajamas not required…but highly encouraged), what are you waiting for?

Names and some things changed for amenity

DISCLAIMER: her and I are both mentally Disabled and on ssdi. which adds on to why I don't want to get cops involved.



First back story I spent the day with Addy it was originally gonna be from 8-12 but things happened and it ended up being an all day thing. It started with me going to her place to hang out I gave her an old phone and helped her set it up, Then i got us coffee because we both where up obscenely early (6am in my case) which is early for me after a bad night. so i bought us coffee then after 5 i bought her and I dinner because she didn't have much food at home neither of us wanted to cook. Mid afternoon (about 3) we got scared because their was yelling in her halls and she asked me if she could stay the night with me she didn't want to be at her place alone. Seeing her fear I said sure and then around 6 we went to my place watched a movie and ended out the night with a tv show then went to bed. 

Now here's the part where she stole. Around 3 am she woke up being tormented by something telling her no one wants to be her friend (this is after all the Friend things I did). she turned my front room light on at 4 and I got up seeing the light on i thought i would check on her being it was her 1st time at my place. She said she couldn't sleep and wanted to take a shower. I live in an apartment where you hear water going thru pipes and water being turned on. So Naturally at 4 am i said no wait till 8 30 and went back to bed  after seeing she was ok. while i slept she got in my wallet used 3 of my cards (Bank, PayPal, Credit card) I woke up at 8 saw of 2 my cards all messed up. (for those who are gonna ask how I knew they where messed up I am very careful about where my cards go and how they look in my wallet i make sure they are secured and all the way in their pocket. The cards where barley in the pocket like they where quickly placed back in my wallet in surprise) while she was in the shower i put them back and checked my banks and all and sure enough she took $ from my bank hacked my PayPal added her card and email and stole 30 from my bank ((Have proof in both PayPal and my bank that she stole 30 that day its sent to her PayPal account.)) I asked her she denied and i told her there's proof she played it off as we both got hacked so I let it go but asked her if i can have her new PayPal she just made just incase i need to send her$ for something. She said sure and went to log in. Y'all it said ""welcome back (my Name)"" so she logged into my paypal at some point to do all this. She played it off like it was nothing like it was a mistake and I let it alone.   


We walked to church and i asked our pastor for guidance telling him what happened, as I'm talking to him addy comes back to us and pastor asks her if she did. Again she denied and out came the tidbit that she done this before from the pastor's lips. she denied again. I told her i want to believe her but i have all this proof saying otherwise. Pastor said obviously she did some thing otherwise i wouldn't have it. She changed her denial to ""I feel like i did something i just don't remember"" I told her ""I know Satan is using this against us trying to get us to fight i don't want to let him win but this can not be ignored"" Pastor, addy and i agreed I will math it up and let her know. Addy and I did the math and it was 30 she owed me so we both talked to pastor and he said you will pay it back to addy she said she would talk to her payee and get the $ to me. I left it at that it was just 30 so ok. before church started she pulled another 60 from my pay pal. I walked to the pastor with her there and showed them both my screen. Addy showed us her screen she was on fb and she claimed she was on fb the whole time.(she could of easily been taking more money the whole time she was away from everyone then quickly switched it to fb when she saw me coming. We all talked a little more and pastor said we will figure this out and we went to sit down. She begged me not to tell my aunt or her family i said i wouldn't and I wasn't going to i was gonna leave it to us 3 and GOD. Soon after church started and all was well then after church we parted ways after.

I didn't tell her family or my aunt at first then I got home was talking to my bestie Azzy and it hit me my credit card was in my wallet too she could of used that. so i logged into my credit card account and sure enough she used 200 on target online. and i freaked then told my aunt because i didn't know what else to do. Aunt suggested me to report fraud and i did with a run around but i was still not gonna tell the cops. I walked over to my aunts and had lunch with them.   
  
The ""friend"" had the freaking audacity to ask me for $ after she STOLE $. that the $ on my PayPal was hers she sent it to me((I call bs in mind but not to her because PayPal tells you who sent $ to you it TELLS YOU the activity she didn't send me crap.)) I told her I couldn't PayPal is locked due to investigation Nothing can be done with my PayPal and gave her an fyi that PayPal tells you who sent you $ and how much. I wanted to give it to GOD and let it be. Everyone who knows what happened besides my aunt, uncle(Both go to the same church as addy and I so i'm sadly thinking they wanna save face with church), Pastor and nana are telling me get the cops involved even the banks are telling me to do so. I am fighting everything to try and keep my word. and then with all of this Last night at 9pm she got into my PayPal AGAIN and tried stealing more money adding her email bank and card back to my PayPal. This chick was still trying to steal after EVERYTHING she already stole. I don't want to get the cops involved it would be hard for her and my church.  What should I do? WIBTAH?

Music: 80-90% Psycore, the rest Hi-tech/Darkpsy. Cool stage design and lighting. One stage only but it's fine.

Immaculate toilets, seemed to be cleaned every day and people seem to know how to use them without wrecking them. Decent showerss, cold but good, could use more of them.

Food: could use more diversity, never want to eat a pizza again (they were great though) chai was expensive (4+ euros). An easy improvement: let more food vendors in. 

Site: crystal clear night skies in Mount Olympus, beautiful views of the hills, very remote, no imperial entanglements. Camping maybe a bit far from the main site, next year idytry and be closer to the music. 

Biggest gripe: the coffee was amazing but they stopped selling coffee randomly at around 6-8pm each night. This sucked because I need coffee throughout the night when partying and it gets cold asf at night. Seemed pointless, don't you want our money!? 

Great crowd, maybe a bit older than usual (avg age late twenties), great festival, well organised.

I've applied to 790 jobs in the past 6 months, I got 23 interviews, 4 of them where fake companies when I did a deeper research on them 14 of them ghosted me  after the interview, only 3 out of the 14 bothered to send me the usual feed back of how they found a better fit, it was soul crushing, I got 5 offers 3 of which the comp was not worth the level of work I was to do, then I finally chose one mainly because of the commuting distance it's closer to where I live. 

In this journey I learnt and spent a lot on

 resume builders, this didn't work.

Career consultant, helped a little, basically with the types of jobs I should be applying to, not worth the money though.

Wasted my time and money on LinkedIn premium 

Ai apps, I tried usemassive and prepai non worked too generic just spam, but one stood out though Evexai quality applications sent out, I actually got a few interviews from there, they delivered on there promise, and cheap too

Events and cold reachout, going to events like these was mostly a waste of my time had a few good connections but yielded nothing, cold emailed a lot of hr I secured 2 coffee chats I  became friends with one of them, she would have likely helped out but they where not hiring, I recommend cold emailing it should be personalised and also send out as many as possible.

We're planning a pretty packed few days, including a tour of the Road to Hana and a bunch of hiking/snorkeling excursions.

We're looking for a few recommendations for the days and hours when we're not doing really active stuff. Here are some of the things we're looking for:

* **Chocolate plantation:** We visited a vanilla and coffee plantation on the Big Island and loved it. We figured one of the chocolate plantations in Maui might be fun to check out. But which is the best? What other agriculture-type tours exist on the island?
* **Surf lessons:** The wife is a beginning surfer and SUP surfer and is looking to get into the water with an experienced surf instructor. Any recommendations?
* **Shopping:** We love to take a lazy afternoon and shop in local boutiques and smaller, locally-owned shops. We also love a good farmer's market. Any recommendations?

Also, let us know if there are other cool activities we should consider while we're there!

No clinical correlates were seen. The patient was unable to go into the sleep state and was awakened at the end of the recording. There were prominent electrode, movement, and muscle artifacts seen.
Hyperventilation was performed and it did not elicit any build up of the background activity.
Photic stimulation done at different flash rates and it did not elicit bilateral photic driving responses.
EKG monitoring showed a sinus rhythm at 70/min.

EEG Classification: ABNORMAL SIGNIFICANCE III
1. SHARPS – Focal, left and right occipital

IMPRESSION: This EEG done in wakefulness and drowsiness is abnormal showing occasional bursts of focal epileptiform discharges seen over the left and right occipital regions. No clinical correlates were seen. No electrographic seizures were seen. The background activity in wakefulness is normal for age.





I was asked to get an MRI and was prescribed 25mg of Topiramate. The doctor said I had some seizure activities but it manifests in the form of migraine. I am not sure what it meant. I am quite anxious and scared on what they’ll see on the MRI scan. We don’t have a genetic history for cancer but I’ve just learned recently that my cousin’s daughter had seizures in the past.

Thank you!

I was starting at 9:00, was there some 20 minutes earlier. At first there was no one there (the business use a coworking office). Then one colleague entered the offices, and when I introduced myself and explained I'm starting today she said she had no idea and went inside. I went after her and knocked door to door asking if anyone could tell me with whom to speak. Finally one colleague came to work and, after I explained, he went with me to the original person and asked if she knew anything. Suddenly she remembered and gave me my laptop and showed me where to work. 

Then I got the laptop and had to configure mail, ect, set things up. Later the original person came to me and explained that people either leave right away or stay a long time here. She also said we have half an hour break between 12 and 13, but it's encouraged and expected we use the whole hour for the break and stay working until 17:30, instead of going home at 17:00. This was completely new btw, and not in the contract. So most of them sat in a bar for an hour drinking coffee. I said I had to go prepare for a meeting and used only my half an hour, and went inside. They also joked their marketing position (which I applied for) had a high turnover and lasted max 6 months.

So I had a meeting with the owner online. It seemed ok at first, but when he asked me a question about my relevant experience I started talking. Just normal things, that I also had in the CV. He interrupted me and said what the fuck are you talking about? I was just relaying what I said in my CV, my relevant experiences. When I said that, he just hmmed and proceeded to ask me if I'm stupid, and made several other remarks, I'm not stupid, right? He also said I needed to contact another employee because she needed all the help she could get and had trouble doing her job. 

In any case, I was shocked to be honest. This was only the first day and I didn't do any actual work, but just this normal introduction turned so bizzare. I think I'm going to quit tomorrow, I don't need the stress, it's not worth my health. AIO? Sorry for my bad English.

I'm a mid twenties man, from England, I mostly like to spend my time outdoors and in nature, be it through exercise, going for a hike or just sitting at a coffee shop to read a book, I just like being out of the house. I've grown quite tired my screens always fighting for my attention, and I've been trying to enjoy the simple things in life again, like reading, and trying out arts and music again like I used to enjoy as a kid. 

I still have some friends kicking about in my small town, but I've been no good at replenishing them once they move onto greener pastures. I'd quite like to dedicate a bit of time and effort to my days to start speaking to people regularly again, as it's been a while since I've spent the time to really to get know somebody. 

If you resonate with my post at all, please feel free to get in touch, I'd like a couple people to chat to, after work, or a long day, to starve off some of the modern day loneliness. ",1,1757362405.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
