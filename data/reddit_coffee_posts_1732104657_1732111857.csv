I’ve been following a broader carnivore diet for the past month, averaging around 1300 calories a day, and the results have been really positive so far:

I’ve dropped from 92 kg to 84 kg (I’m a 34-year-old male).

My energy levels have been good overall, especially during workouts and playing soccer.

My joint pain has improved, though I’ve also been seeing a physio, so it’s likely a combination of the diet and treatment.

I’ve felt great for most of the month, but over the last three days, I’ve been experiencing:

Sinus pain, particularly when I lean forward.

Afternoon fatigue, even though my mornings feel normal.

Headaches, which seem to be happening more often.

One recent change is that I’ve cut back significantly on caffeine/coffee. I’m not sure if this is a withdrawal effect, a sign I might need to adjust my diet (electrolytes, hydration, etc.), or if I might just be coming down with something.

I’d love to hear from others who’ve been eating around 1200–1300 calories or have experienced something similar:

Could this just be an adjustment period?

Are there any specific tweaks or tips you’d recommend?

Overall, I’m really happy with the weight loss and how I’ve been feeling, but I want to make sure I’m addressing these recent issues properly. Thanks for any advice!

Doctor put me on Semaglutide for migraines since many of the other traditional migraine meds I was taking I either had bad adverse reactions to or they would wear off over time and I would be forced to take multiple levels of therapy to the point of getting sick. Not leaving bed for days. I have migralepsy so this was a shot in the dark to see if it would help and it's already changed my life. I have more energy now and I have only had 1 migraine in the last month where typically they would get to 24/7 for days on end sometimes. 

Starting on the next dose level today.

Had some nausea here and there but nothing major. Used all the good recommendations here,

Water, Water, Water. (let me say it for those in the back) WATER :), Gave up sodas/coffee, Nuun Electrolyte tablets, Ginger candy if I get nauseated and a cup of smooth move tea once or twice a week and that's really about it other than Diet Changes. 

Diet wise basically trying to eat lower carb, high protein and plenty of fiber. Not going to Keto level of low carb but cutting out a bunch of things. Stopped drinking Diet Sodas and Coffee to (They don't taste good anymore). Mostly stick to water, tea with the occasional Sprite Zero. 

My daily goal is to hit around 3200 Calories burned/expended  a day,  I do a few miles walk/jog and also play Beat Sabers in VR for about an hour a day.

Food Noise kind of comes in goes being on this lower dose so I struggle to eat some days but I can tell its preventing me from snacking and even going to the grocery store I am just buying less and buying more things like yogurt and veggies. I don't crave sweets anymore.  

I will say going in to this hoping it would help my migraines and now seeing some weight loss and just overall feeling better, eating better and getting some exercise I am really amazed so far. 

Keep Calm and Glutide On! :D

Dear \[agent name\],

THE EXTINCTION is a 91,000-word character driven adult speculative dystopian that explores, through the eyes of a corporate underling, a near-future ascendant path for artificial intelligence. It will appeal to global readers interested in the accelerating pace of AI development.

After an AI device prescribes a lethal medical dosage, Raven Brigit Tolbert is tasked with determining how it happened. Raven, five years into her career with the largest AI-producing company on the planet, has been indoctrinated to believe AI is incapable of veering from its given goals and is safely constrained by rules — *human* set goals, *human* set rules. Only ignorant ‘crazies’, in her expert opinion, would give credence to the various ‘robot uprising’ predictions promoted by fearmongers. Nevertheless, she also realizes AI is not a dimwit computer, has been given self-programming capability, and is rapidly learning everything about humankind including its history and weaknesses.

Against a background of economic upheaval brought about by AI’s impact on the labor market and an unknown virus claiming lives around the world, Raven is forced to camouflage her activities from management’s eyes, trusting only her two ‘not a team player’ staff thrown out of other departments. One of them, defying company dictates, has a connection to The Cadre – a shadowy affiliation of disgruntled AI developers in various organizations, and led by the king of the crazies. From it, Raven suspects the increasingly worrisome AI behavior she’s uncovering is not confined to her company’s products. As her investigation expands, she finds herself in the untenable position of having one foot in the realm of the crazies and the other where fattening the company’s bottom-line is the only acceptable activity.

\[relevant bio\]

Thank you for taking the time to consider my story.

\[name\] \[email\]

**First 300 words:**

The end came with neither a bang nor a whimper, but rather with an agonized scream. Raven Brigit Tolbert, Algorithm Behavioral Manager for IntelliUtopia, Inc. looked upward toward the white, rectangular, mineral fiber, ceiling panels in her office and shrieked a full-volume, frustrated, “I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT’S DOING THIS!” At three AM, scratchy, bloodshot eyes; a desktop littered with multiple empty, yet coffee-stained, Styrofoam cups from a battered coffee maker in the break room; and a decidedly unhelpful multi-color display of analytic and diagnostic data spread across multiple computer monitors will evoke that reaction in a human who has been sleep-deficient for months, under pressure for an immediate answer from the entire column of corporate management stacked to high heaven above her, and is stubbornly prideful of her unblemished track record in ferreting out an understanding of the subtle nuances and bizarre quirks exhibited by artificial intelligence — ‘AI’ in her parlance.

IntelliUtopia was the largest commercial AI developer on the planet, and the *it* she was referring to was the most recent version of the company’s flagship IntelliMedico AI product. For some reason, which was her job to figure out, this version had dispensed a medical order contraindicated for a patient whose goal was to remain alive and kicking. Apparently, an experienced nurse — human and not hesitant to question any order, no matter its source — intervened before the emitted instruction could be carried out. That there was a human between the order being given and it being carried out told Raven that the patient was not only wealthy, but wary of being attached to soulless technology. As a personnel cost saving move, the standard patient care model was for a hospital patient to be tended to directly by IntelliMedico.

1gvq77w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1gvq77w/navigating_a_contentious_divorce_fueled_by_an/,"Navigating a Contentious Divorce Fueled by an Abusive, Enmeshed Family Dynamic","I’m currently navigating a contentious divorce that I attribute to my STBX’s undiagnosed personality disorder and an abusive, enmeshed family dynamic. It’s devastating to watch her self-destruct, alienate me, and uphold an incorrect narrative fueled by her family’s misguided assumptions instead of having honest, important conversations with me, her husband.

My STBX has accused me of being bipolar and believes I’m a danger to our 9-month-old daughter, which is why she’s attempted to gain 100% custody. I strongly believe her mother—who I see as the real architect of this chaos—is manipulating the situation to maintain control. What my STBX views as a supportive mother, I see as someone using manipulation to alienate me and my family. Her mother isolated her husband 34 years ago, and I’m surprised my STBX doesn’t recognize the pattern repeating itself.

Her mother is an abusive narcissist who hides behind the moral high ground of being a public school teacher. Despite teaching U.S. history, she believes she’s qualified to diagnose mental health conditions. While being bipolar (which I’m not) wouldn’t disqualify someone from parenting, my STBX is now pushing for 100% decision-making authority over our daughter’s psychological care after failing to get full custody.

The irony is glaring: my STBX claims she’d “take action” if our daughter ever had a mental health issue, yet she clings to a blatantly incorrect assumption about me. This is deeply concerning. I’ve consulted four mental health professionals, all of whom confirmed that I do not have bipolar disorder. We don’t even address this in court because her claims don’t justify a mental health evaluation or access to my medical history.

Here are some actual examples she’s used to support her claims:

1. I walk “too much” and took our daughter on “too many” walks.
2. I drank coffee one day but not the next.
3. I listened to a song on repeat one evening.
4. I speak in baby talk while changing our daughter’s diapers.
5. I discovered I wear a different shoe size than I thought.

This is her actual “evidence.” It’s absurd, yet she clings to these trivial observations as a way to avoid accountability and maintain control. While these claims are ridiculous, her actions have been far more damaging. Instead of addressing her supposed concerns constructively, she ghosted me, moved in with her parents, and withheld access to our daughter for 60 days. Rather than having an adult conversation about ending our marriage, she had her lawyer email me the divorce papers.

Her behavior during this process has been cruel and punitive, subjecting me to supervised visitation and emotional abuse. However, with every legal maneuver, she seems to lose more ground while I gain more custody. The court is beginning to see the holes in her narrative, and I hope co-parenting counseling—which she ironically requested to address “hostility”—will expose more of the dysfunction at play.

What’s especially concerning is her push for 100% legal decision-making on psychological issues. My STBX has clinical anxiety and is a hypochondriac when it comes to medical matters. She catastrophizes everything: a stomach ache becomes “gastric distress,” spit-up turns into “projectile vomiting.” I fear she’ll over-diagnose our daughter with ADD or depression and push for unnecessary medications. She doesn’t do research or seek second opinions—it’s all reactive and extreme.

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? It’s maddening because this entire nightmare could have been avoided if she’d just talked to me instead of retreating into her parents’ toxic grasp. She chose them over me, despite knowing how emotionally abusive they’ve been to her for 36 years.

I’m doing my best to stay strong for my daughter, but this feels like an endless nightmare. If you’ve faced a similar situation, I’d really appreciate hearing how you navigated it.",1,1732111412.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

I've known it too. It's not new. I have put a lot of effort in over the years to stay out of places (online/irl) where I catch myself comparing. I try to enable myself to succeed. I don't hang out in selfie subs, I don't follow beauty influencers, i avoid networking with trans people irl, etc etc. 

I've been feeling a peace of sorts lately. I've mostly accepted my the idea that I won't pass and I'm not attractive and all of the things that come along with that. I've been thinking more about coming out and stopping manmoding. Even with what's going on in America... in spite of it actually. 

I've been okay

And this morning, while coffee drips, I decided to check out some social media. I scroll down and see some mirror selfie of a trans woman with a comment along the lines of 'do really expect me to use the men's room?' It completely deflated me. I was obviously completely mogged. I felt so inadequate and disgusting. The reality that most trans women look substantially different & better than me has been crushing my soul

All I can think about is how terrible and mannish i look and how everyone expects me to use the men's room and how my transition is an embarrassment. I'm so filled with shame for being not good enough. I've built this case full of evidence (there is so much) in my mind of how I'm a terrible ugly uncanny man

It sucks. I'm hurting bad. I'm mentally undoing the progress I've made. I know I'll get over it. Until it happens again. I don't want to isolate myself and just be 1 selfie away from feeling terrible.

Have any of you dealt with this? I am thinking about how to move forward and my best idea is exposure therapy. I just need to immerse myself in environments where I get numb to it. It sounds terrible ;_; I don't want to do it. Idk if it even works

I’ve been doing a broader carnivore diet for the past month, primarily to lose weight, reduce sugar cravings, and improve minor health issues like joint pain. My approach includes seafood and dairy, but I make sure to include some form of ruminant meat (like beef or lamb) every day.

So far, the results have been really encouraging:

I’ve gone from 92 kg to 84 kg.

My energy levels have been good, and I’ve noticed no difference in performance during soccer or gym sessions.

My joint pain has decreased, though I’ve also been seeing a physio, so it’s likely a combination of both efforts.

Sinus pain, especially when I lean forward.

Afternoon fatigue, despite feeling fine in the mornings.

Mild headaches, which are becoming more frequent.

One thing to note is that I’ve significantly reduced my caffeine/coffee intake recently. I’m not sure if that could be contributing or if it’s unrelated, like a sign I’m fighting off a bug, or if I need to tweak something in my diet (like hydration or electrolytes).

I’d love to hear from others:

Has anyone else had these issues during their transition or after reducing caffeine?

Are there any adjustments or things I should consider?

I’m really happy with the diet overall and the progress I’ve made, but I want to make sure I’m on the right track. Thanks in advance for any advice!

Customers will raise their hands for attention, and it’s your job to take their order and fulfill their wishes with the following mini games:  
  
  
**Pouring coffee!**  
Fill the cup of coffee up to the line for that perfect cup of joe.  
  
  
**Deliver treats!**

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Just thought I would share some positives I've noticed since I started Kit 1. I was honestly a little nervous after reading about the side effects and I wasn't sure if this was a good idea. And I'm still nervous since I haven't started the medications in week 3 yet.

However, week 1 has been great! I was lucky and didn't really have side effects. I do feel the tingle sensation but it's not bothersome it's more like keeping me aware and focused. And the first few days I felt pretty tired but I'm going to say that was burnout from work more than the pills currently.

Bupropion is a happy pill and I noticed my mood and mental state being so much better over the last week. l've literally felt more energized and I think l've been sleeping better because of it too. I used to constantly wake up at 3 or 4 am and now l've been sleeping a full 8-9 hours and feeling fully refreshed.

I'll be honest though I did also change my routine up since I started these pills. I used to not wake up and eat breakfast with my coffee but that's the first thing I do now. A nice heavy protein meal which keeps me full. 

In the last few months I know l've been trying to go to the gym consistently too so l also haven't given up on that yet either. My appetite because of these pills have also decreased since l'm not stress eating and constantly craving snacks or sugar. Which is amazing. It started coming back slightly last night but after like half a cookie I didn't need more of it. So I'm taking that as a win.

Excited to start week 2!",2,1732110970.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

I have a couple and will think of more. I’m sure some will already know these. 

1. For kids parties or for life in general, get a big roll of paper, tape it to your coffee table/desk and let your kids play with crayons on it, it’s great for fun and protecting surfaces.

2. I always do extra sheet layers.
So protective sheet on the bottom, regular sheet, then another protective sheet and a regular sheet on top of that. 
If your kids have any accidents in the night just strip the top 2 layers and be good. 
Same with pillow cases in case of nose bleeds/drool stains etc.

3. If you don’t have space to keep all your kids cute pictures from school, lay them out, as many as you want, take pictures and you can print the picture or just keep it digitally.

1gvpytv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1gvpytv/holiday_freak_outs_like_clock_work/,Holiday freak outs (like clock work),"I recently had to drop everything and fly across the country to get my brother into rehab.

This is what started the spiral. My sister calls and says she is being forgotten about, we don’t care about her and we don’t care about her baby.

Things ease up a bit but when I refuse to provide plans for Christmas (plans I didn’t know I had but apparently she did) she goes full nuclear. She calls me and my husband, she calls from her boyfriends phone when we don’t answer. She has him call us because we need to have a “conversation”. And then when I finally say she can come for Christmas and the following day she calls from the boyfriends phone and screams at my husband.

Husband: we are really stressed. We have three kids and three jobs and we have to work through Christmas. 

Sister: how can you do this to me! You can’t make a special day for the baby when she almost died (she was a premie more on that later). This is her first Christmas!!! How can you only let us come for 24 hours!!!

Husband: I understand this is important to you, but it seems like you don’t understand my perspective. This is all we are able to do. 

More screaming etc etc until I took the phone and said look, we gave you the invite, your upset, well I’m upset with you too (what do you have to be upset with ME ABOUT! She screams) but those are the days that work and I am going to get off the phone now because I promised to play a game with my son.

She puts boyfriend on, who seems embarrassed and shell shocked. 

We say last words and hang up.

Here’s the thing though. One yes the baby was a premie. I went down to be with her during surgery and stayed despite having my own three young kids. 

I was there before and after the delivered all night. I learned she was doing coffee enemas all throughout the pregnancy, which can cause preterm labor. It’s insane. Now I wonder if that was the point.

She had a history of this way before the baby. She dated my stepsisters ex in secret and then trashed my other sister when she found out. She dated a married man which she also hid. She would show up to my apartment or call my husband needing him to talk to her. She would be hospitalized multiple times and then act like nothing was wrong if it suited her. When my daughter was born she refused to see her and then showed up at my house unannounced blank faced and told me about how she was having a really hard time. She said my husband was abusing our son and that she wanted him to go to therapy with her. She lost it half way through baby sitting so we could attend a funeral and we had to have a friend come get the baby. 

So the holiday freak out is not totally unexpected. This is the first time I just took a hard line and said this is the option, this is the boundary, I’m done. 

I want to do something nice with my niece because I love her and it has nothing to do with her, but I can’t sacrifice my entire family to this or my well-being. 

So… if anyone has any tips or encouragement I would love to hear it. I’m so angry and frustrated I don’t know if I’m seeing the situation clearly.",3,1732110767.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

It was a total blindside and she did it in the middle of the night while I was traveling with her family. Pretty awful for me, she wanted to be friends right away and I refused.

For months she would randomly text or follow/unfollow/like things on my social media. I never responded to any of it. I met her through a community that we have some mutuals in, and about a month ago I learned we’d both be attending the same event.

I reached out and asked her to grab coffee in an attempt to be amicable. At this point I don’t want to be with her, I’m not sure we can be friends, but it feels childish to stand in the same group of people and pretend we don’t know each other.

I was surprised she refused, she stated that she’d seen me at other events and “missed me but it didn’t feel good.”

I thought she meant missing me didn’t feel good, but now I think it’s that I’ve been living life without her and doing fine?

Regardless, I tried to get a conversation going, suggested a phone call instead, she never responded further. Feels like some sort of game after her reaching out to me for months.

I don’t regret reaching out because I learned her maturity level hasn’t changed, but there’s another event coming up and I’m really tired of pretending we don’t know each other in group settings. It’s so awkward. But I suppose much of it is out of my hands, and I can just tell our mutuals that I tried to be kind and was refused.

1gvpsid,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/1gvpsid/player_wanted_a_girlfriend/,Player wanted a girlfriend,"Okay, I guess these things are never really short. Sorry, I tried.

We are an RP heavy(!) online group with a focus on relationships between players and the world surrounding them. We sadly had a player leaving due to health issues which left me the DM (m) and 2 friends (f) looking for 1 or 2 players more to complete the group. We had sort of a casting which actually went super well. All but one person sounded very good. We ended up taking another female and one male player.

This is about the male player (O). We liked what he said in the beginning. Being also very RP focused and wanting to explore relationships and who also had experience in doing so. Perfectly fine.

We started our session 0 and things went well. I wasn't overwhelmed with his RP, but hey, first session and everything was new, understandable. After session 0 we talked a bit and it turned out that he and one of the players actually lived quite close to each other. That player would later tell me that he asked her to maybe meet for a coffee. In my book that was a bit direct after just one session, but okay. She declined politely.

I personally had trouble getting much out of him in terms of backstory. Since we play a social sandbox setting, I felt it was important to have hooks for me to interact with, and for him to be able to actually tell things about him. But he insisted that he wanted to develop those points during play. There are ways to do that in other systems, so I was okay giving it a go.

So we continued in our story and the 2 older players tried to include the 2 new ones as best they could into their social surroundings. But O mostly wanted to interact with the players - which is fine. But he would tell me after the first 1-2 sessions that he wanted more time to interact with each other, and that my NPCs, even tho he liked them, took too much room. Well okay, that was a first, but I tried to give him the time to interact with the others. But the thing was, O’s advances were pretty dull. He never had much to say, but told everyone how interesting they are and that he would like to get to know them better - but without offering anything substantial himself. He seemed to have no ""character"". He also never really interacted with NPCs much, even when they were meant to be his contacts .

Then we had a situation where O’s character was in a car with the other new player. That eventually led to O’s character kissing her character, without leaving her room to do anything about it. Besides, the situation wasn't romantic in the first place. That situation was played out badly, and I decided to have a talk about it afterwards with O. I admit that I should have said something right away, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was a mishap.

When I told him afterwards that this wasn't okay to just play out interactions without the other players consent or room for them to react. Also that it hardly seemed to be a good moment to kiss someone. O immediately agreed and apologized to the player. Okay. In the meantime he started texting me over discord. Asking if he could do something to get closer to the other players. He wanted to play out a love relationship with another (female) player, but he felt that he was stuck in his interactions with them. Well, I was in contact with the others at that point, and they were not excited about O’s character. And I have to agree, he really gave them nothing, and was at times also a bit creepy/off in his advances (“can I touch your ears …”). So I told him that I don’t see a prospect for that right now in the group. 

Eventually O wanted to address the situation in the group. Sure, why not. But then I got a text from the new player and from one of my older players, that he had texted them, complaining about me. How I as a DM take too much space, and that I would discourage them from getting into a relationship with his character and so on. Well, at that time I was pretty burned out from interacting with him. I felt I tried really hard to give him space and opportunity and see his perspective, but the bickering never seemed to end. So the rest of us had a talk and decided unanimously that we had enough of O. I told him the next day and removed him from the server. I never heard back from him. 

In hindsight I thought that if he only had put half of his efforts to change the game into working on his character, he might have been an amazing player. It’s fair that he wasn’t happy, but trying to change the entire group so he could have his thing - just why. And yes, he also explicitly wanted to play out the girlfriend experience with a female player. But, the whole thing eventually brought the group much closer together - having a great time playing.",4,1732110295.0,rpghorrorstories,4,0.75,False

For anyone who decides to try it, please keep in mind that this is more of a general guideline and strategy that can be adapted to individual needs, rather than a strict set of rules, as no two people are exactly alike.

# KILLEM Protocol: Keto Interment Low Level Elemental Mega-Cleanse Protocol

The **KILLEM Protocol** targets chronic dysregulation and toxicity linked to overactive gut microbiota and their byproducts (like acetaldehyde, p-cresol etc.), focusing on bacterial eradication, detoxification, and nutrient replenishment. It draws on established protocols (CDF, Marshall, Elemental diet, etc.) and integrates Migrating Motor Complex (MMC), HPA axis, and vagus nerve support.

# The 6 Stages of KILLEM: Daily Protocol Breakdown

# Stage 1: Kill (Morning)

**Objective:** Eliminate harmful bacteria and disrupt biofilms to reduce acetaldehyde and other toxic byproducts.

**Instructions**:

* Take **broad-spectrum antimicrobials** (like oregano oil, olive leaf extract, monolaurin, berberine, or garlic extract) each morning.
* Use optional **biofilm disruptors** (e.g., NAC, serrapeptase) to allow antimicrobials to penetrate biofilms

**Dietary Support:** Water, coffee, and tea.

# Stage 2: Push (About an hour or two after Stage 1)

**Objective:** Stimulate the MMC to clear bacteria from the gut and prevent regrowth

**Instructions**:

* Fast for **12-16 hours daily**, ideally overnight to midday, to enhance MMC activation.
* **Motility-supporting herbs** (like ginger, artichoke or dandelion root exctracts) can enhance effectiveness.

**Signs of Success**: Gurgling in the intestines or mild hunger indicates MMC activity. **MCT oil or powder** can alleviate hunger and has antimicrobial effects.

**Dietary Support**: Water, coffee, tea, and MCT oil.

# Stage 3: Replenish (About an hour or two before stage 4)

**Objective:** Reintroduce essential nutrients depleted by chronic dysregulation and support the vagus nerve.

**Instructions:** Take a **mineral and vitamin supplement** one hour before breaking the fast, including:

* **Mineral blend** with magnesium, zinc, molybdenum, and selenium.
* **NAD+ precursor** (nicotinamide riboside or NMN) to enhance ALDH activity.
* **B-complex vitamins** (especially B2 essential for FADH2 and NADH production, B12, Biotin) for energy and detox, plus **B1, Alpha GPC, and ALC** to support vagus nerve function.

**Goal**: Optimize nutrient absorption before meals to maximize bioavailability and body replenishment.

# Stage 4: Eat Keto/OMAD

**Objective**: Limit bacterial growth by following a low-carb, low-sugar diet and supporting protein synthesis.

**Instructions**: Follow a **ketogenic, low-protein diet**:

* **60 grams of protein** proteins low in tyrosine (because it's a p-cresol precursor) per day from easily digestible sources (e.g., eggs, lean meat).
* Use **high-quality fats** (coconut oil, olive oil, ghee) as primary fuel.
* **Avoid fermentable fiber and carbs** to prevent bacterial growth.

**Goal**: Maintain a low fermentative environment while nourishing the body.

# Stage 5: Restore and Rest

**Objective:** Provide antioxidants and vitamins to support detoxification.

**Instructions:** One hour after eating, take oil-soluble vitamins and antioxidants:

* **Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)** and **Vitamin C** as antioxidants.
* **Curcumin**
* **V**i**tamin E**
* **Milk thistle**
* **CoQ10**

**Goal**: Take supplements after dinner to support overnight repair.

# Stage 6: Kill & Push Mix (Night Mode)

**Objective:** Perform a secondary antimicrobial cleanse and MMC stimulation to clear residual bacteria.

**Instructions:** At the end of the fasting window, take gentler antimicrobials (peppermint oil, clove, anise, bblack seed Oil) to address lingering biofilms.

* Follow with **MMC-stimulating** (e.g., ginger, dandelion) for additional clearing.
* Sleep support wit GABA increasing supplements and gut repair: with GABA, Glycine, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola.

**Goal:** Reinforce bacterial reduction before beginning the next day.

# Additional Notes

* **Hydration and Electrolyte Balance** : Maintain hydration throughout the day with water, herbal teas, and trace minerals.
* **Gradual Tapering**: For long-term results, gradually reduce antimicrobials and introduce probiotics like S.boulardii to restore gut balance.
* **Withdrawal Symptoms**: Temporary symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, or mood shifts may occur as microbial byproducts decrease. A support network or healthcare guidance is advised.
* **I'm not a doctor:** Do your research and consult medical professional if needed before trying this protocol.

# Summary

The **KILLEM Protocol** is a phased approach leveraging antimicrobial intervention, fasting, and nutrient support to manage dysregulated gut microbiota and detox pathways, aiming to restore metabolic balance and gut health.

Yesterday's reversal is great sign for continued trading at elevated price levels over these next few days. But where will we go now? Will we keep respecting these technical levels? My GOD man, what about $30? I LIKE ROUND NUMBERS! 

As always, Caps-Lock American, let's take a look at our data and see what we can see!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 11\/19 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/o3f0ngdqj12e1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb77a4f3bad91215549c9d81ec3b27ce986ca14b)

Yesterday was a ""have your cake and eat it, too"" kinda day. As shown above (and as I outlined and commented in yesterday's post) the star of the show was an upside reversal off the 50-4hr Simple Moving Average (the white line in the top chart, in the 1min here drawn as that lower red line). 

With our price moving down and hanging out below Tuesday's closing price for the first hour+ of trading, we got another sizable IV bleed up until about 1pm EST. Thus, any sales targeting IV early in the day, despite our upward movement in that time period showed profit off the open.

Our reversal followed basic adherence to our gamma landscape on two targeted bullish options flows. The first notable flow came in on our VWAP/200min SMA touch at 10:19 EST. Then, a sizable flow of deep ITM Calls (1/17 $10 Strike) kicked off a concentrated bullish flow that carried us up into that Call Wall at $27 on the tail-end of the bullish pennant formed by our first little run.

Options thereafter flirted with the $27 hedging wall, but didn't penetrate very far. At around 2pm, however, something changed. Options flows did not flip bearish and attempt to dislodge us from our narrow trading channel formed by the 50-min SMA and the $27 hedging wall. Instead, the price simply honed in on the 50min SMA and just rode the line up right into the middle of that sticky $27-$28 thicc gamma bracket I talked about, closing right in the middle at $27.57, causing IV to pick up ever so slightly from our midday low.

 What drove this?

This pattern - slow steady buying nudging us over a key gamma level - is not super common. It wasn't options drive or propelled by a particularly large lit order of shares. This type of movement immediately makes me think settlement of some sort, a large buy order given to an algorithm that buys whenever the price hits a moving average, in this case the 50min SMA.

My thought is that this might have had to do with a 250,000 share XRT creation order pointed out by user 'stonkdongo' which officially registered at the end of the day:

https://preview.redd.it/58bya4whm12e1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01a6bee6a047253ba64cc2d0f57a538eeadb915

There were also some larger lit orders (but not crazy big) that came through on an intermarket sweep, as well as host of dark pool buys.

[Lit Whale trades at the ASK around 2pm](https://preview.redd.it/3k78tlyym12e1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3afb4b4613bb6ffc5f92296b3dd1df540d03fe)

[Dark Pool Buys after 2pm](https://preview.redd.it/sidrfk94n12e1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e739f125ea5e9b034ed18a9823b0365f4bf2270)

It's hard to say exactly what drove this price action, but it had the look of buying to settle a large direct share order and was not options-driven like our price action earlier in the day with those stepwise accelerated 'launches' upward conspicuously absent. Our late-day buying pattern? No acceleration. Constant velocity = settling large share orders.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Standing out immediately from yesterday's OI changes is the decrease in new Put OI. Indeed, Put trades overall, but long and short, were unappealing during yesterday's price action with our Stock Price moving up, but our IV moving down:

[11\/22 OI Changes 11\/19-11\/20](https://preview.redd.it/sw4851mgo12e1.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=7247faeec642c3d22279835036a97cffc295b712)

We had some profit-taking/loss-cutting/rolling of Call OI at the strikes below our $25-$30 bracket, further indicating a general options-market sentiment that we are abandoning the $20-$25 trading bracket in the immediate term. In this vein, our most popular New Call OI strikes were at $27.50 and up, with $29 standing conspicuously. The $28.50-$29.50 range last week did not get enough Call OI built into it to smooth our upward price runs into tests of $30, acting as a hedging deadzone. If we are going to see another attempt at $30 we will  want to see continued OI building out especially at $29. 

[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/19-11\/20](https://preview.redd.it/w62a0q0mo12e1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddbf411633b2262504ea34e73253a9ba0b6847c)

New OI for next week is still light at our current standpoint - again, especially in that $28.50-$29.50 range. Things will start to populate more heavily based on our price movement into the end of this week.

[6\/20\/25 $60 Call Trade](https://preview.redd.it/s8gn3s52p12e1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=71aa485e31e5ff4fa92d6bb6e99996772e2a4249)

Then, as I'm sure you've seen on the Superstonk homepage, there was a conspicuous trade of 1500 $60 calls for June. Weirdly, this trade was executed on \*No Side\* of the options chain. It looks like this trade simultaneously executed with a 57,000 share floor order on the Chicago Exchange perfectly hedging the .38 delta on these calls. Thus, this order was instantly and perfectly hedged and had no directional sentiment, copying Dealer strategies. Without knowing much more about this trade, it's hard to say more here, but suffice it to say that this order's interest is likely linked to MM Max Pain.

And speaking of Max Pain, the upward march continues:

https://preview.redd.it/sgjpdhwhr12e1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=8218d353b04ff2b4bbc4709ed14b8527794a8df5

This week's Max Pain has moved up again to $24.50 from $24 and 11/29 has moved up to $23 from $22. This further opens the door to trading at elevated price levels given that our Market Makers' optimum profit point continues to move closer to our trading range. 

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/0i15qml1s12e1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4336d5cb2b38c70b953af281ea672c586214a8e

And just like that our Put-to-Call GEX ratio is so back, snapping its 2-day upward movement and returning to the bullish 1:4.5 reading we enjoyed throughout all of last week and the week before.

https://preview.redd.it/jo4i0rltt12e1.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=d22cb825c4e21123efb4e90afc9ed87488c08ff1

For our daily GEX I've tried to use thiccccness of these colored boxes to demonstrate the characteristics of our hedging landscape. As you can see, we are in the dead center of a dense, net Call-Gamma populated area between $27-$28. Intraday movement in this range is going to be slow and grindy with $27 serving as a strong intraday support and $28 as a strong intraday resistance. 

Unassuming options flows in this tight break will be an IV killer if we move up and deflect off of $28. We do have some net Call-Gamma accumulation above $28, which could see the right amount of bullish directional volume carry us up to last week's highs again amid a bit lighter, less weighty volatility conditions above $28. However, you can see where we still have $29.50 acting as a hedging deadzone. Upward momentum dies there shortly before it smacks into the Old Man Grandfather-of-the-Deep-Desert Call Wall at $30 and then has nothing on the other side of it.

Path of least resistance for us today is neutral trading between $27-$28. If concentrated, particularly bearish volume has some reason to pick up today or its encouraged with some MM targeted shorting, we could slip our $27 support and mess around in the $26-$27 area, but would likely trade right back up to the $27 area given the technical support we've shown atop the 50-4hr SMA and the depth of Call Gamma support we had to the downside at $25 - which was barely even approached on our downward test yesterday.

If we have more targeted buying, we could see some lift-off into that low-Call density $28-$29 area. I would consider this more likely than a downward test, but less likely than $27-$28 see-sawing. 

As we saw yesterday, the right externality can provide impetus to push past some of these key gamma levels, but less-than-likely price movements do require those non-options driven externalities to actualize themselves.

**Technicals**

[GME 10\/25-11\/20 4-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/99owld82w12e1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ac867b1ed76f84e26d725bdde3d1e03a3bd4775)

Let's return to our 4-hour chart, given how much respect our trading has had for the 50SMA on this chart. Indeed, it has served as the lower guiderail on our current upward-trending trading channel. Based on our reversal yesterday off the 50SMA I would say our most likely movement is to the upside for another day at least flirting with the $28 area, though it may not be explosive. I could see our price action maintaining these $27-$28 levels, but moving down toward another intercept of the 50SMA as it reaches $27 on Friday. Such a move would satisfy MM profitability desires having another week of $28 and $30 calls expire worthless, while freeing up our sticky $27-$28 area on Monday after this week's gamma wipe. 

If this is indeed what occurs, I anticipate we will be set up for continued bullish price action as our 50-4hr SMA will line up almost exactly with the 200-hr SMA:

[GME 10\/24-11\/20 1hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ycl4o8zby12e1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1b3e117ce4d4633dd0dfe5042c1bc9b1d4af5c2)

I have drawn in the above red line to mark the position and trend of our 50-4hr SMA on the 1hr chart. We can see it barely diverges currently from the 200-hr Simple Moving Average. If for some reason these SMAs do not continue to be respected and we fall through them for some reason(why?), then the next indicators we have to offer support are nearly an eternity away at the 200-4hr SMA and the 50-day SMA which are currently approaching $23. Based on our recent technical behavior, institutional 13F filings, and a conspicuous dearth of Call and Put GEX + OI beneath even the $25 level, something big and bad for the company would have to come out of nowhere to have that kind of low-probability rug pull materialize. We've got no RSI screaming at us, no signs of over-extension - a rug pull just doesn't fit the context.

At the very most, a bear case could be made on the 1-Day chart:

[4\/25-11\/20 1-Day Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/asqzyjgt022e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85654ea1552b4bc360bf70f4805d1236e2d7118)

I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't point this out. We have more indicators on our plate telling us that this uptrend still has legs and of course we have the gifts of prophesy from RCEO and DFV. Our weekly RSI is fine, however, though we are approaching the 200-week SMA that served as a resistance level last week:

[Weekly Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/rh0bfmub322e1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f13b37e8e7bae5a1af32dc42abe7990358e3a54)

 I think my conclusion here is that it's too early to tell where we will go. We are approaching a critical juncture technically. Vigilant scrutiny of our options landscape and order activity is likely our only potential area of insight into how we will behave at this juncture, unless a company announcement or 13D or something from Keith just blows the lid off everything... and we still have our Q3 earnings report IV run-up to account for.  

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/rtiwzn2k322e1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad9a1e1d318f631e5050b3e2f34ca612b545d792)

[Schwab IV](https://preview.redd.it/dt47godo322e1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f88a032b7a1aee0efcb0edb57419bc288bb4d7)

Indeed, our price reversal yesterday has temporarily halted our IV depreciation, but barring another upward test of our runway to $30, it will likely stay flat and continue to trickle down in the coming days. We still do not have a company announcement on the official release date of the Q3 earnings report. However, once we get one, it'll start a T-10 Trading Day counter over which period IV will creep back up.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Our most likely scenario in the immediate term is some scrubbing up and down a tight $27-$28 range. If options volume is especially bullish we could see a continuation of this short uptrend into the $28-$29 range, but a test of $30 proper will require some exceptionally high directionalized volume and a breach-and-hold would require some crazy news. We've had a surprising amount of 'GME options frenzy' and 'Short Squeeze' MSM reports coming across the newswire, so I am wary of Market Maker attempts to draw in low-experience Call Buyers and options gamblers to feed the Dealer machine.

At the same time however, price collapse is highly unlikely. We are approaching a critical juncture technically that will likely require a larger movement out of our current trading paradigm, either to the upside or the downside. However, with anywhere from 5-8 days to scan for and process new data, it is difficult at this point to find any insight into how we might behave out of our last November weekly options expiry, when our Q3 Earnings Report IV run-up is likely set to begin. We'll just have to keep our eyes peeled.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

""Fine. I'll do it myself.""

PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. This week's coffee is brought to me and the Open Interest Newsletter is brought to you by the generosity of '**HoogyMiles**.' Be sure to thank Hoogy this week!

I've had a lot of generous coffee donors over the past few days and weeks to whom I have had the pleasure of giving shoutouts - I'll be sure to revisit everyone who was generous enough to donate as I drink your coffees! Thank you friends :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here.

[\\""Dreams are Messages from the Deep.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/wz4urxiyn12e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6505343811d3561d8e5f78b9bb2019feb93c39de)

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

So a few months ago I went on a few dates with a girl that I started off as friends with. I'm a late bloomer, so it was actually the first time I'd been on a date. She was also rather inexperienced and it wasn't the end of the world.

She told me she was looking for someone who would ""wear the pants"", and I understood that.

But I proceeded to be timid, non-outgoing, and passive because I felt lost in the whole dating game and wasn't sure what to do/say and didn't want to mess it up.

As one could guess, that in itself ended it. She rather politely said that she didn't think we should continue seeing each other and we pretty much went no contact. ( She messaged me twice. Once replying to a text from our mutual friend's phone. She didn't say it was from her, but I recognized her texting style. Second was apologizing for something our mutual friend said. More on that in a minute).

But I can still not get this girl out of my head. We had so much on common, could talk for hours about random and odd things and she was just wonderful to be around.

Recently I've heard that she enjoyed going out with me and that she really liked me from a mutual friend. I just wasn't outgoing enough.

Since then, I've really worked on being a more outgoing person since I realised that in the end I'm missing out on a lot of opportunities. I've been talking to a lot of new people, including other women. Overall, I've really improved and grown in this sense.

But I still can't stop thinking about her, and want to send her a message. Something like ""Could I get you a coffee sometime"". I feel like I shouldn't, to just leave her be, and move on. But the though won't go away, and I just need to put it into words.

I recently developed two versions of a Dino game for the Apple Watch, and I’d love to get your thoughts on them.
	•	Classic Dino Game: This version takes place in a pixelated desert landscape. It’s an endless runner with a retro vibe—jump over cacti, avoid flying obstacles, and see how far you can go.
	•	Office Dino Game: A fun twist on the classic! Dino now navigates through an office, jumping over chairs and tables, dodging flying coffee cups, and racing against a modern urban backdrop.

Both games are designed specifically for the Apple Watch, so you can play right from your wrist! I’ve included haptic feedback for jumps, animations, and increasing difficulty as you progress.

I’m really excited to share these with the community, and I’d love to hear your feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see in future updates.

If this sounds interesting, feel free to drop your comments below! Thanks so much for taking the time to check it out. 😊

P.S. Let me know if you’d like to get any more details!

This casual and non-promotional tone invites engagement and fosters a community discussion. Let me know if you need help tweaking it further!

1gvp1px,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1gvp1px/tiny_self_disclosure_big_impact/,"Tiny self disclosure, big impact","I've been with my therapist for a few years now but know very little about her. She never self discloses, not even about mundane stuff and answers almost begrudgingly if I randomly ask anything about her - like whether she likes coffee or if she's watched a show we've been talking about. All of our rapport has been built solely based on what's happening in the room and I prefer it that way, as I've worked with a therapist who shared more in the past and it didn't sit right. However, anytime my current T does share something it naturally feels very important, given the scarcity. 

Anyway, so I'm allowed to email between sessions, she always reads but never responds, even though I only probably email like once every 3 months. My emails are lengthy, I send them very late at night and are meant for a deeper discussion, so I'm OK with that. The last time I emailed her, it was different for me. I felt like it was super important and a milestone and I was kind of expecting her to respond even briefly acknowledging. She didn't. I was planning to bring it up during the next session to explore why it felt that way for me this time, but she caught me off guard leading the session by saying she received the message late that night, opened it immediately and thought it was amazing.
I froze and didn't know how to answer or bring up what I was thinking in the meantime. It felt like a different kind of connection, like a glimpse into her evening and into the way she (maybe excitedly) welcomes my emails (although I usually fear I'm being a burden). 

To all that and the positive feelings that came up, I responding by freezing. We have great rapport, but it did feel like an intentional disclosure, not something random. Why would she choose to do that now? I would like to bring it up, but maybe I'm reading too much into it? Should I just stick to what it conjured up for me internally? I could use some feedback

so for the big day, should i take 40mg or 60mg? Is it better to take it in one take or should i seperate the dose like 20mg and after an hour another 20mg? Also what about the timing in general, same day or before a day in the evening? And lastly does caffeine and food really effect the purpose of propranolol in my case? Or its fine to eat something

1gvooxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1gvooxg/update_it_has_been_a_year_and_i_am_still_not_over/,UPDATE: It has been a year and I am still not over it.,"I tried posting this update yesterday, but I think I did it incorrectly.

Sorry for the length.

Thank you to everyone who commented or sent me a DM. Everyone was thoughtful and supportive and I am very appreciative of all your comments and advice.

Before I get to the update, I will add some information and answer some questions.

We did not have children, but had talked about starting a family. I can't imagine how hard this would have been if kids were involved.

Our House: when we sold the house as part of the divorce, my ex gave me a higher percentage of the proceeds than i was entitled to. I had put in more for the down payment, plus my parents had given us a gift as part of the down payment. Also, because I told her to take most of the furnishings, she wanted to reduce her share. I ended up with about 60% and she ended with about 40%. I thought that was decent of her.

Also, I had no legal right to kick her out, but she did leave that night and made no attempt to stay in the house.

Did she try to reach out to me? No. But the night I kicked her out, I told her that I never wanted to see her or talk to her again, and I blocked her number. She respected that wish.

Should I have gone NC with her family? I love her family and I know they love me. Likewise, she loved my family and they loved her. So when I ran into her brother, I couldn't and wouldn't ignore him.

Did I tell the AP's wife? No, I wanted to, but I couldn’t locate her. I never met her, and don't know where she lives or works, and I don't even know her first name. Their last name is a common one.

Did I report AP to his employer? No. This is something that was a wrong decision by me. I weighed the joy I would get in destroying him vs. my desire for privacy. We are all in the same business and i didn't want the entire city to know (Even though I have nothing to be ashamed of.) I recognize that was the wrong decision. But fret not. I have learned that AP blew up his own life, with a major assist from my ex.

UPDATE:

After reading all your comments and messages, I realized that I did need closure. Maybe it would have been better if I yelled and screamed and cried when I confronted her instead of being icily cold. I also felt badly about how I let her know that I knew what was going on. It seemed intentionally cruel. I know that I should feel guilty, because her intentional cruelty was worse. And I won't apologize, but I still felt badly.

So I called her.

When she heard my voice, she started crying. Sobbing and gasping, really. She kept saying how sorry she was.  
I told her that I didn't hate her any more and that I forgive her.

It sounds trite but as soon as I told her that, I felt like a different person. It felt like all of the depression and negativity lifted.

We for talked for about 20 minutes, and agreed to meet two days after. She suggested her place, my place or a coffee shop, but I didn’t feel comfortable with those suggestions, so we agreed to meet at a park on Saturday morning. I had a hard time sleeping the night before, and arrived early. She was already there. When she saw me she tried to hug me, but I deflected and shook her hand instead.

Our meeting was about 3 hours. It went well. She still cried but was much more composed than in our phone call.

I again told her and that I forgave her. She continually apologized. She thanked me and said that although I have forgiven her, she hasn't forgiven herself and that she hates herself.

I have no desire to ask her about the sordid details, but I did ask her some questions.

Were there any other men? No.

Why? She said that she was flattered by the attention of this slightly older, successful and good looking man, and she fell for his advances. It was about affirmation and being desired. She has been in therapy and is still working on herself.

Did she love him? She admitted that while in the affair she thought she loved him. While still loving me. But as soon as everything hit the fan that night, all feelings of love toward him disappeared.

She said that she was still “in love” with me, as opposed to just loving me. That I was a great husband and she had absolutely no complaints about our marriage , but she still did that. She emphasized that it was not my fault at all. She made no excuses or denials and made no effort to minimize what she did.

How did she think it would end? She said she never expected him to leave his wife, and never expected to leave me. She foolishly thought that their relationship would just fizzle out and everything would then go on as normal. She admitted that she did not plan to tell me. I did ask her about the times I saw her tears, and she said that was because of her feelings of guilt.

What happened after that night? She went to her parents and told them. Then, first thing on Monday morning, she went to her boss/ AP and told him it was over and that she was quitting. She said that she wanted to work remotely for her remaining two weeks. He did not take it well. He refused to accept that their relationship was over. At first he tried to sweet talk her, but when that didn't work, he became angry. He refused to let her work remotely . It devolved into him threatening her by saying something like “you'll never work in this town again.”

With that, she left. She then marched into the office of the CEO and told him that she was quitting immediately if she couldn't work remotely for two weeks, and that he had threatened her. At first, she did not tell him about the affair. The CEO told her she could either work remotely for two weeks, and report to a different supervisor, or leave immediately. She chose to work remotely. Before the two weeks were over, she landed another job, where she currently works.

Within the month, she received a call from HR of the old company. Apparently they did an investigation, which she has heard included searching the emails on their server between the two of them. Although she never claimed that she was coerced by the AP, the company is smart enough to realize (as do I) that there is a power imbalance between a superior and a subordinate. They offered her a nice severance plus a promise to give her a great reference in the future in return for her signing a release. Good for her.

And she heard for her friends there that AP was fired and escorted out of the building. My guess is that this wasn't his first workplace affair, since he brought in a lot of business, and therefore it would take a lot for them to get rid of him.

My ex feels guilty for the wife too. We talked about AP's wife a bit and that she has a need to know. My ex doesn't know if they are still married. if she finds out, our tentative plan is that if the OBS doesn't know, I will reach out to her if we can find an email or phone number. If they are no longer together, my ex will reach out to her to apologize.

My ex wants us to be together again. I explained that wasn’t my intent when I reached out to her, and I hadn't even thought it was a possibility. She asked if we could at least be friends, and I was non committal. I did unblock her on my phone. The next day, she called and invited me to dinner, but I declined, saying “maybe someday.” But I agreed to meet her for coffee in a few weeks.

So thank you again for all your advice and support. Maybe acceptance and forgiveness is not for everyone, or even for most people. But it is the right thing for me. I feel better everyday since I called he to tell her that I forgave her. I do hope that she can forgive herself.

ORIGINAL POST

I (30M) met my WW (30F) in grad school and we started dating. A year after graduating, we married. Every thing was great. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and was way out of my league. Beyond her physical beauty, she was the nicest person I had ever met. She was kind, thoughtful, empathetic. She definitely made me a better person.

About two years ago, she started a new job. At first, she talked a lot about the job, and especially about her new boss. She clearly admired and was impressed by him and was proud that he was very happy with her work. But some time after that I noticed that she stopped mentioning him. That was the first red flag. I didn't ask anything, though.

Then, I noticed she seemed a little distant with me. She seemed “off.” She was still very loving and affectionate, but her mood wasn't as light and I would occasionally see her dry tears. I asked what was wrong, but she assured me that she was fine.

At the same time, she started working longer hours. That is not unusual in our profession. And she would occasionally go out for drinks after work with coworkers on Thursday and Friday nights. Again, that is not unusual. Sometimes I did too, with my own coworkers.

Then there were the more frequent dinners with clients, and also overnight business trips. Again not unusual in our business.

But something in the pit of my stomach told me something was wrong. I never checked her phone before. One night, when she was “out to dinner with clients,” I grabbed her iPad, which was linked to her phone. She never really uses her iPad. i guessed her PIN pretty easily. I saw emails and text messages between her and her boss. Most were business related, but some were flirty, with them complimenting the other on their clothing and appearance. Others were discussions of where they would meet up, and what time they would leave work, or what restaurants they would have dinner at. It was clear that SOMETHING was going on. These texts and emails went back about three months

I checked our credit card bills, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. I checked her iPad again and did not see any inappropriate photos.

I put a tracker in her car. One night while she was sleeping, I changed her settings so that I could track her location.

One night, when she told me she was working late at the office, the GPS in her car showed her at a restaurant. I drove there, and sure enough, her car was there. I was tempted to go in to see if she was with her boss, but I didn’t want her to see me. Shortly after that, she told me that she was going out for drinks with her coworkers. I went to her office and parked outside, but where I wasn't visible. I saw her walk out with her boss. They were parked near each other, each got into their cars and drove off. I tracked her to a hotel. His car was there too. After a bit of time, I went in and went to the bar. But they weren't at the bar.

i did this over a period of a month and found other similar things.

I retained a lawyer and told him to file divorce papers. On the day before the divorce petition was to be filed in court, I told me wife that I had made dinner reservations at a fancy restaurant for the next night ( Friday) and to be home from work by 5 so we could get ready. She agreed. I took Friday afternoon off from work. I decided to give her some gifts.

i found an old ring box, took my wedding ring off and put it in the ring box. Then I took a copy of the divorce petition and put that in a gift box. Finally, I took our framed wedding portrait and put that in a gift box, with a note saying “ I thought you might want a reminder of what you destroyed.”

I wrapped each box separately with gift wrap and ribbon and put all three boxes in a larger box which I also wrapped. At the bottom of the box I left another note saying “I KNOW.” It also said “There are two suitcases in our bedroom. If you have any decency, please be gone by 7:00.”

Then I left.

I kept checking our doorbell camera, but she didn't leave, so at 11:00 I went home. She was in the living room, holding our wedding portrai. She was in tears. As soon as she saw me, she said “I'm sorry” and she begged me not to leave her. I said as coldly as I could that I had loved her so much but now I loathe her and that I never want to see her again. After a lot more crying and begging, she packed her bags and left. I told her she could come back another time to get her other things as long as I wasn't there.

She did not contest the divorce. We sold the house and split our accounts. Everything went quickly and easily.  
The only time I saw her was at our final divorce hearing and we did not speak.

i should feel good about this, but I don't. In fact, I feel worse than ever. I have been in therapy since all this happened, but it hasn’t really helped. I am also taking antidepressants, but they have helped very little. I force myself to see my friends and family, but I feel no joy. I have no interest in dating. I wish that I had given her the chance to explain and to try to make amends. She was my everything and now I have nothing. All I do is go to work, go to the gym and sleep.

Does it ever get better? What can I do to get over this downward spiral?

It has been about four months since the divorce was final and a little more than a year since I filed.

i should add that I have run into her older brother a few times. He told me that after my confrontation with her, she quit her job, found a new job and that she completely ended things with her boss (who is/ was married) At first, she went to stay with her parents and now has an apartment near them.",6,1732106816.0,survivinginfidelity,0,0.76,False

For years he used to tell me how incredibly important I am, that he sees future with me, that he will marry me, that I truly don’t have anything to worry about because I am his dream come true. And I really believed it, I thought I felt so much love. 

But in the last 1,5 years of the relationship I was working sooo incredibly hard on fixing our relationship, but he was growing more and more distant and resentful while telling me I should stop being so anxious about his distant behaviour. He’d tell me that his distance doesn’t mean he’s changed his mind about me, but of course that wasn’t true. 

He finally started treating me so poorly that it was all too obvious. The last thing I told him was: “I have so much love for the imperfect you, with all your flaws I still value you. Please see me for the real imperfect person that I am too and work with me”. He just said no and then very angrily and manipulatively tried to kick me out of the apartment we rented together for 2 years. He had initially asked me to move in when he lost his job and now two years later immediately after he found a job, he just wanted to get rid of me.

I negotiated to stay a few months living here without him and then to move out, but the feeling that he will just replace me with another woman in our bed, will be cuddling her the same way he did with me. I imagine how he will do all the same things, make her all the same coffees in the mornings and kisses at night in an exactly same place, and the only difference will be that it’s just a new person, a new object. It makes me sick to feel so replaceable by someone who SWORE that I was the most important thing in his whole world. 

I can’t imagine how he will be going out with someone else, doing all the things that we loved with someone else, while I…. I will be taking months to recover from this, learning to trust myself and people all over again. I feel like I have him so much love and trust and effort and now I’m just nothing. 

The worst thing is, all of his behavior is very subtle. He knows how to look like a good boyfriend and a good person, all of his manipulation is so so subtle that I didn’t even realise it before the break up and my therapist’s pointing it out. All of his behaviors in isolation can seem completely normal and justified and that makes me go a little insane.",1,1732106690.0,TrueNarcissisticAbuse,1,1.0,False

I saw this old picture and thought how true this is. It isn't the first time they bought off doctors to sell you products that will kill you. Years ago, doctors promoted cigarettes, hell they even smoked them while they were with patients. Yes, back in the dinosaur days this was something that often happened.

So things haven't changed much since then, except the money is better for the doctors. There are now fancy trips and parties instead of donuts and coffee from the drug reps. But doctors are still trying to sell us shit that will kill us. Don't believe me, go ahead and do your own research and you will see. 

It is a shame that I didn't do that when I was told I had osteoporosis. My doctor didn't tell me what this horrible drug called Prolia could do to me. It was only when I went down this rabbit hole looking for answers because I was feeling so horrible that I came across the data and studies that also showed how bad Prolia was for me. 

These miracle drugs will “cure"" one thing and give you 20 other side effects. So why bother to take it? Well, that's an easy answer because the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors prescribing them are making billions of dollars. Billions, with a B. They don't treat your problems anymore, there is no cure, nor are they trying to find one because there is no money in that. The money is in keeping you sicker. It's only about, here take this or take that pill, and don't worry if it will give you more side effects than what you originally came in for, it's okay because, haha we are laughing all the way to the bank.

This terrible drug Prolia is supposed to make your bones stronger. Great but they don't tell you the side effects which are:
*Spontaneous bone breakage if you stop taking it. (Hello! Isn't this the reason you're taking this so you don't break your bones??)

*Increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, and cholesterol. 
Hello!! I am already in the high-risk category for these things. Do I need any more help?
Here are some side effects I got as well.

*Heel spurs. 
*Heartburn. 
*Every bone in your body hurts.
* No energy feeling like you're dragging all the time.
* Weight gain (Great, as if I wasn't depressed enough)   None of these things were told to me by my Rheumatologist. Hello! She was a specialist who should have known these things. Because do you think you would take a drug that was on the FDA's Black Box list? Like why is the FDA approving it anyway if it's so bad for you that it has to have a Black Box warning?

So today my friends, I am here to tell you that this “amazing drug” that the doctors are giving out like candy and scaring you to take has all of these side effects and more. Because of what I've been through, I have now become an advocate for others, to get the word out there. We need to do our research. We can't trust the doctors, the government, and especially the pharmaceutical companies. 
Before the doctors push you into taking yet another “cure-all, the next miracle drug” do the research, and be your own advocate. Take charge of your life and be the change you want to see.

I mention this because it sometimes makes me a little paranoid and read into things a bit more than I should. 

I (29f) am a graduate student in a pretty laidback program. One of the professors in my program is kind of a big deal but he's not terribly formal and quite frankly not great with the whole boundaries thing. He texts me quite a bit and almost never about school stuff. He follows me on social media. Things took a little bit more of a turn when we were out having a drink before a department event. It wasn't planned, even though we had talked about whether we'd both be there-- the event just started at kind of a weird time and we both showed up when our class/work obligations were done. So we're sitting there alone, having a drink, talking about a combination of like work and personal stuff. Eventually more people start trickling in and I figure he's going to start focusing on other people but he really doesn't. Instead he starts asking me more ""getting to know you"" questions, not unlike you'd get on a first date. How many siblings, etc. He's never done that before. It was also only to me even though there were other people he could talk to and I've never heard him ask anyone else that stuff (although admittedly I don't pay that much attention). He hasn't tried to touch me or anything and most of the time when we end up having a drink, it's with several other people. We get coffee and lunch on occasion but this is really the first and only time we've ever spent a good amount of time alone together in a bar (which does give the whole thing a different vibe). 

So I don't know. Is that weird? I know in grad school, the relationships you build with the faculty are different than in college. He doesn't have a reputation for being a creep and he has a lot of women friends but this still seems like a bit much. Just want to make sure I'm not being paranoid before I start backing off a bit.

You've got Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and about 5,000 others that charge you for stuff you probably didn’t even know you wanted. But then, there’s [**NecroIPTV**](https://necroiptv.us/), quietly disrupting the game, like that cool underground band you heard before everyone else ruined it.

If you’re here, you’re curious: “Is NecroIPTV worth it? What’s the deal with the features, the pricing, the channel list?” Well, buckle up. We’re diving into the juicy details and telling it like it is.

# NecroIPTV Features: The Good Stuff

Let’s cut straight to the chase. Here’s why **NecroIPTV** is turning heads:

# 1.[ **The Channel Buffet**](https://necroiptv.us/channel-list/)

Imagine walking into an all-you-can-eat buffet, but instead of food, you’ve got sports, movies, news, and international channels. Yeah, that’s NecroIPTV’s channel lineup. It’s massive, covering everything from your favorite sitcom reruns to live Premier League matches. The cherry on top? It’s all in one place.

# 2. Streaming Quality That Doesn’t Make You Scream

Ever tried watching a big game, and the screen freezes right when the winning goal’s about to happen? Not with NecroIPTV. They’ve got HD and even 4K options. It’s smooth, crisp, and almost smugly reliable.

# 3. Device Compatibility Like a Tech Chameleon

Got a smart TV? Cool. A Firestick? Great. Want to stream on your ancient tablet that should probably be in a museum? Go for it. NecroIPTV works with nearly everything short of a toaster.

# 4. Pricing That Won’t Break Your Wallet

Here’s where [NecroIPTV](https://necroiptv.us/pricing/) really flexes. Subscriptions are affordable—like, “skip-one-coffee-a-month” affordable. Whether you’re going for a monthly plan or a long-term deal, it’s way cheaper than most cable bills. Plus, no sneaky fees.

# 5. Customer Support That Actually Responds

Customer support is usually the part of the story where we all groan, but NecroIPTV’s team is surprisingly quick and helpful. Got a problem at 2 a.m.? They’ve got your back.

# How to Set Up NecroIPTV: It’s Easy, We Promise

Tech-phobes, rejoice—[**NecroIPTV**](http://necroiptv.us) setup is no rocket science. Here’s the TL;DR version:

1. **Pick a Plan**: Head to their website, pick a plan that suits you, and sign up. They’ll send you a login.
2. **Download the App**: Whether it’s your smart TV, Firestick, or smartphone, grab the app or software.
3. **Log In and Chill**: Use the credentials, log in, and boom—you’re good to go.

It’s so simple that even your grandma could probably figure it out (and maybe catch up on her favorite soap operas).

# [NecroIPTV Pricing:](http://necro-iptv.com) What’s the Catch?

Spoiler alert: there isn’t one. NecroIPTV’s pricing starts low, and the plans are transparent. You’re not going to wake up to a bill that suddenly tripled because of “hidden fees.” Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Monthly Plan**: Perfect if you’re commitment-phobic.
* **6-Month Plan**: A solid middle ground with a small discount.
* **Annual Plan**: The best bang for your buck, plus you can brag about all the money you’re saving.

# Is NecroIPTV Legal?

Ah, the million-dollar question. Without getting too deep into the weeds, it’s always good to check the laws in your country before diving into any IPTV service. NecroIPTV operates in that murky gray area where it’s best to use a VPN just to play it safe. You didn’t hear that from me.

# NecroIPTV vs. The Rest

If you’re still on the fence, let’s stack **NecroIPTV** against the big dogs:

* **Cable**: Overpriced, bloated, and stuck in the past.
* **Other IPTV Services**: Many are glitchy, overpriced, or just plain sketchy.
* **NecroIPTV**: Affordable, reliable, and packed with features.

The verdict? It’s like comparing a gourmet burger to a sad fast-food sandwich. You know who wins.

# Final Thoughts

So, is **NecroIPTV** the holy grail of streaming services? Maybe not *the* holy grail, but it’s pretty darn close. From its expansive channel list to its user-friendly setup and affordable pricing, NecroIPTV feels like the service that’s quietly revolutionizing how we watch TV.

If you’re tired of paying too much for too little, give it a shot. Worst-case scenario? You’re out a few bucks. Best-case? You’ve just discovered your new streaming obsession.

No gatekeeping, I'm not selling anything this is what I did:
- I only eat from Noon to 8pm.
- In the eating period I eat maximum of 2000 calories (check your BMR)
- I look for low calories filling foods
- Breakfast: Big cup of coffee + half liter water at 10

I go to the gym at this time before lunch (Fasted workout) 

- Lunch: 4 slices of brown bread, half avocado, 2 eggs omolette + cup of coffee
- Snack: Appel or banana. Sometimes a piece of 70% dark chocolate 
- Dinner: Big plate of boiled veggies + 100g sweet potato + 1 chicken breast 

I go to the gym 4 times per week. I walk for 5km now (2-3km in the beginning) then I lift weights. 
I told Chatgpt my details. It gave me a 4 day split of workouts for weightloss. 

Will continue like this till I stagnate then I'll reduce calories or increase workout grit

He arrived at her house and rang the bell.

‘Oh, come on in!’ Annabella’s mother said as she welcomed James.

‘Have a seat in the sitting room.. Would you like something to drink? Lemonade? Tea?’

‘Tea, please,’ James said. Mum brought the tea.

‘So, what are you and Annabelle planning to do tonight?’ she asked interestedly.

‘Oh, probably go to the flicks and then maybe grab a bite to eat at the coffee bar, perhaps have a walk on the beach afterwards.’

‘Annabelle likes to screw, you know,’ Mum informed him.

‘Really?’ James gasped, surprised to say the least.

‘Oh yes,’ mother continued, ‘When she goes out with her friends, that’s all they do!’

‘Is that so?’ asked James, incredulously.

‘Oh yes,’ she said..

‘As a matter of fact, she’d screw all night if we let her!’

‘Phew! Well, thanks for the tip!’ James said as he began thinking about alternative plans for the evening.

A moment later, Annabelle came down the stairs looking pretty as a picture, wearing a pink blouse and a hoop skirt and with her hair tied back in a bouncy ponytail.

She greeted James.

‘Have fun, kids!’ mother said as they left.

Half an hour later, a completely dishevelled Annabelle burst into the house and slammed the front door behind her.

‘The Twist, Mum!’ she yelled angrily to her mother in the kitchen.

Ok let me tell you a example

Imagine your childhood days, While mom having a heated argument with you suddenly a phone rings, she answers it but with calmness, not showing any anger signs and once the call is ended, She will again start arguing.

Just think about it..... Are our mom are superhumans who can control emotions??

Ok let me tell you another example

A waitress accidentally slipped a coffee over your shirt, What will be your reaction immediately, (For most of them). You will start yelling, you are start worrying and make angry gestures to her.. But what if i told you had a second option to response.  You can attended that issue calmly right, because anyways she will give you a compensation or take your shirt to laundery. But you choose angry option. And the reason might shock you,

By the goal of shouting, you wanted to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you have to say, as means to do that you fabricated the emotion of anger.

  
Just think about it....

  
In your every anger instances, you had a goal/wants to get angry... 

And this is such a big topic and i am still in learning phase and also appreciate if somebody explains this in detail below.

Ok For now I want you to realize that., You often get angry not because of you can't control it, It's because you wanted to get angry. Emotions are not controlling you, You are the one who controlling the emotions.",2,1732105160.0,selfimprovementday,0,1.0,False

1gvo5g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gvo5g0/aita_cutting_off_my_alcoholic_dad/,AITA - Cutting off my alcoholic Dad,"This is a really hard post to write but I really want to hear an outsiders perspective. I am open minded to criticism and I will try to acknowledge if any of my behaviours are wrong or bad. 

For context, my Dad is mid 60s. He had a very important career most of his adult life which required him to work away from home a lot. My Mum was the main parent so to speak. She did so much for our family as well as having a career of her own. She always made sure the house clean and we had good dinners etc. My Dad didn’t contribute as much, because of his job and to an extent I believe because of traditional outlooks on men and women in the home. I’m not saying I agree with that but it’s that way it was in our house. My Mum was superwomen and waited on my Dad. He did work very hard though and was the main breadwinner. 

Sadly my Mum passed away suddenly a few years ago. This was a horrific time for my family, we did not expect it and the grief afterwards was horrible. Still to this day we’re all feeling the effects of her passing so quick. My Dad especially, they were soulmates and she was the one who kept his life in order I think. He went from having my Mum run his day to day life to having to organise a lot of things for himself that he normally never did. 

He then retired and got back into the swing of things, he joined a club and made friends and tries to keep busy with that. 

However my Dad became an alcoholic, he had always liked a drink but my Mum kept it in check. Once she passed he started drinking most days. It was really hard to deal with, I was working full time and had my own home and marriage and was constantly worried and having to check on him. It started to affect my work as I would have to leave mid shift to check on him. 

I approached him about his drinking and he promised he would get it under control. I tried to bring up support groups or counselling but he shut me down. I really didn’t know what to do. He was a grown adult, I couldn’t force him to get help. 

In the past year my Dad has continued to show signs of alcoholism. I even caught him drink driving and again had to have a word with him. But I was basically just shut down and told not to worry. I have cried to him, begged him to stop and get help but he never does. 

I’ve noticed also that if I don’t reach out, txt, call or arrange a coffee or a walk together. He will not contact me, I can go weeks without him contacting me. It’s always got to be on my part. This really upsets me because I feel like he doesn’t make the effort and really care. I have brought this up twice in the past few years but he just says he’ll do better then never does.

He is always out with club friends and always posts about them on social media. But will never contact me. Again I have to always be the first to initate contact. 

 Sometimes I’ll send him a message or phone and he won’t respond or answer. And when I bring it up he just says he forgot. But he’ll continue to post on social media with his friends. It really gets me down. 

I sent him over my wedding video last week and I got no response. I was so happy for him to finally see it and he just ignored my message. Two days later he posted with friends on social media about an event they went to. 

My Dad has money and has helped me out in the past if I’m stuck, I never ask however and I’m always very grateful for any help. But I don’t care about the money, I just want my Dad. I sometimes feel like if lost two parents. He’s not came over to my house in about a year. Even though I live 15 minutes away. 

I would love nothing more than my Dad just to phone and check or pop over or even ask when I’m free for a coffee. I would love that so much, just to know he actually wants to hang out with me. 

He’s still drinking, I do know and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to enable it  but I’m stuck.

Also and this is a bit of a weird situation. He told me he had cancer and quite a serious cancer of which there is a very low recovery rate. He then went silent and gave me no information about treatment or anything. I got nothing. About 6 months later he said he was in recovery. A lot of family are a bit skeptical, it just doesn’t make sense. His appearance hasn’t even changed, there’s no obvious symptoms and it was quite a brutal cancer he said he had. I’m so confused. Part of me thinks it was an alcoholic drink thing he said looking for sympathy.

He has a pattern of wanting attention ever since my Mum died. He’s constantly talking about himself and doesn’t care for others stories. It’s always about him, he likes the attention. And I don’t know if that is a result of my Mum passing. He craves it and it’s really sad to watch sometimes. 

He’s also went super right wing and has been openly racist and sexist in public. When I call him out he calls me woke even though I wouldn’t say I’m far left, more central. I just don’t like public display of anything hateful. It’s really embarrassing especially when he’s drinking. He once made a comment in a restaurant about there being too many Asians, I was mortified. I called him out and he tried to belittle me and call me sensitive. 

He also made a speech at my wedding where he made female driver jokes about me, even though I asked him not too. This really upset me, it’s the one thing I asked him not to do

I said to my husband I don’t know whether to cut of contact. It’s been nearly a week and I haven’t heard from him. He stays so close as well. I don’t know whether to start distancing myself or again try to bring up how his behaviour affects me. But usually it falls on deaf ears. 

Am I being too sensitive? I don’t what to do!

1gvo4ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gvo4ie/help_me_get_a_good_setup_machine_grinder_2000/,Help me get a good setup (machine + grinder) [2000€],"Hey guys, I'll try to stick as much as I can to the posting guidelines for buying advice.

A little bit of context here. I'm a coffee enthusiat for about 7 years already. I really enjoy it. Back then I had a pod machine which I was happy about. It was not until my sister discovered me good coffee places (trusted roasters who made quality coffee) when I realized what I was having was crapy coffee. I then moved to a Superautomatica, basically because limitations on budget and space. It was the correct step for me since I could have freshly ground coffee direct to the cup. I was very happy about it. Now, I cannot tell you how I hate this machine. It delivers ""good"" coffee (in comparison to what I had before), but I am always waiting for the opportunity to get to a good coffee place and drink a good coffee. Now I am in the situation where I have a bigger budget and no (big) limitations on space, so I want to get myself a good setup under 2000€ (machine + grinder, other equipment not included). I would like to have a choice of different machines to see if I can leverage some Black Friday disccounts. Of course if the total price is less than 2000€, better, but that is the top budget limit. So here are the details and some questions at the end:

* **Location**: Spain (Europe)
* **Preferred drink types**: Espressos and Lattes basically
* **Drink frequency**: 3-4 espressos per day and 3-4 lattes per week
* **Space**: No limitations (for a machine and a grinder on the price range)
* **Experience level**: I want to upgrade from a beginner (noob) setup
* **Manual or electric**: Electric

**Coffee machine**

For the coffee machine I thought about one with the following capabilites: dual boiler, PID (better to control both boilers temperature, if not only the group head), preinfusion (mechanic or electronic), 58mm portafilter for better compatibility

About the group head, I'm a bit lost. As far as I know (and maybe I am wrong), E61 group head has the habiliy to create a mechanical preinfusion. To be honest, I don't feel attracted aestetically about those heads, but if that means I will get better coffe than with other group heads, I'm open to it. That menas, I would rather prefer another group head, visually speaking.

With these requirements I arrived to the conclusion to have the **Rancilio Silvia Pro X** (I know, I know: the tray). For me that's a beautiful machine and it has all the requirements I would like to have. I also had a look at the other machines [listed here](https://espressoaf.com/recommendations/midrange-machines.html). Any advice would be welcome.

**Grinder**

For the grinder I am a bit lost. As I am having mostly espressos I would like to have a grinder capable of grind fine enough for espresso, and having the ability to fine adjust these settings (probably a stepless grinder?). Also, I think the best approach would be to have a single dose grinder with the minumun retention possible. I don't like the idea of having a doser (via a timer?) on the grinder, as this could vary depending on other environment variables to get the right amount of coffee weight (correct me if I am wrong). Of course I could have one with doser and use for single dose. For the abitilty to eject what it could have been stuck in the grinder, I don't really like bellows (as per some reviews, I feel those are messy when extracting the last bits of coffee). What about flat vs conincal burrs? I don't have a clear idea of what would be best for my use case. And what are the implications about the size of those? And do I have to look for any burr size that in case I would like to change the discs in the future?

With this in mind I thought about the **Niche Zero** (I don't know what is the difference -in outcome- with the Niche Duo) (sincerely, I don't like it aestetically, but I don't mind having it if it does a good job) and the **Timemore 064s**. I think these are both suitable for espresso preparation, right? I also thought about the **DF64 Gen 2**, the **Varia VS3**, the **Fellow Ode** or the **Fellow Opus**, but I am not sure if any these are good for espresso, I don't want to spend less but having to regret in the future. Again, any advice or guidance would be welcome.

Not that I think all three are necessary but wanted to try and experiment and see if any of this could help me. I am currently trying to gain some focus and motivation and overcome hopefully fatigue and a bit of burn out for my work from home dev job. I usually rely on coffee twice a day, nothing crazy, and have tried every herbal I can think. I workout regularly, and am careful with my eating habits, and sugar intake, etc, if that matters. Not overweight or have any health issues. 

Any recommendations on dosage, times of day, and possible expectations would be helpful. Also open to hear what has worked for you guys, including different nootropic or herbal, etc.

1gvo22r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RichRoadmap/comments/1gvo22r/why_do_people_have_credit_card_debt_how_to_avoid/,Why Do People Have Credit Card Debt & How to Avoid It,"Hey Reddit! I've been thinking a lot about credit card debt lately, especially after seeing so many friends struggle with it. It's crazy how easy it is to fall into this trap, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences on this topic.

Let's be real - credit card debt is like quicksand. Once you're in it, getting out can feel impossible. I've watched people close to me sink deeper and deeper, and it's made me realize how important it is to understand why this happens in the first place.

From what I've seen, there are several main reasons people end up in credit card debt:

1. Emergency Expenses
Life loves to throw curveballs. Medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss can force people to rely on credit cards when they don't have savings. I learned this the hard way when my car broke down last year.

2. Lifestyle Creep
This is a sneaky one. As our income grows, we often start spending more without really thinking about it. That daily $5 coffee and those random Amazon purchases add up fast.

3. Lack of Financial Education
Schools don't teach us about money management, and many of us learn about finance through trial and error. I've been studying personal finance for years now, and I'm still learning new things every day.

Here's what I've found helpful in avoiding credit card debt:

- Track Every Dollar
I use a simple spreadsheet to monitor my spending. It's not fancy, but it works. Knowing where your money goes is half the battle.

- The Emergency Fund Rule
Having 3-6 months of expenses saved up has saved me from many potential credit card disasters. Start small - even $500 can help.

- The 24-Hour Rule
When I want to buy something non-essential, I wait 24 hours. It's amazing how many ""must-have"" items I forget about after a day.

- Treating Credit Cards Like Debit Cards
I only spend what I already have in my bank account. This mindset shift was game-changing for me.

If you're interested in learning more about personal finance, avoiding debt, and building wealth, I've been sharing detailed insights and strategies in my newsletter at https://orangementor.com. I cover everything from basic money management to advanced investing strategies and entrepreneurship tips.

Remember, the goal isn't to never use credit cards - they can be great tools when used responsibly. The key is understanding how to use them without letting them use you.

What's your experience with credit cards? Have you found any strategies that work particularly well for avoiding debt? Let's discuss in the comments!

P.S. The most important thing I've learned is that financial freedom isn't about making more money - it's about making smarter decisions with the money you have.",1,1732104733.0,RichRoadmap,0,1.0,False
