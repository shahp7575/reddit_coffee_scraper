I provide homes
for princes
and paupers.

I‚Äôve witnessed lovers
rushing to reunite
and the heavy stomps
of one who cannot reclaim
harsh words.

I‚Äôve felt the animal fire
of passion
gentle wisps
erupting into flame.

I‚Äôve carried cold tears
and warm tears
of joy.

I‚Äôve borne the hauteur
of a youthful walk of shame
and the weight
of two worlds
vowing to become one.

I‚Äôve breached the impenetrable
become the key
to unconquered kingdoms.

I‚Äôve held spilled coffee stains
muddy footprints
scraped knees
all the small echoes
of life.

I‚Äôve kept the devil at bay
beneath me
and given Angels
a place to land.

I‚Äôve cradled first steps
marked last steps.

To know me
look down.

I am the ground
the keeper
of all your footsteps.",1,1756677598.0,poetry_critics,0,1.0,False

My wife (30F) and I (30M) have been together for 4 years, with the last year being married. We just found out she‚Äôs pregnant and is around 6 weeks pregnant.

A mutual friend, Bill, invited us to a party, but I said we couldn‚Äôt go because Cindy (my wife) wasn‚Äôt feeling well. That was the truth‚Äîshe told me herself she didn‚Äôt want to go because she didn‚Äôt feel good. Bill understood, and I told him we‚Äôd see him another time.

Cindy got mad at me because she felt I had ‚Äúthrown her under the bus.‚Äù She asked how I would feel if one of my friends had a party and she said we couldn‚Äôt go because I was sick. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt see a problem with that if it was the truth. She didn‚Äôt like that answer and ended up throwing me out of the house.

Later, she emailed me a list and said I couldn‚Äôt come home until I agreed to all of the terms of the   
""contract"". This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs used an argument to create a list of demands‚Äîshe‚Äôs even told me that when she used to fight with her sister, she would do the same thing. In the past, I‚Äôve always refused to sign and we would talk things out. But this time is different. She won‚Äôt let me in to even discuss the issue‚Äîshe just wants me to sign the agreement.

Terms of her ""contract"", which she emailed to me.

1. You will cook, make, or obtain me any food or drink without complaint or hesitation the first time I ask.

2. You will fill up my water any time it less than¬†1‚ÅÑ4¬†of the way full without me asking. If I have to ask, you will drop whatever you are doing, apologize, and do it immediately.

3. You will drop off rent the runway garments to UPS or WeWork on your own any time I ask on the day I ask. This will be approximately 1-2 times per week.

4. You will not have coffee, caffeine, alcohol, or cookies.

5. If I feel a cramp, you will do 50 sit-ups and 50 pushups immediately without breaks.

6. You will surprise me with gifts, large or small, frequently. I will not say how often because then it would not be a surprise, but you should hope I do not think it should be more often.

7. You will brush our dog's hair completely every day, so that he has no knots.

8. You will not get out of any prior commitments, such as driving me to and from (if I choose) work, walking our dog alone unless I feel like joining, moving with me wherever and whenever I want to move, and not leaving us more than 14 days per year.

9. This will be reduced to 0 days per year when I am trying to get pregnant, am pregnant, or we have a child under 2 years old.

10. You will massage me anytime, anywhere, for any length I want.

11. You will go to the grocery store any time it is needed, unprompted.

12. If I do not want to go somewhere or do something, I will choose whether I reply that you do not feel well so we cannot go or if you reply that you do not feel well so we cannot go. You will never take it back or say it was not true.

13. If our baby wakes up, you will be the one who comforts the baby, changes the diaper, or brings them to me for breast feeding.

14. You will change all diapers unless the mood strikes me.

15. You will toilet train our children at an appropriate age (2-4 years old) and clean the bed sheets if they ever wet the bed without complaint about it to me.

16. You will cook all food for the children once they are past breast feeding. 

17. You will always take out the trash and recycling, cook, and do the dishes.

18. You will be in charge of all utilities (heat with appropriate humidification, electric, water, air conditioning). We will not need to hear anything about it.

19. If one of us needs to sit in coach with our children, it will be you, and you will be happy.

20. You will be happy to abide by all of these terms because you want to be part of our lives and anything that makes us happy will make you happy so you will want to do it without complaint or hesitation.

Term 3 applies any time I am trying to get pregnant, am pregnant, or am breastfeeding. All other terms apply indefinitely.

1n5757t,https://i.redd.it/5gnayykmefmf1.jpeg,Passed nclex in 85,"I just wanted to come on here and encourage someone and give some tips. 
I passed the nclex in 85 as a b average student in nursing school. I studied for about a month. My school gave us archer and I used it for a week or two (outside of the 4 weeks of actual studying) and it was horrible, too wordy, too much info. I started using bootcamp for the next 4 weeks. I didn‚Äôt finish all the questions but I reviewed almost every question I took whether I got it right or wrong. 

I also utilized nclex crusade (red background from 3 years ago and 1 year ago but mostly the 3 year old one) it was sooooo helpful in helping me come down to at most my final two questions. 

Then I did klimek lecture 12 audio & pdf. Lecture 12 I listened to it a couple time to make sure it stuck. This was what helped me pick between my final two questions if I had a final two or not or didn‚Äôt know anything at all. 


Then I did dr Sharon. Dr Sharon‚Äôs prioritization questions and SATA questions on different topics, I watched the SATA on topics I struggled with but the prioritization I watched multiple times bc at first you‚Äôre not going to grasp it immediately but you will eventually. 


The finally, prayer!!! I prayeddddddd!!! I worshipped, I wrote down what I wanted God to do since the beginning of this year and he met every request if not more!! So keep Jesus first above all else! This is all you need. 

I don‚Äôt recommend studying for more than 6 weeks bc the last week or 2 I got burnt out and was tired of studying and just wanted to take the exam at that point. 

take your time on the nclex exam!!! I took about 2 1/2 to 3 hours on 85 q. Stopped every 10-15 questions for about 2-5 minutes.i also had NO coffee that day and drank electrolytes so that I wouldn‚Äôt feel anxious and jittery and listened to worship music the whole way there and sang in my head and prayed during my 2-5 min breaks i took.

1n56z5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1n56z5o/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I‚Äôve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying.

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning.

It read, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pretty things that matter,‚Äù scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees.

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There‚Äôs not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing.

So that‚Äôs what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand.

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I‚Äôd taken a million times before.

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before: A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù jagged and messy.

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall.

Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window.

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space.

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8.

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation.

However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù with a smiley face underneath.

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years.

I explained the events to the police, with the doll‚Äôs head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they‚Äôd examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured them that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.

While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70‚Äôs rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch.

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness.

I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated.

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned.

Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could‚Äôve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that.

I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere.

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again.

Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning.

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn‚Äôt just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies.

The same message under each display:

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly.

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for.

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile.

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me.

DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear.

As you‚Äôd imagine, it‚Äôs difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That‚Äôs what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed‚Ä¶out of sync with the storm.

I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every big flash of light, and then there‚Äôd be thunder.

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again.

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.

Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain.

Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest.

I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night.

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly.

Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me.

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be.

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house.

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin.

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found.

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward.

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn‚Äôt even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound:

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles.

Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care.

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I‚Äôd stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night.

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me.

A traveler‚Äôs trunk that you‚Äôd see on a train, across the top, the phrase ‚ÄúAll the pretty things.‚Äù

I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12.

Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case.

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

About three months ago, I rushed to the hospital with all the symptoms of a heart attack (I had an energy drink about 6 hours earlier, something I normally never drink). They did an EKG and blood tests, and everything came back normal‚Ä¶ they told me it was just a panic attack and sent me home.

After that, I went back to my normal life (I quit coffee, energy drinks, caffeinated tea, THC, and even cigarettes). Everything seemed like it had just been a scare, until suddenly‚Ä¶ it happened again, this time while I was at work.

Once again, all the tests were normal. A week later, it happened again.

The symptoms are always the same: a sharp pain and pressure in my chest, radiating to my neck, shoulder, and back, dizziness, feeling like I might faint, difficulty breathing deeply, palpitations. Along with that comes horrible anxiety and an overwhelming fear of death.

In the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been feeling this constantly, every single day. From the moment I wake up until I go to sleep, there‚Äôs this constant tightness and stabbing pain in my chest that flares up randomly throughout the day. Even when I‚Äôm relaxing, I get this terrifying sensation that I‚Äôm about to have a heart attack at any moment. It‚Äôs driving me insane and ruining my life.

Two days ago, I had an echocardiogram and my heart seemed healthy, except for some arrhythmias that will be treated later. But even so‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt shake this feeling.

On my last ER visit, they prescribed me Valium/Diazepam 5mg to take in SOS situations, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help much.

Has anyone else gone through this or is going through the same thing? Anything that helped you? I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing control of myself.",1,1756676538.0,Anxiety,8,1.0,False

I made goal weight, and I have an appointment to get final approval from the psychiatrist. I've had to meet with the dietician a few times. She has been really picky about my food logs and it's been frustrating. 

Every morning, I have an iced protein coffee. Nescafe Gold espresso with a vanilla Nurri, plus a little creamer (it's the best combo, you must try it if you haven't). I tried to explain to her that I'm not a breakfast person (never have been) and my protein coffee holds me over until lunch. I've been in a good groove with meal prepping and I'm getting in all the right portions of protein/veggies/fruit/fat etc. But she will not stop picking about the damn protein coffee. She insists I need to be eating a meal for breakfast.

I don't see why I need to change the groove I'm in when the post-surgery diet is literally all liquids and mush for like a month?

For context, he and I met while I was in an open relationship but the relationship was falling apart. I opened it up to try and save it but I was in denial that it‚Äôs been over for months. I did not expect to meet someone like this let alone have such a deep connection. I was struggling with my relationship bc we were long distance but there was rarely any communication, he wouldn‚Äôt inquire about me, I felt forgotten about and then suddenly I meet this guy who‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve been begging my bf to be and more. He made me a playlist with every single band I‚Äôve mentioned to him and even arranged the first four songs to spell out my name. I‚Äôve never had someone do something like that for me. He even sent me a song he had on repeat and said he listened to it with thoughts of me. He stopped speaking to me bc he knew he was getting attached but knew he couldn‚Äôt have me. I understood. But a day and a half passed and I had to come to terms with the fact that my relationship is over but also, I owed it to myself to get to know this person at least as a friend first. So I reached out and he let me have a conversation on the phone with him and I explained everything and we started talking again.

I broke up with my boyfriend a couple days later and it was a very mature, not messy break up. Of course it‚Äôs still painful but deep down I‚Äôve known it was over for a while. Two days after me and my bf broke up, me and the guy met for coffee and spent almost 6 hours together. I had such a blast. Someone wanted to listen to me all night and spend time with me. We kissed. But then he opened up to me about an unfortunate situation from his past and told me he has a tendency to ghost when he feels he‚Äôs getting attached. Well surprise surprise, he ghosted me. But one of the things he told me before we met for coffee was if things don‚Äôt ever work out romantically after meeting, there was no way he wouldn‚Äôt wanna be my friend. But I was ghosted.

Used to be a very avid Naruto fanfic reader circa 2003-2008ish and was talking to my friend about fics we used to read and still think about. 

  
I wanted to find one for her which was a Naruto University fic, Naruto was the main protagonist and it was a primarily Naru/Sasu fic but with a touch of Naru/Gaara.

  
Basically Naruto is going to University and he ends up taking an art class at the behest of the teacher I think, so he doesn't officially sign up for the class I think, one of the scenes I remember is that Naruto gets wrapped up in his art one class and realizes that he has drawn/painted sasuke. I think Kakashi was the teacher of the class and Naruto got really embarrassed by it.

Naruto is friends with Gaara who was specifically described as smelling like stale cigarettes and coffee, and that his dorm room was dark because he blacked out the windows, I remember they kissed a little but nothing serious.  
Beyond this I don't remember but thought I'd give it a shot to see if anyone had a name or any info about it.

Once the pieces are cut out, what‚Äôs the proper/best way to proceed with construction? I‚Äôve finished one sheath, started the second, and want to get some guidance before continuing too far.

For the first/completed sheath, these are the steps I took with some notes and my question about the Edge Kote under step 5:

1. Cut out the leather
   1. Rough cut then finalized shape with sand paper
2. Cut stitching groove where desired
3. Used pricking irons to make holes for stitching
4. Punch holes for snaps
5. Burnished edges
   1. Poorly done on first sheath. Have since picked up gum trag and burnishing tool
6. Dyed/painted
   1. Some leather is getting dyed, some is getting painted 
   2. Upgraded my Angelus yellow acrylic leather paint to Fiebings yellow edge kote
      1. Yellow is only going on edges
      2. Question: The bottle of Edge Kote says not to shake, only stir, before applying. How serious are they when they say not to shake the bottle? What kind of stirring are we talking about: light swirl with a wooden coffee stirrer?
7. Mounted snap hardware
8. Stitched pieces together

As mentioned, I've since picked up gum trag and a wood burnishing tool, but I've also picked up some Leathercraft cement that wasn't used, so that's something that needs to be added to the mix. 

  
Is this generally the correct order? Should iron pricking and hole punching happen before dying/painting or after? Does any of this really matter as long as the final piece comes together? Will the bottle explode if I shake the edge kote? How badly am I overthinking this? ",1,1756675896.0,Leathercraft,1,1.0,False

1n56ilj,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1n56ilj/quick_and_dirty_reviews/,quick and dirty reviews!,"I bought 21 samples for my birthday earlier this month.

I‚Äôm not a professional and my experience with a fragrance might be polar opposite of yours. At the end of the day I judge a fragrance by how happy it makes me feel when I wear itüòÖso here goes some of my thoughts!

1. BDK Parfums - Gris Charnel: a creamy fig scent. Very similar to Sorcellerie‚Äôs Between The Sheets and Imaginary Authors‚Äô Yesterday‚Äôs Haze. This was a safe purchase for me as I already knew I‚Äôd love it.

2. Atelier D‚ÄôOrs - Lune F√©line: a gourmand scent for those who don‚Äôt like gourmands. I could only smell vanilla and not the cinnamon or cardamom, so it was not as spicy as I would have liked. True to its description on the website, it does seem luxurious. This is *exactly* how I want to smell after I shower. Unfortunately the scent didn‚Äôt last long on me :/

3. Maison Francis Kurkdjian - Baccarat Rouge 540: My first thought was that it smelled almost identical to Bath & Body Works‚Äô Into The Night perfume/lotion. I like it! It was kinda like an everlasting gobstopper in that you‚Äôre constantly getting a different note each time you get a whiff of the scent. I totally get why it‚Äôs not for everyone though.

4. DS & Durga - Radio Bombay: if you love the smell of batteries, I have a scent for you! It truly does smell like batteries if that‚Äôs even possible (maybe because of the copper note?). Spicy and electric! My first fragrance with a copper note, I‚Äôm pretty sure.

5. Kerosene - Followed: I unfortunately now have diabetes due to this sample. It reminds me of A Whiff of Wafflecone by Imaginary Authors, but definitely longer lasting. I like the scent, but it feels sickeningly sweet after being on your skin for too long. It does not wash off of you even after you shower, so bear that in mind if you need to be out in public within the next 48 hours.

6. Kerosene - Follow: What coffee should smell like. What you envision when you think of coffee and coffee shops. Not as lethal as Followed. I think I‚Äôd wear this for comfort tbh.

7. D‚ÄôAnnam - White Rice: Less white rice and more rice pudding. Smells like Se√±or Rico‚Äôs rice pudding, actually. Not a bad thing but the name feels like a bit of a misnomer. Very creamy!

8. Diptyque - Philosykos: My first Diptyque perfume! I like fig so I knew I‚Äôd like this one. Not like Gris Charnel in that GC is more of a creamy fig scent and Philosykos feels more earthy, as if you picked the figs yourself.

9. Vilhelm Perfume - Dear Polly: Reminds me of MEMO‚Äôs Irish Leather though I‚Äôm not sure why. Irish Leather has a mat√© note and Dear Polly has a tea note‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs the common denominator? Either way, it‚Äôs a beautiful sunny scent. Like how you‚Äôd picture Sun tea smelling.

10. Zoologist - Penguin: I‚Äôm always at a loss for describing Zoologist‚Äôs fragrances. Penguin smells sawdust-y to me, but not in a bad way. It‚Äôs like Squid in that you have to try it yourself to officially know if you‚Äôd like it. It‚Äôs impossible to know based on the notes if you‚Äôd like it. To me the only way I can describe Zoologist fragrances is based on vibesüòÖLike I can only describe Bee as smelling like this one gift shop I‚Äôd always go to for cards and small gifts, but obviously that‚Äôs not helpful to readers at homeüòÖ

11. Zoologist - Musk Deer: Oh, this one was lovely. I am a huge fan of cardamom so I already knew I‚Äôd like this one. If I needed a specific winter perfume and it had to be from Zoologist, I‚Äôd choose this one or Northern Cardinal.

12. Nobile 1942 - La Danza delle Libellule: This is what I want my home smelling like 24/7, especially in the fall and winter. The bergamot (and maybe the vanilla?) make it creamy. If you‚Äôve ever had a cream of Earl Gray or an Earl gray creme tea, that‚Äôs what it felt like to me.

13. MEMO - Sicilian Leather: African Leather and Irish leather are top-tier for me. Sicilian Leather follows closely behind those two. You should definitely like leather as a note if you try any of their leather fragrances as it‚Äôs not subtle (but I‚Äôd also counter that the leather note isn‚Äôt as prominent as in Slow Explosions by Imaginary Authors). As a side note: after I tried it and looked up the notes, Sicilian Leather looks like it could be a $20 cocktail you‚Äôd find at a very trendy bar.

14. Vilhelm Perfume - Mango Skin: Absolutely adore this one! I didn‚Äôt even realize I liked mango until I saw a post that mentioned Voices from House of Mammoth. There is literally no other note you‚Äôre going to get with Mango Skin except mango. It‚Äôs summery and bright and fresh. It reminds me of those fruity no-tears kids shampoos.

15. Xerjoff - Naxos: Okay, I can see how this is the most popular fragrance on Parfumo. A sophisticated gourmand scent with some edginess‚Äîlike if Bath & Body‚Äôs Warm Vanilla Sugar studied abroad and came back totally different. Heightened, elevated, more worldly.

16. MEMO Paris - Winter Palace: Very orange-y on me. Back when I was a kid, I had to dust with Citrus or Orange Pledge spray and my very first whiff of Winter Palace gave me Pledge vibes üòÖI absolutely love spiced orange anything, so this was ultimately a delightful fragrance but we had to take the scenic route to get there.

Honorable Mentions:
There were several other samples I got that I need to spend more time with before giving any thoughts.

Tauer - Au Coeur du Desert, L‚ÄôAir du desert marocain, and L‚ÄôAir Des Alpes Suisses.

I was really hyped up about Tauer but it didn‚Äôt electrify me like I thought it would. Alpes Suisses reminds me of a Pineward fragrance, and on paper Desert Marocain seems like it should be my one true love but I wasn‚Äôt gaga over it. I think what I wanted Desert Marocain to smell like, I can easily find in other similar perfumes like Zoologist‚Äôs Harvest Mouse, Tiger, or Camel, or MEMO‚Äôs African Leather. I‚Äôm going to give Tauer another chance.

Francesca Bianchi - Tyger Tyger and Sticky Fingers. I want to like them and know I‚Äôll definitely wear both of them, but I wore both of them for such brief periods of time that I didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúwear‚Äù them. I felt more excited for the other samples.

I tried to live my life as best I could but Coming from such a strict and extreme world, I didn't know how to be a ""normal person."" I partied, drank heavily and got in a lot of bad situations because essentially I was running from trauma and pain I didn't know how to process. 

Fast forward to now, I'm on my healing path and it's been incredible but difficult. I'm now processing all those experiences I went through and part of me would like a sense of community. 

I tried going to a non-denominational Christian church and at first I thought it would be a good thing. People seemed nice, and other than the occasional doomsday and fear mongering sermon, I was enjoying some things.  

Some women from the church asked if I would like to meet up and get coffee to which I agreed. But while chatting with them, they were discussing which version of the Bible I needed to be reading, mentioned that my family still in mormanism would be going to hell, that I needed to read these other books, start going to these other groups and I got pressured into having a mentor which really triggered all of the pressures and obligations I experienced in the cult (the morman church). 

I left feeling really sick, and I feel so hopeless. Not believing in God at all feels so heavy. But church in general just feels like more of the same.

1n565zz,https://i.redd.it/pdzqbrdh1fmf1.png,August completions,"Fewer games than usual for me. Most of the time this month was spent on Balatro and modded Baldurs Gate 3 (already completed that one), as well as a few other games that are not fully completed yet.

Best Served Cold - A mix of Coffee Talk and a investigation/deduction VN in a alt history prohibition era noir story, where you are a bartender at a speakeasy who get roped in to help a detective get people to talk. Pretty good, but neither of the two different styles of gameplay truly shine. You don't get to mix the drinks like in Coffee Talk, and the investigation part isn't that hard or complex. A few nice twists and turns, and for the most part a compelling story, but the best ending is dependent on a specific thing you do on one near the end, but thankfully there is no achievement tied to that one. I liked it, didn't love it. Felt a bit undercooked, especially the romance part where you can flirt with specific patrons, but nothing really comes out of it.

Catto's Post Office - Super cute and super short game where you are a postcat delivering parcels. It's an hour long so don't expect much, but it got the vibes of Lil Gator Game, Little Kitty Big City and similar games, just in a tiny bit sized package you'll finish in an hour or so. Very easy 100%.

Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer - This is peak point and click adventure. I love the first game in the series, and this is exactly what i expected of a sequel. For the most part stays away from moon logic, and the pixelart is just fantastic. As long as you make saves every in game day, and when you enter a new area, you will probably not have any problems 100% the game, there is only two (i think) that are missable since they depends on that you do the same action on several days.

Monument Valley 3 - The MC Escher mobile puzzle game get's a surprise sequel after several years, and this was kind of a letdown, it feels a lot simpler than the first games, and it's also extremely short. For 90% of the levels it's immediately obvious what you need to do since you can only walk a very linear path. The controls was also a bit off, and not really suited to mouse. Way to expensive at 15‚Ç¨. I don't refund games i finished, no matter how short they are, but in this case it was very tempting. There will be a free update so you can even say the game isn't finished yet. Wait for that update, and a sale.

s.p.l,i.t -  A short terminal hacking game by mr Buckshot Roulette, Mike Klubnika. Got the same oppressive dystopic vibes as all his other games and tells a very short but effective story. Only two achievement endings, but the game save before the last choice, always nice when a game does that.

Strange Jigsaws - A youtuber (FLEB) who used to make Puzzle videos like a decade ago, returns with a extremely weird Jigsaw game. A bit like ""There is no game"" in that the game breaks the fourth wall, change things up all the time, throwing new types of concepts that challenge what a jigsaw is on you in a rapid pace. I do not want to say too much, going in blind is the best, but the dev made a free game last year called ""20 small mazes"" that gives a hint on what you can expect.

[up to $400],"For background: I mostly drink milk-based coffees. I'm not very sophisticated nor do I aspire to be. Instead, I value convenience and ease of preparation.

After years of using a Breville Barista Express / Barista Pro, the machine finally had to be replaced, and reading up here, including the wiki and many posts, I have just purchased the Breville Bambino Plus with the intention of investing in a separate grinder as well. That will be my next (imminent) purchase.

Now here's my predicament: I understand that I'll have a process ahead of me to dial in the dose etc., which is fine. But once that's done, I'd prefer to not have to weigh out the beans each morning, nor do I want to have ground coffee all over my counter because of spills. In reading about the different grinders, it appears a Baratza Encore ESP or DF54 might offer a good balance of quality vs. cost, but I don't quite understand how it all works. Will I have to wait next to it while it grinds, let it run until a separately purchased scale shows exactly 18g (or whatever I have found works for me), then be quick to turn it off, only to then try and get the grounds into my portafilter and tamp which is going to be messy?

Can someone please explain like I'm 5? And recommend a setup for someone who's busy and enjoys drinking the coffee more than making it?

1n55uc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1n55uc9/manifestation_breakthroughs/,Manifestation breakthroughsüí´üåàüíñ,"I used to think manifesting meant doing affirmations, writing down what you want every morning, speaking to yourself in the mirror, etc. And sure, it‚Äôs totally part of it. But I wasn‚Äôt really getting results using these methods only.  Looking back that‚Äôs because there were a few realizations I hadn‚Äôt had yet at that point in my journey. 

I am by no means a pro, but as someone who has returned to my body after 15+ years of living in disassociation and not understand why I couldn‚Äôt be happy or joyful or why I felt so overwhelmed with hopelessness and loneliness, here are a few takeaways: 

Everything and everyone around you is an extension of yourself! You are a living part of an interconnected grid whose thoughts and experiences attract those of the same vibration or vibrations to help heal you in some way! 

You don‚Äôt HAVE to be anything other than you. You already have the ability to manifest and create your ideal perfect reality by simply existing in your own natural vibration and frequency. But here‚Äôs the catch, most people‚Äôs natural vibration is blocked by stuck negative emotions and belief systems adopted from others growing up. Your ability to manifest quickly is directly related to your ability to heal and unblock yourself from those stuck emotions in your system. 

There‚Äôs a reason you meet someone and feel instantaneously triggered by them. It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre meant to understand that persons behavior as a mirror of your own, use that introspection to then rewire that core belief system within you and remove your own block. We are all infinite souls having a human experience and part of that experience is attracting people and circumstances to us that are meant to help us heal and unblock us. This is why when someone leaves one relationship over an issue of let‚Äôs say, my partner doesn‚Äôt hear me, it‚Äôs no coincidence that they will carry this issue over on to their next relationship and the next until they finally realize where am I not listening to my partner? Or what does my belief that my partner isn‚Äôt listening to me tell me about myself? Maybe I believe I‚Äôm not worth being listened to? Then that‚Äôs what you have to heal. Just an example!

Living with these realizations has allowed me to manifest very serendipitous meeting and occurrences. I‚Äôll find myself in a coffee shop that sells all my favorite items. Or meeting just the right person that I needed in order to further myself along a career path. I also find myself thinking when will this amazingness end? Is the universe giving me a free 3 month trial of this and then it‚Äôs going to end? So that‚Äôs my subconscious belief I need to unblock myself from of why is it so hard for me to believe that I am able to create this life for myself and it‚Äôs no one else‚Äôs doing? It‚Äôs all part of the journey :)

I hope this helps someone understand or make that click on their own. Would love to hear your opinions and suggestions!  ",2,1756673726.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

BlogTO picked up a story about suburban staffers vowing to boycott Toronto businesses once they are forced back into the city five days a week. One person on Reddit said they will spend ‚Äúabsolutely no money downtown‚Äù as a protest. That post got 1,100 upvotes in under 12 hours with people piling on. Some agreed and others called it petty or misdirected.

Key points from the article:  
‚Ä¢ Premier Doug Ford has ordered OPS back 5 days a week starting January 5, 2026 which ends the hybrid 3 day model  
‚Ä¢ Some staff say the push is all about real estate and vacant office towers  
‚Ä¢ Workers are talking about boycotting Toronto coffee shops, restaurants, and other places to ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Critics argue that hurts small businesses and low wage workers rather than the employers forcing return to office

The bigger context is that downtown still has millions of square feet of vacant office space. The City has even studied turning towers into housing. That is not simple and many believe forcing workers back is a way to keep Bay Street alive.

With OPS heading back in January we may see the same tensions play out among our own ranks.

to ‚Äòlive in the end‚Äô is not meant to be taken literally.

It‚Äôs not about pretending you have the thing. 

It‚Äôs about treating what you do have NOW like it‚Äôs already enough.

Because if you really believed your dream life was on its way, or already unfolding, or already here!! you would be obsessed with the present. You would be in love with life right now! You would be happy! kind! excited! full of love!!!!!

But no one wants to do this.
Because it‚Äôs simple!!! but not easy.
It means slowing down. Feeling. Being grateful. 

it doesn‚Äôt mean pretend your soulmate is next to you.

it doesn‚Äôt mean act like you‚Äôre rich when you‚Äôre broke.

it means:
live like what you have now is everything you ever wanted. wow! you are living a dream!!!

so try this:

look at your life, the bed you sleep in, the sky, the coffee, the quiet.

and decide that this is it. this is the life you dreamed of.

romanticise the tiniest things!!!!
 
and let that energy spill into your body like sunlight.

be thankful! be kind! share love! 

this is the cheat code to manifesting! 

that‚Äôs what makes you magnetic.

this is how you get everything you want!!!!

A 2025 Expert‚Äôs Perspective,"Are Cyber Insurance Policies Mandatory for Businesses in Bahrain? A 2025 Expert‚Äôs Perspective\
It was a warm Monday morning as I walked through the pristine glass towers of Bahrain Financial Harbour, my coffee still steaming in my hand, ready for an early majlis-style meeting in the nearby Seef District. Negotiations with clients in the Diplomatic Area always felt more dynamic, especially when the scent of freshly ground cardamom drifted from the coffee service. I‚Äôd just finalized another company registration and was fielding a question that‚Äôs become near-daily: ‚ÄúDo I really need cyber insurance to form a business in Bahrain?‚Äù\
\
Alt text: Business people professionals meeting in a corporate office. forecasts a GDP growth of 4.3% for 2025, fueled by record-high foreign investments and a push for digital transformation (Reuters). Financial services, fintech, logistics, and healthtech are booming‚Äîespecially in hubs like Bahrain Bay and the Seef District.\
\
Forbes Business cited Bahrain as the ‚ÄúGulf‚Äôs most agile market for foreign ownership structures and digital-first company formation‚Äù in their May 2025 report (Forbes Business).\
\
Local regulations are evolving, but Bahrain‚Äôs open-door policy for foreign investors stands out‚Äîespecially compared to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where ownership and regulatory hurdles can feel daunting. Here, 100% foreign ownership is available for many activities (Keylink: Foreign Ownership Guide), and commercial registration has never been smoother thanks to e-services like Sijilat and LMRA portals.\
And yet, with all this growth, cyber threats have kept pace.\
\
The Cybersecurity Landscape: New Rules, Real Risks\
Bahrain‚Äôs National Cybersecurity Strategy, re-launched in January 2025, is among the most advanced in the Gulf. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) and the Bahrain Information & eGovernment Authority have stepped up monitoring and enforcement, especially after a series of high-profile data leaks in 2024.\
Key 2025 Developments:\
- Mandatory cybersecurity risk assessments for all regulated financial and tech firms, effective April 2025.\
- Data protection regulations aligned with the EU‚Äôs GDPR, with stiff penalties for breaches.\
- Cyber insurance not yet mandatory for company formation‚Äîbut strongly encouraged for regulated sectors (e.g., fintech, payments, data processors).\
Bahraini authorities have stopped short of making cyber insurance universally mandatory. However, many licensing authorities‚Äînotably the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB)‚Äînow require it for certain activities. For most standard trading, consultancy, or commercial registrations, it‚Äôs still voluntary.\
(Personal aside: In 2024, I worked with a Bahrain Bay fintech startup that couldn‚Äôt launch until its cyber insurance policy was uploaded to the CBB portal. The delay cost weeks‚Äîhad we known, we‚Äôd have started the application earlier, saving both time and nerves!)\
\
Are Cyber Insurance Policies Mandatory for Bahrain Company Formation?\
Surprisingly, Cyber insurance is not a blanket requirement for all Bahrain companies as of mid-2025.\
Here‚Äôs the breakdown:\
\
General Commercial Companies: No mandatory requirement.\
CBB-Regulated Entities (Banks, Fintechs, Payment Service Providers, etc.): Usually required.\
Healthcare/Data Processors: Strongly advised; sometimes required by specific ministry guidelines.\
Free Zone Entities: Local authorities (e.g., Bahrain International Investment Park) may set their own standards. Check specific free zone requirements.\
\
This means that, unless your business falls under a regulated sector, you can legally register without cyber insurance. However, industry best practice (and common sense) says: don‚Äôt risk it. Data breaches cost Bahraini companies an average of BHD 29,000 in 2024 (Gulf News Bahrain), and government guidance is only getting stricter.\
\
What Does Cyber Insurance in Bahrain Actually Cover?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Network downtime & business interruption\
- Regulatory fines (where insurable)\
- Third-party liability (customer lawsuits)\
Most reputable insurers (AXA Gulf, GIG Bahrain, BNH, etc.) offer both local and international coverage options.\
Pro Tip: Always check that your policy meets the regulator‚Äôs minimum standards. One client‚Äôs generic policy was rejected by the Sijilat portal because it didn‚Äôt cover third-party liabilities‚Äîcosting precious time during license finalization.\
\
Step-By-Step Guidance: Save Time & Money\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation., SPC, Branch, Partnership, etc. (Full Guide)\
- Foreign-owned companies enjoy up to 99% ownership (Ownership FAQ), with no local sponsor usually needed (Sponsorship explained).\
2. Register Early‚ÄîAnd at the Right Location\
\
Use the Sijilat online portal to avoid queues at MOICT (try the Diplomatic Area branch if you must go in person‚Äîlines are shortest midday during Ramadan!).\
For foreign founders, prepare notarized and legalized documents before arrival to shave weeks off the process.\
\
3. Check Your Cyber Insurance (If Needed) Early\
\
Financial/fintech/regulated businesses should request a compliance certificate from the insurer.\
Ask for Bahraini market-compliant policies‚Äîgeneric offshore ones will rarely suffice.\
\
4. Document Preparation Shortcuts\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs MOICT accepts scanned copies for initial approval, then requests originals. Use a reputable courier like Aramex for fast delivery from KSA or the UAE.\
Keep your commercial registration (CR) number handy‚Äîit‚Äôs needed for nearly every cyber insurance application.\
\
5. Timing Insider Tip\
\
Avoid submitting applications around Eids or end-of-Gregorian-year‚Äîreview times double!\
Appointments at Bahrain Bay EDB branch are fastest on Thursdays before 11 am.\
\
\
Financial Realities: Cost of Cyber Insurance & Related Fees\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs. start as low as BHD 60/month.\
\
Compliance: Avoid Mistakes & Stay Inspection-Ready\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. requires written policies and evidence of risk management. Inspectors may request cyber insurance details, especially if you handle ‚Äúsensitive personal data.‚Äù\
How to Stay Ahead:\
- Keep an up-to-date compliance binder (digital/physical) with your insurance certificate, IT policy, and business continuity plan.\
- Schedule annual audits‚Äîlocal consultancies like Keylink will keep your documentation ready for review.\
(First time I faced a surprise MOICT audit in Seef, my files were offline‚Äîlesson learned: keep a cloud copy on a Bahrain-based server, which passed the check!)\

Just as an aside (and to break the stress of paperwork), I always make time to pick up a box of fresh dates from the Manama Souq during business setup season. Aside from being a great icebreaker at meetings, they remind me of how Bahraini business culture combines sweetness and resilience‚Äîa bit off-topic, but when you‚Äôre negotiating with a government official who‚Äôs been fasting since dawn, offering dates can be the difference between another queue and same-day approval. And, yes, that‚Äôs how I closed my first insurance policy deal for a client in 2022.\
\
Should You Get Cyber Insurance Even If It‚Äôs Not Mandatory?\
Short answer: Yes, if you handle customer data or rely on digital operations‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre not a fintech.\
Bahrain‚Äôs policies are shifting toward stricter enforcement. Even if your business isn‚Äôt in a regulated sector now, that might change soon. Insurers often provide free risk assessments and can help you patch gaps before they become expensive mistakes.\
Without a policy:\
- One ransomware attack can wipe out your profit and reputation.\
- Suppliers/clients increasingly require insurance as a condition of doing business.\
- New CBB and MOICT updates (effective September 2025) may expand mandatory coverage to e-commerce and logistics sectors.\

\
Short FAQ: Cyber Insurance & Company Formation in Bahrain\
1. Is cyber insurance required for all new companies in Bahrain?\
No‚Äîunless your activity is regulated by the CBB or MOICT (e.g., fintech, health, data operations). General commercial companies are strongly advised to have coverage, but it‚Äôs not a legal requirement yet. Full requirements\
2. How much does cyber insurance cost in Bahrain?\
Startups pay BHD 220‚Äì350 annually for base coverage. Complex/regulated companies (fintech, healthcare) pay BHD 1,400‚Äì4,000/year (see detailed cost breakdown). Always compare policy limits and exclusions.\
3. Can 100% foreign-owned businesses buy local cyber insurance?\
Yes. Bahraini insurers serve foreign-owned and free zone entities. Ownership guide\
4. What‚Äôs the biggest mistake new founders make?\
Assuming last-minute insurance is ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Many policies take 7‚Äì14 days to process‚Äîand government portals may reject incomplete submissions. Start your applications alongside your commercial registration.\
5. Where to get help with insurance, compliance, and renewals?\
Use Keylink‚Äôs accounting & compliance services or trusted local consultancies for ongoing support and annual audit readiness.\
\
So‚Äîwhile you can legally form a Bahrain company without cyber insurance (except in regulated sectors), skipping it in 2025 is like driving fast down Shaikh Isa Avenue‚Ä¶ with no seatbelt. Local expertise, cultural awareness, and the right paperwork are your best allies as Bahrain‚Äôs digital economy shifts into high gear.",1,1756672479.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

- The film is a triptych of self‚Äëcontained chapters set in three different countries, each examining adult children‚Äôs relationships with distant parents.
- It marks Jarmusch‚Äôs first entry in Venice‚Äôs main competition; his earlier anthology *Coffee and Cigarettes* screened out of competition in 2003.
- The ensemble includes Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Sarah Greene, Indya Moore, Luka Sabbat and Fran√ßoise Lebrun.
- Production is backed by Mubi, Saint‚ÄØLaurent‚Äôs creative director Anthony Vaccarello, The Apartment (Fremantle), and several European partners such as badjetlag, CG‚ÄØCinema and Films‚ÄØdu‚ÄØLosange.
- At the press conference Jarmusch was questioned about Mubi‚Äôs financing ties to Sequoia Capital; he declined to comment on the company‚Äôs funding decisions.

Why it matters: The strong audience response highlights the relevance of anthology storytelling and signals Jarmusch‚Äôs continued influence on independent cinema.

We got individual cards for his primary doctors and nurses during his stay, but there were also other who took care of him so we'd like to also give a more ""communal"" gift.

From what l've seen so far, less sweets more healthy options so would love feedback or suggestions on the following:
1. We are ordering bagels and coffee since it'll be a morning delivery. And are bringing a fruit platter as well
2. It's a 24/7 vet where the team works 12 hour shifts, so we'd like to make a ""refresh basket"" with things like lotion, makeup wipes, dry shampoo, cold and flu medicine, liquid IVs, energy drinks, Bobby pins, protein bars, gum, etc. -Is this something that the team would like? Should we add additional items? What would be some gender neutral items?
3. One of his nurses was pregnant with twins and let us know, and we'd like to get her a little something. Would that be weird?

We don't want to clutter the office or make anyone uncomfortable, but we're super grateful for all that they did for our little guy and want them to feel appreciated.
We welcome any and all suggestions!

**Itineraries:**

**Da Nang, Vietnam**

* **The Pergola Hotel, Da Nang (5/5 stars)**
   * cute hotel with decent size, very warm staff, and a nice little restaurant inside. relatively cheap
* [Han River Night Cruise](https://www.klook.com/activity/23321-han-river-cruise-my-xuan-cruise-da-nang/)
* Walk around the beach and chill
   * Restaurant Recommendation: [Nh√† B·∫øp X∆∞a Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K7kwbZnj3azbJTJWA) (made me fall in love with B√°nh x√®o)
* Hoi An Ancient Town
   * You can go here by bus but Grab is just as practical
   * [Hoi An Ancient Town Free Walking Tour (GuruWalk)](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/41156-hoi-an-ancient-town-free-walking-tour)
   * Bike Rental around the old town
      * lots of bike rentals around, we found this guy from Google Maps and had an amazing review. used the one with a cushioned seat at the back seat and a large basket 
      * cross the other side of the bridge -- less crowded sya and you can go further. takot lang ako sa heights so di tumuloy dun sa hanging bridge pero pwede mo siya tawirin via bike lol
   * Gets really crowded around 6PM onwards for the lantern boats so do your things prior to that
   * Lantern boat is. . . okay. For the experience siguro. The pricing is fixed and they just call at the riverside.
   * Skip the Banh Mi line inside the ancient town and get your Banh Mi fix [here](https://share.google/aVF9EYIhrntuQhHYI). Mas mura, mas masarap, at madaming locals na nagte-take away.
   * Restaurant Recommendation: [Relics](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6duyE3ysLhDohvG8)
* Ba Na Hills
   * [Book it via website](https://banahills.sunworld.vn/en/). Or Klook. There should be a buffet option as an add on but didnt get it. I heard it gets pretty crowded anyway during lunch time. Maybe kung 1-2 persons baka mas madali.
   * It's... a theme park with almost no rides except the Cable Car which is probably the longest cable car ride I have been to (or maybe it was in Ngong Ping, Hongkong or Genting Highlands, Malaysia or Maokong Gondola, Taiwan?)
   * The coaster was part of the package I purchased. Ample line. The ride was about 1-2 minutes (yata) but it was pretty good ngl. Otherwise, the ""rides"" are few and they are paid.
   * Golden Bridge is here (yung may kamay). I find it underwhelming. Mukhang maganda sa picture pero andaming tao tapos maiksi lang naman. 
   * Sections are divided by cable car rides. The complimentary beers from Sun World are actually nice! Ang mahal nga lang dun sa restaurant where you are supposed to redeem the beer lol.
* Fly to Ho Chi Minh City (at night)
   * This sh-t was delayed so bad and it was late in the night.

**Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam**

* **Level Saigon Hotel**
   * Great value hotel even with the cheapest room. There is a really nice laundry shop in front for a few *dongs)*. About 15-20 minute walk to the center which is okay.
* [GuruWalk Free Walking Tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/54272-all-in-one-saigon-free-tour)
   * Goes to the usual spots in HCM -- Bitexco Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, Saigon Central Post Office, etc.
   * Amazing insights and recommendations! 
* [Guruwalk Street Food and The Life of Saigon -- Free Walking Tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/55157-street-food-and-the-life-of-saigon-free-walking-tour)
   * Great food tour for a small (tip) price! They will bring you to obscure places. [Ho Thi Ky Food Street](https://share.google/6op1wjSN6HK0DrVqy) is probably one of my most favorite street food markets ever! Lots of choices, cheap, and great food. Ingat lang sa mga motorbikes kasi pati eskinita dumadaan sila lol.
* Cu Chi Tunnel Half Day Tour
   * Informative and funny guide. It is pretty short and the bus ride is longer than the tour lol.
   * There are basically two tunnels -- yung usual na magtatago ka at yung isa na naka crouch ka na dadaan na medyo malayo rin.
* Coffee Apartment: i mean... it's there. You pay for the views, really. Check whether the cafe has an overlooking view. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of overpriced coffee shops.
* Restaurant Recommendation: 
   * [Bun Cha Ha Noi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TiiG5UoPP6ymHPfT9) 
      * Never going to Vietnam without my #1 favorite -- bun cha! They nailed it to a tee! 
   * Pizza 4Ps: it is pretty gooood! Place looks fancy. You may need to wait to be seated but I think it's reasonable for how fancy it looks within the center of Saigon.

**Phnom Penh, Cambodia (spent only 1 night here)**

* Bus from Saigon to Phnom Penh (6:00 am to 12:30pm) via VET Air Bus Express
   * Cheaper than the other more premium alternative but still very comfy
* King Grand Boutique Hotel: has a swimming pool if you need one (lol)
   * the cheapest we can find after booking 1 week prior. i think it's value for the price. right next to the center.
* [Phnom Penh Hidden Gems Free Walking Tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/56908-phnom-penh-hidden-gems-a-guided-walking-tour-of-history-art-markets-local-life)
   * One of the best guides in terms of information that I have attended in GuruWalk. Learned a lot of things most especially different ""types"" of Buddhism being practiced there and other things. 
   * He's semi-open to discussing the atrocities within Cambodia but that's because the government cracks down on any ill narrative towards them.
   * He will indeed bring you to the place to eat insects and bugs like spiders lmfao

**Siem Reap**

* Traveled to Siem Reap via a *luxury-ish* van. Quite spacious for a van. Via Vireak Buntham Express Terminal (7:30 to 1:00 PM). 
* Pandora Suite D' Angkor: great value hotel with swimming pool, a bit distant from the ""center"" or pub street. Most hotels in Siem Reap are basically like hotels with swimming pools lol.
* Angkor Pub Street
   * Surprisingly lively with good shops to buy souvenirs! I suggest you get some outfits here for your Angkor Wat tour. They have a lot of skirts for women and tops for men that suits Angkor Wat! Pwede ka tumawad. Sabihin mo lang, Filipino ka para di ka nila i-overpriced parang mga puti lol.
* **Rent an e-bike and** ***scoot*** **around Siem Reap @** [**Blue E-bike Service**](https://share.google/IRwUybkJi8McMAzbr)
   * Price is around 12 USD a day. You need to bring the bike back for charging and then go back I think. Pero pwede atang straight 2 days kung di naman nauubos.
   * Siem Reap is very easy to navigate. I have never rode a scooter before but I was able to do it! Everyone follows simple traffic rules and the roads are not even crowded. You will spend around the same amount anyway if you go around paying for Tuktuks.
   * You can only bring e-bikes on certain parts of the Angkor Complex
* [Angkor Wat Full Sunrise Tour (5:30 to 1:00 PM onwards)](https://www.getyourguide.com/siem-reap-l274/angkor-wat-small-group-sunrise-tour-without-crowds-t406206/?ranking_uuid=52fbb760-a28f-4c5d-8c25-ccfd33ef9d10)
   * Really early and you even need some phone flashlights at the start because it's dark. 
   * But there's less people this time so you can get a better shot. Unfortunately, their New Year Celebration (for buddhism i think?) is near so they are setting up stages that are blocking some of the view of Angkor Wat.
   * The view is just truly majestic whet it is covered in orange tint and reflected by the sunlight.
   * There are two more temples you will visit -- one is the temple where they shot Tomb Raider and the other temple is also very interesting and amazing.
* Angkor Botanical Gardens
   * A small botanical gardens with few animals on the way to Angkor.
   * It's free, you just need to follow their socials. You can also buy fish feed to feed koi fishes or do some archery shots lol.
* Some few temples within Siem Reap outside Angkor Complex
* Restaurants Recommendations:
   * [New Hope Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F9VsrGtFXtz1ToxN8)
      * Great food on a reasonable price! Warm staff. A little hidden from the center so there's very few people. But the profits go into some children's org to send them to school. Honestly worth it!

**Highlights**

* The Vietnamese food is just... wholesome, guilt-free, and absolutely delicious. Personally the best cuisine in South East Asia.
* Spent a ton of time in the free walking tours -- and it was amazing and educational! Knew very little about Da Nang and its roots, knew almost nothing about Cambodia too. 
* The bike rentals in Da Nang and e-bike in Siem Reap are pretty great! You have the freedom to go wherever, whenever! 
* Pictures do not give Angkor Wat and the other temples justice. It's one of those moments that you just have to be there to see and feel it. It's massive. 
* Phnom Penh surprised me for how walkable, clean, safe, and spacious the center is! Didn't expect too much after the blunder that was Vientiane, Laos. HAHAHA.
* Viets and Cambodians are very warm! 

**Lowlights**

* Late March is incredibly hot and humid at times. I don't like going out like that lol.
* The tuktuks at the terminals (Phnom Penh) charge about 10x more! Just don't do it.
* Ba Na Hills is... meh. It's hot, crowded, and there are no ""rides"" for a theme park.
* Cambodian cuisine... is just.. meh. Arguably (personally) my least favorite cuisine in Southeast Asia. It is actually the closest one to Filipino cuisine to our surprise. They do use a lot of coconut milk and food seems to taste sweeter than usual.
* **Vietjet is the worst!** Either it's a delay or they will literally charge you if you are over 500grams. There are cases where they dont weigh the luggages. But be prepared! You have been warned.

**Notes / Tips:**

* Use **GrabTuktuk** in Cambodia. It is way cheaper than asking random tuktuk drivers. 
* I suggest getting the sim card (or e-sim beforehand) since you will not be able to buy sim cards in the bus terminal on PP so you wont be able to book via Grab and will be forced to be overcharged by the Tuktuk drivers
* Crossing the vietnamese street is quite difficult for some. Just walk straight, look at the eyes of the motorists, and raise your hand. **Do not stop in the middle of the road!** There is a higher chance you bump into them.
* Walk. Seriously, walk. Da Nang is really chill. You buy a banh mi on the street vendor and walk by the beach. You will literally see dudes walking at the middle of the highway towards the beach barefoot lol. This goes the same for HCM and Cambodia.
* Both places are rich in history -- immerse in them via museums or walking tours
* If you are new to Vietnamese cuisine, I highly recommend getting a food tour -- paid or tip-based. My first one was in Hanoi (paid one) and it changed my view of Viet cuisine and vegetables in general. It was so good, it immediately became my most favorite cuisine after Japanese cuisine.
* You like Banh Mi? There are differences between Banh Mi in Hanoi, Central Viet (Da Nang), and HCM. Try to identify what they are!
* Try local specialties! The specialties in Da Nang are Banh Xeo, Bun Bo Hue.
* **Cambodia still has very few direct flights**. Hence, it is more expensive than other destinations in terms of air fare. Plan your entrance and exists accordingly.

I already did my grading for my Five Pillars of a Great Travel in my last post. You can just refer to that one.

Budget Breakdown:

* Flights: 45K (for two)
   * Cambodia flight made this expensive. But it's also because MNL to SGN and SAI to MNL were Vietnam Airlines)
* Accommodation: 14K for 8 nights
* HCM to PP bus: 1500 per person
* PP to SR: 870 each

I found out he was cheating on me with multiple girls for 3 months‚Ä¶. He claims nothing physical happened and it was only texting/pictures, that thing. I decided to believe him and we worked through it. I never told anyone. Not a soul. My best friends caught on to me being super distant and depressed, they all took me for coffee and really wanted to just know what was going on. I broke down and told them everything. They all felt terrible I was going through this. Since then I feel so stupid. Now I feel less intimate with him and I feel stupid for throwing away my life plans with this guy like future PA school plans (I was going to only apply to PA schools to states we were okay with living in together) and stuff like that, as well as places I wanted to live. I always wanted to live East coast and he always wanted to not live there. 

Again we do live together and have a lease. I do still have love for him and his family, but just feel like the less intimacy thing towards him truly is from the fact he cheated.

The idea came from my own experience‚Äîgrowing up, school often made learning feel like memorization without meaning. But books showed me that knowledge could actually be exciting. I wanted to capture that feeling and make it easier for anyone to learn.

So what does Gurwi do?

* Lessons are short (10‚Äì15 minutes).
* Each time you hit¬†*continue*, a new page unlocks with a¬†**visual or interactive resource**¬†\+ questions.
* Text can be played in¬†**audio**, with rewind/fast-forward controls.
* You can switch between¬†**Spanish, English, and Portuguese**, which also makes it useful for language learning.
* Current topics: math, history, economics, biology, programming. Sources are included for accuracy.

We built this with¬†**Flutter (frontend)**,¬†**Supabase (backend)**,¬†**RevenueCat**¬†for subs, and¬†**Cloudflare R2**¬†for storage. No funding, just two guys and a lot of coffee ‚òï.

Right now we‚Äôre part of a hackathon where traction could get us up to¬†**$65k in funding**, so installs/reviews really matter. If you‚Äôd like to see it:

I also added a can of wildfish cannery smoked octopus for extra protein. I tasted the biscuits on their own. First the salt biscuit, a nice crisp texture with a pronounced salt flavor but in the best way possible. Paired with the pate, it added an extra savory note without being overpowering or too salty. The sweet biscuit has a nice crisp texture as well with a light sweetness. Reminds me of a graham cracker. I paired it with the pate as well and holy shit it works so well. It balanced perfectly with the pate. The chocolate one is the same as the sweet biscuit but with the added deliciousness of chocolate. It's a subtle flavor that would pair well with coffee or maybe a nice port if you're feeling really fancy. The cereal bar has a great apricot flavor and nice texture. Not much else to say about it. The nougat bar is always a great treat. It reminds of my Granny's divinity she used to make at Christmas. A pleasantly chewy texture with bits of dried fruit. For all of these 8/10 for the salt biscuits, 8.5/10 for the sweet and chocolate biscuits, 8/10 for the apricot cereal bar and 9/10 for the nougat bar. The tea is just a standard black tea and I drank it plain with no sweetener as I normally do and 5/10. 

The chicken liver pate is amazing. It has a livery, mineraly flavor that was best complimented by those sweet biscuits. That's a 10/10 combo. Texture reminds me of a tighter potted meat (redneck pate for those that don't know...mechanically separated beef, chicken and pork with spices and mustard. Makes a great sandwich on cheap white bread with mayo and an ice cold Barq's root beer in a glass bottle). The flavor also reminds me a bit of potted meat with a more pronounced liver flavor. 9/10 for me. 

Now for the main. I heated it in a pot of water for about 20 minutes. I don't do a rolling boil, more like a medium high heat. Weigh it down and let her ride. It has a wonderful smell when the can opens. There are huge chunks of salmon. I was honestly expecting way more rice than protein but not this time. It reminds me of the jambalaya I cook. Honestly the salmon is way overcooked but I enjoyed the meaty texture compared to the mushy rice and vegetables. Don't take that as a bad thing. I love contrasting textures in foods because it makes it more of an eating adventure. The only thing I found lacking was it was a bit bland. This was definitely a problem for hot sauce to solve. It added a nice salt level with a bit of heat. It took it from a 8.5/10 to a 9.5/10. The octopus is a 9/10 for me. It has the right amount of salt and smoke. I'm not much on tinned seafood in water. I feel like oil is a much better medium for it. The flavors are more pronounced plus you can dip some nice, crusty French bread in it. 

Overall a 9.5/10 for lunch. Really hard to find any fault with this. ",9,1756671968.0,MRE,2,0.92,False

The sweet biscuit has a nice crisp texture as well with a light sweetness. Reminds me of a graham cracker. I paired it with the pate as well and holy shit it works so well. It balanced perfectly with the pate. The chocolate one is the same as the sweet biscuit but with the added deliciousness of chocolate. It's a subtle flavor that would pair well with coffee or maybe a nice port if you're feeling really fancy. The cereal bar has a great apricot flavor and nice texture. Not much else to say about it. The nougat bar is always a great treat. It reminds of my Granny's divinity she used to make at Christmas. A pleasantly chewy texture with bits of dried fruit. For all of these 8/10 for the salt biscuits, 8.5/10 for the sweet and chocolate biscuits, 8/10 for the apricot cereal bar and 9/10 for the nougat bar. The tea is just a standard black tea and I drank it plain with no sweetener as I normally do and 5/10. 

The chicken liver pate is amazing. It has a livery, mineraly flavor that was best complimented by those sweet biscuits. That's a 10/10 combo. Texture reminds me of a tighter potted meat (redneck pate for those that don't know...mechanically separated beef, chicken and pork with spices and mustard. Makes a great sandwich on cheap white bread with mayo and an ice cold Barq's root beer in a glass bottle). The flavor also reminds me a bit of potted meat with a more pronounced liver flavor. 9/10 for me. 

Now for the main. I heated it in a pot of water for about 20 minutes. I don't do a rolling boil, more like a medium high heat. Weigh it down and let her ride. It has a wonderful smell when the can opens. There are huge chunks of salmon. I was honestly expecting way more rice than protein but not this time. It reminds me of the jambalaya I cook. Honestly the salmon is way overcooked but I enjoyed the meaty texture compared to the mushy rice and vegetables. Don't take that as a bad thing. I love contrasting textures in foods because it makes it more of an eating adventure. The only thing I found lacking was it was a bit bland. This was definitely a problem for hot sauce to solve. It added a nice salt level with a bit of heat. It took it from a 8.5/10 to a 9.5/10. The octopus is a 9/10 for me. It has the right amount of salt and smoke. I'm not much on tinned seafood in water. I feel like oil is a much better medium for it. The flavors are more pronounced plus you can dip some nice, crusty French bread in it. 

Overall a 9.5/10 for lunch. Really hard to find any fault with this. ",3,1756671937.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1n553hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1n553hy/truth_and_wine_how_much_does_betrayal_cost_family/,"‚ú® Truth and Wine, How Much Does Betrayal Cost | Family Drama ü§ç","‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®  
The story of three siblings who inherit an old family vineyard in California. They think they are returning to their past, but instead they find a dark secret that reveals the truth about their parents. Their perfect marriage was a lie, built on a betrayal that destroyed someone else's life.

Now Leo, Isabel and Noah must make a choice: honor their parents' memory or admit their mistake, even if it leads to the complete collapse of their family. Can they find forgiveness and save their legacy? Dive into a story of family drama, redemption and the price of truth :  
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®  
The California sun was a merciless white orb in the sky, beating down on the dusty hills of Sonoma County. The air smelled of dry earth and dormant dreams. Leo pulled his rental car to a stop in front of the old family estate, a place he hadn't seen in over a decade. The house, once a beacon of his childhood, now looked like a ghost. Its paint was peeling, the porch was rotting, and the once-pristine rows of grapevines were a tangled, overgrown mess.

He sighed, a long, weary exhalation that carried the weight of a thousand unanswered calls and unsaid words. He had come back for one reason only: the will. His parents, pillars of the community and owners of the once-revered ""Gilded Vine"" winery, had passed away in a quiet car accident, leaving their entire estate to their three children: him, Isabelle, and Noah.

As if on cue, a dusty SUV pulled up behind him. His sister, Isabelle, stepped out, her designer clothes and polished shoes a stark contrast to the rustic scenery. A famous sommelier in New York, she looked more at home in a high-end restaurant than on a crumbling vineyard. Her face, a mask of professional poise, betrayed a hint of emotion as her eyes took in the state of their childhood home.

""well,"" she said, her voice a low whisper. ""It‚Äôs worse than I remember.""  
""It's a money pit,"" Leo said, his voice clipped and dry. ""And the sooner we sell it, the better.""

Isabelle turned to him, her eyes flashing with a familiar anger. ""Sell it? Leo, this is our legacy. This is where we grew up. We can restore it. We can bring it back to its former glory.""  
Before the argument could escalate, a third car arrived. Noah, the youngest, stepped out, a backpack slung over his shoulder. He was an artist, a dreamer, and the only one who still held a romanticized view of their family's past.

""Hey, guys,"" he said, a forced cheerfulness in his voice. ""It's good to be home.""

The three of them walked up to the house in a silent, awkward procession. The front door was unlocked, and the interior was just as bad as the exterior. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that cut through the dirty windows. The furniture was covered in sheets, the air thick with the smell of mold and old memories. They made their way to the living room, where a lawyer, a grim-faced woman in a sharp suit, was waiting for them.  
She laid out the will on the dusty coffee table. It was a simple document, but its words would change their lives forever. The will stated that the vineyard, the house, and all the assets were to be inherited by the three siblings, but with one condition: they had to work together to restore the vineyard and produce a successful harvest within three years. If they failed, the entire estate would be donated to a local charity.  
Leo scoffed. ""This is insane. We're a lawyer, a sommelier, and a starving artist. We have no idea how to run a vineyard.""  
""Our parents were painters of dreams,"" Isabelle said, her voice filled with a sudden, passionate conviction. ""They believed in us. We can do this.""  
""It's a beautiful thought,"" Leo said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""But the reality is, this is a business, and it's a failing one. We should cut our losses and run.""

The argument that followed was a familiar one. It was a battle of wills, a clash of their very different personalities. Leo, the pragmatist, saw only the numbers. Isabelle, the romantic, saw only the potential. Noah, the mediator, was caught in the middle, trying to find a way to make everyone happy.  
Later that day, after the lawyer had left, Isabelle went to her mother's old study. It was a small, quiet room, filled with books and old photographs. She opened a small, locked cabinet and found a box. Inside, nestled among old photographs and love letters, was a small, leather-bound journal. Her mother's journal. She opened it, her hands trembling. The first entry was from thirty years ago, written in a shaky, hesitant hand.

""I can't believe what we did,"" it read. ""The guilt is a heavy stone in my heart. He was our friend. He was our partner. And we betrayed him. I don't know if I can live with this.""  
Isabelle‚Äôs heart sank. She recognized the handwriting. It was her mother's. But the words... they were a betrayal of everything she had ever believed in. Her parents' marriage had been a love story, a perfect dream. But this journal... it was a nightmare. She read on, a growing sense of dread settling in her stomach. The entries told a story of a business deal gone wrong, a partnership with a man named Alistair Finch. The deal was supposed to save both of their businesses, but her parents, in a moment of desperation, had manipulated the legal documents and forced Finch out. They had taken everything, leaving him with nothing.  
Isabelle‚Äôs world tilted on its axis. The idyllic life she had lived, the perfect family she had cherished, was all a lie. A lie built on betrayal, on a dark, unspoken secret that had poisoned their family for years. And she was standing right in the middle of it.

Isabelle sat on the dusty floor of her mother's study, the journal open in her lap. The words swam before her eyes, but the message was a cold, clear slap to the face. The perfect love story, the idyllic life, the successful winery... it was all a house of cards built on a foundation of lies. Her parents, whom she had idolized, were not the artists and dreamers she had believed them to be. They were betrayers, thieves who had stolen from a friend.  
Alistair Finch. The name echoed in her mind. She had never heard of him. He was a ghost from a past her parents had meticulously erased. She closed the journal and ran her hand over its worn leather cover, a mix of grief and rage swirling inside her. The rage won out. She had to know everything.  
She began to search the study, rummaging through old papers and forgotten documents. The room was a treasure trove of family history, a history she now knew was filled with dark secrets. She found stacks of old invoices, business contracts, and legal documents. She sorted through them, her hands trembling. And then, she found it. A file with Alistair Finch's name on it.  
Inside, there were letters, legal agreements, and a final, terse note from her father to Finch, dated years ago. The letters revealed a partnership, a dream they had all shared: to create a unique wine, a masterpiece. But the partnership had soured. Her parents had a rare disease in their vines, and they had needed money to save their winery. Finch, a wealthy investor, had refused to lend them more money, believing their venture was doomed. In a fit of desperation, her parents had forged documents, selling off Finch‚Äôs shares for a fraction of their value and forcing him out. The letters from Finch were a heartbreaking descent into despair, from pleading to rage to resignation. He had lost everything: his money, his business, his best friends, and his dream.

Isabelle felt sick. She closed the file, the truth a bitter taste in her mouth. She went outside, where Leo and Noah were still arguing, their voices a low, angry hum. They stopped when they saw her, her face pale and drawn.

""What's wrong?"" Noah asked, his voice filled with concern. ""You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""I have,"" Isabelle said, her voice a low, raspy whisper. ""Our parents. They weren't what we thought they were."" She showed them the journal and the file. Leo took the file, his face a mask of disbelief. He read through the documents, his eyes scanning the legalese. He was a lawyer, and he could see the forgery, the manipulation, the cold, calculated betrayal.

He looked at her, his face ashen. ""This can't be real. This is insane.""

""It's real,"" Isabelle said, her voice filled with a heartbreaking finality. ""They cheated him. They stole his money. They took everything he had.""

Noah, always the optimist, refused to believe it. ""No, this is a misunderstanding. It's a mistake. Our parents would never do something like this. They were good people. They loved us.""

""Good people don't steal from their friends, Noah,"" Leo said, his voice hard and unforgiving. ""They ruined a man's life.""

Just as the argument reached a fever pitch, another car pulled up the driveway. It was a sleek black sedan, a stark contrast to their dusty rental cars. A woman in a stylish, dark dress stepped out. She was tall and elegant, with a quiet confidence that radiated from her. She looked at the three of them, a ghost of a smile on her face. Her eyes, a cold, piercing blue, seemed to see through them, to the ugly truth beneath their perfect facades.

""Hello,"" she said, her voice a low, melodic purr. ""I'm Ava Finch. I believe you're on my family's land.""

Isabelle‚Äôs heart stopped. She looked at the woman, her mind racing. Ava Finch. The name from the journal, the daughter of the man her parents had betrayed. She was here. She had come for them.

1n5507z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1n5507z/should_you_try_the_best_furniture_sliders_wenqik/,Should You Try the Best Furniture Sliders Wenqik for Easy Appliance Moving?,"Testing out the Wenqik 2 Pcs Appliance Sliders has been quite an experience for me as someone who‚Äôs frequently handling heavy appliances and furniture. These sliders promised efficiency, ease of transportation for bulky items, and protection for hardwood and tile flooring ‚Äì all of which felt too good to resist. Over the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been using them to move various items around my home, and here are my honest thoughts about how they perform and where they could improve.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about these appliance sliders was their thoughtful design and durable construction. The set includes two sliders made with strong PE plastic and nylon straps, measuring 48.43 x 8.07 inches for the sliders and 0.98 x 35.43 inches for the pull straps. The material feels sturdy yet easy to grip with the cutout hole in each slider, making the entire process smoother. The quality screams durability, and I‚Äôve dragged my refrigerator across the kitchen without seeing any visible scratches or cracks on these sliders. It‚Äôs honestly surprising how lightweight but resilient they feel in hand.  

[Grab Wenqik 2 Pcs Appliance Sliders at the best price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cn63hc3z/)  

**Ease of Use and Performance**  
Moving heavy furniture is typically a chore, but using these sliders simplified everything. They minimize the friction between the furniture and the floor, making it feel like I was gliding objects instead of dragging them. Attaching the pull straps takes seconds, and once you‚Äôre set up, you just tug the furniture or appliance in the direction you want. When I shifted my washing machine last week, I didn‚Äôt feel the usual exhaustion that comes with moving such a hefty piece of equipment. These sliders deliver on their promise of reducing physical strain while making the experience smoother.

****Protects Floors While Moving**  
One standout feature is how effectively these sliders safeguard my floors. I have hardwood throughout my house, and the fear of scratching or gouging it often makes me hesitate before rearranging furniture. Using these sliders, I noticed their smooth base protected even my delicate tiles in the bathroom. No scratches appeared ‚Äì something my previous sliders failed to prevent. Whether you‚Äôre using them on wood, laminate, or tile, they do an impressive job of keeping your flooring pristine.

**Versatile Applications**  
It‚Äôs worth mentioning that these appliance sliders aren‚Äôt just for the big-ticket items like refrigerators and ovens. They worked just as well for smaller bulky items. I‚Äôve used them to move toolboxes, a bulky dresser, and even a stubbornly heavy coffee table. The versatility is what really won me over because you‚Äôre not limited strictly to appliances. This makes them a fantastic addition to any moving kit, especially for someone like me who‚Äôs always redecorating.

**Positives**  
- Minimizes strain during heavy lifting.  
- Protects sensitive flooring.   
- Lightweight but highly durable materials.  
- Versatile for both home and office use.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The straps, while functional, can be a little challenging to adjust for angle-specific moves.  
- Some wobbliness occurs when pulling very narrow furniture due to the slider‚Äôs width.  

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other furniture sliders I‚Äôve used, such as some simple felt-based pads, these far outperform in terms of durability and ease of movement. While felt pads work okay for smaller, lighter objects, they don‚Äôt offer the versatility or strap support included here. Competitors like multi-directional roller sliders might move items faster, but they don‚Äôt offer nearly the same level of floor protection. That balance of stability, functionality, and safeguarding your flooring gives these sliders a competitive edge.

**Value Assessment**  
Considering their performance and range of use cases, I‚Äôd say the price-point feels justified. Furniture sliders can sometimes seem unnecessary until you‚Äôve got back pain from moving something heavier than anticipated. These balance affordability with features like high-quality material, smooth flooring protection, and adaptability that you can actually feel are worth the investment. Whether you move things around frequently or just need them as a part of a moving kit, they‚Äôre a smart purchase.

Let me introduce myself again as I am back into looking for people. 

My name is Lauren and I am from the Dayton, OH area. I know I was looking for a while, but I am trying to find the right person as it‚Äôs hard for my age nowadays. I don‚Äôt want someone to just hook up with or someone who either wastes my time or doesn‚Äôt want a relationship after all. 

I am a metalhead as well as a huge nerd. I love Ghost, Iron Maiden, DND, ren faires, coffee, and many more! I make DND dice and have my own dice jewerly business. 

I love to go out and explore new places like I am a huge foodie and like to explore to hidden gems. I am also agnostic and somewhat of a socialist.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a S√ºper Lig spectacle where the underdog isn‚Äôt just under, it‚Äôs *underwater*. On August 31, 2025, Alanyaspor hosts Be≈üikta≈ü in a clash that bookmakers have turned into a math problem only a spreadsheet could love. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a referee‚Äôs red card and the humor of a player tripping over their own shoelaces‚Ä¶ *again*.

---

### The Odds: A Statistical Farce

The numbers here are so lopsided, even a blindfolded statistician would side-eye them. At **FanDuel**, Alanyaspor is priced at **+1.02 decimal odds** (98% implied probability). For context, that‚Äôs like betting the sun will rise tomorrow. Be≈üikta≈ü? A staggering **+101.0** (0.99% chance), which is basically the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúBet on this if you enjoy losing money to a vending machine that keeps your snacks.‚Äù DraftKings and BetMGM only double down on the absurdity, giving Alanyaspor a 100% and 99% chance to win, respectively. Even Bovada, the lone voice of reason, only gives Alanyaspor a 66.67% shot‚Äîstill enough to make Be≈üikta≈ü feel like the third wheel at a couple‚Äôs massage.

Why the disconnect? Well, Alanyaspor‚Äôs recent form is as sturdy as a Turkish coffee table (unmoving, unshakable), while Be≈üikta≈ü just underwent a managerial coup. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer exited after a 1-0 Conference League loss, replaced by Sergen Yal√ßƒ±n, who now has the unenviable task of turning around a team that looks like it forgot to pack its A-game.

### The News: Be≈üikta≈ü‚Äôs New Coach and Alanyaspor‚Äôs ‚ÄúMystery‚Äù Lineup

Be≈üikta≈ü‚Äôs starting XI under Yal√ßƒ±n? A Rorschach test. Will they be the team that shock

It's about time I bust out of this self-imposed shell and meet new people both online and IRL!

I honestly don't know how to describe myself other than I'm a bit of a homebody who wants a relaxed existence and enjoys the simple things in life (hiking, exploring coffee shops, etc), so here's a list of random facts about me:

-Every day after work, I take my Staffy mix dog to a wooded park along the Mississippi River to let her run to her heart's content. 

-I'm the most over-educated blue collar guy you'll ever meet. After working in biomedicine for 13 years, having a PhD in a biomedical field (yes, I'm technically a doctor), and a failed stint in the private sector, I started my own lawn care business that's growing faster than I ever thought it would!

-Most people would consider my hobbies to be complete opposites. I'm a Trekkie, DnD fan, and I want to get back into cosplay. At the same time, I like tinkering with small engines, restoring lawn mowers, and looking up how to get better lawn stripes with my zero-turn mower.

-Favorite TV shows include Supernatural, Wednesday, Suits, Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, Star Trek TNG (trying to start DS9, but that first season is just terrible), Beastars, Avatar, Stranger Things, and Inside Job. Also, The Orville is my favorite Star Trek series ü§£

-I'm a guy with long-hair, guess what my favorite music genre is?

-I will talk your ear off about world mythology. My favorite is Aztec. 

-As far as what I look like, [here are some photos of me](https://imgur.com/a/XqqTndC)

*Green flags:*

-I've been to therapy and I want to go again. I think it's given me plenty of emotional intelligence and good communication skills

-I think I'm empathetic, even to a fault. When I'm out at work or running errands, I get anxious about leaving my dog at home. I think I may have more separation anxiety than her üòÖ

-I pay close attention to my health. Last year, I lost 60lbs during my weight loss journey, and I've managed to keep it off over a year later!

-I love dogs! I plan to have a few acres in the future and have as many dogs as I (legally) can!

*Possible deal breakers:*

-I'm 5'6. However, I don't care if you're shorter or taller than me

-I'm child-free. Not that I hate children; I just don't see myself being a father. I plan to get a vasectomy by the end of this year

-I have debts, but I'm slowly working on them and on my credit score. 

-I have a ""high body count"" due to wanting to explore in college. However, I tried to be as ethical about it as possible; I always used protection, I never got involved with people in monogamous relationships, and I never tried to be deceitful about it.

-I'm pansexual/demisexual. I don't think it's a dealbreaker, but I've been rejected before because of it.

*What I'm looking for in terms of relationships:* 

-Honestly, I would like a friendship that will eventually turn romantic. If not, I at least hope to make some lasting friendships!

-Physically, as long as you're at least height-weight proportionate, you're good.

But my partner makes me feel awful, sad and depressed. 

For example.   
I had to leave my job early, take the tram, then the bus, cut it short, go into the market and buy food, hurry to school pick all kids up, rush them home, cook them a snack/dinner, start the real dinner, while plucking in and emptying the dishwasher... In the mean time I put on a cup of coffee, put all the freeze items in the freezer, the cold opnes in the fridge and I left 3 packets of nudles on the kitchen bench...

She comes home and she dosent say hello, or how do you do, nor gives me a hug, she walks in and blast out, telling me off for leaving three packets of noodles and not putting them into the cupboard. 

This is quite often... she comes home and finds a fault and lets me have it.  
  
I do not even find her kind anymore, not to me nor to our kids. She is not a bad woman, she dont do drugs or is violent or is any odd troubles, she just aint kind.   
  
She do not always yell, but its a big sigh, or speaking to herself how bad I am, mumbling, like talking to higher powers while complainting about me. I find it so offputting and hurtful.  
  
Not that our relationship is good either, she is happy as is. She do not care if she outs on 100 pounds, while I hit the gym to stay in shape. I even mention to her I want us as a family to eat healthier I get a lecture on body shaming or she is happy with her size and so on and on...  
  
After we had our first thats when she didnt want intimacy anymore. We do it maybe 3 times a year and it feels more like a chore than anything else and I dont even find her attractive anymore, not because she added a lot of weight but that she is so unkind and so aggressive towards me.

For my latest beans, the machine seems to settle on grind size 10, except when it is actually set to 10. When making espresso on size 10, it recommends 4-5 after. Making the next coffee on grind size 9 then recommends 10 again after. This loop repeats itself.

This is my first time to engage with a client from UK. Bare with me, mahaba itong kwento ko. Grab some popcorn or coffee.

* The actual hiring process was totally different from the published steps in the job post. Initially, there's a practical test which is actual tasks a PM which I spent more than 5 hours to complete. Then if I pass, there will be a GMeets call. The call didn't happen but I was informed that there will be additional assessment needed, a ""paid test"". - **1st red flag yung biglang may scope creep agad sa hiring process pa lang,** pinalampas ko kasi ""paid test"" naman daw, 7USD/hr max of 6hrs.
* And so I took the ‚Äúpaid test‚Äù. However, the test is not entirely a PM task but more like a systems implementation and setup, strategic rather than tactical tasks na yung pinagawa for an outreach campaign using Apollo and LinkedIn. **2nd red flag the test is beyond a PM's responsibility based on the original job post.** Took me more than 6hrs to complete the ""paid test"" which includes creating a full implementation plan, risk analysis, templates, even work management structure, comms plan ‚Äî but after I submitted, the CEO never mentioned payment for the supposed ""paid test"". But he did inform me that he will hire me. So I didn't follow up the payment since 42USD lang naman, I assumed it will be included in my first payout. 
* He scheduled a Zoom call with me to discuss the ""offer"". He didn't open the camera which is weird, first time ko maexperience na yung interviewer ang ayaw ng open cam. And during the call, intermittent ang audio nya, hihina then lalakas ang boses nya, it seemed paalis-alis sya sa tapat ng computer nya while we are discussing. Then I asked for a written job offer with deliverables, responsibilities, and the equivalent rates sabi ko for me to better assess the offer. Never got one. - **3rd red flag, a major one!** He said, he will just draft a contract. 
* **4th red flag** Delayed submission of contract for signing kesyo may sakit daw ang anak nya. At this point, nilalaro ko na lang ang pagsagot sa kanya kasi alam ko ng hindi sya maayos na kausap. He initially committed to send the contract mid last week, kasi target start date ko daw ay Sep 1st but they sent it Saturday, Aug 30th, weekend na. *""They""* na kasi yung wife ni founder ang finance and admin, she got involved na, as she is preparing the contract, dalawa na silang kausap ko. Then they pressured me to review it over the weekend and sign it para on track daw ang start date ko on the 1st. Actually, ang messaging nga nila, *sign the contract* hindi *review and sign*. 48 pages yung contract but dati naman akong nagrereview na ng contracts with vendors and contractors so madali lang naman. After they sent the contract they bombarded me with follow-ups to sign, natawa na lang ako kasi parang scammer, ang lakas makapressure. Then as I went throught the contract, I found something disappointing, nanganak na lalo yung responsibility stipulated sa contract versus on what was included in the original job post plus what we had agreed verbally. It included na *""review responsibilities of the CEO and identify which can be transferred to the PM and help the CEO plan future needs of the company*"" so parang EA and consultant na yung role ko on top of being a PM. Tapos pinakanakakakulo ng dugo is the rate, kinalahati yung original rate kasi magstart na lang daw muna as part-time. Despite these, I acted professionally and stayed polite in communicating with them. I positioned myself to negotiate, so I asked for clarifications, I've listed down all findings from the contract and presented it to them. (Just to add lang, even the payout sched, gusto monthly which during the call, I insisted for a bi-monthly payout which he approved, pero sa contract, hindi nakareflect). Still no response na from them, but I doubt they will provide my asks. Saka ayoko na din.  
* **5th red flag** \- The rate? So low it was below PH standard rates for Project Managers even lower than entry level PM. Lowballing at its finest si mate.
* Then as I go on reviewing the contract, meron pang indemnity/insurance clauses shifted all risks to me, that I will be responsible for all potential fees, cost of damage, etc. and that I will indemnify the company for all of that. Then I also need to purchase an insurance to cover the risk exposure of the company. **6th red flag**, major ito especially, a PM's role is highly dependent sa output ng collaborators which there will be times that it will be uncontrollable by the PM and even the CEO/Founder. Pano kung palpak talaga ang collaborators - gross negligence or let's say isabotahe yung operations intentionally, ako lang ang mananagot? Naurr!

What struck me the most is he is a Founder/CEO with thousands of followers on LinkedIn, seen as an influencer, a trailblazer in his field. His company's website brags testimonials from big global brands. In fairness, his company is doing good and the vision is there which is another reason why I pursued my application despite the signs.

  
My Takeaways:

* Trust the red flags. If something feels off in the hiring process (always changing, scope expanding), it will likely be worse once you're inside.
* A ""paid test"" that turns into unpaid work is exploitation.
* A late, vague or inconsistent contract shows lack of respect.
* Value your worth. If their offer for your role is less than the PH rates, walk away. They are already saving a lot for getting top notch talents from PH for a very lower rate than their local talents. And yet they will offer you rates lower than PH entry level? 
* Don't confuse influence with leadership. Thousands of followers doesn't mean they'll be a good manager or a fair employer.
* Gratitude in disguise. Despite the disappointment, I'm still thankful for the experience. I was able to dodged a bullet and I found out after all these years, I still have my contracts review skills in tact and I still know how to nudge people when it comes to negotiation. The nego didn't directly favored me yet (I'll update y'all), but I think I was able to stand my ground and prevented myself to be victimized by this opportunistic CEO. 

I have an interview on Tuesday with a founder and co-founder also from UK. I hope not all from UK are BS, but if they are, then I know how to spot the red flags and avoid them.

To those who are still looking for the right opportunity, you are not alone. Just keep on trying, build your portfolio and continue upskilling. That way, you will know your worth and have the leverage to negotiate for the value you truly deserve. Don't settle for less if you truly know who you are and what you can do. Anak ka ng nanay at tatay mo! Hindi sila naghirap palakihin ka para lang abusuhin at lamangan ng ibang tao. Laban lang! Cheers!",3,1756671097.0,buhaydigital,3,1.0,False
