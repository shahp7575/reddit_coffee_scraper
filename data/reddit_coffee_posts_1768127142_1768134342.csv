1q9y0gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q9y0gf/aio_my_girlfriend_wakes_me_up_on_my_days_off/,AIO my girlfriend wakes me up on my days off,"My (29m) girlfriend (30f) and I have been together for 7 years. There has always been some tension about how much I sleep. In 2022, she switched to the weekend shift at her job and has to be at work at 6 am. It wasn't a big deal at first. We had opposite work schedules, but for the most part, we respected each other's sleep as we got ready in the morning. Then, a year or two ago, because we both worked Mondays, she started waking up with me at 4. We would both get up and eat breakfast together, and then I would leave. Then she started waking up at 4 am on Saturdays and Sundays too. I didn't think this would be a problem, but she started waking me up too. 

It started with her just turning on the bedroom light and watching a show while she ate breakfast and had coffee. It wasn't the end of the world, and I could usually sleep through it. Then she started waking me up to let the dogs out and feed them so she could focus on getting herself ready in the morning. I didn't really understand why it was necessary for me to do it because she was giving herself an hour and a half to get ready, but I didn't argue. I would get up, take care of the dogs, and go back to sleep. Some days, I would be so exhausted from the day before that I would sleep through her alarm and the lights and TV coming on, at which point she would get angry with me for making her have to take care of the dogs on top of her morning routine. Then she began demanding that I spend time with her in the morning. After she ate breakfast, she would jump into bed and start cuddling me. I'm not anti-cuddling my girlfriend, but when it's 4 in the morning on a Saturday, and you have fresh coffee breath suddenly invading your nostrils while you get shook around by someone trying to force you to wake up, it's hard not to have a negative reaction.

I've tried talking to her about it. I've expressed dozens of times in a dozen ways that I want to sleep on my days off, and that I don't want to be up at 4 am every day of the week. She always responds with one of a few responses. ""You can go back to bed after I leave."" ""I just want to spend time with you because we only get a couple of hours together at the end of the day."" ""Everyone is tired in the morning. You just have to deal with it."" Regardless of her response, every time I say something, it ends in a fight, with her saying she wishes I liked spending time with her and loved her more.

It's getting to the point where I'm considering ending the relationship because I'm constantly tired. ",1,1768134018.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Got it for like ten bucks at some random store, and I’ve had it for probably eight years now. Been through dishwashers, drops, even left it on a roof once when I forgot it in the car. Still works perfectly, no leaks, no weird smells, just solid.

Another one would be my basic nylon backpack. Paid maybe twenty bucks, used it daily through college, work, hikes, you name it. Zippers are still fine, straps haven’t frayed, and it’s surprisingly roomy. People always ask why I don’t get a fancy bag, and honestly, this thing has outlasted all of them.

I think the key is simple, sturdy materials and not overcomplicating things. Sometimes the cheap stuff is built to last because it’s designed to do one thing well, instead of trying to impress with features.

I’m debating replacing everything with a Baratza Encore ESP, or keeping the OXO for her and adding a small dedicated grinder (like a Lagom Mini) for me and the 1-2 shots I pull a day.

My main question is: Is the ESP actually viable for switching back and forth daily? Specifically, if I leave the hopper full for her drip, then clear it to single-dose my espresso, is the retention and dial-twisting going to be a nightmare?

[In Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EdgeUsers/comments/1q02obd/god_of_prompt_is_a_scam_an_osint_investigation/), I documented how God of Prompt operates a sophisticated fraud infrastructure:

* **Estonian shell company** for anonymity
* **Fake San Francisco HQ** with zero employees
* **New York address** that belongs to beehiiv (an email platform)
* **178K Twitter followers** that generate only 100-1,500 YouTube views
* **$8,000+ ""value""** products built on copy-pasted ""Take a deep breath"" prompts

I thought that was the end of it.

Then I received this message:

https://preview.redd.it/m791g8gnipcg1.jpg?width=1474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=416ca433bd102fc4d8869a0860532b86926b4ef1

>*""What will it take you to take down this reddit post?""*

No factual rebuttal. No evidence to counter my claims. Just an offer to negotiate deletion.

# Dear Alex,

If you hadn't sent that message, this article wouldn't exist.

But you did, and I got curious again. I decided to take another look at your website—specifically, at those glowing customer testimonials proudly displayed on your homepage.

Your site asks visitors: **""Will You Be The Next Success Story?""**

https://preview.redd.it/qpseyq4yipcg1.jpg?width=1539&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3b90b8580fd6c7e60448f17c268da2b7c72f97

Accompanied by a carousel of smiling faces—satisfied customers who transformed their lives with your prompts.

**What I found was remarkable.**

There are no success stories. There never were any.

Every single reviewer on your site appears to be a fabricated person.

Let me show you.

# The Parade of Fictional Customers

Your website proudly displays: **""Loved by Business Owners""** with a row of smiling faces and a badge claiming **""25K+""** satisfied customers.Let's meet these business owners.

**TL;DR: Not a single one of them is real.**

I examined each profile photo. Here's what the files reveal:

# 1. Lyndi Betony — The Confession

https://preview.redd.it/kjvl0tqrjpcg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=941e845aa560c486bcc5acdbaede02e04688f0ea

**Filename:** `thispersondoesnotexist.com-2.avif`

This is not a mistake. This is not a coincidence.

[ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) is a famous website that generates AI faces using GANs. You downloaded an image from there—and **didn't even rename the file**.

The filename literally declares: *""This person does not exist.""*

And you used it as a customer testimonial.

# 2. Guiying Juan — The Impossible Name

https://preview.redd.it/1rc3x6bwjpcg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0ade59e29a1986e2badb577a466fd3a2a5bb49f

Filename: rev2.avif

""Guiying Juan"" is presented as a satisfied customer with the handle @anxsolutions.

The problem: **This name is structurally impossible in Chinese.**

* 桂英 (Guiying) = Female given name
* 娟 (Juan) = Female given name
* No surname present

This is like naming someone ""Tom John""—two first names slapped together with no family name. Anyone who actually knows Chinese naming conventions would never create this combination.

The photo shows a **middle-aged East Asian man**. The name is feminine. And if you look closely—**one ear is crushed and malformed**, and his **lips are melting into his front teeth**. The boundary between mouth and teeth simply doesn't exist.

Also notable: **1024×1024 resolution**—the default output size of AI image generators like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E.

# 3. Lukáš Valerie — Another Broken Name

https://preview.redd.it/5qhnibi6kpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88ef1c30ff0ffcb9a7f8ff7b71e45da93707ae1d

**Filename:** `rev16.avif`

* Lukáš = Czech male name
* Valerie = English female name
* No surname

The ""16"" in the filename suggests this was the **16th revision**. You rejected 15 faces before settling on this one.

# 4. Thomas James — ""Juts Bought""

https://preview.redd.it/d9j80t48kpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c3e59c167be762b23ced714b17515a98c1d7365

**Filename:** `rev6.avif`

His review contains:

>""Juts bought the God Mode ChatGPT!!""

""Juts"" instead of ""Just.""

The God of Prompt—selling prompt expertise for $97-199—didn't run their own testimonial through ChatGPT to check for typos.

# 5. John Tanner — The Wrong File

https://preview.redd.it/czaxj69ckpcg1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52c2225f73bcafee858b7895c9729b9b196c30d4

**Filename:** `josephwhite.avif`

The displayed name is ""John Tanner."" The filename says ""Joseph White.""

You couldn't even keep track of which fake name goes with which fake face.

But let's examine the image itself: This boss in his silky suit is having a rough day. His ear has collapsed into an anatomical impossibility—crushed and malformed. His oversized tie defies physics, jutting outward as if trying to escape his chest.

And here's a fun detail: **there's no door handle on the rear passenger side.** This man is trapped in a luxury car with no exit.

Actually, given the camera angle, whoever took this photo would have to be sitting where the driver's seat should be. I suppose they removed the entire front half of the car for this shot?

# 6. Alex Grant — The American Flag Test

https://preview.redd.it/0v07t3eekpcg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28a4921af3190704f71213a4ac2a079610243beb

**Filename:** `alexgrant.avif`

https://preview.redd.it/hq3dzl4hkpcg1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c475d41abddcab4bc02bfccc029864e923b59d82

This man is drinking coffee from a cup the size of a flower vase, in a space that can't decide if it's indoors or outdoors.

Before worrying about prompt engineering, he should probably clean up the clutter around him—piles of objects that seem to defy gravity, stacked in ways that physics doesn't normally allow. And that **warped drawer** behind him? I don't know where you buy furniture that bends like that, but it might be time for a replacement.

The image contains multiple AI generation artifacts:

* **American flag in background**: Wrong number of stripes. Real flag has 13 stripes (7 red, 6 white). This one doesn't.
* **Sign reading ""CA.AN""**: Meaningless text—AI attempted to generate ""AMERICAN"" or similar and failed.
* **Hands**: Fingers appear fused and anatomically incorrect.
* **MacBook**: Apple logo at physically impossible angle.

Resolution: **1024×1024**—AI generator default.

# 7. Betie J. — The Spelling Error

https://preview.redd.it/v7k918wmkpcg1.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=212b8b070d3779fcde64a18f3bbb302250fc7818

**Filename:** `betanie.avif`

Displayed as ""Betie J."" but the filename says ""betanie""—neither of which is the standard spelling of ""Bethany.""

The balloons in the background show classic AI distortion.

# 8. Josh Reid — The Typo and Mismatch

https://preview.redd.it/66jans8tkpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=824eefee099c1ca43fffcd5527d8cbd0d368830e

**Filename:** `josshtanner_reviews_gop.avif`

* Displayed name: Josh Reid
* Filename: ""Jossh**tanner**"" (not Reid, and ""Josh"" misspelled as ""Jossh"")

Another case of losing track of your own fake identities.

As for the image: Is this man about to play golf naked, or dive into a pool with his cap on? I genuinely can't tell.

One thing I can tell: **his face and upper body are completely out of proportion.** The head is adult-sized, but the shoulders belong to a child. How convenient that the circular crop cuts off exactly where the anatomy would become obviously impossible.

# 9-10. Darina Laura & Katie Jimenez — Giving Up on Names

https://preview.redd.it/fdujt3qxkpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c2abc19ab03dba43774f198597dc1ed1e58492e

https://preview.redd.it/o28s54bzkpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba034705576efacbbf707260c096d2ea21e9e6be

**Filenames:** `3223.avif` and `2342949323.avif`

You stopped even trying to name the files. Just random numbers.

Both names follow the same broken pattern: two given names, no surname.

# 11. Unknown Woman — The Telegram Import

https://preview.redd.it/8qrh9311lpcg1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e0550495571dc7803cf9e8c66cdf5833cc21a21

**Filename:** `photo_2023-09-21_01-07-07.avif`

This filename format—`photo_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`—is **Telegram's default export naming convention**.

You pulled this image from someone's Telegram chat on September 21, 2023, at 01:07:07, and uploaded it directly as a ""customer.""

The image shows:

* A seat with **no headrest**
* A **warped door frame with no handle**—good luck getting out
* Background sign reading ""EINCOL TERIACY""—AI-generated nonsense text
* Resolution: **640×640**—Telegram's default

# 12. Vanya Korolyov — Version 2

https://preview.redd.it/4piecpn3lpcg1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae2b74117961a106da6b00d12f06ade2b023df0b

**Filename:** `vanyekorolov2.avif`

The ""2"" indicates the first version was rejected.

This Russian gentleman has chosen to pose in what appears to be a silky smooth suit, standing before a **massive houseplant** for his professional headshot. An interesting aesthetic choice.

# 13. Lucas Kendall — The Handle Mismatch

https://preview.redd.it/1e5oh0k6lpcg1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f089646e4bc103db941ad03db50fd4e888f695c9

**Filename:** `lucas_kendall.avif`

English name. But the displayed Twitter handle is **@vverev**—a Russian-style username.

The ear in this image has an unnatural orange/red coloration that doesn't match any realistic lighting scenario. His shirt collar is partially **flipped inside-out**—sloppy for a professional photo. And that plant on the left, next to some **bizarre foreign-style architecture**? It's **abnormally tall**, stretching upward with the desperate energy of an AI that doesn't understand how houseplants work.

# 14-16. The Assembly Line

https://preview.redd.it/vb3gj1tclpcg1.jpg?width=100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d715b241834a3e8f20b2ede8835034c375ba12e

**Filenames:** `rev1.avif`, `fernando1.avif`, `katherine-reviews_gop.avif`

The naming convention is curious:

* `rev1`, `rev2`, `rev6`, `rev16` — revision numbers. Did it take 16 attempts before they found a face they liked? Or is this just how they organize their... inventory?
* `fernando1` — First Fernando. Is there a Fernando 2 somewhere?
* `_reviews_gop` — Internal tagging for ""reviews, God of Prompt""

Whatever the explanation, these aren't customers. They're **catalog items**.

# The Infrastructure of Deception

Using Wappalyzer, I analyzed your website's technology stack:

**Marketing & Tracking (6+ tools):**

* Google Analytics GA4
* Microsoft Clarity
* Facebook Pixel
* LinkedIn Insight Tag
* Plausible
* DoubleClick Floodlight
* Google Tag Manager

**Email Automation:**

* Sendinblue (now Brevo)

**Affiliate System:**

* Tolt

**Site Construction:**

* Webflow (no-code)
* Wized (no-code)
* MemberStack

You invested heavily in **tracking and selling**. Minimal investment in **product quality**.

# The Email Bombardment

Your response to my article claimed:

>""several emails a day? Not happening""

My inbox tells a different story:

**55 emails from November 29 to January 10** — that's 43 days.

Subject lines follow classic psychological pressure templates:

* ""last chance"" (multiple times)
* ""it's almost gone""
* ""You're About to Regret This Email""
* ""F\*ck being broke""
* ""I hacked wealth""

These aren't newsletters. These are **Sendinblue drip campaigns** designed to exploit FOMO and anxiety.

The ""Day 1:"", ""Day 2:"", ""Day 3:"" pattern in some emails confirms automated sequencing—exactly what Sendinblue is designed for.

# Bonus: The Suspended Reviewer

On [godofprompt.ai/ai-prompt-generator](https://www.godofprompt.ai/ai-prompt-generator), there's a review dated **January 13, 2025** from a user with the handle [@ihteshamit](https://x.com/ihteshamit).

That account is now **suspended by Twitter/X**.

I'm not saying these two facts are related. I'm just noting them.

# A Note on Defamation

Alex, you may think I'm damaging your reputation.

I'm not.

**I haven't defamed God of Prompt. But you have—or rather, whoever ""you"" are.**

Defamation requires false statements. Everything in this article is:

1. Documented with screenshots
2. Verifiable by anyone who inspects your website
3. Preserved in third-party archives

Your filenames confess. Your fake names collapse under basic cultural knowledge. Your testimonials cite non-existent people from ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.

**I'm just reading what you wrote.**

# Final Question: Alex, Who Are You?

https://preview.redd.it/o2m1r7dqlpcg1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbfb33ab094e4d454d19bc2d881a897903f029cd

**Filename:** `Alex_GodofPrompt_12.avif`

The ""12"" suggests this was the twelfth version. You rejected eleven before choosing this one.

No surname. An English first name for an Estonian-registered, Czech-operated company claiming San Francisco headquarters.

I've found video of you on X. So you do exist—or at least, someone calling themselves ""Alex"" exists. Whether that's your real name, I have no idea.

But here's what I do know:

**Your business is built on fiction and deception.**

Fake customers. Fake testimonials. Fake follower counts. Fake addresses. Fake reviews. And now, demonstrably fake faces downloaded from ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.

You're real, Alex. Your business isn't.

# For Those Who Already Purchased

If you bought products from God of Prompt:

1. **Request a refund** within their stated 7-day window
2. If refused, **dispute the charge** with your credit card company
3. Report to the **FTC** at reportfraud.ftc.gov
4. Leave honest reviews on **Trustpilot** to warn others

# A Note on Evidence Preservation

All evidence referenced in this article—including website snapshots, image files, and HTML source code—has been preserved in **multiple independent third-party archives** with timestamps predating this publication.

Any future modifications to the God of Prompt website will only create a documented record of evidence tampering.

# Conclusion

The God of Prompt doesn't use prompts.

They couldn't be bothered to:

* Run ""Guiying Juan"" through ChatGPT to check if it's a real Chinese name
* Fix ""Juts bought"" before publishing
* Rename `thispersondoesnotexist.com-2.avif`
* Keep track of which fake name matches which fake face

They sell AI expertise they don't possess, using testimonials from people who don't exist, through a company that hides behind Estonian anonymity, claiming an address that belongs to someone else.

**The God of Prompt is a faithful user of ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.**

That's the most honest thing about them.

1q9xowy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1q9xowy/how_to_confidently_date_women_you_want_the/,How to Confidently Date Women You Want: The Psychology That Actually Works (Without Being That Guy),"Studied hundreds of dating experts, psychologists, and real case studies for months. Here's what actually works (and why most advice sucks).

The dating advice industry is a cesspool. It's either pickup artist nonsense that makes you look like a creep, or generic ""be yourself"" platitudes that help nobody. Spent way too much time going down rabbit holes - research papers on attachment theory, evolutionary psychology studies, therapy sessions, way too many podcast episodes. Talked to women about what actually works versus what makes them uncomfortable.

Most guys struggle because nobody taught them this stuff. Your dad probably didn't sit you down for real talk. School definitely didn't cover it. Society sends mixed signals about masculinity. And dating apps have made everything weird and transactional. But here's the thing, confidence with women isn't some genetic lottery. It's a skill you build through understanding psychology and taking action despite fear.

**1. fix your foundation first (nobody talks about this part)**

You can't attract healthy relationships when you're a mess internally. Women pick up on insecurity like sharks smell blood. Not trying to be harsh but it's true.

Read Attached by Amir Levine. Neuroscientist and psychiatrist who breaks down attachment theory in relationships. Won multiple awards and it's the best book on understanding why you're attracted to certain people and why your relationships follow patterns. This book will make you question everything about your dating history. Shows you whether you're anxious, avoidant or secure in relationships and how that affects literally every interaction you have.

Work on your mental health genuinely. Try ash, it's basically like having a relationship coach in your pocket. Gives you personalized advice on communication, understanding emotions, working through insecurity. Way cheaper than therapy and actually helpful for dating specific situations.

**2. understand what confidence actually means (hint: not what you think)**

Real confidence isn't loud. It's not walking up to ten women a night at bars. It's being comfortable with who you are, flaws included. It's knowing rejection won't destroy you because your self worth isn't dependent on external validation.

Here's what actually happened after reading Models by Mark Manson (yes that Mark Manson who wrote the subtle art). Dude has a background in psychology and spent years in the dating advice world before calling out its toxicity. The book basically argues that attractiveness comes from vulnerability and honesty, not tricks or manipulation. Genuinely changed how i approach dating. Teaches you to polarize, meaning be authentic enough that some women won't like you but the right ones will be very interested.

Confidence also means having standards. Too many guys are so desperate for female attention they'll tolerate disrespect or pursue someone clearly wrong for them. Ironically, having boundaries and being willing to walk away makes you more attractive.

**3. develop actual conversational skills (beyond small talk hell)**

Most guys bomb conversations because they either interview women with boring questions or talk about themselves nonstop. Neither works.

The trick is curiosity plus storytelling. Ask open ended questions then actually listen to answers. When something interesting comes up, dig deeper. ""Oh you're into pottery? What drew you to that?"" not ""cool cool so where do you work?""

Share stories that reveal personality. Not bragging about accomplishments but funny observations, mild self deprecating humor, things you're genuinely excited about. Emotional resonance matters way more than impressing someone.

Watching Charisma on Command youtube channel helped weirdly. They break down body language, tonality, conversation flow using examples from movies and interviews. Makes social dynamics way easier to understand when you see it analyzed frame by frame.

**4. make your intent clear early (the friend zone is real and avoidable)**

Biggest mistake guys make is hiding romantic interest and hoping friendship magically turns into attraction. Doesn't work that way.

If you're interested in someone romantically, make that obvious through flirting, asking them on actual dates (use the word date), light appropriate touching if there's mutual interest. Creates sexual tension which is necessary for romantic relationships.

This doesn't mean being aggressive or pushy. Just clear. ""I think you're interesting and i'd like to take you out sometime"" is a thousand times better than ""so uh maybe we could hang out as friends and see what happens possibly idk.""

**5. handle rejection like a functional human**

You'll get rejected. Often probably. Every guy does no matter how attractive or successful. It's literally just statistics and compatibility.

The difference between guys who succeed and guys who give up is how they process rejection. Don't take it personally (easier said than done i know). She's not rejecting your entire existence as a human. Maybe she's in a relationship. Maybe you're not her type. Maybe timing sucks. Maybe she's dealing with her own issues.

Respond gracefully. ""No worries, thanks for being honest"" then move on with your life. Don't argue, don't ask why, don't suddenly insult her. That behavior is how you earn a reputation as that guy nobody wants to be around.

Journal your experiences. Insight timer has guided meditations specifically for processing rejection and building resilience. Sounds soft but mental resilience is what separates confident guys from bitter ones.

**6. stop consuming garbage dating advice (seriously)**

The manosphere is poison. Redpill stuff, alpha male nonsense, pickup artist tactics, it's all based on viewing women as obstacles to overcome rather than humans to connect with. Creates adversarial dynamics that make dating miserable for everyone.

Instead listen to podcasts like where should we begin with esther perel. She's a psychotherapist who works with couples and discusses real relationship dynamics. Helps you understand how healthy relationships actually function, what women value, communication patterns that work.

Or read come as you are by emily nagoski. About female sexuality written by a sex educator with a phd. Most guys are clueless about how women experience attraction and arousal. This book explains the science in accessible language. Makes you way better at understanding signals and creating comfort.

If you want something more structured and personalized for building genuine confidence with women, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been helpful. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from resources like the books and research I mentioned above, plus dating psychology experts and real success stories, then turns them into personalized audio content.

You tell it your specific dating goal, like ""become more confident approaching women as an introvert"" or ""overcome fear of rejection in dating,"" and it creates an adaptive learning plan just for you. The depth is customizable too, from quick 10-minute summaries when you're short on time to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples and strategies when you want to go deeper. Makes it way easier to internalize this stuff during your commute or at the gym instead of having to sit down and read.

**7. work on yourself for real (not just to get women)**

This sounds cliche but it's true. Develop hobbies and passions. Get in decent shape. Build a career you're proud of. Cultivate friendships. Travel if possible. Become genuinely interesting.

Women are attracted to men who have full lives they're excited about, not guys whose entire existence revolves around finding a girlfriend. Desperation repels people. Abundance mentality (having lots going on) attracts them.

Use an app like finch to build better habits. It's a self care pet game that helps you track goals and build routines. Sounds childish but gamification actually works for habit formation.

**8. understand the difference between confidence and arrogance**

Confident guys are secure enough to admit mistakes, ask questions, show vulnerability, and genuinely care about others. Arrogant guys need constant validation, can't handle criticism, dominate conversations, and view everything as competition.

Women can tell the difference immediately. Confidence is attractive because it signals emotional stability and self awareness. Arrogance is repulsive because it signals insecurity masked by bravado.

Practice self awareness. When you're about to do something ask yourself, am i doing this because i genuinely believe it or because i'm trying to impress someone? Honesty with yourself builds real confidence over time.

**9. learn to read and respect signals**

Some guys struggle because they miss obvious interest. Others struggle because they don't recognize disinterest and keep pushing.

Signs of interest include asking questions back, laughing at your jokes, finding excuses to extend conversation, open body language, initiating contact. Signs of disinterest include short responses, looking away constantly, mentioning other guys, creating physical distance.

If you're not sure, escalate slightly and watch the response. Suggest moving to a quieter area or getting coffee sometime. Her reaction tells you everything. Enthusiastic yes means interest. Maybe or hesitation means no. Actual no definitely means no.

Respect boundaries always. Persistence isn't romantic, it's harassment if she's clearly not interested. There's literally billions of women in the world, you don't need to convince one specific person.

**10. put yourself in positions to meet people**

Confidence means nothing if you never talk to women. Join clubs, take classes, go to social events, try hobby groups, use dating apps intelligently.

Dating apps can work but treat them as supplementary not primary. Also get good photos (ask a female friend for honest feedback), write a bio that shows personality not just lists interests, and actually start conversations beyond ""hey.""

Real life is better for building genuine connections though. Shared activities create natural conversation topics and let personality shine through. Rock climbing gym, book club, volunteering, whatever aligns with your interests.

The mental shift that helped most was reframing approaching women. It's not about success or failure. It's about giving someone the opportunity to meet you. If they're interested, awesome. If not, you've lost nothing and gained experience.

Stop waiting for perfect confidence before taking action. Action builds confidence, not the other way around. You'll never feel completely ready. Just start conversations. Make your intentions clear. Handle outcomes gracefully. Repeat until it feels natural.

Nobody's born knowing this stuff. Every confident guy you see built that through experience, probably embarrassed himself a bunch, definitely got rejected more than he succeeded. Difference is he kept going anyway.

We were taught empathy. We were told to work hard. We were told that if you played fair, stayed curious, and didn’t screw people over, you could build a good life. Not a billionaire fantasy, just stable, meaningful, dignified.



Because that’s what the generation before us had.



And now it feels like they lied. Or maybe they didn’t, but they handed us a rulebook that no longer applies.



I grew up in a decent middle-class family. Nothing fancy, but safe. That life is gone for me now. I’m not middle class anymore. I have siblings who married into wealth, and because I didn’t, I’m quietly treated like the one who “fell behind.” Same upbringing. Same values. Totally different outcomes.



I left my home country over a decade ago because it felt impossible to build anything there. Ten years later, things don’t feel better...just different flavors of worse. More expensive. More precarious. More exhausting.



I did everything “right.” I worked corporate jobs. Three of them. All for large American companies. I worked in tech, helping people start digital businesses. Except the truth was: only the big customers mattered. Everyone else was disposable. If you weren’t paying enough, you didn’t really count.



My job was basically to lie politely, deflect angry people, and protect shareholders. And over time, that hollowed me out. I couldn’t do it anymore.



So I jumped ship and left the corporate world for good.



I honestly believed I could build something better, without losing my soull. Something fairer. Something that actually helped people get started without punishing them for being small. I’ve spent years building it. Years of unpaid work, stress, doubt, and hope.



I built it so it costs nothing to get started. You get the tools. You don’t get nickel-and-dimed for existing.



And when I show it to people I used to work with, they don’t get it. They ask why I’m “giving so much away.” They tell me I should charge more. Gate more. Extract more.



That reaction alone tells me everything about how broken this whole thing is.



On top of all that, I have a 3-year-old who has never slept through the night. Not once. I’m permanently exhausted in ways coffee doesn’t touch. I’m trying to build something meaningful while running on fragments of sleep and whatever optimism I have left.



And now I’m stuck failing at the part you’re supposed to win at: getting the word out.



Not because I don’t believe in what I’ve built, but because I’m tired. Bone level tired. Disillusioned. Worn down by years of pushing uphill while the ground keeps sliding backward. My will just isn’t what it used to be.



So I guess I’m asking:



Has anyone else here taken a massive leap of faith back when they still believed what their parents (and society) taught them...only to now feel like those dreams might not even exist anymore unless you earn millions of dollars?



Sorry if this is rambling. I don’t need hustle advice or “charge more” takes. I just want to know if I’m alone in this.



Because I’m tired, boss.",3,1768132611.0,Millennials,7,0.8,False

my parents label these things on me since I was a kid that I'm inattentive, lazy , weak in studies, liar , mood swings , get angry/overwhelmed easily like a cry baby and sensitive ,selfish and unbothered like i hv never take stress any point of my life and I'm lazy( sometimes my anxiety levels r high but most of the time I'm unmotivated I wanna do a particular task but I can't find the motivation to do so) .I'm inattentive (i can't even focus on one to one conversation Ik they r speaking but i can't understand it like nothing make sense like I hear people talking but can't process it properly) , liar&selfish(my parents said i lied a lot and i still do like making up fake scenarios) and hyperactive ready to dance all the time they said it was task to keep me still in superstore cause i used to straight up start dancing even though I was shy yet very  talkative (saying everything in one breath), forgetful( amount of times i hv entered a room and forgot why I was there i did this since I was a kid my parents thought I'm tryna seek attention by saying i forgot what i was asked to bring from the kitchen), talking to myself as a kid(i still do ) and I also used to say ""my teachers speak their own language and i don't understand what she says "" they thought I can't understand because of English medium school but the teacher taught in hindi only it was me who wasn't paying attention.

I even hv low self-esteem and crave validation and reassurance a lot (Sorry i mixed everything up 😭)

After listening to all this habits from my childhood i was confirmed that something is wrong with me but I'll be able to get checked once I'm 18 cause my parents don't believe in this and i highly suspect my grandmother and my father has adhd (he went to a store near our house with scooty and came back without one he forgot that he went with scooty 😭).

I don't know if it is something else or not but i find myself relating to people with ADHD a lot , and my symptoms r too from the childhood they didn't appear not out of nowhere .

Im not trying to self-diagnose, but I genuinely want to understand whether what I experience could be ADHD or something else. Why do I think i strongly think i hv adhd ? My top reasons is all my life i hv been like this my parents, siblings, teachers, friends always described me like this to me right now I'm at lowest point of my life but to people around me I'm the same kid .

my parents label these things on me since I was a kid that I'm inattentive, lazy , weak in studies, liar , mood swings , get angry/overwhelmed easily like a cry baby and sensitive ,selfish and unbothered like i hv never take stress any point of my life and I'm lazy( sometimes my anxiety levels r high but most of the time I'm unmotivated I wanna do a particular task but I can't find the motivation to do so) .I'm inattentive (i can't even focus on one to one conversation Ik they r speaking but i can't understand it like nothing make sense like I hear people talking but can't process it properly) , liar&selfish(my parents said i lied a lot and i still do like making up fake scenarios) and hyperactive ready to dance all the time they said it was task to keep me still in superstore cause i used to straight up start dancing even though I was shy yet very  talkative (saying everything in one breath), forgetful( amount of times i hv entered a room and forgot why I was there i did this since I was a kid my parents thought I'm tryna seek attention by saying i forgot what i was asked to bring from the kitchen), talking to myself as a kid(i still do ) and I also used to say ""my teachers speak their own language and i don't understand what she says "" they thought I can't understand because of English medium school but the teacher taught in hindi only it was me who wasn't paying attention. I was even sensitive to lots of stuff refused to wear undergarments (they were a torture)till I got my period and refused to poop(i still don't like too) 😭🙏 making comments like i don't like the smell . I even have low iron hands r always cold and feet too even in summers nails r blue too. I'm not also good at making friends barely hv anyone to talk to , I avoid eye contact. I even hv low self-esteem and crave validation and reassurance a lot (Sorry i mixed everything up 😭)

After listening to all this habits from my childhood i was confirmed that something is wrong with me but I'll be able to get checked once I'm 18 cause my parents don't believe in this and i highly suspect my grandmother and my father has adhd (he went to a store near our house with scooty and came back without one he forgot that he went with scooty 😭).

I don't know if it is something else or not but i find myself relating to people with ADHD a lot , and my symptoms r too from the childhood they didn't appear not out of nowhere .

Lmao before writing this post i made myself coffee and forgot about it and my mom pointed out saying will u ever remember to drink coffee/chai hot 😭 .

I went there religiously for drinks from 18 - 22.

I’m 25 now, soon to be 26 and don’t go anywhere near as much as I used to. I really only go to spoons now at the airport, if I’m out for a day drink session and need cheap drinks and cheap food to keep me going or it’s became an annual thing for my mates birthday to go for breakfast.

I tend to avoid spoons simply because I find the crowds extremely young or extremely old, not a huge fan of the overall atmosphere and I would genuinely would rather spend abit more on good drink.

With the above being said, I will always have a soft spot for spoons. The food isn’t terrible and today I got a large vegetarian breakfast and refillable coffee for under £8 (living in London that’s unheard of). I find it to be one of the only chains/pubs which doesn’t have regulars to the point of giving you daggers when you enter. I also find it’s a great spot to go if you’re with a group of people that have a mix of food and alcohol preferences (just don’t go in expecting Michelin star food and you’ll be happy with your bang for your buck).

Suddenly I am seeing these compact vintage trucks everywhere. Coffee shops, farmers markets, construction sites, even just cruising around on weekends. They look almost out of place next to modern vehicles, smaller and more utilitarian, but somehow cooler in their simplicity.
Last month my neighbor brought home a japanese pickup truck from the early 90s and it has become a conversation starter for the entire block. People stop to ask about it, admire the condition, talk about how vehicles used to be simpler and more reliable. There is this nostalgia factor mixed with genuine practicality. These trucks were built for work, not luxury, and somehow that feels refreshing compared to modern bloated pickups.
What I want to understand is whether this is a legitimate trend or just my town being weird. Are these vintage imports actually practical for daily use or are they maintenance nightmares. I have seen listings on sites like Alibaba for similar models being imported, which suggests there is real demand. But I cannot tell if people genuinely use them or if they are more about aesthetic and nostalgia. What drives these kind of vehicle trends. Is it practicality, nostalgia, or just wanting something different from everyone else.

1q9x5va,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q9x5va/should_i_invest_in_a_second_acrylic_painting/,Should I invest in a second acrylic painting setup at my mom’s coffee shop instead of painting alone in my room?,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some outside perspective because I’m honestly stuck going back and forth on this.

I already paint with acrylics and I have a setup in my room, but I struggle a lot with loneliness and motivation when I’m alone. When I’m by myself, I tend to procrastinate, feel unmotivated (especially without Ritalin), and fall into gaming instead of actually painting.

My mom owns a coffee shop. The first floor has customers, but the second floor is more like a clothing office space. It’s quieter, still private, but there are familiar people around. Being surrounded by people (even if they’re not interacting with me much) makes me feel less lonely and more grounded.

I’m considering investing about $400 to set up a *second* acrylic painting station upstairs instead of constantly moving my current gear back and forth. I already own paints, brushes, canvases, an easel, water bucket, cloths, etc., plus an iPad and stand. The main reason I don’t move my current setup is inconvenience and fear of damaging things.

I’m torn because:

* **Pros:** Being around people helps my loneliness I might actually paint more consistently Clear separation between “sleep space” and “creative space” Less isolation, more structure
* **Cons:** $400 is not a small amount I haven’t made money from painting yet There’s a risk I’ll lose consistency after a week I might be romanticizing the idea

The money would mostly be mine, though I might ask my mom for help if possible. I don’t *need* this setup to survive it’s more about mental health and productivity.

When I imagine 6 months later, the regret that scares me more isn’t “I wasted money,” but “I didn’t try something that might’ve helped me.”

So my question is:  
Is investing in a second creative setup for mental health and consistency a reasonable decision, or am I just avoiding learning discipline in my current environment?

Would love to hear from people who’ve dealt with loneliness, creative motivation issues, or setting up workspaces outside their bedroom. any advice are welcome. Thanks ",1,1768131118.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/r3hbunp6cpcg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b369e1faa33865b4bdb9964dabd8259f998e1a83

Treasurer Jim Chalmers is en route to Washington to spruik Australia’s critical mineral offerings to counterparts from the world’s biggest economies, as Canberra vies to position the country as an alternative supplier to China amid “global uncertainty”.

Critical minerals are crucial for modern technology, from smartphones and cars to power sources and advanced weapons systems.

Mr Chalmers will meet with finance ministers from the G7 countries as well as with India, Mexico and South Korea for “strategic discussions about strengthening critical minerals supply chains”.

“Everyone benefits from stronger and more diverse critical minerals supply chains, but especially Australia, and that’s what this work is all about.

“Whether it’s our resources or renewable energy, our skills or stability, Australia has exactly what the world needs, when the world needs it, and that’s well understood by our closest counterparts.”

The summit comes as the West vies to challenge China’s dominance in mining and refining critical minerals.

China accounted for 59 per cent of mining, 91 per cent of refining and 94 per cent of permanent magnet production in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Beijing in October spooked the US by slapping strict export controls on several rare earths vital for defence and high-tech manufacturing.

Later that month, Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump signed a landmark agreement to “unlock” a $13bn pipeline of projects across both countries, using loans, equity stakes, and offtake agreements.

China announced a one-year pause on restrictions in November following a meeting between the US President and Xi Jinping.

Mr Chalmers noted “global uncertainty” was a “critical” factor in the talks.

“In the face of growing global uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions, this is a critical time to confer with counterparts,” he said.

“Collaborating on critical minerals will help to make our economies and our supply chains stronger and more resilient and make our people big beneficiaries of global churn and change.”

Mr Chalmers is also scheduled to have one-on-one meetings with his counterparts US, British, Canadian, and Japanese counterparts.

# Jan. 11th, 2026~US signals deeper critical minerals engagement with India

[US signals deeper critical minerals engagement with India, Vaishnaw to attend meet: Report](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/us-signals-deeper-critical-minerals-engagement-with-india-vaishnaw-to-attend-meet-13766928.html)

Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is expected represent India at a key US-hosted meeting on critical minerals scheduled for January 12, at a time when China’s use of supply chains as a geopolitical tool has raised concerns, the *Economic Times* reported.

Indicating Washington’s intent to involve New Delhi in the initiative, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Saturday that India, Australia and several other countries will participate in a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies that he will host in Washington on Monday to discuss the issue, the report said.

Bessent told reporters that he had been pushing for a dedicated discussion on the matter since the G7 leaders’ summit last summer, citing China’s weaponisation of supply chains. He added that G7 finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting on the issue in December.

The report, citing People familiar with the developments, said Vaishnaw is likely to attend the meeting on India’s behalf.

India is also set to join the US-led Pax Silica initiative ahead of the artificial intelligence summit being hosted by New Delhi, the report said.

In addition, India will participate in another US meeting on critical minerals ahead of the Artificial Intelligence Impact Summit scheduled to be held in New Delhi on February 19 and 20, ET said.

Although India is a member of the Quad Critical Minerals initiative, it was not initially included in Pax Silica, which currently comprises the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, the UK, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Australia.

Separately, the US has a distinct critical minerals initiative with Pakistan—an engagement that has strengthened political ties between Washington and Islamabad, much to India’s discomfort.

*G7 finance ministers will hold a meeting in Washington on January 12 specifically focused on securing rare earths and critical mineral supplies.*

[G7 Sets a Floor to Escape China's Rare Earth Control - Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2026/01/06/g7-sets-a-floor-to-escape-chinas-rare-earth-control/)

# NEWS BRIEF

G7 finance ministers are convening an emergency meeting in Washington to address their collective vulnerability to China’s dominance of rare earths and critical minerals, with coordinated price floors on the agenda as a key tool to de-risk supply chains. The meeting reflects escalating Western efforts to make non-Chinese mining investments economically viable and break Beijing’s strategic stranglehold on materials vital for defense, tech, and green energy.

# WHAT HAPPENED

* G7 finance ministers will hold a meeting in Washington on January 12 specifically focused on securing rare earths and critical mineral supplies.
* A key topic will be establishing coordinated price floors to ensure Western mining and processing projects can compete with heavily subsidized Chinese production.
* The meeting follows a G7 action plan agreed in June to secure supply chains, with the U.S. already implementing a domestic price floor for rare earths in 2024.
* All G7 nations except Japan are heavily or entirely reliant on China for critical materials like rare earth magnets and battery metals.

# WHY IT MATTERS

* This marks a shift from dialogue to concrete, market-interventionist policy coordination among the world’s largest advanced economies, targeting a core pillar of Chinese economic power.
* Price floors represent a radical departure from free-market orthodoxy, acknowledging that pure competition cannot break China’s monopoly due to state subsidies and strategic pricing.
* The G7’s unified move signals that “de-risking” from China is entering an aggressive, operational phase with direct financial mechanisms, not just rhetoric.
* Success or failure will determine the West’s ability to build independent tech and defense industrial bases, from EVs to fighter jets, for the next decade.

# IMPLICATIONS

* If implemented, G7 price floors could trigger a global bifurcation in critical mineral markets, with a higher-cost “Western” market and a lower-cost Chinese market, forcing companies to choose supply chain alliances.
* This could lead to trade tensions with China, which may retaliate by restricting exports or further lowering prices to undermine new Western mining ventures before they become established.
* Major mining investments in G7 nations and allied countries (e.g., Australia, Canada) will receive a significant boost, reshaping global resource geopolitics.
* The move may accelerate a broader trend of “managed trade” in strategic sectors, eroding WTO principles and leading to more bloc-based, politicized global commerce.

# 🚨 The G7 Draws the Line on Critical Minerals — And Why NioCorp Is Suddenly in the Right Place at the Right Time

**The news that G7 finance ministers are meeting in Washington on Monday January 12th, 2026** to discuss coordinated **Price floors and financial mechanisms for critical minerals** is not just another policy headline — it’s a structural shift in how the West intends to secure supply chains. **This marks a move away from “let the market decide” toward active intervention to ensure non-Chinese mining and processing projects are economically viable.**

**In plain English:** *Western governments are acknowledging that competing with heavily subsidized Chinese supply requires deliberate support, not just encouragement.*

That policy shift directly benefits projects that are already aligned with national-interest objectives — and that’s exactly where NioCorp sits. Elk Creek is no longer merely a permitted mine waiting on financing. With dual-portal construction slated for Q1 2026, metallurgy & oxide production PROVEN, and a Scandium alloy + component reveal expected in February under NAMA, the project is evolving into a **vertically integrated critical materials platform**. That distinction matters. Strategic lenders like EXIM, and partners within DoD and allied governments, don’t evaluate these projects as speculative commodity plays — they evaluate them as infrastructure critical to defense, energy, and industrial resilience.

What makes NioCorp especially relevant to a G7 price-floor environment is the breadth of its potential contribution. Elk Creek is positioned to supply or support **Seven critical materials** tied to four defense-critical supply chains: **Niobium, Titanium (TiCl₄), Scandium and Sc-Al alloys, plus future Rare Earth byproducts (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb). That is precisely the category of project price supports are meant to protect: multi-decade, geopolitically essential supply sources that cannot survive under distorted Chinese pricing alone but become strategically indispensable once supported!**

**We’ve already seen early versions of this playbook. MP Materials secured U.S. government-backed price and offtake structures to stabilize magnet economics. Lynas has received repeated strategic support.** Perpetua, Talon, and others have benefited from government-linked de-risking mechanisms. The G7 now discussing **coordinated price floors** signals that this approach is expanding beyond one-off deals toward a broader framework. ""**If"" implemented,** it would dramatically improve the financing landscape for aligned projects — including Elk Creek — by improving long-term revenue predictability and reducing downside risk for lenders.

**The key takeaway:** this isn’t abstract geopolitics anymore. It’s operational policy. The West is building a protected economic lane for critical minerals projects that serve national security goals. NioCorp was architected for this environment from day one — integrated, multi-mineral, defense-relevant, and aligned with U.S. strategic priorities.

2025 was the setup year and as Q1 2026 begins physical execution (Dual Portal Ramp & Construction), then policy momentum like this G7 meeting is the macro tailwind that could turn Elk Creek from “undervalued junior” into a *World* recognized strategic asset in buildout.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# “We’re there!!” — Why 2026 Is the Year for NioCorp

**Mark Smith & Jim Sims saying it plainly:** ***“We’re there. We’re going to be able to start construction in 2026, next year.”*** After years of permitting, engineering, financing work, and validation, management is now openly talking about construction activity, site work, and visible progress on the ground. That’s not speculative language — that’s execution language.

What stood out most wasn’t just optimism, but certainty. Mark repeatedly emphasized momentum, **calling 2025 “nothing less than a phenomenal year”** and making it clear that 2026 is when the work becomes visible: portals, construction activity, and tangible progress at Elk Creek. **That lines up perfectly with what shareholders have been watching all year — drilling completion, assays underway, DFS work advancing, EXIM engagement, DoD funding, land acquisition finished, and now portal construction approved for Q1 2026.**

# For anyone still wondering “what changes in 2026?” — this is it. The story transitions from validation to build-out. From paperwork to equipment. From waiting to watching. As Mark said, “I hope you walk away realizing that things are about to change — and 2026 is going to be the year that it changes.” After all this time, NioCorp isn’t talking about someday anymore!

No sweetie — every LLC company must register, even if your company has no activities.
And at the end of the year, you must submit your audit.

Because this is an ad for my accountant team at my company.
They are professionals in UAE tax laws and accounting laws.

Yes, they can register you with the FDA
(I can already hear you saying: “That’s easy”).
But if you already have the $10K fine, they can help waive it for you.

**Project Airfoil – Successful Demonstration of Non-Localized Blade Manifestation**

Dr. Elias Varnholt, Lead Researcher

On December 19, 1966, at 03:47 EST, we achieved repeatable zero-point summoning of a mono-molecular edge under controlled conditions.

The device (designated “Aether Edge Prototype IV”) requires no physical blade reservoir. Instead, it exploits a temporary coherence collapse in the vacuum energy field, triggered by a precisely modulated 7.83 Hz pulse train synchronized with the subject’s alpha-wave rhythm. When the resonance locks, a 28 cm triangular blade of apparent negative mass manifests directly into the target spatial coordinates.

Key observation:

The summoned edge possesses no measurable material precursor in the seconds before manifestation. High-speed photography (10,000 fps) shows only a sudden absence of light – a perfect optical silhouette – immediately followed by the blade itself. We hypothesize the weapon is “borrowed” from a parallel vacuum state and repaid upon dematerialization 1.8–2.4 seconds later.

Test subject 17 (cadaver) exhibited instantaneous transection at 4.2 cm depth. Tissue margins showed characteristic thermal blooming consistent with an edge temperature estimated at 4,200 K for approximately 800 microseconds – hot enough to cauterize while cutting.

The blade leaves no trace, no metal fragment, no molecular residue. It simply… returns from where it came.

We are preparing human trials under DoD Protocol 11-66.

End of excerpt.



Forty-three years later, in the sticky summer of 2010, a used VR headset appeared on Craigslist in a suburb outside Columbus, Ohio.

**For Sale: Oculus Rift DK1 (heavily modified) – $180 OBO**

“Runs old demos like a dream. Previous owner was… eccentric. Lots of custom firmware. Take it or leave it.”

The buyer was thirty-one-year-old Daniel Marrow, recently divorced, newly unemployed, and very enthusiastic about anything that cost less than a tank of gas. He met the seller at a gas station parking lot at dusk. The man was thin, jittery, wearing sunglasses at 7:40 p.m. He handed over the headset in a plain brown grocery bag like it was dirty laundry.

“Didn’t come with the original box,” he muttered. “And don’t… don’t run the demo called ‘Aether.’ It’s corrupted. I mean it.”

Daniel laughed. “Dude, I’m just gonna play Half-Life 2 mods.”

The seller stared at him for three full seconds too long, then walked away without another word.

That night Daniel plugged everything in.

The modified firmware had a custom boot screen: black background, white Courier font, one line.

**AETHER EDGE – PROTOCOL IV – ARMED**

He clicked past it, found the familiar Oculus Home knockoff, launched a wave shooter. Nothing weird. A little laggy maybe. He played for forty minutes, got bored, started digging through the custom demo folders because why not.

There it was.

**Aether.exe**

0 bytes

Created: 12/19/1966

Modified: never

He laughed again. “Zero bytes? That’s adorable.”

Double-click.

The screen went black. Not loading-black. Gone-black. Then came the sound: a low 7.83 Hz sine wave that seemed to crawl inside his skull rather than enter through the headphones. His hands went numb. The room lights dimmed, though he lived alone and the breaker hadn’t tripped.

Then the tutorial voice – calm, clinical, fifties-era enunciation.

“Subject aligned. Resonance achieved. Prepare for manifestation.”

Daniel tried to pull the headset off.

Nothing moved.

His right arm was still holding the touch controller, but now the controller felt… heavier. Colder. And something was forming inside his grip – something that wasn’t there a heartbeat ago.

He looked down.

A perfect triangular blade, matte black, hovered two centimeters above his palm. No handle. No tang. Just the edge, hanging in the air like an open wound in reality.

He screamed.

The blade didn’t wait for permission.

It snapped forward – not thrown, not swung, simply relocated – and punched through his left pectoral at a forty-five-degree angle. The entry was surgical. No resistance. No blood spray. Just a sudden wet absence where lung tissue used to be.

He felt the heat bloom, the flash-freeze of tissue cooking and collapsing in the same instant. The smell hit half a second later: copper, ozone, burnt hair.

The blade vanished.

He dropped to his knees, headset still strapped on, the black screen now showing only one word in white:

**RETURNED**

Daniel tried to breathe. One lung bubbled. The other was simply… gone.

He clawed at the straps. Finally got them off. The room looked normal again. Quiet. His shirt had a neat triangular hole, edges charred black. Blood was only now starting to well up, as if the wound had waited politely for the headset to come off.

He stared at the Oculus on the carpet.

The power LED was still green.

From somewhere inside the headphones – still faintly playing – he heard the old voice again, softer this time, almost gentle, fading like a radio signal slipping beneath the horizon:

“…manifestation complete… subject terminated… preparing for next coherence event… please stand by…”

Daniel’s phone was on the coffee table, eight feet away. He tried to crawl.

He made it four feet before the next pulse came – the same low 7.83 Hz, only now it was inside his remaining lung.

He never reached the phone.

Somewhere in the headset, a counter incremented.

**SUBJECT 18**

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

**AWAITING NEW OPERATOR**

The little green light stayed on all night.

And most of the next day.

And the day after that.

I have been living in a different city for 15 years. It is about 2 hours train ride from my mom's city. In these years, my mom has been here 3 times. I have come to hers at least on time in the last years but usually multiple times. She complains all the time we never see each other. The times she came to my city, she came alone 1 time. Usually, she brought a partner. The last times, with her new partner were very stressful. She told me, he had promised to do something on his own, so, we have some mother daughter time but that never happened. He seems possessive to me and there has been financial abuse. My mom has drunkenly told me on the phone, she thought about leaving several times. Recently, I have been very bad. I got very ill, when that was over, I got pretty depressed because I have been suffering from a lot of chronic pain as a result. My mom told me, she would visit me to give me my Christmas present as I wasn't able to come and to be there for me. Well, then I found out, she would bring her boyfriend. I asked her, why, she said, she can't sleep without him and my city is dangerous, he needs to protect her (not true, her area is notoriously dangerous, 
mine ist not). They booked the hotel they usually book which is about an hour from me. Why they book that? No clue. It's not cheaper. There are many hotels 10 min from my place. But: ""They like the area."" I told her fine, but I don't want to see him in my state (I don't know him well at all). She came the first day and stayed 3 hours, then she had to leave because it was getting dark, she didn't want to travel in the dark and she needed one hour to go to find him. They went shopping and had dinner together. She asked to meet the next day, I said, I would like to text her when I get up. I have massive sleeping problems, so, I wanted to take in as much sleep as I could. I texted her when I got up, they were at a museum and then had lunch. She came to my place and stayed 50 min. Why? Because she still had to go back to the hotel. I was a bit confused. I live one stop from the train station. The guy could have taken their (minimal) luggage and met her there to catch the train back home. She said, no, they wanted to still have coffee in that area. So, she had to leave several hours earlier than I expected. I was pretty upset and told her, that I felt this trip wasn't about me, my state of health or anything. It was about having a getaway with her partner. She thinks I am overreacting and I am being jealous of her partner. AIO?",1,1768130298.0,AIO,1,1.0,False

Honestly, I'm not sure how this will land, but this random thought just popped into my head the other day, so I figured I'd share it here and see if it resonates with anyone.

I'm in my early 30s, unmarried, working and living in Pune. Lately, I've been reflecting on how this particular life stage can feel a bit strange and isolating at times. Younger crowds (in their 20s) often seem to be at a different level of maturity when it comes to career pressures, financial realities, and long-term life decisions. On the flip side, many people in their late 30s or 40s are already married, settled with family priorities, and focused on different things.

A lot of us around 30-35 appear to be navigating this odd in-between phase: some are unsure about marriage, some are happily content staying single, some are reflecting on past relationships or even divorce thoughts, and others have been actively searching for a partner for years without much success yet. It creates this unique limbo where things can feel unclear or lonely sometimes.

These are the main reasons I've been thinking a casual peer community for folks in this early 30s unmarried stage could be genuinely helpful:

1. Harder to connect across ages — Younger crowds sometimes miss that deeper understanding of adult responsibilities like career stability, finances, and life planning, while older ones are mostly in married/family mode. 

2. Safe space for real talk — A judgment-free zone where people can openly communicate, share personal thoughts, vent, express doubts, or just be themselves without being labeled, misunderstood, or judged.

3. Knowledge & idea exchange — Everyone carries unique pieces of wisdom from their experiences (whether it's work insights, hobbies, life hacks, or random learnings). Exchanging that could help everyone grow, learn something new, and feel more enriched.

4. Battling this confusing phase together — With marriage doubts, firm choices to stay single, post-relationship recovery, or ongoing partner searches, it's a strange zone of uncertainty. Hearing others' perspectives, stories, and journeys might bring a bit more clarity, make decisions feel less overwhelming, and remind us we're not alone in it.

I'm not trying to organize anything big or pushy right now — this is just an idea that's been lingering. But I'd love to hear from others in a similar spot (especially 30-35 unmarried folks in Pune):

- Do you feel this way too? How are you handling the social/peer side of this life stage?

- Have you found good ways to connect with like-minded people (casual hangs, interest-based events, apps like Meetup.com, etc.) without it turning into dating stuff?

- If this kind of low-key peer connection (coffee walks, group discussions on life topics, shared meals) sounds appealing, drop a comment — maybe we can brainstorm simple ways to make it happen organically.

Open to all respectful thoughts, experiences, or suggestions. Let's keep it positive and friendly! 😊

Thanks for reading — curious and looking forward  to see what people say.

I'll be honest, I'm not really a 'meetup organizer' kinda person neither do i have that kinda personality. So it would be great if like 4-5 people put like their brain into it and maybe we can have something meaningful out of it, you never know.",1,1768130142.0,punemeetup,2,0.67,False

Here's everything I wish someone told me before I started (because no one asked).,"Look, I've been doing this for way too long. When people ask ""what's the best place to work remotely,"" I usually give them some diplomatic non-answer because every place has tradeoffs. But fuck it, here's my actual opinion on where to base yourself in 2026, organized by the questions you're actually Googling at 2am when you can't sleep.

Quick disclaimer before the pitchforks come out: I'm ranking based on actually living somewhere 1-3 months, not backpacking through for a week. Also not a millionaire, so these assume you have a real budget and actually need to work.

The ""why is nobody talking about these"" tier

* Tbilisi, Georgia - $400/month, year visa-free, fiber everywhere
* Muscat, Oman - Not expensive, beach vibes, friendly locals
* Cuenca, Ecuador - Perfect weather, $6 lunches, easy residency
* Taipei, Taiwan - Great transit, food scene, affordable
* Windhoek, Namibia - Stable, good infrastructure, self-drive safaris nearby

Coffee shop laptop lifestyle - where it actually works

Chiang Mai, Mexico City (Roma/Condesa), Lisbon, Seoul, Melbourne

Time zones that won't destroy your soul

* US East Coast clients: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica
* Europe clients: Portugal/Spain, Georgia, Turkey, Morocco
* Asia clients: Thailand, Vietnam, Bali, Taiwan (hope they're flexible)
* Australia clients: Just move to Australia

Where your money actually stretches

Under $500/month: Tbilisi, Chiang Mai, Hanoi, Medellín

$500-800: Lisbon (outside center), Taipei, Buenos Aires, Playa del Carmen, KL

$800-1200: Barcelona, Porto, CDMX (nice areas), Bangkok (luxury), Tokyo (if you hunt)

The brutal honesty section

Noped out after trying: Belize, Morocco (Marrakech scam fatigue), El Salvador

Solo women - extra caution: India, Morocco, Egypt, Bangladesh

Pickpocketing hotspots: Barcelona, Rome, Paris

Actual mugging risk areas: Parts of Mexico City, Bogotá, Rio, Johannesburg, Lagos

The food situation

Never cooking: Vietnam, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia

Will cook a lot: USA, Switzerland, Nordics, Singapore

Healthcare when shit goes wrong

Good and cheap: Thailand, Mexico, Portugal, Taiwan, Malaysia

Expensive, get insurance: USA, Switzerland, rural anywhere

The ""everyone ends up here"" spots

Chiang Mai (Nov-Feb), Medellín, Lisbon (summer), Bali (Canggu), Mexico City (Roma/Condesa)

I avoid these now. Nomad scene becomes your entire world.

The decision paralysis trap

Wasted 2 months with 47 tabs open comparing wifi speeds. Made a 20-column spreadsheet. Didn't help.

What actually matters: Stop optimizing for ""best"" and ask what you need right now. Adventure or calm? Community or solitude? Beach or mountain energy?

Started picking cities based on gut instinct about my headspace instead of data points. Best decisions I made. I saw some tools recently trying this approach like Novad but honestly you can do without it.

Where I keep coming back

1. Mexico - Value, food, time zone, variety
2. Vietnam - Cheap, food, easy travel, fast internet
3. Portugal - EU quality, affordable (for Europe), good weather
4. Japan - Expensive but worth it for quality of life
5. Georgia - Opened a hostel there. Love Tbilisi.

Red flags a place will suck

* Every other building is coworking (Bali)
* Nomad groups full of visa complaints
* English-only menus everywhere
* Locals avoid tourist areas
* Airbnb host sends 47 pre-arrival messages
* Everyone's on Zoom in the cafe

Things I was wrong about

Japan too expensive - Eat like locals, avoid Tokyo

India impossible - Easier than you think

Eastern Europe depressing - Balkans are incredible

Need nomad hubs - Best times were random cities with zero nomads

More research = better - Sometimes just pick and go

Rapid fire takes nobody asked for

* Coworking spaces are overrated. Coffee shops work fine
* ""Digital nomad visa"" = ""we want your money but won't give you benefits""
* If you're staying under 2 weeks, you're traveling, not nomading
* Countries obsessed with tips: USA, Canada, Egypt
* Best local booze: Rakija (Balkans), Mezcal (Mexico), Sake (Japan)
* Worst local booze: Ouzo (Greece), Cha Cha (Georgia), Aguardiente (Colombia)
* Oat milk availability predicts nomad-friendliness better than internet speed
* Every ""best coworking space"" looks identical. Same plants, same chairs, same startup people

My actual top 5 for 2026

New to nomading:

1. Mexico City
2. Chiang Mai
3. Lisbon
4. Medellín
5. Taipei

Been doing this a while:

1. Tbilisi, Georgia
2. Oaxaca, Mexico
3. Da Lat, Vietnam
4. Porto, Portugal
5. Tallinn, Estonia

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

We have been talking for a few days and he overall seems like a nice guy, I think we maybe have even overshared some things a bit too early because we mostly talk late into the night. All goes well, I like him and he tells me he likes me as well however we are in really different situations that make it hard for us to date normally. We planned a meet up date and I cant lie that I have a bit of anxiety regarding this because we did meet on tinder after all and later exchanged instagrams but as a girl you can never fully trust guys that are basically strangers. The thing is he will soon leave for training as he wishes to become a cop and for a month we won’t really be able to see each other again or once a week at most. I am studying a hard degree and dont have time during the week except for Thursdays sometimes and the weekends. Even so I dont want to rush things and I have explained that to him, which he seemed to understand and agree to. Do you guys think it would be a good idea to meet up for a coffee after only about 5 days of talking because we wont really be able to otherwise? He did say we could wait until he comes back from the first month of training but at the same time I want to know if the chemistry is present irl as well.

Hi Kolkata 

I’m a 28 year-old woman in the city for a few days (about a week), and I thought—why not try meeting some new people while I’m here?
Full honesty: I’m overweight, not exactly winning any beauty pageants, and self-confidence and I are currently in a long-distance relationship 
BUT—if you enjoy good conversations, random walks, street food debates, coffee that turns into deep talks, or just wandering around Kolkata without an agenda, we might get along pretty well.
I’m not looking for anything fancy or appearance-focused. Just decent humans who value vibes over looks, conversations over impressions, and laughter over filters.
Open to:
	•	Random outings
	•	Coffee/tea walks
	•	Exploring Kolkata casually
	•	Talking about life, books, random thoughts, or absolutely nothing important
If you’re kind, non-judgmental, and okay with awkward jokes and genuine conversations, feel free to DM.
If not—thanks for reading anyway, and have a great day 

P.S. I promise I’m better at conversations than introductions like this.",2,1768129382.0,kolkata,32,0.58,False

I’m a student (doing a master degree in a nice uni but from home) and I also work part time. That’s a non negotiable, as much as I hate working in restaurants because I really need the money (I’ve struggle enough during my studies (I love the place and my colleagues but I hate having to deal with customers and the fact that it’s physically and mentally exhausting). 

I’m also kinda engaged (I’ll be when my bf propose, it’s supposed to be anytime soon and we already are (secretly) organising the wedding that is planned in 2027). 

I’ve been in exam mode for over a month now and I’m **exhausted**, it’s so hard to deal with work and exams at the same time and we also are visiting wedding venues. 
Over the semester I also tried to keep up with social and cultural life (visiting friends in other cities, going out to the cinema or theatre, having people over at night, going to the gym (I’m actually on a weight loss program so I have weekly meetings with a nutritionist and I’ve sort of new food rules), going to the therapist etc.) 

I obviously also try to keep my apartment clean (obviously sharing that with bf). 

Last night we came back late from the cinema (went to see Avatar) and planned on waking up kinda early to clean the apartment before I work on my Spanish test for tomorrow. 

This morning I got up before bf and immediately started to tidy and clean before even having my morning glass of water or a coffee. When he got up (after I already dusted the leaving room, cleaned the toilets and the litter box) he said we still needed to vacuum, empty the trash cans, fold laundry and clean other dirty clothes. 
I said I’ll go launch the washing machine but then that I did my part and will start working on my Spanish. 
He kinda got offended saying that he wasn’t going to do everything by himself. 

I was so mad I ended up launching the machine, dusting and vacuuming all the apartment and moping the kitchen while he emptied trash, put the clean dishes away, fold laundry and clean the bathroom sink. 

It’s already noon and I haven’t done any Spanish yet. 
I’m stressed out, kinda freaked out and mad about him not seeing that it wasn’t my job to do all that cleaning today. 

Also I still haven’t eat a proper breakfast or clean myself.

Atm I'm on a combination of 18mg atomoxetine and 30mg elvanse (vyvanse). 

While the atomoxetine wiped out my anxiety and constant food noise completely, it didn't help with the other symptoms. On a higher dose I became aggressive. 

So we added the 30mg elvanse which I split into two doses during morning. I cant take it later than 10:30 or I will not sleep despite taking melatonin and magnesium in the evening. 

Unfortunately I still have a noticable crash in the afternoon, even on days where it works great and I feel I did everything right like eating protein, drinking, snacking, enough sleep etc. 
When I tried higher doses of elvanse I became tired and my eyes cant really focused while having an elevated heart rate and being short of breath. 

When I tried to 'boost' in the afternoon with one coffee (none before during the day) I couldn't sleep for hours or not at all. 

I read that many of you take an additional short acting stimulant in the afternoon to be productive until the evening. 

Sometimes I have uni until 9-10 pm in the evening and will probably ask my dr. if it's possible to get a booster for those days. I hope I would then still be able to sleep. 

Both meds I take atm work well for the different symptoms but just not long enough. Generally switching meds is difficult cause  ritalin sedated me for days and adderall is not available where I live. I was hoping to get a dex booster. 

My question is: Has anyone had a similar situation and was prescribed 3 meds for adhd at the same time? 
Especially a combo of atomoxetine, elvanse and an additional stimulant? How was your experience?

​Now I want to turn the tables. I am curious how the European coffee community perceives Slovak roasters and if you have any experience with them.
​Slovakia is a small country (5.4 million people), yet the density of specialty roasters here is incredibly high. More than 100. 

It is also the birthplace of Standart magazine, which many of you likely know. The quality has skyrocketed in recent years, with local roasters even winning categories at the Global Coffee Awards Europe 2025. It is great to see that high-end coffee is no longer just a privilege of the capital but can be found in small towns across the country.

​Have you ever tasted beans from Slovakia? Do you even have them on your radar?

​If yes, please mention where you are from. If not, I am curious why - is it a lack of international shipping, marketing, or do you simply stick to your local favorites?",3,1768129152.0,pourover,5,0.8,False

Just some prerequisites:

I don't eat salad / raw veg (with very few exceptions). Most of my veg I oven roast in avocado oil with salt and pepper.

I really dislike condiments, so stuff like mayo, salad dressing etc wont work for me. I'm not even a huge fan of butter, though I do eat it from time to time.

Veg I usually eat:

* Broccoli
* Cauliflower
* Green beans
* Mushrooms
* Brussel sprouts
* Tomato (usually if I'm making some sort of sauce)
* Courgette
* Cucumber
* Chives, watercress, rocket, lettuce, spinach

Meat wise I usually eat pork and chicken breast during the week, and on weekends have either beef, ostrich or venison. I also have a ready supply of Biltong. I also usually eat cheese, eggs and peanuts.

Fish I eat tinned tuna or sardines.

I do drink a fair bit of coffee, usually with a splash of whole fat milk. I would ideally like to keep to that if possible. I'm not a huge fan of cream and really dislike milk alternatives.

Lastly I intermittent fast from 12pm until 8pm, and usually get hungry around 1pm.

I'll likely just eat egg, cheese, Biltong and maybe some fish for lunch from Mon - Friday as I generally don't eat a lot in the day.

Dinner wise I'm planning to eat pork or chicken from Sunday - Thursday, then having burgers / steaks of one of the more exotic meats on Friday and Saturday. All of this will be done with a tray of the above mentioned veg in various quantities.

Some days I don't feel like roasting I'll do something like a casserole with everything in it.

I know this is super basic, but I usually don't put much thought into my meals, I like doing something that's mainly set it and forget it.

If there's anything I could potentially add or something I'm clearly missing from my rotation please do let me know. I'd like to go into this as properly as possible.

I also drink a reasonable amount of water (1-1.5l daily).",1,1768128260.0,keto,6,1.0,False

Hey!
I’m stepping into a new semester and a new year, and I thought this might be a good time to put myself out there a little more intentionally. College has been exciting, overwhelming, grounding, and chaotic in equal measure and while I’m loving the learning, I’m still craving real human connection. The kind that feels warm, curious, and actually meaningful.

I’m hoping to meet people who enjoy real conversations the kind where we talk about what we’re reading, what keeps us up at night, what we’re slowly figuring out about ourselves. Not just “hey, what’s up” energy, but something a little more present and thoughtful. Friendship first, always. And if something deeper grows organically, I’m open to that too no rush, no pressure.

A little about me: I’m a law student, so my days are usually split between case laws, coffee, and pretending I understand things on the first read (still working on that). I love literature romance, thrillers, classics anything that makes me feel deeply or think hard. I’m really into history, psychology, feminism, philosophy, and long conversations about why people are the way they are. I also love researching random things, skincare deep-dives, tech rabbit holes, and the occasional late-night “let me overthink this quietly” moment.

Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert. I can be a little reserved at first, but once I’m comfortable, I’m warm, chatty, and very much an “I remembered that tiny detail you mentioned once” person. I value independence, but I also love soft, intentional care. I’m a feminist with a romantic heart. I believe in building something steady, kind, and emotionally safe.

I’ve never really dated because I’m not into anything casual. I care a lot about intention and emotional depth. I’m very much a “friendship first, slow connection, date-to-marry” kind of person but I also believe the best things unfold naturally, not on a timeline.

One small request: if you message me, please say more than just “hey.” Tell me what you’re reading, what your week’s been like, what’s been sitting on your mind lately something real. I want to know you, not just your opener.

If this resonated with you, I’d genuinely love to hear from you

My usual workflow with the Bosch has been: grind the beans while the water boils and I preheat my old stove top on medium (1.5/3), load water just below the gasket, close it all up & place it all on the stove, and as soon as there are my first signs of coffee coming out I lower my stove down a notch (1/3) or two (0.5/3) depending on how it’s flowing. Usually takes between 1:45-3:00. (In the event that it comes out too quickly/hot, I’ll immediately turn off and remove pot from the stove to let the heated chamber do the rest of the work).

There’s:
no monetisation
no roasters listed
no products being sold

At this stage I’m just trying to answer:

Does this kind of matching feel useful?

Is the language clear or annoying?

Would this actually help avoid buying the wrong bag?

1q9w5wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1q9w5wq/my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn’t take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see his whole body shake from excitement when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy, a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don’t think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend, a Labrador named Henry, was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I’m talking about. It’s more than just a dog. It’s a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn’t fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say “goodbye” in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin, which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom, the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room; me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy’s basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy’s plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don’t know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy, or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn’t make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy’s bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow… choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn’t believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don’t remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, “Billy?!” The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn’t rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Billy!” I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. “B…Billy?” I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy’s return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn’t really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy’s gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn’t want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn’t want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn’t actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked… I don’t even know how to describe it. The best description I think is “cartoonishly distorted,” as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn’t quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit “derpy”, because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy’s bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn’t start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. “What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half derpy smile, half assessing. A look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn’t want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn’t quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn’t touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to “relearn” it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn’t interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze… all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn’t really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy’s return into unease. He seemed to “learn” little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn’t eat, and his gait didn’t improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a wobbly dachshund, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy… right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn’t well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn’t think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn’t his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy’s return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn’t want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn’t be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn’t make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn’t respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy’s teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror, if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn’t know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn’t even want to touch him. But I also couldn’t leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn’t help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet… the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a “real” dog, and now what I had just witnessed… all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn’t care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn’t even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly smiling yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn’t fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I carelessly brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn’t seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up - and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that derpy grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy’s death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy’s memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was “Billy’s” confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn’t know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn’t Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy’s memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn’t a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That “Billy” made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing, whatever it was, had realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn’t dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn’t yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of “Billy” sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn’t want to imagine what it could mean if it was “Billy.” But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn’t come from the forest… it came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn’t have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and “Billy” climbed inside. But the worst part wasn’t that he was back. It was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

“B-Billy…?” I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when “Billy” snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering “no… no…” I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my bed, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn’t want to look back. I don’t remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn’t slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying once more for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It’s ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy’s basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn’t want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy. A few weeks after the experience at the cabin, I went into the forest where we always walked and where I had buried him at one of his favorite spots between the trees. I had brought his plush dinosaur to leave at the little grave. And just as I was about to turn and head home, I heard barking behind me… far too clipped. There, on the path, stood Billy; his eyes a little too big, the grin slightly derpy, tongue hanging out, and with a look as if he were waiting for me to finally finish.",1,1768127457.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False

Today's Pick: **Eagles TT U 12.5 - 2nd Half**

**$DKNG**: **-105**

Wager Amount: 1.05U to WIN 1U

League: San Francisco 49ers vs Philadephia Eagles (3:30PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: You kno what's crazy? I was telling someone that I was going to place a wager on 1st Half Packers ML and parlay it wit 2nd Half Bears ML. Should have done it! But man! I had a DAY yesterday! HIT 4 lays in the NFL Wild card Saturday games! Both amazing games! +42.55U yesterday including yesterday POTD win (+1.3U)! And yea.. this POTD looked cooked in the 2nd half and it looked like another bad beat wit a strong 1st half! But credit to the Panthers for making the Rams play up to their standard and score 4 TDs! I knew taking the Rams -10.5 was trap bet. It was key seeing Panthers money come in prior to gameday that made me so confident on today's Ram TT TDs! Panthers spread was also a consideration but really wasn't that convicted. Nonetheless glad it hit! Both wagers HIT!

**Rams TT O 3.5 TDs✅(+130)+1.95U**

**Rams TT O 26.5✅(-115)+1U**

**Matchup:** You guys might not like today's POTD because not only is it a under bet but also it is not plus money.

I'm going to do something different, but trust me on this one when I bet on something I bet wit conviction! Eagles are 1st half team. They are the complete opposite of the Bears yesterday, they play fast in the beginning and take a sizeable lead then bleed out the clock in the 2nd half. Eagles coast in the 2nd half and if you don't believe me when I say they literally sandbag the 2nd half, just watch any of their games this season in the 2nd half (well.. not every game, but most games they really do the minimal offense). This is something I've noticed about this team since Jalen Hurts became the starting QB. This is why I love taking their opponents point spread and most of the time tease the alternate lines up. Eagles are just not a good ATS team, so Niners +6 was definitely a consideration, but I'm more confident on the Under TT in the 2nd half because I strongly believe that most of the offensive scores is going to be in the 1st half for the Eagles at least. So much that I think Eagles might take a sizeable lead and let up in the 2nd half and the Niners adjust their defense. I mean look at their last 9 games of this season.

**Week 18 : 2nd Half Eagles - 10 Points ✅**

**Week 17 : 2nd Half Eagles - 0 Points ✅**

**Week 16 : 2nd Half Eagles - 22 Points ❌**

**Week 15 : 2nd Half Eagles - 14 Points ❌(against dog$hit Raiders defense)**

**Week 14 : 2nd Half Eagles - 10 Points ✅**

**Week 13 : 2nd Half Eagles - 12 Points ✅**

**Week 12 : 2nd Half Eagles - 0 Points ✅**

**Week 11 : 2nd Half Eagles - 3 Points ✅**

**Week 10 : 2nd Half Eagles -10 Points ✅**

Other than against weak defensive Raiders team and Commanders on Week 16 the Birds have gone under 12.5 points in 2nd half. Niners defense might be somewhat suspect in the past few weeks, but I truly believe that they can make adjustments in the 2nd half and be just good enough to hold off the Eagles. Lane Johnson is also questionable for this game and if he is out for this game I think the line moves a point down once he is confirmed out.

Lastly last time these two teams met were in 2023 regular season and Eagles got smoked by the Niners and they barely went over this line (scored exactly 13 points in the 2nd half).

**The Play & Prediction :** I get it if you don't like this POTD then take the 2nd half spread Niners +2.5 (+100) for plus money, going 0.5U for me and 1.05U on **Eagles TT U 12.5 - 2nd Half**. Lastly 0.65U on CMC ATTD at -125 on $DKNG.

1q9w56l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1q9w56l/my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn’t take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see his whole body shake from excitement when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy, a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don’t think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend, a Labrador named Henry, was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I’m talking about. It’s more than just a dog. It’s a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn’t fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say “goodbye” in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin, which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom, the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room; me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy’s basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy’s plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don’t know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy, or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn’t make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy’s bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow… choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn’t believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don’t remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, “Billy?!” The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn’t rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Billy!” I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. “B…Billy?” I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy’s return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn’t really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy’s gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn’t want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn’t want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn’t actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked… I don’t even know how to describe it. The best description I think is “cartoonishly distorted,” as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn’t quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit “derpy”, because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy’s bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn’t start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. “What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half derpy smile, half assessing. A look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn’t want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn’t quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn’t touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to “relearn” it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn’t interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze… all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn’t really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy’s return into unease. He seemed to “learn” little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn’t eat, and his gait didn’t improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a wobbly dachshund, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy… right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn’t well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn’t think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn’t his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy’s return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn’t want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn’t be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn’t make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn’t respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy’s teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror, if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn’t know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn’t even want to touch him. But I also couldn’t leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn’t help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet… the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a “real” dog, and now what I had just witnessed… all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn’t care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn’t even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly smiling yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn’t fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I carelessly brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn’t seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up - and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that derpy grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy’s death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy’s memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was “Billy’s” confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn’t know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn’t Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy’s memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn’t a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That “Billy” made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing, whatever it was, had realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn’t dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn’t yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of “Billy” sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn’t want to imagine what it could mean if it was “Billy.” But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn’t come from the forest… it came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn’t have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and “Billy” climbed inside. But the worst part wasn’t that he was back. It was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

“B-Billy…?” I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when “Billy” snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering “no… no…” I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my bed, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn’t want to look back. I don’t remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn’t slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying once more for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It’s ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy’s basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn’t want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy. A few weeks after the experience at the cabin, I went into the forest where we always walked and where I had buried him at one of his favorite spots between the trees. I had brought his plush dinosaur to leave at the little grave. And just as I was about to turn and head home, I heard barking behind me… far too clipped. There, on the path, stood Billy; his eyes a little too big, the grin slightly derpy, tongue hanging out, and with a look as if he were waiting for me to finally finish.",1,1768127384.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False
1q9w4gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1q9w4gj/my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn’t take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see his whole body shake from excitement when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy, a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don’t think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend, a Labrador named Henry, was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I’m talking about. It’s more than just a dog. It’s a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn’t fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say “goodbye” in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin, which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom, the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room; me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy’s basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy’s plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don’t know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy, or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn’t make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy’s bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow… choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn’t believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don’t remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, “Billy?!” The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn’t rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Billy!” I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. “B…Billy?” I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy’s return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn’t really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy’s gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn’t want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn’t want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn’t actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked… I don’t even know how to describe it. The best description I think is “cartoonishly distorted,” as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn’t quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit “derpy”, because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy’s bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn’t start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. “What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half derpy smile, half assessing. A look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn’t want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn’t quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn’t touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to “relearn” it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn’t interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze… all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn’t really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy’s return into unease. He seemed to “learn” little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn’t eat, and his gait didn’t improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a wobbly dachshund, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy… right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn’t well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn’t think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn’t his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy’s return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn’t want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn’t be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn’t make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn’t respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy’s teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror, if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn’t know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn’t even want to touch him. But I also couldn’t leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn’t help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet… the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a “real” dog, and now what I had just witnessed… all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn’t care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn’t even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly smiling yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn’t fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I carelessly brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn’t seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up - and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that derpy grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy’s death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy’s memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was “Billy’s” confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn’t know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn’t Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy’s memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn’t a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That “Billy” made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing, whatever it was, had realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn’t dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn’t yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of “Billy” sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn’t want to imagine what it could mean if it was “Billy.” But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn’t come from the forest… it came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn’t have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and “Billy” climbed inside. But the worst part wasn’t that he was back. It was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

“B-Billy…?” I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when “Billy” snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering “no… no…” I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my bed, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn’t want to look back. I don’t remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn’t slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying once more for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It’s ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy’s basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn’t want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy. A few weeks after the experience at the cabin, I went into the forest where we always walked and where I had buried him at one of his favorite spots between the trees. I had brought his plush dinosaur to leave at the little grave. And just as I was about to turn and head home, I heard barking behind me… far too clipped. There, on the path, stood Billy; his eyes a little too big, the grin slightly derpy, tongue hanging out, and with a look as if he were waiting for me to finally finish.",1,1768127313.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

1q9w2su,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q9w2su/hr_my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,[HR] My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn’t take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see his whole body shake from excitement when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy, a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don’t think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend, a Labrador named Henry, was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I’m talking about. It’s more than just a dog. It’s a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn’t fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say “goodbye” in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin, which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom, the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room; me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy’s basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy’s plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don’t know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy, or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn’t make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy’s bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow… choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn’t believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don’t remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, “Billy?!” The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn’t rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Billy!” I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. “B…Billy?” I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy’s return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn’t really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy’s gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn’t want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn’t want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn’t actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked… I don’t even know how to describe it. The best description I think is “cartoonishly distorted,” as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn’t quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit “derpy”, because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy’s bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn’t start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. “What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half derpy smile, half assessing. A look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn’t want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn’t quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn’t touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to “relearn” it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn’t interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze… all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn’t really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy’s return into unease. He seemed to “learn” little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn’t eat, and his gait didn’t improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a wobbly dachshund, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy… right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn’t well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn’t think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn’t his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy’s return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn’t want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn’t be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn’t make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn’t respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy’s teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror, if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn’t know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn’t even want to touch him. But I also couldn’t leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn’t help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet… the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a “real” dog, and now what I had just witnessed… all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn’t care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn’t even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly smiling yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn’t fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I carelessly brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn’t seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up - and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that derpy grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy’s death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy’s memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was “Billy’s” confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn’t know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn’t Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy’s memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn’t a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That “Billy” made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing, whatever it was, had realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn’t dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn’t yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of “Billy” sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn’t want to imagine what it could mean if it was “Billy.” But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn’t come from the forest… it came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn’t have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and “Billy” climbed inside. But the worst part wasn’t that he was back. It was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

“B-Billy…?” I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when “Billy” snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering “no… no…” I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my bed, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn’t want to look back. I don’t remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn’t slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying once more for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It’s ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy’s basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn’t want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy. A few weeks after the experience at the cabin, I went into the forest where we always walked and where I had buried him at one of his favorite spots between the trees. I had brought his plush dinosaur to leave at the little grave. And just as I was about to turn and head home, I heard barking behind me… far too clipped. There, on the path, stood Billy; his eyes a little too big, the grin slightly derpy, tongue hanging out, and with a look as if he were waiting for me to finally finish.",1,1768127149.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
