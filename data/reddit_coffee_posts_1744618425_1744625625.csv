1jyva7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/YearsAndYearsBBC/comments/1jyva7z/funniest_show_in_years/,Funniest show in years,"The show is brilliant. I laughed out loud frequently. The characters never have any dialogue. Instead, they complain about the shitty economy. Every scene, line and plot is the worst imaginable outcome a shitty economy could have on shitty people with shitty attitudes.

It’s like if Charlie Brooker merged ScreenWipe and Black Mirror, the result would be Years and Years.

**The good**

**Granny**

* She's a breath of fresh air in a sea of sociopaths. She knows her clan are useless scum yet loves them anyway. She's the only human character, the voice of reason and a good laugh.
* ""I remember when he confessed. He came out as though I didn’t know already. ""
* ""You look great in dungarees""
* Granny gets to live to be at least 105, outliving some of her crappy grandchildren. At 105 she has the energy of a 60-year-old.
* She's the only one who's happy. The thing that's making her unhappy are her miserable grandkids. Yet she tolerates them no matter what.

**The bad**

**Victims**

The characters are life’s losers. At the mercy of the economy with no means of escape ever.

**Rosie**

* Despite being a disabled single mother to two children, Rosie is well. She has a fantastic job, leading a team in a kitchen. She has a dedicated babysitter so she can hook up with strangers whenever she wants.
* When she loses her job, she decides not to use her considerable experience to get another job. Instead, she takes a long break, then buys a chip van from a drug-dealer. She decided that this was all the economy allowed her to do.
* She complains that the chip shop isn’t doing well, yet it doesn’t seem to impact her lifestyle. She doesn't get another job. Just sits there moaning. I’m sure his brother has contacts from his old job. They could take up drug-dealing and pretend the economy made them do it.
* When her boyfriend proposes she says ""yeah"" then starts whinging about the economy again. She must be incredible in bed.
* Her sister tries to moves out and she whines about the lost income… When her granny tries to sell the house, she complains. Until she learns granny wants to downgrade in her final year to split the money. This is deemed acceptable.
* She even complains when medicine cures spina bifida. Nothing is good enough for this woman. I'll bet she isn't disabled. Just can't be bothered to walk, because of the economy.

**Steven**

* Steven loses his job as a banker. Rather than getting another job, he works many low-paid jobs instead. They downgrade by living in his granny’s house. They have 85,000 pounds from their old lives. He works 5 jobs Celeste works 3. They have no rent and few overheads. Despite this they’re still completely broke. They must have a cocaine or gambling addiction off-screen.
* Despite all the downsizing and extra jobs, he’s still desperate for money. He winds up working for one of the devil’s minions. He works even more hours and has even less money. He even lets his boss lick him and threaten to shag his ex-wife. Because of the economy.
* He winds up living in his girlfriend’s house. She lives in a one bed flat which is all she can afford. Because of the economy. They have to live with each other, even though they hate each other. Because of the economy. Despite now having two incomes that flat, they’re still broke and miserable. Perhaps they bonded over their mutual gambling addiction and nothing else.
* He didn’t invest in property or a pension while he was working. He’s clearly a useless financial planner. Again, it’s because of the economy.
* At one point he runs over a delivery driver's bike because it reminds him of his dad. His siblings say nothing. It’s because of the economy.

**Celeste**

* I detest Celeste. Unlike the other characters who blame the economy for her life circumstances, she blames Steve. For everything. The economic crash is his fault. Not being able to make ends meet despite them working 5 jobs between them is Steve’s fault.
* Her being a bitch to him is his fault. Him obviously starting an affair in front of her is his fault. Her telling the kids and his family all the gory details is again his fault.
* Like her husband and SIL, she has no idea how to function in the working world. When she loses her job, she takes it as a sign from the economy that she isn't meant to be an accountant. Instead, she works as a bookkeeper. Which is totally different from being an accountant.
* Like her husband, she didn’t invest in property or a pension. Like her husband, she’s shit at her job.
* Celeste's hatred for Granny is palpable. The reason for such animosity is never explained. Even when she lets Celeste and her adult children live in her home rent free, Celeste still openly hates her.
* She resents having to tolerate granny in her own home. Even after an eye operation to save her sight, Celeste hates having to look after her. Despite being 90, temporarily blind and her savior, Celeste draws the line at kindness and compassion. No-one can call her soft.
* Celeste clearly hates Steven and his family. She clearly has no family or friends of her own. Steven’s family rescue her and support her in her time of need during her split from Steven. Yet she openly hates all of them while clinging desperately to them like a parasite. Why? The economy.

**Dan**

He is my favourite character despite being a complete arsehole. When he thinks it’s the end of the world, he leaves his husband in seconds. So he can shack up with an asylum seeker.

We’re never told what it Dan is drawn to.

* Is it Viktor’s handsome face, cool brown eyes?
* His desperation after having to leave for fear of prison or death, in favour of a life that’s only marginally better?
* Is it because Dan is in a superior position and Viktor can’t say no?

We never see Dan make efforts to rescue other asylum seekers. Just the one he thinks is hot. Far from the romance it’s portrayed, i's more like Stockhom Syndrome or The Handmaid’s Tale. Viktor has no choice.

Dan’s charisma and likability make us overlook how horrible he is to Ralph, Viktor and his family.

**Edith**

* Crazy as a sack of weasels. She drew a knife on her sister’s boyfriend. And accuses him of being a kiddy fiddler…. All he did was offer to make her coffee!
* Despite being a homeland terrorist, she gets uploaded to the web. What a dumb idea.
* She regularly uses her niece and nephew to scam and break laws. Yet threatens the boyfriend.

**Bethany:**

* I liked the irony of her wanting to live forever. Yet she doesn’t live at all. Stuck online all the time. I think that message was intended.
* What I didn’t like was the government giving her full access to everything.
* When Bethany paid to blind her friend, neither her or her mum care. They’re happy that Bethany is ok. Their sociopathy is transparent in that scene.

**Viktor**

* When Viktor meets an old friend at a refugee camp, he complains that people don’t remember phone numbers any more. The cringe scene exists purely to make that point.

The show is about what misery guts the Lyons family are. If the economy tanks, we’ll all be fine. Provided we don’t make the worst possible decision in every moment, we won’t end up like them.",1,1744625316.0,YearsAndYearsBBC,0,1.0,False

I 20(F) was visitng my mom in miami after a pretty fresh break up, so naturally I got on hinge to distract myself. I matched with this guy who we'll call Joe 21(M), his profile seemed pretty normal, we got to chatting and the conversation was good. He seemed to speak very good english based on his replies which were very long and detailed (this is important), so we decicded to go out on a date. I didn't have access to a veichle since my mom's car is standarded and I wasn't confident enough to drive it on the roads down there, so he offered to pick me up. We chose to go to a coffee shop inside an outdoor mall 30 minutes away from where I was satying. He picks me up and I get in the car, as he starts driving I come to realize this man doesnt speak a lick of english. It's extremly broken mixed with a thick colombian accent. One thing about me is I. can't. do. accents. I can barely understand people who speak perfect english, partly casue I'm just stupid. So I start to panic, cause now I'm trapped in a car with this man for the next 30 minutes awkwardly trying to not only understand him but to make converstaion as well. After a very long and painful car ride we finally get to our destination. We walk in and all I'm thinking is how can I get myself out of this situtation. He then turned to me and in spainsh said soemthing along the lines of ""i'm going to use the washroom"" idk I heared el baño and assumed. He then walks away and into the washroom. In that moment I didn't really think I just ran. As fast and as far as I could through the mall into the american version of the hudson bay. I finally get outside, book an uber home, and leave. I sent him a message on hinge saying I had an emrgency and had to leave and then unmatched with him. I know I sound like a total bitch which granted in that moment I probably was, I just didnt know how I could sit through a date barely understanding a single word that would have come out of his mouth, I also didn't want to offend or anger him since he was taking me home, and I was unfamilliar with where I was.

## Understanding the Importance of Your Frigidaire Water Filter

Before diving into specific models, let's emphasize why replacing your Frigidaire refrigerator water filter regularly is crucial. A high-quality water filter significantly contributes to:

   **Improved Water Quality:** Frigidaire water filters are designed to reduce contaminants like chlorine, lead, mercury, pesticides, and other harmful substances, resulting in cleaner and better-tasting water.

## Top Frigidaire Water Filter models in 2025: A Detailed Comparison

   **Frigidaire puresource 3 (WF3CB):** This filter provides basic filtration, removing chlorine taste and odor and sediment. It's a budget-friendly option suitable for homes with relatively clean water sources.if you are primarily concerned with taste and odor, consider this filter.

These compatible filters often offer meaningful cost savings. Though, it's crucial to research and choose reputable brands that meet NSF standards to ensure safety and effectiveness. Look for certifications to confirm the filter’s performance claims.

## Selecting the Right Frigidaire Water Filter for Your Needs

Choosing the right Frigidaire water filter depends on several factors:

   **Refrigerator Model:** Always check your refrigerator's user manual or the existing filter to determine the correct filter model number. Using the wrong filter can lead to leaks or improper filtration.
   **Water Quality:** If your water source has high levels of sediment or specific contaminants, choose a filter with advanced filtration capabilities, such as the PureSource Ultra II.
   **budget:** Frigidaire water filter price points vary considerably. Determine your budget and compare the features and performance of filters within your price range. Look out for a Frigidaire water filter sale to maximize savings.

1jyv20c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1jyv20c/was_i_wrongfully_fired/,Was I wrongfully fired?,"Hi guys, title is a bit flashy so it looks better. I wasn't 'fired' but rather my probation was closed and I was dismissed after only a month. It's a bit of a long story, but I'll try my best to condense it down.

I started working in the Costa in my local hospital on the 17th of March. It was my first proper barista job, and it was 30 hours a week. The team is all female and I was the only male, everyone seemed nice enough. Definitely felt like there was a bit of a 'clique', but what work place doesn't have one when you're a new person. There were two managers, I won't use their real names so lets just call them Sophie and Donna. Sophie was the store manager, and Donna was the assistant manager. Donna is the girlfriend of Sophie's son, so a bit of nepotism there! Donna never really seemed like she liked me either, she was always silent around me.

Everything seemed to be going well, or so I thought. I was learning drinks, learning till, doing all that. I got told to do some online training, but it wasn't made clear what it was exactly. I now know that there were TWO kinds of allergen training, one for Compass Group, and one for MyCosta. I did all the Compass Group ones, and told them that I had completed it. The Compass Group one included allergy training, so I thought it was done.

The first problem arose the day after doing a close. This was my second week in. Most of my closes had been with only one other person, and everyone on the team kept saying how since I am new there needs to be three people on the close, one to get on with doing close things, and the other to babysit me essentially, and go through with me what is expected of me on a close. My closes were mostly with a girl named Sally (not real name). Sally was good, probably the best worker there, but her problem was that she wouldn't tell me exactly why she does some things, or does some things for the close and not tell me. 2 weeks in I did a close with a different girl, Kate we'll call her. Kate must have just assumed I knew everything, so left me to stay behind bar to do close stuff there. and I did everything I had been shown and told to do. I wiped down. swept, mopped, cleaned the coffee machine, refilled lids and cups etc. The next morning I get this message on the group chat from Sophie.

""Hi team

Had a really bad close last night I will be speaking to everyone about this to make sure we know what is expected on a close.

Also we are a team we all help each other when things need doing. We all need to care and have pride in our work if not maybe this might not be the right job for you please think about this as it makes it harder for everybody else 😊""

I was quite offended by this message really, I obviously don't mind that she said that my close was bad, I want to learn and do better, but the bit at the end about it not being the right job? That was clearly aimed at me and was quite rude really. Not only that but she didn't say what I did wrong exactly on the group chat. I went in the next day and she called me in for a chat. She really was making it sound like I had just been lazy and not done the work that was required of me. I told her that this is not the case, and that I did everything I thought needed to be done, and anything I didn't do that was to standard I didn't do because I hadn't been shown. She was going on about how it seems like I don't take this job 'seriously' which I have no idea what she meant by, I was genuinely probably the most serious person on the team when it came to work, because I wanted to impress my managers. I apologised for doing a bad close and asked for more training on the close.

She also was saying how Donna was complaining about me, I was quite shocked because Donna had told me the other day that I was doing really well. She said that I was not taking 'orders' very well. I asked her to expand on that and she said that when Donna says to me 'do you want to go on your break' I usually say 'yeah I'll go in 10 minutes or so' and then that's the end of the conversation. Sophie was saying how when she says for me to go on break, I need to go on break. I said that that's fine, but Donna doesn't really 'ask' me to go on break, she always poses it as a question. When I asked her what other problems there were, she said there was nothing, which felt really weird because it felt like this big conversation should be happening to someone who's done many things wrong.

To be fair, I did receive better training on close, Sally was showing me more in detail, but I couldn't help but feel like she was being short and sharp with me, maybe she was offended at me saying to Sophie about her not showing me everything?

On Tuesday the 8th of April Donna asked me if I had done all the online training, I said I think I did but let me double check. I logged back in to Compass group and saw I had 4 modules that were recently added that I hadn't done. I sat down and did them and told Donna that I did them. On Friday the 11th before I was due to come in, Sophie messages me being very blunt, and asks me directly if I had done the MyCosta training as 'it is needed by law for me to work'. I said I hadn't but I was trying as we spoke to reset my password so I could get in to do it, as I didn't know what my password was. MyCosta wouldn't send me a link to reset my password, though. She tells me that it needs to be done before my next shift as this is compulsory. I explain to her that I am trying to reset my password but that I can't. She asks me how I logged in on Tuesday when I did the learning then, and then it all clicked. I told her there must have been miscommunication, and that I didn't know she was talking about the MyCosta one, when they were all along. She tells me that she was talking about the MyCosta allergen one as I need to do it before I can come to my next shift. Bare in mind she messaged me this 2 hours before my shift, and I hadn't heard anything about needing to do it to work before this point. She tells me to come in to talk with her, and I go when I'm due to work, at 12:00.

We had a long chat when I came in, and her mannerisms were of someone who was trying to be a little bit aggressive. We kept going in circles really about the allergy training. I was saying how I did do allergy training on the Compass one, and it wasn't made clear to me that there are TWO allergy trainings, she just kept saying that I was supposed to do both. She made it sound like I was again, being lazy and not doing it. To cut a very long conversation short, she said that because I had not done my allergy training, she could not let me on shift, and because I was supposed to do the close that evening, she had to shut the store early. Because of that she basically 'fired' but she used the term ending my probation. I tried to talk to her about it and give her solutions, but she was having none of it, almost felt like her mind was made up. I said to her that respectfully, this felt a little dramatic, I was saying how I fit into the team well, I enjoyed the job etc, but she was having none of it. She kept also saying how I think this job is a joke, I still have no idea what she meant by that. Truly, If I did something so wrong for her to say that, I would say it here, but I have no idea what she means, I never messed about or slacked off or anything like that, I was just doing my job for 6-8 hours a day. I pleaded with her to try and keep my job, I said that I'll try right now to contact costa to change my password asap, and she said she'll give me half an hour to do it. I emailed costa straight away and asked them for help there, but they said it'll take 24 hours+ for them to process my request, so it was over. I showed the email to Sophie and she said 'well thats that then'. I just left, didn't say goodbye to anyone, just dipped.

Afterwards I phoned my parents individually, and both of them said how she cannot fire me just because of that, and that it sounded like she was actively trying to get rid of me for whatever reason. The more I think about it, the more I can't help but agree. It felt like neither of the managers really liked me for whatever reason. I feel like a normal boss would say 'hey you have to do this training by law, I'll give you the next week to do it or else we have to take this further', and then I would have done it ASAP. It felt quite convenient that suddenly now I had to do it by law, and because I couldn't and the store would shut early it would end my probation period now. It would be super inconvenient for them, but why not get someone else to do the close if I couldn't do it? Anyway what do you guys think? Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR - Both my managers never seemed like they liked me and last Friday I suddenly had to do an allergy training by law that I didn't know about, but I couldn't access it because I couldn't change my password, so she fired me because I couldn't do the training so I couldn't 'legally' work, so she had to close to store early because I was supposed to do the close that night. Other than this I had been nothing but a good member of the team, always listened and always did what I was told.",1,1744624394.0,Costa,4,0.67,False

For anyone who doesn’t know, “Slayer” is one of the “Big 4” Thrash Metal bands and arguably, invented it, alongside Metallica (not the Metallica you hear on the radio today, but Metallica as they were in 1980), Anthrax, and Megadeth…it’s called thrash metal for a reason, it’s really hard, fast, and aggressive. “Reign in Blood” is known to be one of the hardest and best Thrash Metal albums of all time. The Walter that we’ve gotten to know over the last 2 seasons does not put me to mind of a “Slayer” fan in the slightest. Not even a little bit. I thought his and Misty’s “shared” love of show tunes was pretty credible for the guy they were mapping his character out to be. I don’t really have a theory of my own about who Walter may actually be or why he showed up when he did, for all I know he may be a totally legitimate person and is exactly who he says he is.

What do you get when two wine-obsessed wonders go full DIY with a bar build? Bouquet Wine Bar – Little Eaton’s latest glow-up.

Originally tucked inside the village, they’ve now levelled up with a slick new space featuring:

* Over 70 wines (yep, seventy)
* A fancy enomatic vending machine that pours wine by the glass
* Specialty coffee from Buxton Coffee Roasters
* Pastries, cheese boards, and cakes that make resisting impossible
* Dog- and granny-friendly vibes

Oh, and the lighting? Bang-on for sipping and smouldering. They’re calling it a wine shop and bar. We’re calling it your new happy place.

Their first event?

🎉 [Crackin’ the Wine – Saturday 19th April, 3 PM – 5 PM](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGi_4cCCkJI/?utm_source=localscoopderby.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=things-to-do-in-derby-this-week-including-giant-rabbits-purple-rain-easter-craft-carnage)  
💸 £35 for 6 wines, explained by a pro, with cheese & charcuterie to soak it all up.

Get ready to **go crazy** – it’s *Purple Rain* on the big screen, followed by an all-request Prince DJ night in the café bar. They’re decking the place out in full purple glory. Themed cocktails? Yep. Post-it note request wall? Sorted. You in that ruffle shirt your mates said you’d never wear again? Now’s the moment.

Watch Prince do his thing, then party like it’s 1999 — because it basically will be by the time you leave.

It’s loud, it’s local, and it’s absolutely free. What’s your excuse?

Ever fancied strutting into Wednesday night with more rhythm than your weekly planner? JD Dance is bringing the heat with back-to-back Bachata at The Waterfall.  
Two levels. Two styles. One big midweek mood.

Start with a free taster, stay for the sensual. No pressure, just footwork, body rolls, and a banging social after. Bonus points if you spin like nobody's watching.

Bar’s open, vibes are high. And if it’s your birthday week? Your class is on the house.

🕺 Come solo or bring your salsa-curious mates. Either way, you’re leaving with better hips and bigger smiles.

He told me ki "" Agar har koi tumhare against ho mein fir bhi tumhare sath hu. Jab tak tera baap Zinda tere ko koi tension lene ki zaroorat nahi hai . Jee nahi hua bhad mein gaya tu tension mat le .Un logo mein se kisi ne koi competitive exam crack nahi kiya hai . Meine kiya hai aur mein keh raha hun tune mehnat ki . Mein tere sabhi sacrifices se waqif hoon.""

Bache hue har din mein unke sath department ki library mein jata tha aur negativity avoid karne ke liye unke sath time spend karne laga. Hum dono roz sath mein coffee peete the aur life ke bare mein discussion karte the.

Then he admitted me to a lesser known state college. And he would often surprise me by ordering me a pizza and oranges . Meine college mein aakar mehanat ki aur ek acchi percentile le aaya .

Just wanted to share something, maybe some of you can relate. I work a regular Monday-to-Friday work-from-home job. The job’s fine, pays the bills, and I’ve got friends and a supportive family. But sometimes, it feels like life’s stuck in a loop – same routine, same Zoom calls, same group chats. It’s gotten a bit… monotonous, you know? 😅

Because of WFH, there’s barely any human interaction. If I was in an office, I’d probably bump into someone random during a coffee break and have a fresh conversation. Now it’s just open laptop, work, close laptop. Weekends come, and it’s either Netflix marathons or the same old plans with friends – movies or chilling at someone’s place.

So, I’m thinking of picking up some new habits on weekends. Something that lets me meet new people and brings a bit of fresh energy into my life. Maybe join a hobby class?

1jyus9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiverslotCommunity/comments/1jyus9j/how_to_start_a_cyber_cafe_with_sweepstakes_games/,How to Start a Cyber Cafe with Sweepstakes Games in the USA,"The market for video games is booming, and for entrepreneurs who wish to take advantage of this lucrative business, operating a cyber cafe with sweepstakes games offers a unique opportunity. Compared to traditional casinos, sweepstakes games combine fun with an aspect of promotion, so they are an attractive and often legally compliant choice in the USA. Imagine this: a cozy internet cafe where customers sip coffee, surf the web, and play exciting sweepstakes games to win cash prizes—all under one roof. It's a business model that embraces the nostalgic feel of cyber cafes with the energy of gaming, driving profitability and customer interest.  
  
If you're a small business owner or an entrepreneur, this book will guide you through everything that you have to know in order to begin a successful cyber cafe business based on sweepstakes games. From discovering what sweepstakes games are to handling legal concerns and choosing the right software, we'll guide you through the step-by-step process to begin. With the right strategy, your cyber cafe can be a local hot spot, riding the popularity of internet cafe gaming to create a steady source of income. Let's see how you can make this idea a successful reality.  

## What Are Sweepstakes Games?

Sweepstakes games are promotional games where players purchase a product or service—most commonly internet time or phone cards at an internet cafe—and receive entries to play games with a potential possibility to win prizes. Sweepstakes games are distinct from standard gambling, where real money is staked directly, as they operate on a promotional system. The customers can buy 30 minutes of time on the internet, for example, and accumulate ""credits"" for engaging in slot machine-type games, fishing games, or other interactive activities. The winners can redeem prizes in the form of cash, gift cards, or merchandise, depending on the operation.  
  
The sweepstakes games possess an appeal that they are easy and exciting. They copy the look and texture of casino games—think of spinning wheels or bright colors—but are formatted to comply with sweepstakes legislation rather than with gambling legislation. This reality renders them popular choices among cyber cafe businesses across the USA, where gambling legislation would otherwise limit gaming activity. For players, it's a fun, risk-free way of gaming fun, and for businesspeople, it's a proven method of boosting interactivity and building repeat business.  
  
## Why Sweepstakes for Your Cyber Cafe?  

So why build your cyber cafe business around sweepstakes games? It's simple: they're a money machine and people magnet. They tap into the universal need for competition and reward, drawing in a broad base—from casual gamers to regulars seeking a quick fix. Unlike most internet cafes that survive on hourly computer rentals, sweepstakes games add an entertainment element that keeps customers in-house longer and spending more.  
  
Profit is achieved through the combined revenue streams of internet time sales and the upsale of further credits for gaming. Statistics show that cafes featuring sweepstakes games can enjoy an increase in average customer spend between 27% and 62% over non-sweepstakes setups. Furthermore, the ""play-at-home"" capability made available by certain sweepstakes software companies allows gamers to play off-site, developing another revenue stream even when your cafe is unattended. For engagement, sweepstakes games provide a lively atmosphere, encouraging social interaction and repeat visits—key ingredients for a thriving cyber cafe business.  
  

## Steps to Launch Your Cyber Cafe  

Ready to get started? Starting a cyber cafe with sweepstakes games requires planning and preparation. Follow these step-by-step instructions to guide you along the way:  
  
## Step 1: Research and Plan Your Business  

Every successful business starts with a solid plan. Define your target audience—think young adults, gamers, or even retirees looking for entertainment. Estimate your startup costs, including rent, equipment, and software, and project your revenue based on local demand. A small cafe with 10-20 computers might cost $10,000-$50,000 to launch, depending on your location and setup. Research competitors in your area to identify what sets your cyber cafe apart, like unique sweepstakes games or a cozy vibe.  
  
##Step 2: Choose the Best Spot  

Location, location, location is the name of the game in the cyber cafe business. Hunt high-traffic locations like strip centers, colleges, or lower-to-middle-income neighborhoods where sweepstakes games attract frequent patrons. Ensure good power and internet availability—slow connectivity or disruptions can turn your customer experience into a sour one. A 500-1,000 square foot building is an optimum starting point, with room for computers, chairs, and a mini-snack counter to supplement ancillary revenues.  
  
## Step 3: Acquire Equipment  

You’ll need the right tools to bring sweepstakes games to life. Start with 10-20 mid-range computers—high-end specs aren’t necessary since most games run on moderate graphics. Add comfortable chairs, fast internet (at least 50 Mbps), and a backup generator for uninterrupted service. Consider a point-of-sale (POS) system to manage transactions and track sweepstakes entries. Total equipment costs might range from $5,000-$15,000, depending on quality and quantity.  
  
## Step 4: Select Sweepstakes Software  

The core of your cyber cafe is the sweepstakes software. Find platforms with easy-to-use interfaces, mobile support, and multiple games—slots, keno, and fish games are popular among crowds. Advanced software such as Riverslot offers customizable features, secure payment processing, and real-time analytics to track performance. Plan to spend $500-$2,000 on software upfront, with possible licensing fees depending on usage. Try out the software in advance to ensure it's stable and entertaining.  
  
## Step 5: Install and Test Your Systems  

Install your computers, lock them onto a network, and put the sweepstakes software in place. Test every feature—internet connectivity, game download times, and prize redemption—to iron out any kinks before going live. Train yourself or employees to operate the system, troubleshoot, and service customers. A smooth launch instills confidence and keeps players coming back.  
  
## Step 6: Market and Bring in Customers  

Spread word through a combination of offline and online marketing. Build social media presence promoting your sweepstakes games, operate opening-day promotions, and produce flyers in the neighborhood. Word-of-mouth does work—encourage early customers to bring friends with incentives such as bonus credits. Adding foods, drinks, or daily tournaments can make your cafe the center, encouraging interactions and profitability.  
  
## Legal Issues related to Sweepstakes Games in the USA
  
Navigating the legal landscape is crucial when starting a cyber cafe with sweepstakes games. Unlike gambling, which is heavily regulated or banned in most states, legal sweepstakes in the USA are regulated by promotional laws. The key is adhering to three principles: no purchase necessary (offer free entries), predetermined prizes (not random chance like slots), and disclosure of rules. This structure distinguishes sweepstakes from illegal gambling.  
  
But legality is state-by-state. North Carolina and Ohio have targeted sweepstakes cafes as loopholes are taken advantage of by operators, while Texas and Mississippi permit them with some restriction. Investigate your state law—hire a local lawyer if necessary—and acquire relevant business permits or licenses. Sweeps software may need special certifications in some jurisdictions, so check with your provider. Remaining in compliance with the law safeguards your investment and image.  
  
## Best Sweepstakes Software for Gaming  

Choosing the best sweepstakes software can break or make your cyber cafe. You need a platform that is secure, scalable, and loaded with features to attract players. Look for these essentials:  
  
User-Friendly Design: Simple navigation ensures customers of any age to play comfortably.  
  
Game Variety: A mix of slots, table games, and interactive games creates an interesting experience.  
  
Mobile Access: Play-at-home features enhance your reach outside the cafe.  
  
Security: Secure payment systems protect customer data and your business.  
  
Analytics: Live reports enable you to track profits and modify offerings.  
  
Sites like Riverslot lead the way with robust solutions specifically tailored for internet cafe gaming. They offer customizable game libraries, secure transactions, and 24/7 support—the ideal combination for new operators. Other operators like Orion Stars and Gamesauce also offer feature-rich, affordable options. Test demos and check reviews to decide on the most appropriate one according to your budget and goals.  
  
## Conclusion  

Starting a cyber cafe with sweepstakes games in the USA is an interesting venture that has immense potential for profitability and customer involvement. By combining the allure of internet cafe games with the thrill of sweepstakes, you can create a venture that surpasses others in the industry. From picking a prime location to selecting top-tier sweepstakes software, each step builds toward a sustainable operation that delights players and boosts your bottom line.

I ordered Iced Mocha in most of these cafes, while my girlfriend ordered Chocolate Frappe, so these cafes are ranked on the base of taste of the respective dishes, and ambience. Also I visited (most of) these cafes at least twice, both on weekends and weekdays.

1) Roastery Coffee House-  Taste 9/10, Ambience 9/10 (especially the seats near the stepwell)- Iced mocha was pretty good, so was the frappe. I liked the ambience, was decently crowded but not much noisy (both weekends and weekdays)

2) Half Light- Taste 9.5/10, Ambience 7/10. Both the items tasted pretty good, probably the best coffee place in Jaipur if considering taste. The Ambience was too noisy and crowded (even on weekdays). It might be good for some people who like to work from cafes, but wasn't my type.

3) Curious Life (Red)- Taste 8.5/10, Ambience-8. It used to be my go to cafe for Vietnamese brew, but it doesn't taste the same anymore (though not much difference), though still one of the best in the city! Ambience is better than Half light.

4) Cafe Quaint- Taste 7.5/10, Ambience 9/10, Iced Mocha wasn't the best, but wasn't bad either. I love the Ambience here, its quite most of the times, good for dates and long talks.

5) Coffee Sutra- Taste 8/10, Ambience 8/10. Both the items were above average (but on a sweeter side), ambience was okay.

6) Town Coffee- Taste 8/10, Ambience 6.5/10- I tried Vietnamese drip and Spicy Guava here, while my GF tried Hot chocolate. Taste was pretty good, but it is way to crowdy and noisy. Probably the most crowded of all in this list.

7) Magnolia- Taste 6.5/10, Ambience 8/10

5) NBC/LOC/Coffee Cartel- Taste 4/10, Ambience depends on branch. Is you want to have a coffee for around Rs 150 which can easily be made under Rs 20 at home with Nescafe pouch, you can go to any of these places.

she's funny, great personality, charismatic, she likes all of the same bands i like, etc. i've fallen in love with girls before but never this quickly or this hard. i asked his friend at the end of the night for her phone number, and she didn't hesitate to give it to me. we started texting about various bands we like and concert experiences. she seemed very interested in talking to me and even sent me a heart eyes emoji. then she also asked me for band recommendations.

I’ve had a Sage Barista Express since September and it’s been life-changing, absolutely adore it.

This morning I tried to switch from my usual double shot to a single shot as I’m pregnant and trying to see if reducing caffeine will stop my energy peaks and dips throughout the day. I switched the double shot, single wall basket for the single shot, single wall basket. I selected the Single basket button.

Did everything as I usually do (used automatic grind setting for portafilter) and then when I hit the Single Shot / One cup button nothing happened. Some noise, but no coffee. Tried again, same result.

Out of desperation and curiosity I then hit the Double Shot / Two Shot button and coffee started pouring. Pressure was waaaay too high, but at least I had coffee.

Any ideas? I’m using high quality Colombian beans from a local roaster. Perfect shots using the double shots but single shot a disaster.",1,1744622418.0,baristaexpress,0,1.0,False

He’s secured a coffee date with a 300 franchise brick-and-mortar business.

[Whale Client Coffee Date Set](https://preview.redd.it/ywm7jczxorue1.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2ffa7ccd421a0dbcf5df772b2064fded81e60f4)

Well done DeMarkus!

I love a dude who just gets out there and starts making offers!

I mean, look what happens when peeps take action.

This offer is 🔥🔥🔥

Btw this isn’t the first franchise I have seen closed either.

Jack over in ROYA is rolling this solution out to 300 lawyers, I wrote about it [yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1jyb64v/he_landed_4_whale_clients_without_any_cold/)

You might have heard me say it before?

Every business knows they need AI, they just have no idea what they need, or how to implement it.

This is where YOU come in.

WHAT DO THEY NEED?

Ask. Don’t guess.

But 9 times outta 10, large businesses are going to have leads they’ve paid top dollar for and haven’t converted to a sale.

So, DEMO ON ZOOM and SHOW THEM how AI can pull sales from their dead leads on a performance basis.

HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT?

The easiest way to get started is to ask the client to upload a CSV file of their old leads into a [HighLevel](http://honeysyed.com/gohighlevel) sub-account that’s in their name (this way they’re just transferring data from one CRM in their name to another)

Then, plug in the exact message flow from [The Instant AI Agency](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency) to revive those old leads and turn dead data into new deals, fast.

Easy peasy.

This is not rocket science.

Although you might just catch a rocket to the moon, if you stick with it.

Seize the day!

P.S. For those who have a keen eye you will notice that I told DeMarkus to run a TEST rather than try and roll this out to all 300 locations on day 1.

Why?

As tempting as it may seem to just crush it for this client…

… personally, I want to make sure that I WANT to work with my clients.

If they are rude, don’t move fast, and generally aren’t my type of person - I would rather not, thanks very much.

With what I am teaching here, we become the CHOOSER… not the other way around.

If you can understand this, and remove the desperation from your coffee dates, you’ll experience more hungry-to-get-started-clients than you ever have before… I pinky promise!",1,1744622398.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False

1jyuivw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jyuivw/posttraumatic_relationship/,Post-traumatic relationship,"I can't move on.  I'm not talking about relationships but memories.

I'm going to talk a little about my life so hang in there! 

I ended up hospitalized for 2 weeks in September in a psychiatrist department (I was promised 3 days...) 
At that time I was still in love with my ""ex-husband"" who wasn't yet. Given my condition, my whole family supported me to stop this charade and leave. It wasn't a life for me, I was sinking more and more... since July my best friend had been trying to open my eyes. But despite everything I wanted to believe it. 

I had started medical treatment since June. I was very exhausted, it was the first time in my life that I had taken treatment and above all, I didn't start with a small dose.
My ordeal began there (even though my life had been an ordeal for a long time. I had an emotional shock, I almost forgot everything, but everything comes back little by little, you will understand) 
It wasn't easy having to take care of a man who was a princess, a man who was a child knowing that I could no longer take care of myself. 

He didn't help me or just a little bit in the depression, just sentences and then it was ""come on, let's go have a beer with my family! I know you can't drive with your medication but don't be selfish and think only of yourself""... (he didn't have a license despite being 7 years older) 

Results my best friend took care of me, she prepared me to do activities, to come take care of my horse, go for walks in the evening, etc. 
And the final blow for Mr. she took me to see a film that Mr. wanted us to watch with HIS family. 
I was really demeaned for that, bordering on violence for a FILM (that I can watch again)... 

TW /!\ /!\ /!\ 




During these last months I had non-consensual relations... I was under treatment half asleep with my head in my ass. 
One time when I just said no, no, no but he still pushed me on the sofa.. it stayed in my head. And 2 days later one in the middle of the night while I was still asleep.... I spoke about it to my best friend who clearly explained to me that it was serious. 

After all that I collapsed, an argument broke out but I wasn't at home. By text... my girlfriend took over because my ""ex husband"" was the passive aggressive pro and I was so bad... then in the evening I slept at her house. I have never seen him since because the next day I ended up in hospital.

My girlfriend explained everything to my parents, my parents already had their opinions but didn't tell me anything. I realized that my brother too and my sister too.
My mother came to the hospital every day, my girlfriend came every other day because she was at school. 
She took care of my horse every evening.

They recovered my animals and my computer, some clothes. My mother was alone, my father had just had surgery at the same time. She wanted to come back but ALL my things were missing, she thought she was going crazy.

She made me come back another time when I left to see, but the barrel had been changed. (I terminated my bail but I still had 1 month of access + according to my lawyer I had no obligation to notify him) 


When I got to the hospital my parents took me back to protect me. I had a new hard treatment, to sleep at night and live during the day lol.  I didn't want to go out anymore, I was afraid. 
My parents wanted to go to the mountains to do mushrooms because my father was better, for fear of being alone I went with him. 

The drama has our return. 
Monsieur was there with his whole family. First shock.  My father brought me into the house. And 20 minutes later I was unconscious in my room. I suffered such a strong emotional shock according to the doctors that my body did not want to help me. Lol. 
I forgot so many details and my life afterwards but I felt like it helped me. (spoiler alert not at all) 

1 month later, a boy I knew (I saw twice in my life, but we spoke by message from time to time) 
Invites me for coffee, my best friend tells me why not because I have completely lost confidence in men and it's far from being the nastiest thing. 
I spent an evening with him, then I RE-discovered life with him, he has never let me go since. He teaches me to love myself first, he supports me in short (thank you Lord) 

But since February my psychiatrists have seen that I am doing better, so they decide to lower my treatment, so that I can drive again etc. but there you go. My brain was foggy.  It all comes back, in the night of nightmares of my ex-husband and his family. 
Innocuous gestures but which scare me. 
Memories all at once... a nightmare... night and day. 
Knowing that I had to file a complaint because of the 100 emails (yes lex husband won't give up) I re-read everything with the police, still a shock... 
It haunts me. I don't want to go out anymore. My boyfriend's solution is to move for my ""safety"" 

I spoke about it with my doctors who told me about the trauma because he knows things have happened more or less serious... 
Except that now it's April, nothing has changed, they're going to give me a new treatment again... 
I'm losing a little freedom again but now I'm lucky to have good support... 
But everyone comes back... 


When will I be able to get everyone out of my head??? 
When will it finally disappear into nothingness. I'm afraid he'll stay in my head forever. I feel like I'm going crazy.

TLDR: Was on lexapro for over a year; suicidal thoughts got really bad out of nowhere, doc pulled me off and started me on wellbutrin. Doc said wellbutrin is usually stacked on lexapro but since i’m having the thoughts, to just taper off and switch from my SSRI to the NDRI. Thoughts are worse and feel like i’m living my life in third person. 

I read a lot of your stories, good and bad. My experience after week 1 was TERRIBLE nausea. My doctor sent over zofran. it helped for alittle but being in a car is miserable for me. I usually have motion sickness and Dramamine wouldn’t work and zofran barely did. I take them both together now and another nausea medicine at night. The first week i was so energized, didn’t nap once, was getting things done. (I was still tapering off lexapro) and then boyyyyy did the tears come. Props to my boyfriend for being there for me. 
i’ve been having super low lows and really high highs. if that makes sense. The depression is so bad. My brain feels like it’s been having a 24/7 bad headache without the actual pain???? Like the pounding/fuzziness is there. Like the brain zaps from lexapro when i skipped a day by accident but this is all the time it seems. I don’t even feel like me. I tried explaining to my boyfriend full freak out mode using two pens trying to tell him one pen is my brain over here and the other pen is my body on the other side. Poor dude probably thought i was nuts.
i feel nuts???? what???? the only pro to this is my libido is back a bit. Lexapro knocked that out of the equation (biggest reason i wanted off besides starting to get suicidal thoughts out of nowhere) 
Also i vape and that craving left week 2 (i know it’s meant to help quit, i didn’t plan on quitting lol) and i go through withdrawals without noticing so i hit my vape like once a day to not go mad, because i was getting irritable quite frequently.
AND i stopped drinking coffee. Whatever, it’s probably all good for me, although it’s what gave me joy in the morning. I’d rather have coffee than these scary thoughts that will have me in grippy socks if i tell my doctor about them. 

I just graduated school and i should be studying for this licensing exam i failed already but the motivation is gone, i feel like a failure, i need to study and focus on my future but i can’t get out of bed. I nap so much again, im only 26 and now im going on a rampage of feeling sorry for myself and wondering if anything is worth it.

Ive read that the first month on wellbutrin can be tricky for people and im wondering if i should switch meds, come off of them completely or try sticking it out and taking a xanax when im having mental breakdowns.

Do these third person, s thoughts, nausea, brain fog, 0 motivation, major fatigue issues go away? tyia ",1,1744621943.0,bupropion,1,1.0,False

1jyufub,https://i.redd.it/he60sd34orue1.jpeg,Review: Welcome to the Hyunam-dong bookshop,"When I was looking for some warm, cozy reads, I came across three titles that revolved around the bookshop theme: The Days of the Murasaki Bookshop, Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop and Before the Coffee Gets Cold.

I decided to go with the hyunam-dong bookshop on the synopsis. There was something intriguing and exciting about a female protagonist yeonju who quits her job to start a bookshop. I mean, who hasn’t dreamed of owning a bookshop café at some point?

Now, let me begin with the good things I liked. The characters made tiny improvements over the course of time in their lives emphasising that you do not have to take big steps in order to feel content. The characters always listened to other people’s thoughts without being judgmental. The book really highlighted the stress if work culture in korea. Sensitive topics like the divorce and dropping out of university were all handled well without the usual stigma. 

However, I felt there’s a miss of emotional touch to me probably cause the characters weren’t trying to connect to a deeper level and the translation felt a little bit off in many places that I couldn’t feel the warm cozy moments for a book that was rated to be a balm that heals you. 

To me, The characters were just there. They neither gave me hope nor the feeling that I need to root for them. Yeonju wanted to spin optimistic views to whoever she met when they were struggling with their own things in life. Each character had their own struggles, but I didn’t feel that any of them experienced real growth throughout the book.

Yeonju tried to keep only the books that she liked better and wasn’t in favour of best sellers as she believed that they are many better independent authors than those best seller ones. I do agree that they are many good not-so-famous ones but at the same time she not stocking best sellers and giving other alternative suggestions for the book felt like imposing her opinions on others. Not all best sellers are bad either. 

When I was done with the book , it didnt offer me what I was looking for. Ironically, the Aesthetic book cover was the only part that gave me a sense of coziness. 

I give this a solid 3/5.

Basically, I asked my partner if he could watch the baby while I jumped in the shower and he was funny about it - more context, he is very very supportive and 100% does his fair share with the baby and there is basically never any friction or resentment about childcare responsibilities, we just tag in and out as needed. 

This particular time, I had had the baby overnight and he had slept separately (he generally has her about once or twice a week, she’s breastfed and usually an ok sleeper). He’d then gone to the gym this morning and brought us coffees on his way back. He was just finishing his coffee and looking through emails when I asked if he minded if I jumped in the shower before him. It was about 40 mins before he was due to start work and I didn’t know when I’d get a chance to shower without having to worry about what to do with the baby.

He said no because he was just about to get in the shower himself and then get ready as he had a work call starting in 40 minutes. He works from home and usually leaves things until the last minute so I thought I had plenty of time, and also felt resentful that he was saying no when he had all night and the morning to himself to sleep and go to the gym, which I would have liked to do but I was watching the baby. And I thought him wanting the whole 40 minutes to get ready was mean when I just wanted 10 minutes to shower. But I did spring it on him just as he was about to get in the shower himself.

Before anyone starts talking about how he needs to work and my job is to look after the baby, I do work too, admittedly part time whereas he works full time (we both work mostly from home) and know full well about trying to juggle work and a baby, I just happen not to be working today. But I do sympathise with him that it’s stressful when baby stuff crops up when you’re trying to get your head into your work day.

Anyway, I had my shower and then he had his and he was ready for work on time, though maybe in more of a rush than he planned. But I still just feel a bit upset about the situation.

But I don’t know if I’m overreacting because as I say, he is usually super supportive and reasonable when it comes to sharing responsibilities with the baby so it could be that I’m not seeing the situation fairly (hormones, sleep deprivation etc)",1,1744621680.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.

1jyu831,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1jyu831/10_years_of_hpylori_pylera_review/,"10 years of hpylori, pylera review","My Story

My battle with Helicobacter pylori began around 2015–2016 (maybe before that). It all started after I drank some ginger tea, which triggered chronic stomach inflammation and persistent nausea. That was the beginning of a long and frustrating journey consulting multiple doctors, trying different medications, and still not finding relief.

In 2018, I finally underwent an endoscopy with a biopsy, and the results came back positive for H. pylori. I was prescribed the standard triple antibiotic therapy along with omeprazole… but it didn’t work.

In 2019, I did a second endoscopy. It confirmed that the parasite was still present. This time, I was also diagnosed with a hiatal hernia something I believe was triggered or worsened by the infection.

From then on, I turned to natural remedies: mastic gum capsules, cauliflower juice, ginger, and more. While some helped manage symptoms, none eradicated the infection.

In 2024, I developed a stomach ulcer. I’ve been managing it since and finally, after exhausting all options, I decided to try Pylera, what I now see as the last viable solution.

Why Pylera?

My research led me to understand that H. pylori protects itself with a shield that maintains a pH of 6–7, neutralizing the stomach’s natural acidity (which is usually 1–2 pH and would kill it). Pylera contains bismuth, which helps break down this shield and expose the bacteria to antibiotics and stomach acid.

My Pylera Protocol:

- Pylera: 12 capsules per day for 10 days
3 capsules every 6 hours
- Omeprazole: 1 capsule in the morning + 1 at 6 PM
- Probiotics: Taken twice daily, 2–3 hours after Pylera to restore healthy gut flora and reduce side effects. Essential probiotic strains to include:
   Lactobacillus plantarum
   Lactobacillus acidophilus
   Bifidobacterium lactis
   Saccharomyces boulardii

What I Eat:

White rice
Olive oil
Eggs
Fish
Chicken
Cauliflower juice (2x/day), powerful for ulcer healing
Ginger (once daily)
A small amount of strawberries (vitamin C helps, but too much may interfere with bismuth’s effect without bismuth you can't kill it)++

What I Avoid:

All dairy products
Sun exposure
High-vitamin C foods and supplements (they can reduce bismuth’s effectiveness
No alcohol, coffee and any food that can irritate the stomach or interfere with the medication.

Today marks my first day on Pylera. I’ll post daily updates in the comments to share how I’m doing and what I’m feeling.

From the bottom of my heart, I truly hope this is the end of my fight with this parasite, inchAllah.
If you’re battling H. pylori too stay strong, and don’t lose hope.

So have his parents and most of his extended family. We only dated very briefly 2 years ago and I got pregnant right away. He freaked out, as any person would. We didn’t get along too well during my pregnancy. After I had our daughter, we eventually agreed to try dating again because we already had our daughter. He is an amazing dad and he is an amazing partner. He will make me a cup of coffee if I ask for it, he will get me my food for me, he checks up on my throughout the day frequently, if I’m upset he can tell and will not stop asking if I’m ok until I’m actually ok, he listens to me when I have problems with my family, he worries about my health and my mental health, he even went out of his way to buy me a birthday cake for my birthday when he didn’t even get one on his birthday a couple days later (he’s not really a sweets person even), he even bought me a new phone because the battery in my phone was terrible, I didn’t even ask him, he just did. But. He is rarely, if ever, physically affectionate. He has an issue with my weight. Like it is so much of a problem, it was brought up constantly. I’m losing weight. But I can’t deny that while pregnant I gained 100lbs. I’ve since lost almost the entire extra weight, but he does want me to be smaller beyond that. Which I’m ok with. Do not get me wrong, I’m very unhappy with my weight and how I look too. But it’s such a problem for him, he doesn’t really touch me at all. I’m almost always the one initiating sex or intimacy. He hadn’t kissed me since we started to date. Told me he doesn’t kiss/wont until he felt more emotionally attached to me. He kissed me when I was pregnant, I’m assuming once he realized we were actually going to date, and I wouldn’t just eventually go away or something, he didn’t want to invest more into me emotionally. He recently kissed me for the first time in months since I was pregnant, during sex, but we haven’t since. I know some people say I don’t respect myself or I’m stupid for staying with someone like him. But he is different than any man I’ve ever met or dated. And he’s the father of one of my baby’s. He’s only ever dated one other woman, and I think she was in her 30’s and they only dated for a month. She ended up ghosting him. I’m assuming because he seemed incredibly boring and only ever wanted to talk about business. He’s changing a lot for me. He’s trying all the time for me. His family accepts me and my other kids and even tells me to call them the Cantonese names for in-laws and his aunt will even ask me when looking at baby photos if I can find my ‘hubby’, now his parents are even joking about me having another baby but this time a baby boy. I don’t know how he views me because even when he’s so attentive and sweet, he can make me feel like the most alone person in the world, and when he knows that, he feels bad, and he tries to change it. I’m not sure what I’m even talking about. I guess I’m confused. And a little sad. ",0,1744620677.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False
1jyu6ny,https://i.redd.it/xsi8uf4mfrue1.png,"3 Kingdoms timeframe is not the Fundamental Issue, But...","It's the new Civs representing short lived political entities rather than people groups.

# Disclaimer

The following post is very, very long. If you don't have a lot of time or are not invested, you don't have to read it. If you want, you can read some of the points, as some may not be relevant to you. If you do read it, partially or all of it, I really appreciate it. Sit back and relax, grab your cup of tea, coffee, or kumis, as this is gonna take quite a while.

# Why is the timeframe not an issue?

After thinking about it for a while, while I would love to see medieval Chinese content, the timeframe issue is not that big of a deal. It's close enough to late antiquity, which is already loosely reprsented by Romans and Huns (and arguably Goths, but they did survive into the middle ages as well) (and not Celts as many people think, they represent medieval Scotland and Ireland, not just the classical Celts). Additionally, given how advanced the east was back then (correct me of if I'm wrong), 3k period could fit. I mean they literally have some sort of trebuchets for what it's worth (or isn't). However...

# What really bothers...

Me personally and a lot of other people from the community is Wei, Wu and Shu representing... well, Wei, Wu and Shu. I think it really breaks the criteria for what a Civ can be, and in my opinion and the opinion of many others, it's something that sits at the very core of this game's identity, and something that hasn't been harmed in all of it's 25 years of existence, and should never have been honestly.

# Why can't we just delete the 3k Civs?

It's already been hyped, people are pre-ordering, and those of us who are bothered by the 3k civs' presence in the base game seem to be in a big minority. There may be a lot of us but we are still the minority, meaning that a large portion of the player base is already hyped for Wei, Wu and Shu and would be let down if they are suddenly removed, not to mention that a lot of them have payed from their own wallet for the pre-order.

# What about moving them to Chronicles?

Which has been a popular solution within the community, and for most of the time since the DLC's announcement, I have been supporting this idea very strongly as well. It seems like the 3k Civs are perfectly tailored for Chronicles, fitting quite well in it's antiquity timeframe, having a lot of gimmicks, and heroes. This would have been an opportunity to expand on the Chronicles gamemode, and a lot of people would be happy with that. However, it's...

# Too little too late

As I said before, it's already been hyped, and people are expecting to play the new 3k civs in ranked, which has been promised by the devs before they even revealed what the new civs would be. Moving them to Chronicles would shatter that hope for many players who really want to try the new civs and their cool new toys and unique mechanics. Moving the 3k civs to Chronicles may make a lot of people in the community happy, but may also upset just as much of not more.

# But wait..!

It's already been established that, for some reason, whether it be intentional, an error on the devs' part, or just due to lack of material and/or research, the Wei seem to represent the Northern Wei in addition to the 3k Cao Wei. This can be seen in their Wonder and castle architecture, as represented in a few posts you've probably seen already. I personally see it as some sort of a happy accident, since that means the Wei Civ could represent the Xianbei, who are a people group, and that prevents my immersion from being ruined by thie Civ, since by representing a people group it does not break the thematic integrity of a Civ.

# What is the ideal solution? Compromise!

Yes, this is not an original idea, you've seen it too in a few posts already, at least if you've been as chronically online as I have been lately, and as bothered by this issue as I am. I want to add my voice to support this idea. What is the idea? Renaming things here and there mostly. Leave the Civs mechanically as is, perhaps tweak a few things here and there, and make them represent actual people groups (e.g. Wei will represent Xianbei, aside from the 3k Cao Wei). This will also hit two birds with one stone, as the timeframe would no longer be an issue, for those who would be still bothered by it. I'll use the Wei - Xianbei example once more; Northern Wei, the Xianbei dynasty that seems to be represented by the Wei Civ besides the Cao Wei it's intended to represent, lived from 386 AD up until 535 AD. This directly fits the game's timeframe of actual late antiquity up until the actual early middle ages. Similar things can be done with Wu and Shu. How they are done is up for you guys do suggest here in the comments, and up for the devs to decide, if they do (and they should). For instance, I've been a lot of suggestions of how the Shu can represent Bai. While I would really love this to be the case, I can't really find material that confirms the Shu can do so as they are now. If you're reading this, feel free to discuss it in the comments!

# Why is this compromise the best solution?

Besides that, the other options include, Banishing the 3k civs to Chronicles, Removing them entirely from the game, or releasing them as is. The problem with all of those solutions is that they risk a divided community, and every single one of those will live a large portion of upset players, in a way that no DLC has ever done before, I am willing to wager. We have already seen all of the outrage and division between people here in this sub, and it's not something that happens often in this community, at least from what I am aware. The compromise that I can't take credit for proposing, but I definitely do support, is the only way to make everyone happy (well, almost, there's always gonna be someone who's unhappy). One group is really hyped for the new civs and would be let down if they are removed, and the overwhelming majority of this group is hyped because of their mechanics and gimmicks rather than them being 3k Civs. The other group is very dreadful of having 3k Civs in the base game, be it due to their timeframe, due to them not representing actual Civilizations rather than political entities, or any other reason (and another big one which I will address soon!).

# But I want the 3k Civs because I want 3k content in AoE II!

Which is why the new Civs can still be made to represent the 3k along with actual civilizations. Wei can simultaneously represent Cao Wei and the Xianbei, even if we change their name. How? Well, as suggested by another post, a certain player's civ name can be changed within the scenario editor (e.g. ""Sicilians"" changed the ""Normans"" in some campaign missions). This can be used to give the Civs their original 3k name in the 3k campaign, which can and should be left in game if we go by the compromise solution. Xianbei will go back to Wei, as an example. But just for the campaign. Additionally, perhaps they can introduce a new feature that changes a Civ's emblem within the scenario editor, this way they can use the original 3k emblems in the campaign but a different new emblem that would be more representative of the Civ rather than the 3k kingdom it represents in random maps, ranked, etc... This way we both get 3k content for those who want it, and don't force 3k content upon those who don't feel like it belongs in the game.

# But I want the Bai, Tanguts, and/or Tibetans!

Me too, a lot. I've been among the many people who were hyped for those Civs only to be disappointed by the 3k announcement. Tanguts seemed to have been merged with the Khitans in a weird mishmash that almost feels rushed. Bai may be arguably represented by Shu according to some people, but I admit I don't have enough understanding in the matter to tell my opinion about it. Tibetans still have no representation whatsoever (I'd probably use Khitans if I wanted to represent them in a scenario but it's a very rough fit, if it is at all). I believe it's first priority to fix the 3k controversy before we wish for any new content for the game. Ignoring this issue could have negative effect on the game's identity and community in the long run, and I don't think it's something worth risking. I do wish to mention though, that I share the hope for those civs to be represented better within AoE II one day.

# What about the heroes?

Let's address the elephant in the room. The addition of heroes to ranked gameplay may be the most controversial feature of this new DLC. They are chonky, powerful and unconvertible units that almost no one wants to have to face in multiplayer, and justifiably so. Some people are actually hyped about this feature, but it's way overshadowed by the dread of many players who just don't want this seemingly alien element in their AoE II, including myself. However, a compromise can be reached. I'll propse what is in my opinion the best solution. First of all, all civs should get their own hero unit. Second, heroes should be a gamemode, and not be in standard random maps or ranked gameplay. This way we can both enjoy experimenting and having fun with heroes without having to face them when we don't want to.

# And this is it!

If you've gotten this far, then I really hope you had fun reading my yapping 😉.

I'd really like to thank you for taking your time, I think this really means a lot for the community and that this issue should be solved before it's too late, so the more people this post will reach the better. Be sure to write your thoughts in the comments, I'd really like to see discussion about this subject here, and be free to tell why you agree or disagree, and to put your own insights on the matter!

And having that funky gut feeling on a Sunday evening.

Yeah, that sucks ... what are you doing about it ?



I think there are 2 ways of looking at things:

1) Complicated

I hate Mondays - my job - my boss - the lighting in my office - the noise that the coffee machine makes - the keyboard sound of my colleague - the lunch smell from that new colleague - the speed of the elevator - the angle of my chair, the angle of an angle… 

Sounds familiar ?

And if you put it to a higher perspective, you get: Monday is “The Moon’s Day” from Anglo-Saxon Mōnandæg - Moon symbols tides, mystery, far side darkness, constantly there and you can’t do anything about it

A pretty fast way to overcomplicate your life, unnecessarily. 



2) Simple

Do something about it - own it

Look at the different perspective: Moon is also a symbol of change, balance, a constant guiding light, and probably a bunch of other stuff in astrology (if that’s your deal)

If you want to hate Mondays, that’s ok and it’s only going to get worse.

Unless you do something about it



Change. Yup, that simple.



P.S. I’m not gonna say “Happy Monday” - that blows, big time :)

Hey everyone! I’m a m24 living in Berlin for 5 years, but I’ve yet to make any real friends. I’m looking to meet new people and hopefully build some genuine connections.

I’m always up for exploring new places, grabbing a coffee, or just hanging out and having a good chat. I speak English and I’m working on improving my German (I’m currently at an A2-B1 level).

Meeting new people outside of work or school can be a bit challenging, so I thought I’d give Reddit a try. If you’re also looking to expand your social circle, hang out over the weekend, or just want someone to join you for a walk or some good food, feel free to reach out!

I’m not really into clubbing, drinking, or smoking.

I’m open to all kinds of meetups - whether they’re relaxed or more active. Let’s make Berlin feel a bit more like home together!

I was made redundant in June 2024, but during that had a family member who was terminally ill and chose to take a bit of time out helping care for them/ following their death. I was still actively applying following my redundancy however, just didn’t really properly pick up until September time. In the last 10 months I’ve had the following happen:

- Countless applications, probably in excess of 600? Some more casual (hospitality, zero hours), permanent roles, Fixed Term Contracts - many with lengthy, time consuming cover letters and applications that align with my experience. 

- Had an interview with a founder of a company early on who was 15 minutes late without acknowledging, processed me to the next stage which was an hour long call with one of his investors - never heard another word from either of them (no acknowledgment, no thank you for 2 hours of my time).

- Initial interview with a role similar to my previous role. During the interview they told me they actually want me to look at a different role that was considerably less (literally my starting salary 7 years ago). I politely declined. 

- Managed to secure a 3 month Fixed Term Contract for a remote job. Absolute HELL. We had to be on camera 9-6pm even when not in a meeting, just on a continuous call so that they could make sure we were at our desks working. Crap salary but I couldn’t decline it at that point. Had to chase them for 2 months for underpaid wages after I left. 

- A one stage interview with a well known charity who started the interview with me presenting a case study task. 10 questions following that all alluded to experience I very clearly didn’t have in my application or cover letter that initially said entry level was fine for this role. Rejected on the basis of lack of experience in that particular field (charity fundraising when my background is in sales and marketing). Weirdest part of this experience was that if I had done well I would have received the job there and then from that one interview - with no feel/ understanding for the company/ meeting the team (recruitment was who I spoke to), or further clarity on the roles benefits. 

- Phone interview for a role that waited weeks to get back to me, emailed me at 5pm and told me they needed to interview me the next day ONLY which I wasn’t able to make work as I had a freelance job booked that I would lose the money for if I declined. Said they would see what they could do and sent me an auto-response a week later saying they wouldn’t be progressing me but had ‘extensive feedback’ - I asked what the extensive feedback was (considering they wanted to progress me initially?) - no response.

- At the start of my job hunt I wasn’t aware of the scam companies set up and originally entertained a few phone calls/ video calls that became glaringly obvious weren’t part of a proper business. 

- 4 x prompt responses to invitation to interview without then hearing from the company again. 

- Declined from coffee shops, hospitality and bar work (I have over a decades experience in the above as I worked in the drinks/ hospitality industry). 

The role I managed to get was a 2 stage interview process including presentation and then an hour of questions from 3 people in the company, including the founder. They are a great company and what I was looking for in terms of their values and WFH, slight pay cut but at this point it’s not important to me. The recruiter said there were 200 applicants to this ONE role. Keep your heads up out there as it really is a tough market at the moment and one I definitely under appreciated after being at the same company for 6 years.

The Neurotypical Friendship Ladder (A.K.A. “The Bullsh*t Timeline”)
       
This is the general, unwritten process people tend to follow. Not because it’s better—just because it’s what they’re used to.
We’ll break it into 5 stages, with what’s “normal” to do in each, what might overwhelm people, and how to gently level up.
     
⸻
       
STAGE 1: Acquaintance / Friendly Stranger
      
What it looks like:
	•	You see them sometimes (class, work, mutuals)
	•	You make small talk or share memes
	•	They smile and say “we should hang sometime” but never actually plan it
        
What’s safe to do here:
	•	Like their posts
	•	Make lowkey conversation (weather, music, “how’s your week been?”)
	•	Send a casual reel/meme about something you both laughed at before
       
What freaks them out here:
	•	Trauma dumping
	•	Long paragraphs about life
	•	Asking to hang out one-on-one right away (they’ll say they’re down but flake 50% of the time)
        
How to level up:
	•	Find excuses to interact in person (group study, mutual hangouts)
	•	Show consistent presence (they start seeing you as “someone I enjoy being around”)
       
⸻
        
STAGE 2: Casual Friend
           
What it looks like:
	•	You’ve talked more than a few times
	•	You might hang out in a group or message once in a while
	•	You like each other’s vibes but you’re still figuring each other out
         
What’s safe to do here:
	•	Invite them to a group thing
	•	Say “hey, I’ve been enjoying talking to you lately”
	•	Send a TikTok or voice message once in a while
          
What freaks them out here:
	•	Daily check-ins if you haven’t done that before
	•	Expressing deep emotional needs too fast
	•	Expecting consistent attention without that already being normal
            
How to level up:
	•	Suggest a chill one-on-one hang (“wanna grab a coffee after class?”)
	•	Share a slightly more personal story to test the vibe (not trauma, more like “ugh I cried over a dumb movie last night lol”)
          
⸻
         
STAGE 3: Medium/Developing Friend
          
What it looks like:
	•	You’ve hung out at least a few times
	•	You talk semi-regularly
	•	You might joke about deep stuff but haven’t gone full vulnerability mode yet
         
What’s safe to do here:
	•	Send “I thought of you” messages
	•	Ask them how they’re really doing
	•	Talk about your values or what you want in friendships (especially if it comes up naturally)
       
What freaks them out here:
	•	Assuming you’re best friends without checking how they feel
	•	Getting hurt if they don’t always reply fast
	•	Getting mad if they’re close to others too
      
How to level up:
	•	Be consistent without being clingy (think: “I’m here when you want to talk”)
	•	Start inviting them into your world (recommend a favorite movie, talk about a hobby you love)
        
⸻
       
STAGE 4: Close Friend
       
What it looks like:
	•	You can vent to each other
	•	You hang out one-on-one
	•	You know stuff about each other’s lives (exes, struggles, family stuff)
       
What’s safe to do here:
	•	Say “I really appreciate our friendship”
	•	Offer help when they’re stressed
	•	Talk about boundaries and needs more openly
         
What freaks them out here:
	•	Getting mad if they cancel plans or don’t prioritize you all the time
	•	Making them your emotional support human 24/7
	•	Expecting more from them than you’ve agreed on
       
How to level up:
	•	Be honest about wanting to grow the friendship (“I’d love for us to be closer”)
	•	Initiate deeper convos but also show emotional responsibility (“you don’t have to fix anything, I just like having you to talk to”)
       
⸻
       
STAGE 5: Ride-or-Die / Best Friend
         
What it looks like:
	•	You text like siblings
	•	You trust each other
	•	You’ve seen each other ugly-cry and still came back
         
What’s safe here?
	•	Literally everything, except maybe showing up at their house uninvited
	•	You can say “I need you” without feeling weird
	•	You can talk through conflict openly and survive it
          
What freaks them out here:
	•	Betrayal
	•	Not being included in your life after reaching this level
	•	Suddenly pulling back without communication
           
How to sustain this level:
	•	Keep communicating
	•	Let the relationship breathe without fear
	•	Show up, even if it’s just “hey, I miss you”
          
⸻
        
Tips for When You Want to Get Closer to Someone:
	•	Say it. Literally. Try:
“I really enjoy being friends with you and I’d love for us to hang out more.”
“You’re someone I’d like to be closer with, if you’re cool with that.”
	•	Match their pace, not just your desire. If they only reply twice a week, don’t message every day. Build a rhythm that works for both.
	•	Ask them what they like in friendship. Try:
“What kind of stuff makes you feel close to someone?”
“I’m someone who loves deep convos and quality time, but I know people connect differently—what’s your thing?”
	•	Be okay with some people not going past Stage 2. That’s not your fault. That’s capacity, not your worth.

1jytzjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1jytzjg/im_in_an_emotionally_draining_marriage_with_two/,I’m in an emotionally draining marriage with two young kids. Is this a valid reason to divorce?,"I’m writing because I feel like I can no longer make decisions on my own, and maybe someone here can help me see things more clearly.

I’ve been married for several years and we have two small children. The older one is three years old, and the younger one isn’t going to kindergarten until they turn two, and I’m staying at home with them. I haven’t worked because that’s what we agreed on. Right now, I’m trying to work freelance, but it’s hard, and I can’t get a full-time job until the younger child starts kindergarten after their second birthday in the fall.

My husband has had outbursts of anger for a long time. He yells at me, insults me in front of the children, and often accuses me of not respecting him and ruining his life. He’s threatened to pour the contents of the children’s potty on my head and to pour boiling water on me while the coffee was brewing. Sometimes he says he’s going to kill himself, leaves the apartment for a few hours, and leaves his phone behind, then accuses me of not supporting him enough.

When our younger child was only two weeks old, during one of his anger outbursts, he slapped me while I was breastfeeding. Later, he apologized, but I’ll never forget it. When I ask him about it, he either acts like it wasn’t that serious or says he doesn’t remember. He hasn’t hit me since, but he’s constantly draining me emotionally. When we argue, he says I won’t get the children if I ask for a divorce, that I don’t deserve them because I don’t have a job or income.

He can go through phases of regret, showering me with attention and sweet words, as if everything is fine. But I already know it never lasts long.

I know the situation isn’t healthy, and I know it’s not good for the children. Still, I keep wondering—am I overreacting? Is this really a reason for divorce, or am I just being overly sensitive? I feel like I’m just waiting for one more thing to happen so I can finally decide, but maybe I should decide now.

Six months ago, I suggested marriage counseling, but he didn’t want to. Now he says he wants us to go, but honestly, for me, it’s already over. I no longer have the strength.

I’m grateful for any comments.

I don't recall the female or male leads but the plot line included a cafe at the beginning of the story (for a few chapters) The female lead for some reason bought a small plot of land in a village away from the capital and started a cafe, where she met the male lead's nephew who was living with his maternal aunt; she neglected him as she was busy making a living. And the child got attached to the female lead. Then ofc the male lead somehow found them and he visited her cafe daily and realised he's been able to fall asleep these days after having the coffee from her cafe. Turns out she could use mana unknowingly.  Then he takes her to the capital and that's all i could remember. Ofc the Male Lead had black hair 😭",1,1744619358.0,OtomeIsekai,4,1.0,False

I'm currently on 1750mg of Keppra and 250mg of Vimpat, both twice a day. These meds are so far the most effective ones, but they make me easily sleepy and confused. 

So I'm wondering, if I take a cup or two of coffee in the morning (not at the same time as the meds), will it have any side-effect with the medecines ? Am I risking to have a seizure ? I haven't had a full-blown seizure since January/February 2024, and only had partial ones since then.

I'm not a big fan of caffeine so I'm not  talking about chugging the whole pot, but if I can not be a zombie at ten in the morning...

I'm on lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and some valdoxan for depression.

Recently started Lithium orotate 10mg - it has been godsent for general sense of well being, makes me feel normal and then some.

Added 500mg ALCAR, this thing is a beast - I move differently, I think differently, yet kinda overstimulated, had a coffee yesterday at work and had to take a benzo to avoid a panic attack building inside.

Also take NAC 1000-2000mg a day for overall symptom management and well-being, this one is old for me, tested and loved.

Started on ashwagandha as well, maybe to counteract the thyroid effects of lithium and alcar and also add some stabilizing effects and anti-anxiety that alcar seems to sometimes bring.

I occasionally take a multivitamin, magnesium citrate, iron when I feel I'm deficient and daily fish oil.

Anything I'm missing? Does it look like a sound approach? Thanks a lot :))

We felt completely trapped. That evening, he said a new place in the Old Quarter had opened. We moved again, only to find one bed instead of two (again, not what we booked). The “free airport shuttle” turned out to be conditional – only if we booked a tour through him. Then he requested payment via a third-party link outside of Booking.com.

After we stayed, we discovered our reservation was marked as “Canceled” so there was no paper trail of us ever staying there. We then decided to contact booking about this, but their customer service sucks and they never responded. We took matters into our own hands and wrote a bad review.

I'm close to 40 years old, my wife 35 years. I've been married for 10 years, my wife and I made a conscious decision to not have kids.

I/we lead a comfortable life in a tier 1 city, having jobs that give us a combined income of 8L post taxes. We have an apartment that is paid for, a car for each that are fully paid as well, my EMI was just done last year's end.  
We have a health insurance for 15L through New India.  
A term insurance through Bajaj (ULIP) with a payment term of 10 years was just completed last month, the maturity year is 2035.  
Another term insurance through Axis MaxLife payment term will end 2030 and maturity is 2040.  
Other investments over the last 10 years, we have a combined equity portfolio worth about 5cr as of now, Mutual Funds about 50L or so as per today's values; and FD's worth 25L. Some physical jewelry/gold that my wife invests in once a while.

Considering it's just the two of us, we try to accommodate two domestic trips and/or two international trips a year, probably the only big expenditure that we incur over the year. Regular expenditure would be coffee/lunch/dinners outside and some shopping here and there.

Like I said, I've been wanting to post this for a while, I just want to know where to go from here or what would you guys do if you were in my place.  
Having no kids, you could say I usually am more aggressive with investments but at the same time would like to benefit from compounding over the long term. I think I've done decent over the last decade, started with 20L and slowly kept investing over the years to where I am, but at crossroads as to what to do now (thankfully this is a good problem to have and I'm grateful for that).

This guide explores the best New York coffee cups available in 2025, considering design, durability, and overall value, helping you find the perfect memento of your trip or a daily reminder of the city that never sleeps. From classic paper replicas to modern ceramic interpretations, we'll delve into the top contenders.

[[Browse top-rated new york coffee cup on Amazon]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-care/?kw=new+york+coffee+cup)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The best New York coffee cups blend iconic design with practical functionality. The materials used significantly impact durability and the overall user experience.

**Material:** The selection of material is paramount, impacting both the cup's aesthetics and longevity. Options range from traditional ceramic and porcelain to modern, insulated stainless steel and eco-friendly bamboo fibers.

The classic paper cup, while authentic, lacks durability and is primarily disposable. Ceramic and porcelain versions offer enhanced durability and are dishwasher-safe, making them suitable for daily use. Stainless steel cups provide excellent insulation, keeping beverages hot or cold for extended periods, and bamboo fiber cups are a sustainable alternative.

**Design Authenticity:** The design should accurately capture the essence of the classic New York coffee cup. This involves faithful reproduction of key elements, such as the ""We Are Happy to Serve You"" text, the Greek-inspired pattern, or the prominent skyline imagery.

Authenticity is crucial for a true souvenir. High-quality printing techniques ensure the design remains vibrant and resistant to fading or chipping over time. Licensed versions often offer greater accuracy and attention to detail, while artistic interpretations can add a unique touch.

**Insulation Properties:** For reusable options, the ability to maintain beverage temperature is a critical factor. Insulated cups, particularly those made of stainless steel, excel at keeping coffee hot for hours.

Double-walled construction and vacuum sealing technology contribute to superior insulation, preventing condensation and keeping the exterior of the cup cool to the touch. This feature is especially important for commuters and travelers who want to enjoy their coffee on the go.

**Lid Design:** The lid design significantly impacts usability, preventing spills and ensuring a comfortable drinking experience. Considerations include the lid's material, seal, and ease of cleaning.

Lids should be made of BPA-free plastic or silicone and provide a tight seal to prevent leaks. Some lids feature a sliding closure mechanism for easy sipping, while others are designed for compatibility with straws. Dishwasher-safe lids are a practical convenience.

**Size and Capacity:** The cup's size should be practical for everyday use, accommodating a standard serving of coffee without being overly bulky. Common capacities range from 12 to 16 ounces.

The ideal size depends on individual preferences and usage scenarios. Smaller cups are suitable for espresso-based drinks, while larger cups are better for brewed coffee or tea. The cup's dimensions should also be comfortable to hold, with a handle that provides a secure grip.

Key features of the best New York coffee cups include:
 * Durable Materials (Ceramic, Stainless Steel, Bamboo Fiber)
 * Authentic Design Reproduction
 * Effective Insulation for Temperature Control
 * Spill-Proof Lid Design
 * Practical Size and Capacity
 * Dishwasher-Safe Components

Then using the Breville ""The Razor"" tool, I was able to work out the minimum clearance and therefore maximum depth.

For the 54mm basket provided by Breville, I found that the weight was 20.06g for a well-known dialled in coffee. For that 18g also produced a delicious tasty beverage.

*Sorry in advance English is not my first language.*

 TL;DR: Friend acts like a bf in a fwb arrangement, don’t know what to do about our future.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I’ve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops. 

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. I told him I understood his moves as a joke because he was talking/hooking up with other girls and I have no interest to guys like that. I told him that I didn’t want to get into a relationship and he already knew that but he said our friendship dynamic was kinda distorted and we both wanted someone to get close with (like kissing and stuff). We stopped meeting for two months because of this issue and only talked in messages. 

Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy. 

The problem is I feel like he is in love with me and only agreed to be FWB because I am not interested in relationships. He knows I am a virgin (only got intimate with other stuff with ex bf) but he is confident that it will change. I have strict rules about intimacy and not comfortable with doing it. But he says it’s okay and we will see when timing is right. We setup some rules to not hookup w/other people or talk with them, or if we met someone we will stop talking immediately and go back to being friends. No dating apps or whatsoever. But ofc if we decided to find someone we will tell each other and stop this thing right away. He says that he is not interested in anyone rn and has no intention downloading dating apps. I told him I might want to meet someone if I am ready for a relationship and he was kinda hurt and got weird that I am thinking about downloading dating apps etc. He said that I can make any rules and he is fine with anything because he feels like I might stop this if I get uncomfortable. So he told me to be the decision maker for everything and he will just follow my lead (He said bc I was talking about negative scenarios of what might happen, he thought I wanted to end things with him).

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn’t need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years). 

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don’t feel that way. We already agreed on to not catch feelings but I feel like he likes me romantically. 

Idk if I am exaggerating this so I need some advice to what to do?",2,1744618439.0,relationships,4,0.75,False
