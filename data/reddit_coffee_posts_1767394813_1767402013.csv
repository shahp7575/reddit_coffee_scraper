We spent a ton of time together and I cared about him a lot. Over time I developed some complicated feelings toward him. Nothing was ever officially romantic, but I was definitely more emotionally attached than I probably realized at the time.

Initially when I met John and we both lived in the same building I was pretty depressed and enjoyed the convenience and comfort but John spent most of his time outside of me and work going out with women (proudly with no goal of ever ending up with one and would use women for months at a time and string them along and use them for sex). He would make gross comments about how he needed a new person tonight or he hadn’t found a perfect 10 yet and would blow me off frequently for these women since I lived in the building and he said we were best to be there “when we both needed to fill the time”. 

At a point, after work he would go out with women 4-5 nights a week in search of hooking up with them (he would only do ice cream or coffee dates and invite them to his apartment) and want to be with me hanging out or joining in on my plans. We spent probably every weekend together (outside of him leaving me for a girl). I also got sick of going out with him as we would get mad at me for not being social and talking to people but we would be at the bar until 4am as he looked for the last person there to hookup with and bring him, if not he was happy to get food with me. 

Initially, we had a fight as over the summer he told me he might be interested in trying things out with gay guys now but not myself since we were too close (smart). But i was also offended it wasn’t me as the choice especially since we were so close. I realized at this point he was probably an addict and now he was going to be using gay guys how he uses women as another outlet to get out his needs and I saw him make out with a guy on Halloween. Awful. We had a conversations before this as he would say if he was into guys I would be the perfect partner and he wishes he could spend his life with me. We even talked about moving in together - it was all weird. 

Things kind of blew up when he showed me a video of himself having sex with someone and even after I had confessed that it was getting hard for me to move on from him and meet someone for an actual relationship. John often goes into depression spirals when something happens in his life or a change and after this time he ignored me and told me ignored his girl friends for about a week. 

I was out drinking at an event and after a few weeks of processing how bad of a friend he was and also my own feelings I was hurt, and uncomfortable, and instead of just setting a boundary or stepping back, I reacted badly. He sent me a picture of him and one of the girls he was ignoring instead of coming out with me after my event. I said some pretty harsh and judgmental things to him about his behavior. I also contacted two of the women he was involved with and basically warned them about him, implying he had unhealthy sexual behavior, even though everything he was doing was (allegedly) consensual.

Looking back, I can see that I crossed a line. I think I was reacting emotionally and out of jealousy more than anything else, but that still doesn’t make what I did okay.

He ended up feeling really betrayed and said I violated his privacy and trust. He asked for space and eventually ended our friendship. Now I feel ashamed, sad, and honestly just confused about the whole thing. I do miss him, but I also know I may have been way out of line.

From my side, I felt hurt and overwhelmed. But from his side, I can see how it must have come across as controlling and invasive.

So now I’m wondering: AITA for how I reacted and for getting involved in his personal life like that?

The core narrative structure early in the book is that of translating specific coffee shop tropes and conventions to a high fantasy setting. For example in the book coffee is an "" exotic gnomish invention"", the cafe becomes the hangout of magical/wizardish university students who never want to buy anything, there's a quirky lyre-playing experimental folk musician who passes a hat, pastry confections invented by a hobbitlike humanoid mouse, etc. (For the record I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy this sub!)

One thing I was mildly surprised got a mention in the book was biscotti, which I associate with 90s coffee culture, but which seems to have mostly faded in popularity in the 21st century. I'm in my 40s and have never actually eaten biscotti or known anyone who especially liked it. I was a barista for a while in the 2010s, and the shop I worked in didn't sell it.

So, like... what's the deal (Seinfeldian/Chandler Bingian tone intended) with biscotti? Was it ever a truly popular cafe menu item among actual 90s coffee shop regulars?

Hi, I need some advice, and I saw on TikTok that I might be able to find it here. So, I (female, 24) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (male, 25) for a little over a year. We met through a mutual friend (female, 27). Everything was going great until my boyfriend started spending a bit too much time with our mutual friend who actually introduced us.

They were friends before, they live very close to each other, and they go for coffee together, take walks, etc. All of that would be okay if she wasn’t a bit of a “pick me” girl. She’s had a boyfriend for a few months, but she still goes out with other men—and not just in mixed groups, but alone with up to five men. That might still be okay with me if she didn’t flirt with everyone.

My boyfriend has always kept his distance, but I feel like he’s starting to loosen up. Sometimes when we’re supposed to go out, he cancels, and then an hour later she calls me and shows me that he’s at her place.

I really love and respect both of them, but this situation bothers me a lot. I haven’t said anything to anyone except my cousin, who told me I should talk to him, but I don’t know what to say. Am I overreacting, or is this a valid reason to be suspicious?",1,1767401084.0,u_Heavy_One4331,0,1.0,False
1q2g05p,https://scitechdaily.com/dark-chocolate-compound-linked-to-slower-aging/,"Dark 🍫🌀 Compound Linked To Slower Aging (4 min read): Dark chocolate with 70 to 90 percent cocoa is richest in theobromine, a natural cocoa compound linked to slower biological aging markers and healthier cellular function | SciTechDaily: Health [Jan 2026]",">*A compound naturally found in dark chocolate may slow key signs of aging in the body. Researchers discovered that people with higher levels of theobromine often look biologically younger on a molecular level.*

**Scientists have discovered that theobromine, the same compound that gives dark chocolate its signature bitterness, may help keep the body biologically younger.**

*By analyzing DNA aging markers and telomere length in over 1,600 people, researchers found that higher blood levels of theobromine were linked to a younger biological age.*

# Dark [🌀🍫🔍](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/search/?q=Chocolate) Compound Linked to Biological Aging

A naturally occurring compound in dark chocolate may help slow certain signs of biological aging. Researchers at King’s College London report that theobromine, a plant chemical found in cocoa, shows potential anti-aging effects in humans.

The new findings, published today (December 10) in *Aging*, examined how theobromine levels in the bloodstream relate to molecular indicators of aging.

# How Scientists Measured Biological Age

Biological age is used to estimate how well the body is functioning compared with a person’s actual years lived. These measurements rely on DNA methylation, which refers to small chemical tags that act as regulatory marks on our DNA and shift gradually as we grow older.

In two major European study groups, consisting of 509 participants from TwinsUK and 1,160 from KORA, individuals with higher circulating levels of theobromine tended to have a biological age that appeared younger than their true age.

Professor Jordana Bell, senior author and Professor in Epigenomics at King’s College London, explained: “Our study finds links between a key component of dark chocolate and staying younger for longer. While we’re not saying that people should eat more dark chocolate, this research can help us understand how everyday foods may hold clues to healthier, longer lives.”

# Theobromine Stands Out Among Cocoa and Coffee Compounds

The team also evaluated other substances found in cocoa and coffee to see if they produced the same effect. The results suggested that theobromine was the compound most closely tied to the observed aging differences.

To estimate biological age, the researchers used two types of assessments. One focused on chemical changes in DNA that indicate the pace of aging. The second measured telomere length. Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes, and shorter telomeres are typically associated with aging and age-related health problems.

# How Plant Compounds Influence Aging

Many plant-derived compounds in our diet can influence how genes are activated or silenced. Some of these molecules, known as alkaloids, interact with the cellular systems that regulate gene activity, which can shape long-term health outcomes and potentially affect aging.

Theobromine is one such alkaloid. While it is well known for being toxic to dogs, it has been linked to possible health benefits in humans, including a reduced risk of heart disease. Despite this, it has not been studied as extensively as other dietary compounds.

# Questions For Future Aging Research

Dr. Ramy Saad, lead researcher at King’s College London, who is also affiliated with University College London and is a doctor in Clinical Genetics, said: “This is a very exciting finding, and the next important questions are what is behind this association and how can we explore the interactions between dietary metabolites and our epigenome further? This approach could lead us to important discoveries towards aging, and beyond, in common and rare diseases.”

Researchers including Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, a Professor of Human Nutrition at King’s College London, are investigating whether theobromine works alone or if it acts together with other compounds found in dark chocolate. Polyphenols, for example, are another group of cocoa-derived molecules that have documented health benefits and may influence how theobromine behaves in the body.

# Why More Chocolate Is Not Always Better

Dr. Ricardo Costeira, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at King’s College London, noted: “This study identifies another molecular mechanism through which naturally occurring compounds in cocoa may support health. While more research is needed, the findings from this study highlight the value of population-level analyses in aging and genetics.”

Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that increasing dark chocolate intake is not a guaranteed way to slow aging. Chocolate also contains sugar, fat and other components, and additional research is needed before drawing any conclusions about dietary recommendations.

Hey, been a while since my last post. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is I stay grounded for those who I care for. I'm blessed to be living a quiet life with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A relationship with me is one where we could either co-op a game, share a book, or have a fun day at an arcade. And one day I'd enjoy to just sit with my partner in a park field, just enjoying the peace. And if we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen. I'm also getting into cosplay (Final Fantasy, as my profile suggests), so if you're interested, we can talk about that too. I date with marriage in mind.

Currently I am a full-time honors student working towards a master's, with a long-term goal to be a novelist. I am also prepared to take editing or publishing roles. It may be a bit of a long shot, but I also would like to teach English in Japan should the opportunity present itself.

I was raised Catholic and still follow Jesus’ teachings. I believe in kindness, forgiveness, doing good, and living with purpose. My favorite verse is: Ephesians 6:17 – Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. I do take part in Catholic apologetics, and I lead with His word in mind. I'm not perfect, but I try to be the best man of faith I can be.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. And I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to a cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes. She would value things like kindness, purity, patience, honesty, and is a little playful when she feels safe.

You're in that place where everything feels pointless. You wake up and there's this weight on your chest. The future looks gray. Maybe you're scrolling through life on autopilot, wondering if things will ever get better. I've been studying this shit for years, diving into psychology research, reading everything from Viktor Frankl to modern neuroscience, listening to hundreds of hours of podcasts from experts like Andrew Huberman and Brené Brown. And here's what I found: losing hope isn't a character flaw. It's often a biological response to prolonged stress, unmet needs, or a disconnect from meaning. Your brain is doing what it evolved to do when it perceives no way forward. But here's the kicker, there ARE ways to rebuild hope, backed by actual science and real-world application. No bullshit platitudes. Just what works.

# Step 1: Understand That Hopelessness Has a Biological Component

Your brain right now is likely stuck in what researchers call ""learned helplessness."" Martin Seligman's groundbreaking work showed that when we repeatedly face situations we can't control, our brains literally rewire to expect failure. Your prefrontal cortex (the planning part) gets quieter while your amygdala (the fear center) gets louder. This isn't weakness. This is neurobiology.

The good news? Neuroplasticity is real. Your brain can rewire itself. But you need the right inputs. Start tracking small wins, anything. Did you shower today? Write it down. Ate a meal? Count it. These micro-acknowledgments start training your brain to notice progress again. Sounds dumb, but it works because you're literally building new neural pathways.

# Step 2: Find One Tiny Thing Worth Showing Up For

Not some grand purpose. Not your life's calling. Just one small thing. Maybe it's your dog who needs walking. Maybe it's a plant you're keeping alive. Maybe it's a Tuesday night show you actually enjoy. In ""Man's Search for Meaning,"" Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, discovered that people who survived the camps had something to live FOR, even if it was tiny. He wrote this after experiencing the absolute worst of humanity, and it's sold over 10 million copies because the insight is universal: meaning comes before motivation, not after.

Your tiny thing becomes your anchor. It's not about finding THE meaning of life. It's about finding meaning in THIS moment, this day. Build from there.

# Step 3: Move Your Body (Yes, Really)

I know you don't want to hear this. But the research is overwhelming. Exercise is as effective as antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. Not because of some woo-woo energy shit. Because movement literally changes your brain chemistry. It increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which is like fertilizer for your brain cells. It regulates cortisol. It gives you agency over your physical state, which translates to mental agency.

Start stupid small. Ten pushups. A five-minute walk. Put on a song and dance like an idiot in your room. The bar is on the floor. Just move. Apps like Fitbod or even simple YouTube workout channels (like Yoga With Adriene, she's got a video literally called ""Yoga for When You Feel Dead Inside"") can help structure this without overwhelming you.

# Step 4: Cut the Rumination Loop

Your brain is probably stuck in a loop, replaying failures, catastrophizing the future, running the same dark thoughts on repeat. This is called rumination, and it's toxic as hell. Research from Susan Nolen-Hoeksema showed that rumination is one of the biggest predictors of depression duration.

Here's how you interrupt it: Name it. Out loud or in your head, say ""I'm ruminating."" Then redirect with something tangible. Describe what you see around you. Five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear. This isn't some meditation retreat nonsense. It's called grounding, and it forces your prefrontal cortex back online.

Another brutal but effective tool: Set a ""worry timer."" Give yourself 10 minutes to spiral. When the timer goes off, you're done. This sounds insane, but paradoxically, giving yourself permission to worry for a set time reduces overall worry because your brain isn't fighting itself.

# Step 5: Connect With One Human (Even Minimally)

Isolation is rocket fuel for hopelessness. Humans are wired for connection. When you're alone too long, your brain interprets it as threat. But I'm not saying go make best friends. Just connect somehow.

Text someone. Comment on a Reddit post. Join a Discord server about something you're mildly interested in. Go to a coffee shop and have a 30-second interaction with the barista. These micro-connections matter. Research from Julianne Holt-Lunstad found that social connection is more important for longevity than obesity or smoking. Your brain needs to know you're not completely alone.

If traditional socializing feels impossible, try the Finch app. It's a self-care pet app that builds habits through a virtual bird companion. Sounds childish, but thousands of people with depression use it because it gives you something that responds to your actions without judgment.

# Step 6: Read This Book (No, Seriously)

Grab ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk. He's one of the world's leading trauma researchers, and this book has been on the New York Times bestseller list for literal years. Why? Because it explains how trauma and chronic stress physically live in your body and brain, and more importantly, how to release them. This book will make you understand that your hopelessness isn't random. It has roots. And roots can be dealt with.

For structured learning on mental health topics, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert interviews into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. You type in what you want to work on, like ""understanding my depression patterns"" or ""building resilience,"" and it pulls from science-backed sources to create podcasts tailored to your pace. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a calm, soothing option that's perfect for before bed when your brain won't shut up. Plus, you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it'll recommend the best content for where you're at. Helps make the knowledge stick without feeling like homework.

# Step 7: Challenge the ""Forever"" Story

When you're hopeless, everything feels permanent. ""I'll always feel this way."" ""Nothing will ever change."" ""I'm fundamentally broken."" These are cognitive distortions, and they're lies your depressed brain is telling you.

Here's the reality check: Feelings are temporary. All of them. Research shows that emotions, even intense ones, typically last 90 seconds in the body if we don't feed them with thoughts. The suffering comes from the story we attach to the feeling. Start catching yourself when you think ""always"" or ""never."" Replace it with ""right now."" ""I feel hopeless RIGHT NOW."" That small shift creates space.

# Step 8: Get Professional Help (Not Optional)

Therapy isn't some luxury. If your leg was broken, you'd see a doctor. Your brain is injured right now. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has massive evidence for treating hopelessness and depression. So does EMDR for trauma. If money's tight, check out Open Path Collective, they connect you with therapists who charge $30-80 per session.

Can't afford any therapy? Try the app Sanvello (has free CBT tools) or 7 Cups (free peer support). These aren't replacements for real therapy, but they're bridges when you have nothing else.

# Step 9: Lower Your Expectations (Radically)

You know what kills hope faster than anything? Expecting yourself to be okay when you're not. Expecting to be productive, social, happy, when your brain is in survival mode. Stop that. Give yourself permission to just survive right now.

Your only job today is to get through today. That's it. Not thrive. Not optimize. Just exist. This isn't giving up. This is strategic energy management. You're in triage mode. Once you stabilize, then you can think bigger.

# Step 10: Remember That Relapse Isn't Failure

Some days will be better. Then you'll have a shit day and feel like you're back at square one. This is normal. Recovery isn't linear. It's a zigzag. Research on behavior change shows that relapse is literally part of the process, not evidence that nothing works.

The difference between people who recover and people who don't isn't that they never slip. It's that they get back up one more time than they fall down. Be stubborn. Be unreasonably persistent. Even when it feels pointless.

Hope isn't something you find. It's something you build, one tiny action at a time. You're not broken beyond repair. You're injured and healing slowly. Give yourself the time and tools to do it.",1,1767400832.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
1q2fwo8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2fwo8,I Accidentally Became the Chosen One of the Three-State Prophecy (And All I Got Was This Stupid Immutable Ledger),"I Read a 70-Page Document About Architectural Blueprint for Ternary Logic Smart Contracts, So You Don't Have To.

And let me tell you, my friends, it was like being hit in the face with a magical grimoire written by a lawyer who'd fallen into a vat of blockchain juice and emerged speaking only in the language of ""evidentiary integrity"" and ""epistemic holds."" I'm not even kidding. One moment I was just a regular person trying to understand smart contracts, and the next moment I was thrust into what can only be described as the most complicated fantasy quest ever conceived, except instead of fighting dragons, I was fighting the concept of binary logic itself.

Picture this: I'm sitting there, minding my own business, when suddenly this document starts explaining that everything I thought I knew about computers, you know, the whole ""yes or no,"" ""true or false,"" ""execute or reject"" thing, is apparently THE MOST BORING AND INADEQUATE SYSTEM IMAGINABLE. Like, imagine if someone came up to you and said, ""Hey, you know how you've been breathing your whole life? Turns out you've been doing it wrong. You need a THIRD lung for uncertainty management.""

That's basically what happened to me. Except with smart contracts.

So there I was, innocently reading about something called the ""Ternary Logic Framework,"" when I realized I'd stumbled into an entire alternate universe where numbers don't just go from 0 to 1 like civilized mathematical concepts. Oh no. In this world, created by someone named Lev Goukassian (who honestly sounds like a wizard who got kicked out of Hogwarts for being TOO intense about magical contracts), we have THREE states: +1, 0, and -1.

""But wait,"" I hear you cry, ""zero is already a number between negative one and positive one! This isn't revolutionary, this is just... counting!""

WRONG. SO WRONG. You sweet summer child. You absolute fool. In Ternary Logic Land, the zero isn't just a number, it's a LIFESTYLE. It's called the ""Epistemic Hold,"" and it's basically the smart contract equivalent of your friend saying ""let me think about it"" except it's been formalized into an entire philosophical framework with legal standing and cryptographic proofs.

I'm going to try to explain this journey I went on, and I apologize in advance because I'm pretty sure I experienced some kind of documentation-induced fever dream.

The adventure began innocently enough. The document started talking about how binary smart contracts are basically speedrunning their way into disaster. Flash crashes! Supply chain failures! Unstable policy reactions! It was like reading a horror story where the monster is ""premature commitment to potentially risky actions."" Not exactly Freddy Krueger, but somehow more terrifying because it's real.

And then. THEN, the document introduced me to my new overlord: The Hold State.

Imagine if every time you were about to make a decision, a mystical force field appeared and said, ""Hold on there, buckaroo. Do you have EVIDENCE for this? Do you have RECEIPTS? Have you consulted the Oracle-Custodian Gateway?"" 

Yes. The Oracle-Custodian Gateway. 

I swear I'm not making this up.

So in this magical land of Ternary Logic, when a smart contract isn't sure about something, maybe the data is stale, maybe the compliance check hasn't come back yet, maybe Mercury is in retrograde, it enters this Hold state. And during this Hold state, it's like the contract goes on a vision quest. It sends out a call to the Oracle-Custodian Gateway (which sounds like either a Stargate sequel or a very fancy yoga studio), and then it WAITS. 

But here's the kicker: it doesn't just wait like your computer buffering. Oh no. It ACTIVELY DELIBERATES. It's gathering evidence. It's building a case. It's creating what the document lovingly calls ""a complete evidentiary package.""

I felt like I was reading about the world's most paranoid contract. Like, imagine if every time you tried to buy coffee, your credit card went, ""Hmm, yes, I see you want a latte, but first I need to verify seventeen things, consult three independent oracles, anchor a cryptographic proof to the Bitcoin blockchain, and get sign-off from the Stewardship Custodians. Also, I'm logging everything you're doing to an Immutable Ledger. BRB, entering Epistemic Hold state.""

But wait! It gets better! Because this isn't just about paranoid smart contracts. Oh no. This is about GOVERNANCE, baby!

The document introduced me to what might be the most elaborate system of checks and balances since the U.S. Constitution, except instead of three branches of government, we have three governance bodies with names that sound like they came from a JRPG:

1. The Technical Council (9 members, 75% quorum required, basically the nerds)
2. The Stewardship Custodians (11 members, also 75% quorum, basically the ethics committee that can revoke your license if you try to build Skynet)
3. The Smart Contract Treasury (autonomous, incorruptible, code-governed, basically a robot piggy bank that nobody can touch)

And here's where it gets absolutely wild: these three groups can't do ANYTHING without the others agreeing. The Technical Council can't just push an update. The Custodians can't just spend money. The Treasury literally won't release funds unless both of the other groups have signed off. It's like the world's most elaborate game of Mother May I, except with blockchain and cryptographic proofs.

Oh, and there's something called the ""Goukassian Principle,"" which I'm 73% certain is named after someone's D&D character, and it basically says ""don't be evil, and also, preserve the continuity between conscience and accountability."" Which, fair! But also, imagine having to code CONSCIENCE into your smart contracts. 

""Error 404: Conscience not found. Entering Epistemic Hold.""

The document kept going on about how this prevents ""institutional capture,"" which is a fancy way of saying ""stopping bad guys from taking over."" And they're REALLY serious about it. There are constitutional rules that literally CANNOT be changed. Like, written in stone. Except the stone is blockchain. You can't remove the foundational pillars. You can't terminate the system. There's literally a rule called ""No Switch Off.""

I started imagining the Technical Council as this group of wizard-programmers in a tower, and the Stewardship Custodians as paladins guarding the sacred texts, and the Smart Contract Treasury as a dragon sitting on a pile of cryptocurrency, except the dragon is actually just lines of Solidity code and won't give you any gold unless you have the right governance tokens and a signed attestation from both councils.

Then we got to the technical implementation section, and friends, this is where I truly lost my mind.

The document started throwing around code examples. Solidity code. TLA+ specifications. Something called the ""Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern"" that apparently saves you from reentrancy attacks, which sound like something a vampire would do but are actually about malicious smart contracts calling back into your contract before it's done executing.

Picture this: your smart contract is like, ""Okay, I'm going to transfer some money…"" and then BAM, a vampire contract swoops in and goes ""ACTUALLY, I'm going to call you again WHILE you're still transferring money, and I'm going to drain all your funds, mwahahaha!""

But Ternary Logic has thought of this! They have GUARDS. They have MUTEXES. They have the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which means you do all your checking first, then you change your internal state, and ONLY THEN do you talk to other contracts. It's like the smart contract version of ""measure twice, cut once,"" except it's ""check everything, update your own stuff, and only then interact with the potentially vampire-infested outside world.""

And every single one of these decisions gets logged to something called the Immutable Ledger, which is exactly what it sounds like: a ledger that CANNOT BE CHANGED. Ever. Even if you really want to. Even if you made a typo. Even if you're super embarrassed about that transaction you made at 3 AM. It's there FOREVER, anchored to multiple public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with something called ""Veracity Anchors"" that sound like they should be magical artifacts but are actually just cryptographic hashes proving that your data existed at a specific point in time.

The document explained that they use something called the ""Hybrid Shield,"" which has two layers: the Mathematical Shield (encryption for privacy) and the Public Blockchain Shield (hashes on public chains for verifiability). So you get privacy AND transparency at the same time, which is like having your cake and eating it too, except the cake is a Merkle tree and eating it involves validating cryptographic proofs across multiple blockchain networks.

But here's where things got REALLY weird: the use cases.

The document started describing real-world applications, and suddenly I was no longer in a fantasy land of mystical smart contracts. I was in a cyberpunk corpo-thriller where automated AML reporting and Basel III compliance were the heroes of the story.

Picture this scene: A transaction comes in. It's suspicious. Maybe it's over a certain threshold. Immediately, the smart contract goes, ""HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"" (Okay, it probably doesn't say that, but let me have this.) The contract enters the Epistemic Hold state. It queries external oracles. It performs sanctions screening. It checks the source of funds. And if everything checks out? It automatically generates a Suspicious Activity Report and sends it to the regulator's node. 

The regulator's NODE, people! Like the regulators are just sitting there with their own blockchain nodes, receiving automated compliance reports from smart contracts that are actively investigating financial crimes in real-time!

And if there's a sanctions match? BAM. Straight to -1. Transaction rejected. Reason logged to the Immutable Ledger. Evidence preserved forever. Court-admissible. Done.

It's like RoboCop except for financial compliance, and instead of ""Dead or alive, you're coming with me,"" it's ""Compliant or non-compliant, you're being logged to an immutable blockchain with cryptographic proofs and multi-chain anchoring.""

The green bond example was even better. Imagine you're funding a solar power project. In the old world, you just had to trust that the company would use the money for solar panels and not, like, buying a yacht and claiming it runs on solar power. But in Ternary Logic Land? 

Oh no no no.

The smart contract HOLDS THE MONEY HOSTAGE. It sits there in its Epistemic Hold state, waiting. The project installs solar panels. A third-party auditor verifies the installation. The auditor sends a cryptographic attestation to the oracle. The oracle calls back to the smart contract. The smart contract verifies the proof. ONLY THEN does it release the funds for the next milestone.

It's like having a really paranoid but ultimately well-meaning robot guardian for your money. ""You say you installed solar panels? PROVE IT. Show me the receipts. Show me the cryptographic proofs. Show me the signed attestations. Show me the satellite imagery. NOW ANCHOR IT ALL TO THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN.""

By the time I got to the implementation roadmap, yes, there's a ROADMAP, this is a whole journey, I was fully invested in this universe. 

Phase 1: Build the core infrastructure. The Ternary State Machine. The Hold() function. Get it working on a testnet. (A testnet! For testing! Before you deploy to production! Revolutionary!)

Phase 2: Integrate the Oracle-Custodian network. Get those evidence-gathering systems working. Make sure the dispute resolution flows work.

Phase 3: Set up the Immutable Ledger and the multi-chain anchoring. Make sure everything's getting properly logged and verified across multiple blockchains because ONE blockchain apparently isn't paranoid enough.

Phase 4: Integrate with governance. Get the Technical Council, Stewardship Custodians, and Smart Contract Treasury all talking to each other. Encode the constitutional rules. Make sure nobody can violate the Goukassian Principle.

Phase 5: PILOT PROGRAMS. Real world applications! Regional banks! Renewable energy projects! Electronics manufacturers! Living the dream!

The document even had success metrics. ""95% reduction in compliance processing time."" ""Zero uncaught regulatory violations."" ""Complete audit trail for all transactions.""

Zero uncaught violations! ZERO! 

It's like the document is saying, ""Yeah, we're going to build a system SO paranoid, SO thorough, SO obsessed with evidence and verification and multi-chain anchoring and immutable logging, that literally nothing bad can slip through.""

And then.THEN, the document had the audacity to include actual code examples.

I'm talking full Solidity smart contracts. Enums for TernaryState (Intent, Hold, Commit, Reject: the four horsemen of the smart contract apocalypse). Structs for Decision logs with fields like ""evidenceHash"" and ""reasoning."" Functions with names like ""resolveHold"" and ""fulfillEvidence.""

There was even a TLA+ specification! For the non-nerds in the audience, TLA+ is this language for formally verifying that your system doesn't have deadlocks or livelocks or other concurrency nightmares. It's like mathematical proof that your code won't explode, except it's done BEFORE you deploy anything.

The document described using TLA+ to verify properties like ""The contract can only transition from Hold to Commit if it has received a valid PROCEED signal from a trusted Oracle-Custodian."" Which, yes, seems important! You wouldn't want your contract randomly deciding to commit transactions without proper evidence! That would be chaos!

There were sequence diagrams showing the user calling a function, the contract entering Hold state, emitting an event, the Oracle-Custodian picking up the event, gathering evidence, calling back to the contract, the contract verifying the callback, updating its state, logging everything to the Immutable Ledger, and anchoring it to multiple public blockchains.

It was like watching a Rube Goldberg machine designed by someone who REALLY doesn't trust Rube Goldberg machines and wanted to add seventeen additional verification steps, three independent auditors, and multi-chain cryptographic proofs.

The document concluded with this grand vision of ""trustworthy, transparent, and accountable digital systems"" and ""building critical infrastructure for the digital age"" and honestly, by that point, I was ready to join this quest.

Because here's the thing: underneath all the technical jargon and the mystical-sounding names and the absolutely BONKERS level of paranoia about evidence and verification... this actually makes sense?

Like, we DO have a problem with trust in digital systems. We DO have issues with flash crashes and unclear decision-making and opaque processes. We DO need better ways to handle uncertainty instead of just forcing everything into binary yes/no choices.

And maybe, the solution really IS to build smart contracts that can say ""hold on, let me think about this"" and then proceed to think REALLY HARD, gathering evidence and building complete audit trails and creating court-admissible records and anchoring everything to multiple blockchains just to be absolutely sure.

Maybe we DO need the Epistemic Hold. Maybe we DO need the tri-cameral governance model with the Technical Council and the Stewardship Custodians and the autonomous Smart Contract Treasury that won't give anyone money unless they follow the proper procedures.

Maybe we DO need to log everything to an Immutable Ledger, forever, even the embarrassing stuff, because that's the only way to build real accountability.

Maybe the Goukassian Principle, preserve continuity between conscience and accountability, isn't just some fancy philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Maybe it's actually... important?

But also, let me be real with you: this is the most EXTRA solution to a problem I have ever seen in my life.

Like, yes, we need better smart contracts. But did we need to invent an entire framework with three logical states, multiple governance bodies, multi-chain anchoring, formal verification in TLA+, court-admissible evidence generation, and a principle named after someone who sounds like a Final Fantasy character?

Did we need the Oracle-Custodian Gateway? Did we need the Hybrid Shield with its dual-layer Mathematical and Public Blockchain protections? Did we need Veracity Anchors? Did we need the ""No Log = No Action"" mandate?

The answer, apparently, is yes. Yes we did. Because anything less would be binary thinking, and binary thinking is SO last paradigm.

I closed the document, my mind reeling, my soul forever changed. I had entered as a simple person trying to understand smart contracts. I emerged as someone who now understands that smart contracts should have three states, elaborate governance structures, complete evidentiary packages, and the ability to consult oracles before making decisions.

I am the Chosen One of the Three-State Prophecy. I have seen the light of the Epistemic Hold. I have witnessed the glory of the Immutable Ledger. I have understood the wisdom of the Goukassian Principle.

And you know what? I'm not even mad about it.

Because somewhere out there, someone is building this system. Someone is actually implementing these Ternary Logic smart contracts with their Hold states and their Oracle-Custodian Gateways and their multi-chain anchoring. Someone is writing Solidity code with reentrancy guards and Checks-Effects-Interactions patterns. Someone is setting up a Technical Council and recruiting Stewardship Custodians.

And when that system goes live, when the first transaction enters an Epistemic Hold state and successfully gathers evidence and creates a complete audit trail and anchors it to multiple blockchains before finally, FINALLY, transitioning to the +1 Commit state...

I'll be there. Watching. Probably crying a little. Definitely impressed.

Because if we're going to build the future of digital infrastructure, we might as well make it INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED and OBSESSED WITH EVIDENCE and governed by THREE SEPARATE BODIES with a CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK that CANNOT BE SWITCHED OFF.

Anything less would just be... binary.

And nobody wants that.

We have been seeing each other for coffees and drinks and occasionally chatting for the past 6 months and only kissed and cuddled a few times.

I (32 M) was lied to in both (and cheated on in the last relationship but probably in the previous one too) and was the one to break up and completely cut communication with both my ex boyfriends. And, while I now feel emotionally available again (I broke up with my last boyfriend on the Valentine’s Day 11 months ago), I don’t feel I can trust men again. Long story short, the last guy was the only person who I trusted enough to share something very intimate and so the fact that he still was dishonest and lied and cheated on me, and I confirmed that on the Valentine’s Day no less, now makes me wonder if I can ever trust a man again. I totally backed off from meeting new people after that and didn’t even have sex since breaking up because I now feel safer being alone and not letting anyone too close. And this guy I occasionally share a drink and normal conversations with is nice, seems serious and still I do seem to control myself very well and I was honest with him a month ago that I am not ready for the next step and he understands. He will definitely distance himself slowly at some point (and I think this already started - and, understandably!) but I’m just wondering how have you guys gotten over this in the past? I’m not a hookup person, not the one for open relationships, not using any dating apps and only interested into more serious connections. When I was in my 20s I was having fun with guys but those time now feel like a very distant memory to me and my life has changed a lot (for the better I hope). Well, thanks in any case I guess.

-mom and pop restaurants. Don’t want a ton of chain restaurants. Also I’d love a neighborhood coffee shop where I can work remote sometimes. 
-gay friendly (we’re two married men)
-we’re very liberal people if that matters—it seems most of Chicago is, but I understand there are pockets heavily filled with conservatives. 
- good access to transportation (we plan to sell one of our cars to just have one vehicle
-we want to be close enough to things. Or at least within 15-20 mins of concerts, nightlife, etc.
-we go abroad twice a year and travel domestically often (about every month to every other month beginning in march and ending in November), so good access to the airport would be a plus! At least with a half hour of it. 
-good dive bars or breweries
Housing - we are willing to spend $500k on a home but the HOAs scare me because some places look well priced and then aren’t at all when you factor that in. I would say overall we don’t want to spend more than $3k monthly even if we rented, but would prefer to buy a condo/townhome because we hateeeee yard work
We’re both in our mid to late thirties

We don’t want to live in the suburbs really but don’t want to be in the middle of tourists. Right now we live about a 15min uber ride from downtown Denver and can hop on the freeway in about 5 mins. 

Any suggestions for neighborhoods would be awesome and so much appreciated! Or maybe we’re just too picky and need to start talking to a realtor. Haha. I know there’s places like boystown/lakeview but they don’t seem to be in our price range or maybe I’m just not doing a great job looking!

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1767400530.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False
1q2fsda,https://i.redd.it/x3lxtmqeqzag1.jpeg,Zoologist - 10 Samples w/ reviews!,"After being stuck in customs limbo, I finally got my samples from Zoologist and let them settle for a couple of days. Perhaps I should have let them rest a little longer, as they may have more time to develop later, but I got impatient! In the review section, I'll start with my least favorite and work my way up.

Top Row (L to R): **Camel, Chameleon, Dragonfly, King Cobra, Olm**  
Bottom Row (L to R): **Orchid Mantis, Penguin, Rhinoceros** (complementary sample), **Snowy Owl, Squid**

# Rhinoceros

* **Top:** Pink Pepper, Whiskey, Coffee, Rum, Basil
* **Heart:** Leather, Incense, Tobacco Absolute, Flouve, Ylang Ylang
* **Base:** Laos Oud, Patchouli, Nargamotha, Oakmoss, Amber

I decided to try Rhinoceros first since it was the complementary sample. Initially looking at the notes on paper, I knew it would almost certainly come off as a traditionally ""masculine"" scent, but this in and of itself isn't a deterrent for me because I often like boozy, smoky scents, as well as coffee and leather. However, when I sprayed it on my skin it was *extremely* forward with the pepper notes, and I hoped it would settle into something more pleasant, but as it dried down there was this bitter earthiness about it that - when combined with the heart notes - made me feel like I just walked into a poorly-ventilated cigar bar. It's funky and rather animalic, which I expected since some people have expressed that Zoologist perfumes have a tendency to smell a bit like a zoo, but it felt like Rhinoceros and my skin chemistry combined to bring out the worst of both worlds.

# Camel

* **Top:** Dried Fruits, Frankincense, Palm Date, Rose
* **Heart:** Amber, Cedar, Cinnamon, Jasmine, Myrrh, Orange Blossom
* **Base:** Civet, Musk, Oud, Sandalwood, Tonka Bean, Vanilla, Vetiver

Camel hits the nose with heavy spice- and wood-forwardness, all but completely overpowering the top notes which may as well be the olfactory equivalent of a chain-link fence around this perfume's enclosure. As it settles it becomes less aggressive with the spices, and the arid desert air seems to creep in instead; I have never been to a proper spice market, but I can almost imagine the ambiance and slight bustle of both customers and vendors, the awareness that animals such as camels and goats are never far away, the incense and perhaps a hookah or two being shared amongst a group of gentlemen. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it feels like observing this from the interior of a well-furnished open-air seating area, I can even envision the beautiful handmade rugs. I could see how this might appeal to folks who are fans of spicy, musky aromas, I can tell it was crafted carefully and expertly, but I think it's just not my personal cup of tea.

# Penguin

* **Top:** Antarctic Air, Ice Accord, Juniper Berry
* **Heart:** Pink Pepper, Saffron, Ciste Absolute
* **Base:** Sandalwood, Musks, Seamoss, Suede

I had been interested in trying out scents that feel *cold*, since I found myself unexpectedly enjoying Alkemia's *Dust of Snow,* so I went out on a limb when I decided to add Penguin and Snowy Owl to the samples I purchased. Some said that Penguin leans masculine - which makes sense as the description in the packet talks mostly about penguin fathers - and frankly I'm inclined to agree. However, perhaps this is just my own chemistry, but Penguin on me smells vaguely of soap or cleaning products; it makes me feel like I just spot-cleaned the bathroom and haven't had the chance to air it out yet. The chemical scent does ebb away after a few minutes, and the suede and sandalwood remain steadfast, much like the penguin dad in his vigilance and months-long wait for his mate to return. Penguin is the scent of a father who - while not always the most affectionate or expressive - will do everything in his power to maintain a clean, safe home. Again, not necessarily a scent that I personally like on myself, but this is something I would recommend for a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, if only because the process of freshening up again feels that much more satisfying afterward.

# Squid

* **Top:** Pink Pepper, Solar Salicylate, Incense
* **Heart:** Black Ink Accord, Salty Accord, Opoponax
* **Base:** Ambergris, Benzoin, Musk

I was definitely expecting something more *aquatic* when I picked up Squid. Pink pepper and incense hit quickly, but past that was a very confusing journey; if you've ever ordered from a Cinnabon shop in a mall, Squid somehow smelled like that on my wrist, except without the sweetness. That's not to say that it's a gourmand in any sense of the word, if anything I get the sense of, ""look, smell, but don't eat/touch"". This perplexing, cinnamon-adjacent scent lingered even though it softened, perhaps my nose hasn't had enough experience with discerning more subtle/complex/niche notes to truly appreciate this perfume; I wouldn't say it's unpleasant or bad, but it wasn't anything like what I would have imagined just by reading the description.

# Orchid Mantis

* **Top:** Bergamot, Lemon, Dewy Green Accord, Pear, Basil
* **Heart:** Pink Orchid, Queen of the Night, Ylang Ylang, Jasmine Absolute, Rose Absolute
* **Base:** Patchouli, Vetiver, Moss, Sandalwood, Musks

If you like florals, you'll probably love Orchid Mantis. Florals are not generally what I gravitate toward since I often find they're too extreme on the feminine side, but in the interest of keeping an open mind, I picked this one up because the specific flowers listed evoke sensuality and sophistication in my mind. A spritz of this on my wrist felt like stumbling upon a grove full of carefully-tended but otherwise untouched exotic flowers & plants, it's lush, moist, even a bit humid, and one can practically smell the sunlight dancing upon the leaves; but, in this imagined scenario, it's hard to shake the feeling that you're being watched from afar, likely by something that intends to protect that grove with its life if you don't respect the pristine beauty of the space in which you tread. This scent feels pink and green at the same time, but this is no pastel pink, this is closer to a carnation or fuchsia pink, with a vibrant green backdrop. As it settles, the moss note makes itself known, bringing in a scent not unlike recent rainfall, as though the clouds had only parted mere hours before your arrival. Beautiful, enchanting even, but with an undercurrent of danger.

# Snowy Owl

* **Top:** Snow Accord, Lily of the Valley, Mint, Coconut
* **Heart:** Iris, Snowdrop, White Rose, Mate, Frankincense, Galbanum
* **Base:** Ambrette, Cedar, Civet, Musks, Oakmoss, Tonka, Vanilla

Snowy Owl is fascinating in a good way. It's definitely a cold, snowy scent, but it achieves this in a sweet, almost playful way rather than a sheer iciness. The mint and snow accord hit my nose right off the bat, however the mint isn't in any way aggressive - it's not going to smell like your dental hygiene products, essentially - but the coconut, vanilla, and various flowers take the edge off very nicely. There's a white floral quality to this for sure, but it isn't the first descriptor I'd use for Snowy Owl. It's also not quite a gourmand, even though it reminds me of non-dairy ice cream. I think the way I would liken this is like waking up on a sunny but cold morning, the bed dressed in soft, freshly-washed, cream-colored sheets, and you can see through the window that the snow is still glistening on the ground outside; it's mood-uplifting and cozy, but not so cozy that you're inclined to sleep the day away (not that there's anything wrong with that ofc). At the very least you'll want to put on a plush, fuzzy robe and matching slippers before you go about your day.

# Olm

* **Notes:** Water Cave Accord, Limestones, Iodine, Algae, Soft Amber, Sandalwood, Oily Musk, Cashmeran, Iso E Super

In my quest for a suitable aquatic, and in my intrigue for exotic & unusual scents, I picked up Olm because it offered some of both worlds. I'll be the first to say that it is strange and almost alien; the perfumer, Spyros Drosopoulos, did an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the olm - a blind, pale, aquatic salamander - and the description of it as something that is felt rather than seen is extremely apt. While on the initial spray it smells strongly medicinal due to the iodine (I would liken it to Vapo-Rub), it dries down and the limestone, algae, and cave water begin to assert themselves. Olm has extremely limited projection, I have to almost press my nose against my wrist to smell it; I would describe this as a skin scent, but the skin in question belongs to an amphibious or scaly creature whose world is nearly nothing like our own. Nevertheless, I kind of have to respect the unabashed *strangeness* of it all - if you're a fan of particularly weird perfumes, Olm is worth adding to your collection.

# King Cobra

* **Top:** Petitgrain, Mandarin, Fig Leaf, Camphor, Pomelo, Ganja Accord
* **Heart:** Black Tea, Cumin, Leather, Soil Accord
* **Base:** Incense, Amber, Moss, Patchouli, Vetiver

There was absolutely no way that I was going to pass up King Cobra, my favorite animals have been snakes for as long as I could remember, and in particular I was fascinated by cobras in my youth. I was unsure if I was going to like this one, as the notes suggest it's both earthy and green, which I don't typically wear, but the mandarin, pomelo, ganja, and black tea notes sold me. On initial spray, I get the sense that a door was flung open and through it strode an imposing individual exuding palpable authority & charisma; this is less ""king"" and more ""senior military commander"" to me, and yet as the scent itself settled, one got the sense that this individual, too, is finally able to sit down and enjoy a few comforts amidst the whirlwind of their responsibilities. A fine leather seat with matching ottoman, in a private office that while stately, still reflects that it belongs to someone who values luxury and beauty, and you've been given the privilege to join them for a chat. King Cobra is a scent for those who wish to project confidence, discipline, class, and respect, without coming off as pompous or arrogant.

# Dragonfly

* **Top:** Grapefruit, Basil, Angelica Seed, Ginger, Rice
* **Heart:** Aquatic Florals, Geranium, Jasmin Sambac, Mimosa, Orris Absolute, Rose, Violet Leaves
* **Base:** Rainwater, Moss, Patchouli, Tonka, Vetiver, Benzoin, Cashmeran

As I stated above in the Orchid Mantis review, florals aren't normally my bag, but I'm trying to keep an open mind; however, since I *am* a fan of aquatics, Dragonfly is described as an aquatic floral, and so I decided I had to give it a try. Boy, am I glad I did! This is a beautifully fresh perfume, simultaneously familiar and unique, with no singular note taking precedence but rather all of it comes together in a wonderful spring/summer symphony. The official description likens Dragonfly to the romanticism of impressionist art, and I'm inclined to agree that this smells exactly like one of Claude Monet's paintings of lily pads. Light, billowy fabrics, sundresses, a walk by the pond with a parasol, it's a freeing, dreamy, and almost innocent perfume without seeming childish. I will probably be wearing this more often when the weather warms up, and am considering getting a travel spray.

# Chameleon

* **Top:** Bergamot, Ylang, Mango, Pink Pepper, Violet
* **Heart:** Clove, Coconut, Frangipani, Jasmine, Saffron, Sea Salt
* **Base:** Musks, Opoponax, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Vetiver

Finally, my favorite of the bunch definitely had to be Chameleon. I love tropical fruit scents, but my issue with fruit-forward perfumes is that sometimes they can be too sugary or lacking in complexity; Chameleon has been blended so smoothly that while the mango definitely takes center stage, it doesn't stand alone, as the bergamot, violet, coconut, and frangipani frame it marvelously, with the vanilla being subtle enough to back it all up without evoking a gourmand. On a more personal note, this has the potential to be elevated to a signature scent, because it's just about everything I could want from a daytime perfume, and when the weather warms up I'll be able to get more out of it because I'll have more skin showing, and this is definitely a summer scent. I do wish it lasted a little bit longer, but I don't mind freshening it up from time to time.

**Final Thoughts:** My literal only regret is that I only have four of these that I can justify buying travel sized sprays of, because Zoologist offers packs of five travel samples for $240, and I don't know if I could handle waiting another month for samples, but I also wouldn't want to blind buy when the travel sprays average around $60 each. I've already lined up another eight to sample (Bat, Civet, Cockatiel, Elephant, Hummingbird, Nightingale, Panda, Sacred Scarab, and Seahorse) and hopefully I'll be able to also provide reviews of those! Maybe one of those will become the lucky fifth, we'll just have to see!",9,1767400517.0,NichePerfumes,0,1.0,False

Fortunately loads of great shops exist for this sort of thing. 

But it winds me up that certain shops on Essex Road - I'm thinking of a particular Italian deli and a certain coffee shop - mark up those prices by around 50% above the market rate for unthinking, price-insensitive customers, so the pasta that usually goes for £4 becomes £7, and the £15 coffee beans are sold for £25.

They also have over-attentive shop assistants that immediately want to help you and make it more awkward to walk out empty-handed.

Insight?  Want to know where things are breaking down and whether there are things I (or he) can do better.  I feel like I'm trying to collaborate together to come up with solutions that work for both of us, but am wondering if I'm just being too picky and need to chill out, and he feels like nothing he does is ever good enough for me.  We can't really see it each other's way.  AITAH for how I approach this?  


(I wanted to post this in relationship advice, since I don't want to view it as 'is this person wrong or am I wrong' but rather 'how can we fix this' -- but it recommended AITAH so here I am.  Sorry if it's long!)  


Context:  
My partner (39M) and I (36F) have been together 16 years. 

We've both recently come a LONG way with communication, therapy, emotional maturity, etc and things have been pretty good lately since I hit my breaking point last year and was 'done', ready to leave.  He realized he didn't want things to end and took a long hard look at himself, made emotional maturity and communication progress, and then I also realized I had a lot of areas to make progress in, too.  (Holding firm boundaries, being better at listening and empathizing with his experience, not compromising my own values for others and people-pleasing/resenting when I allowed my boundaries to be pushed, not getting emotionally triggered by things, etc.)  
  
   
Lots of progress in the past year, and things have been pretty good.  I didn't think things COULD be fixed from where I got to, mentally (being just over the relationship and him), but we're doing tentatively OK since he's been trying SO hard to be a more supportive and considerate partner, and we both have tried overall to reconnect and be healthier and change some of our unhealthy patterns.  He's a different person from who he was two years ago, it feels a lot healthier.  He's actually making an attempt to do 'stuff' around the house and correct communication breakdowns, we have a chore chart for each person, etc. 

We've had issues around chore division for years; if I asked for help he'd feel attacked (like he wasn't doing good enough), I felt like I did too much and would shoulder more to compensate when I couldn't get help by asking directly, and for many years he just didn't contribute much.  And I mean in a big way.  If I did 95% around the house, he'd do 5% and feel resentful that I didn't appreciate him more, and I had to push to get that 5%.  He always felt pressured and unappreciated and would shut down.  I always felt like I shouldered way more than I should have and couldn't get him to relate/communicate or be on the same team.  We both worked, made income, etc.  Did our best despite huge issues between us with communication styles, etc.  

Anyways, we're MOSTLY past that stage; he does maybe around 30% of what he 'should' do (that we agreed on/he established himself as a system that could work) consistently, and honestly that's better than it ever has been, so I have just accepted this is where my life is at right now and that's better than it was.  For example, we have daily and weekly tasks that we agreed on (his system), and each day I do an average of 80% of the things on my 'daily' list and 90-100% on the 'weekly' list.  (Cook meals, clean the kitchen, take care of the dogs, clean the microwave daily (for some examples) and weekly things like 'grocery shop, pick up water, vacuum the air purifier filters, etc).  I used to push to do 100% of mine but now I just don't worry too much and if dinner isn't made or I don't do all the things I'm 'supposed to' we just eat 'whatever' or I leave the dishes an extra day because I'm not continuing to overburden myself when some days I just need a breather.  I've accepted that my level of drive/function and desire to actually get stuff done is just way higher than his, and if I'm with him, I have to just accept that he's never going to be driven or a high-achiever in the same way and I have to learn to just let a lot of things go if we're going to be together.  
  
He has daily things on his chart like 'vacuum kitchen, vacuum living room, clean toilet (etc) and weekly things like 'clean bathtub, bake bread'.  So for context, he'll vacuum MAYBE 2x or 3x on a good week (not daily), he's pretty good about the toilet (3-4/week on a good week maybe?) and the weekly things, just not happening.  He deep-cleaned the tub 1x in the past 6 months (I did it twice when I finally got tired of asking/waiting for him to do it), and he has 'bake bread' on there (we have a machine) and has literally done that once (when I specifically asked him to), in the past 6 months.  (I've done it about 8 times when I think we need bread but basically it just doesn't happen that often.)

I'm not complaining, because I just stopped caring that much about what he does because it's been easier on me to just let it go rather than keep trying to change things or get him to do what he doesn't want to, and he's doing WAY MORE lately than he ever has before we almost broke up, and I'm just feeling out whether that's enough for me to just exist and have my own life and appreciate the good parts of his company as we continue to work on our lives both together and independently, for both of us to be healthier/happier.

\-----------------  
  
Anyways, sorry for so much backstory.  I know that doesn't sound GREAT but things are better than they ever have been.  To the point I want some clarity on:

He is on night shift, I work from home so we're kind of on opposite schedules.  He waited until I woke up to vacuum, to be considerate, but it's past his bedtime.  (He waited until 10am, he should be sleeping by 9am (his idea) generally).  I didn't sleep super well the night before and it's far northern winter, so it's hard for me to wake up in the AM and I usually am groggy/lay in bed a couple hours some days when it's so dark.  (I gotta put the aerogarden/6am lights back in my room to help me actually wake up, which I'll do soon.)  It doesn't REALLY matter when I start my day because my schedule's so flexible, so if I'm extra tired I just sleep in sometimes.)

I do my morning routine when I get up (usually around like 7-9 to wake up lately) and usually say goodnight to him/spend some time with him, and this morning I was trying to talk to our child (doing homeschool/homework stuff) and make coffee/breakfast/feed the dogs in the kitchen as usual, but it was difficult with him running the vacuum in the area (noise/space sharing).  Not a huge deal but it was more difficult.

So I didn't know how to bring it up because this has always been an issue if I word things wrong, but I asked if I could bring in a suggestion.  He agreed, and I said that I absolutely appreciate him vacuuming, and that it's wonderful that he's been doing it so much more often, and I'm so happy about it, so please don't take this the wrong way.  And that I know he was waiting to vacuum to be considerate and that's really kind of him, and I appreciate that he's so kind -- but how would he feel about the idea of doing it while I'm still in bed, as long as it's after 7am?  Because that way he doesn't have to stay up later than he should, we can still have some time together in the morning if I sleep late, it absolutely doesn't bother me because it's not that loud in my room and if I'm tired I'll literally sleep through it anyways, and while I'm doing my morning routine and trying to talk to our child about homework stuff, it's not in competition with the vacuum for space or sound ( because I am usually not able to be that 'loud' in the morning before coffee to talk over the vacuum and I was having a hard time getting my morning going with the vacuming happening in the same space.

So he basically said that my sleep was important and he didn't want to wake me up.  
I tried to express that I understood that, but that it literally didn't bother me at all if he were to vacuum while I'm still in bed as long as it's after 7am, and I would actually prefer it/it would make my morning easier if he did it that way.  Win/win.  Tried to see if we could be on the same page about it or come to an understanding that worked for both of us.

He basically shut down about it, and went down the path of 'No matter how I do things, it's never good enough'.  This kind of thing (people withdrawing/inability to connect/communicate, or feeling hurt when I try to problem-solve with them), ends up triggering MY dysregulation, where I feel unheard and unable to connect/understand each other, and makes me upset that HE'S feeling hurt when my intention is only to communicate and work together as a team, and I end up feeling like no matter what \*I\* do, I can't communicate properly without it becoming an issue between us or causing a disconnect/conflict when that's not at all my intention.  I reiterated that this is why I try to word things so carefully, because there's a history/pattern of this kind of shut down when I try to connect/collaborate to come up with solutions that work for both of us.

My question becomes.. how does this come across from an outside perspective?    
Should I be celebrating forward progress and just praising/being happy that he IS doing so much more than he has been, and allow things to be good?  Am I causing issues where I should just leave well enough alone, by being too picky about how things are done or allowing myself to be irritated by the noise/lack of space, when he's just doing a good thing?  Should I learn to regulate harder so I don't get triggered by the conversation not going the 'way I want it to'?  Am I being too 'my way or the highway' and dismissing his feelings about being uncomfortable vacuuming when I'm 'asleep'?

Part of me feels like, since the issue is around MY sleep that he's concerned about, it feels kind of dismissive that he hears what I'm saying, but then chooses his view of the situation as what should determine his actions.  I understand that maybe HE feels weird doing it while I'm sleeping, but to me, if I'm reassuring him that I'm totally good with that and would even prefer it, it feels like he's not actually hearing me or respecting my views on it.

But am I not hearing HIM, about how it makes him feel weird/bad to do that?

I often feel confused around things like this because I know I can be opinionated or controlling (Or I think I can?) but I feel like if roles were reversed, I would just respect what he said and do the vacuuming while he slept, because it not only works better for HIM but also literally not be keeping me up past my night-shift bedtime.

Anyways, please be kind if you can.  I'm open to changing/hearing that I'm doing things wrong, etc - and I'm just trying to get some outside perspective on whether I'm doing things that are problematic, or whether there are perspectives I'm not seeing.  I'm just a bit soft/sensitive of a person so I take harsh criticism to heart sometimes even if I know I shouldn't.

I just don't know if I should try to chill out and let the man vacuum and stop trying to adjust/control things to be more efficient or work better together, or if I'm being insensitive, or if he's being overly sensitive, etc.  Since it seems like such an ongoing communication issue, my default now is to jump back to the mindset of 'this isn't worth it; why are we fighting about something so small and simple; I would be better off alone.'  I don't SAY those things but I find myself just quickly reverting to 'naw this sucks I'm out' in my mind.  (I used to be the one to always keep trying and keep trying to reconnect/build things/be healthy together (he's usually the one to back off and be avoidant) but since the big fallout about a year ago, I'm much quicker to just get to the idea that we don't work together -- and then I feel bad that I'm being the problem for giving up.)

I feel like if we were able to talk about it and come to a reasonable solution together, it wouldn't be a fight, but as soon as he takes what I say as criticism and withdraws and starts suggesting there's no winning with me, that's when I get defensive myself, and try to continue pushing for understanding/connection, and it just ends with both of us frustrated.  If someone spoke to ME in that way (hey, I really appreciate X, but is it possible to do Y?), I would be totally OK with it -- but he always offers suggestions for me to word things better -- and no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to 'get' the right way to say things that don't cause a communication breakdown.  A big part of me feels like maybe we're just not compatible this way, because I've tried for years to find the 'right words' but I never seem to be able to do it right despite trying very hard, yet I can't tell if it's me failing to learn/figure out how to talk to him or change my communication style so as not to trigger his defensiveness or shame, or if it's him not being able to communicate or collaborate or receive suggestions for a better way to coexist in healthy ways.  It's just such a challenge between us and it always ends in disconnection and both of us feeling frustrated.

Anyways, thank you.  Sorry it was so long, it's very hard for me at times to simplify and not give too much information.

Basically we're both doing our best and trying to get along and improve, but have various issues that sometimes get in the way of healthy collaboration and communication or understanding and I'm hoping there might be some insight that could help.",0,1767400144.0,AITAH,12,0.5,False

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

It was me, my wife, and my 10 year old daughter.

i’ve flown coast to coast more times than i can count, but doing it in an rv is a completely different experience. leaving new york, it felt familiar at first. busy roads, quick stops, lots of noise. but once we got past the east coast and settled into the rhythm of driving, something shifted. days started to blend together in a good way. wake up, make coffee, drive for a few hours, stop somewhere random that looked interesting, repeat.

the middle of the country surprised me the most. ohio and indiana eased us into slower scenery, then places like south dakota and wyoming really made the rv lifestyle shine. huge skies, wide open land, and campsites where nights were quiet enough to actually hear the wind. having your home with you makes it easier to slow down and appreciate those stretches instead of rushing through them.

one thing i liked about rv travel is how intentional everything feels. you’re not just passing through places, you’re stopping, setting up, cooking, and actually existing there for a bit. on longer driving days, i tried not to overload myself with constant podcasts or noise. sometimes it was music, sometimes silence. i also used an iOS app called Roadguide that plays short facts about the places you’re driving through. it was a nice way to add context to small towns and regions without needing to stare at a screen, especially on those long, straight highways.

crossing into the west was when the landscapes really started to change. colorado and utah were unreal, and california felt like a slow buildup rather than a sudden arrival. by the time we rolled into los angeles, it felt earned. not just another destination, but the end of a long story.

what stood out to me most was how driving lets you feel the scale of the country. you don’t jump from one coast to the other. you experience the transition in climate, culture, and pace day by day. rv travel amplifies that in the best way because you’re never really in a rush.

if you’re on the fence about a cross-country rv trip, i’d say go for it if you have the time. it’s not always easy, and some days are just long drives, but the freedom and perspective you get from it are hard to match. this was one of those trips where the journey really did matter just as much as the destination.",7,1767400069.0,GoRVing,4,1.0,False

Nothing bad actually happened, but by the time it ended I felt tired. It was strange because on paper it was a good date. That feeling made me realize I might be putting too much pressure on myself instead of just letting it be a normal hangout between two people.

I really want to change that going forward. I would like dates to feel more natural and relaxed, not like I am trying to say the right thing at the right moment the whole time.

So I am curious how other people handle first dates. Do you think more about picking the right place, setting a certain mood, or do you just show up and let the conversation flow on its own?",1,1767400023.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

I’m in desperate need of advice. Two weeks ago, a Bakelite spoon burned in my kitchen, creating a massive amount of thick, acrid smoke. The smell was (and still is) incredibly intense.

Despite my best efforts over the last 14 days, the smell hasn't faded at all. It’s just as strong as it was on day one. Here is what I’ve already tried:

• Ventilation: Windows have been open 24/7.

• Deep Cleaning: I’ve washed the walls and the ceiling.

• Natural Absorbers: I’ve tried bowls of vinegar, lemon, coffee grounds, and baking soda scattered around.

• General Cleaning: Scrubbed surfaces with standard detergents.

Nothing seems to work. The smell feels ""stuck"" in the air and surfaces. Has anyone dealt with burnt Bakelite or similar plastic fires before? Are there specific products (maybe enzymatic cleaners or ozone?) that can neutralize this chemical odor?

1q2ffy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1q2ffy5/retail_horrorfunny_story_was_too_long_for/,Retail Horror/Funny Story (was too long for YouTube’s comment section),"So this is more of a saga of my time at Walmarts as an employee… I was hired on remodel crew when I was pregnant with my first kid. I was seven months pregnant at the time and hired to do overnight. But the first two weeks you do training and random crap they can find for you to do until the actual remodel managers show up to start ripping apart the store. In this time, all 5‘6“ of me and pregnant belly gets told to start stocking grocery aisles, which I obliged doing… The cart is full of stuff. The manager says just grab boxes and stock things where it’s empty. I’m working along and realize I have a lot of stuff to stock that’s on the top shelves that I can’t reach without a ladder… And these things are the big jugs of spaghetti sauce. I’m all by myself so I go and ask if I can get some help and I’m told just grab one of the ladders from the aisle it’s fine. So I start doing exactly that stocking the shelves putting up these jars of sauce there’s easily 6 to 8 jars in a box. I carry the box up, balance it and start filling the shelves. Two of my remodel crew coworkers come around the corner who are both the age of my parents and very irately tell me to get my happy behind off that ladder. I tell them I was told to do this and they tell me that they’re gonna go find one of our co-managers and very bluntly point out my condition Doesn’t allow this. So I shrug and go with them and we find the grocery co-manager who happens to have a wife exactly as far along as I am, he hears what I was doing and tells me I’m not allowed to stock anything above the third shelf if I need to lift find one of the guys. So I go back to what I’m doing and I lift nothing else the rest of the day.

When you work at Walmart, there are a lot of training they give you like pay attention to certain things and how people are acting, but they also tell you if you think someone is stealing or going to steal you’re not allowed to approach them. You need to get asset protection or a store manager/co-manager. Well, I may be a week into working here and I’m on my lunch break and walk out of the back room and see this very tall man easily 6‘8“ tall and almost 300 pounds like this guy could’ve been Hagrid‘s little brother… And he is barefoot Staring at all the sandals he’s got raggedy shorts a baggy shirt and I stopped out in my tracks because how did this man get from the front of the store all the way to the back where the sandals are barefoot and nobody noticed him? So I carefully walk over to the department manager of shoes who was a friend that I quickly made since starting and get her attention to come show her this guy casually perusing the sandals… She agrees it’s sketchy and we go into the back and try to find a store manager or a co-manager. We get our co-manager Jim tell him what’s going on and his response, “How in the hell did he get all the way back here and nobody noticed him walk in the store with no shoes on?”, My friend and I look at each other look at him, shrug our shoulders and just pointed him in the direction of our Hagrid mini me…
So these adventures started before we even got to our overnight shifts… That started about two weeks after my first shift, and when I say they hired bodies, they were just hiring anybody to fill spots. This was quite the crew and for the most part I made some friends I’m glad I made, but there were some characters I could’ve done without meeting. We were truly the misfit Island of Walmart. Our very first night we met the overnight assistant manager. Her name was Sarah and when you first meet her, she is a little rough around the edges, but this woman has a heart of gold. Just do not piss her off. Our job for that night was to take down and move this entire aisle of shelves and move them into the middle action aisle which for those of you who don’t know is that big middle aisle you walk down when you’re in the groceries Section or you first walk in on what’s called the HomeGoods side and you can make that direct shot back to electronics. So we took this whole thing down, packing up all of the food, mostly tea and coffee filters, and things like that and then disassembling the shelving unit And moving it to its new home. Then reassembling it minus about an 8 foot section of either side of what was originally there. No problem right? Wrong. The problem is we didn’t fully restock the new section after we reassembled it. We left several boxes of items because of that nice 8 foot section that was missing. Couldn’t be restocked. So I came back across Sarah who I mentioned earlier and Dallas, who was another lower manager, attempting to figure out where those items went in the shelves because they couldn’t find the tags for them and I stopped and said you might not be able to find them because they took out this big section and didn’t put it back… Sarah looked at me, looked at Dallas and threw the box she was attempting to restock. My remodel managers had not passed on the information to her or her grocery manager about them removing the 8 foot section and I being my people pleasing self apologized profusely to Sarah for making her upset. This was one of the first times Sarah told me Not to apologize for doing the job I was told to do it was not my fault. Sarah would tell me this multiple times while I worked at Walmart.

Now I mentioned the joy of disassembling the shelving units and moving them well in my fun of working while pregnant my coworkers on remodel didn’t disassemble these units in the best way and after a while I started to notice I was getting assigned to some really frustratingly stupid tasks away from everybody doing The disassembling and I finally called out my managers on this because I’d get called back at the end to join everyone else or behind them anyway to clean up the mess, they made of the restocking and I’d say how come I get called back to do this, but I’m not actually working with everyone else? And my one manager said because we don’t want you in the middle of that shit show that they make while they rip apart those shelves and not able to get to you if you fall or go into labor… I looked at them, looked at the huge circle of randomly tossed shelves on the floor around this group of 15 or so employees working on this gondola, which is what they were called as they tore it down and got ready to move it and realized yeah that was probably a really good call because I did not wanna be stuck in the middle of a bunch of Walmart shelves, possibly giving birth to my first board child.

What were some of those really stupid jobs I mentioned? Well, one night I got told to sit in the assistant manager’s office because they updated the scan in process. Which meant everybody needed a new sticker. So I sat and I made everybody on remodel crew a brand new badge.   My entire shift from my 10 PM clock in until 2 AM for break when Sarah walked in to grab something was spent making new badges at which point she looked at me and said what are you doing? I told her and she pointed out they simply could’ve taken the new sticker, covered the old sticker on everybody’s current badge and put a piece of tape over it. This was the second time Sarah told me not to apologize for doing what I was told at work for Walmart. I made about 25 badges that night.

The next really ridiculous job I got to do was babysit the open door for my entire shift from 10 PM until 7 AM so that the guys that had to come in through the back and leave the emergency exit propped open as they worked could be supervised… Yeah, that was fun. But I got some free books out of it because every time I did that I could choose a book off the shelf and store use it (The store pays for it). The first one I bought and paid for myself, Sarah saw that and told me from now on to store use them and not to waste my money since I was told I had to sit there For work… I don’t think she realized just how fast I could read at the time. But hey, I did what I was told.
One job I was allowed to work with everybody for Was the installation of the paint counter sample station. This should’ve been pretty simple, right? No drama no trouble at all just unpackaging and sticking sample cards on a display shelf right? Wrong again. We had one girl and her Little sidekick who weren’t very thrilled at the so-called special treatment. I was getting so while we were working to put these samples out. They decided to start taking the carts we had around us and start pushing them into me while I stood there, putting my sample cards up on the display. The first one I ignored it went into my back. The second one I caught and pushed away the third one slammed into my stomach, at this point I am eight months pregnant. I’m already having blood pressure issues and I turned the cart and I pushed it back and said enough. She faints innocence and says she didn’t mean to and didn’t see me there. I’m eight months pregnant I’ve gained almost 60 pounds. I’m a walking blimp. You can’t miss me. So I walk around to the other section away from her instead of starting a fight and start working on another section of samples. as I’m working on the new section her little sidekick shoves another cart into me, this time my baby‘s father who else that works on remodel sees this one gets irritated and gets one of the managers because she’s hit my stomach again. I get asked if I’m all right by the manager and we get separated to different areas for the rest of the night. Shortly after I get moved to days because it’s been deemed no longer safe for me to continue working nights. The very first night I’m gone from the night shift that same girl gets into a fight with Isaac who’s basically the non-manager manager of our remodel group, and I mean, physically knockdown drag out fight attacks him after he reprimands her for not doing her job as she’s told. She got fired on the spot.  Her sidekick followed, not too long after that.

A few weeks later, I had, my baby, thankfully my little Walmart baby was born perfectly healthy at the hospital not at Walmart but because of all my friends made during my time there she has been dubbed a Walmart baby nonetheless… They very best Story from my remodel time Happened technically after I was on remodel. My baby‘s father continue to work on the remodel crew after she was born and I left. And when she got fussy at night, I would drive her over while he was working with our little beagle who like to road trip. When he came out for his brakes or lunch, we’d be in the parking lot because most of the overnight cruise came outside for their lunches in the summertime. While we were all outside, we noticed there was a car on the other side of the parking lot that was clearly bumping and moving and totally fucked up. All of a sudden the cops show up two cars surround this car until the people inside to get out. It’s two of the regular Walmart employees, they were getting busy on their lunch break. The only problem is they’re married, but not to each other. They’re each married to other people with kids and they’ve just been caught by the police and the entire Walmart crew and remodel crew in the parking lot. 
I went back to Walmart when my daughter was six weeks old and I worked there until she was about six months old when I got very sick and lost my sight. There was a lot of drama, but generally, I really enjoyed the friendships I made with my coworkers and I miss it quite a bit. Hope you guys enjoy the stories.",1,1767399635.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Ok so it’s me again.

I just really need to hear some encouragement. Like I really need to hear it. I need a push because I know what I need to do, but it is just so hard to walk away.

Anyways…

It happened again today with my wife leaving the house with our son because she knew my mother was coming by to drop off my daughter. (I have a 15 year old daughter from a previous relationship that I have every other weekend and she was spending the afternoon with her.)

I’m just fed up with it. My parents are to the point of going off on her and her parents.

My wife’s parents and adult brother have been living with us for the past year while they look for a new house in the area since they have sold their’s.

So far there is something wrong with every single house they have looked at.

Anyways, they have access to seeing my son at all hours of the day every single day but my wife makes it super difficult for my parents to see our son.

She will literally make plans out of thin air at the slightest hint that I might take my son to see my parents or if they ask if they can stop by.

My wife will make sure we are unavailable or come of with some excuse why they can’t stop by.

She has even gone as far to say my parents only prioritize their granddaughters and not our son even after asking my parents to buy him a very expensive Christmas gift the started a fight about us going to their house for him to open it.

Like I really hate it because it makes me sound crazy even trying to describe all of this.

But she literally nearly ruined Christmas because she was telling my parents that I treat her horrible and I am the problem and I need to change.

(I made a post on here recently about when she dug her nails into my arm)

My parents are absolutely livid right now and they were trying to make peace but my mom left my house today after dropping my daughter off and called me  balling her eyes out not getting to see her grandson.

I told her exactly how it went down, how my wife took off with my son and left after I told her not to.

I don’t know.

I’m just at the end of my rope here.

After the interaction with my mom today I have avoided her and her family in my house and stayed upstairs with my son and daughter just trying to hold back from breaking down.

I really am trying to hold off until her parents buy their house nearby so that I could keep my soon to be ex-wife and my son close to so that they don’t move 80 miles away back to where they are moving from. I really feel like an ass towards her parents because they really don’t deserve this but I absolutely can not continue to live in the hell that it is being married to their daughter.

I hate the time I will miss out on getting to raise and bei with my son post divorce but I am also constantly told by my wife how to parent our son. She will ask me to watch him and then tell me how to watch him. Don’t give him this, don’t give him that. I also work a night shift (4pm to 12:30am) and she expects me to be awake at 8 am in the morning to chase our son around while she sits on the couch drinking coffee. Weekends when I am off are even worse she expects me to watch him all day.

I’m really not trying to complain about all of that. It’s just the way she does it.

I just need encouragement that I am making right decision here to go through with this divorce and any advice on what I need to do financially like freezing/injunction on bank accounts, etc.

she stays at home with our son and doesn’t work but has a masters degree in business administration. I’m a simpleton with a high school degree and an electrician journeyman card.

At this point I feel like divorce is the only way I will get any kind of autonomy on how I raise my son but I expect her to fight me tooth and nail on the parenting plan.",2,1767399555.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False
1q2feqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Question/comments/1q2feqh/how_much_are_you_guys_paying_for_expressvpn_right/,How much are you guys paying for ExpressVPN right now?,"I renewed my ExpressVPN subscription yesterday and noticed the cost is higher than what I paid before. I am on the yearly plan and it ended up being around 100 this time. It is still cheaper than paying month to month, but I clearly remember paying closer to 80 last year, so the increase stood out to me.

I mainly use ExpressVPN for streaming shows from other countries and for staying secure when I work from coffee shops. It has been reliable for me, so I am not really looking to switch providers right now. Still, seeing the higher price made me stop and think about whether this is just the new normal.

I am curious what other ExpressVPN users are paying at the moment. Are you seeing similar prices on renewals, or did anyone manage to lock in a lower rate? I am especially interested in whether there are any real discounts or longer plans that make sense before the next renewal comes around.

Just trying to figure out if I missed something or if prices have simply gone up across the board.",0,1767399553.0,VPN_Question,0,0.5,False

I was going to talk to a close friend about this but i can't for multiple days which i won't be able to sit with this for that long, i've already had it bottled up inside for so many weeks.  
since like before the first year anniversary i've been occasionally flip-flopping between wanting to break up with him, but it was always solved whenever i explained to him that something was upsetting me, but what scares me this time is i don't even WANT to explain whats upsetting me because i just don't want to date him anymore, is that normal??? 

Heres a couple things why i want to break up:  
\-in the two years he's never ONCE asked me out on a date. He's organising meet ups, but things such as iceskating or going to a museum or to a concert (which i understand is very cool and kind) BUT his family where going to go anyway and it always felt a bit like his mum told him to bring me along? like even if i said no they would go anyway so it's not much of a date. I can't think of one time HE'S said 'hey lets go out for a date' or 'are you free next Saturday to go get coffee' literally nothing  
\-he never initiate contact? I'm always the one to hold his hand, hug him, kiss him (he's autistic so i understand if it's not his preference but also he NEVER tells me anything that makes him uncomfortable so i have no idea how to navigate it) It took me almost 2 years to pluck up the courage to kiss him on the lips because he never started ANYTHING. like month long periods between even cheek kisses and only would when i had previously been all-lovey with him for ages beforehand.  
\-sometimes he'll complain about his problems and when i try to give him advice he just ignores them as if he likes his problems?  
\-sometimes really really difficult to talk to (once again i know hes autistic so i don't blame him especially in school) but like still.

I don't know is this normal? should i try to talk to him about it? but i don't want him to feel like he 'owes' me connection y'know, like it would all feel very fake if i ""made"" him start kissing me and stuff.

How do i do it? i really want to stay friends with him, because he's nice and i like him, and i'm super close to him, but i also don't know how to do it gently and kindly. Where do i do it? we're big texters, but that feels very impersonal to text a break up, i don't know how to do it in-person as he lives far away and the only time i see him is at school which feels a bit rude. i could call him but we're not big callers. i would feel bad getting him to meet me somewhere because it's so out of the way for both of us and i don't want to drag him down somewhere just to break up with him.",1,1767399507.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Why do you make getting my food its own personal challenge???,"Is there a DoorDash training video where you are taught to set my food exactly in the blast radius of my front door?

Every. Single. Time.

Bag of food? Centered.
Drink carrier? Snug against the door like it’s seeking warmth.

So when I open the door, I’m forced to choose between:

	1.	Sacrificing my drink to the porch gods

	2.	Doing an Olympic-level side door maneuver

	3.	Slowly cracking the door and fishing my food in like a raccoon

I even leave a clear, wide-open porch. No obstacles. No clutter. Just vibes. And yet… the food is placed with surgical precision directly where physics says “absolutely not.”

Is this:

	•	A test of character?

	•	A subtle revenge for not tipping enough?

	•	A secret DoorDash cult ritual?

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is I stay grounded for those who I care for. I live a sort of quiet life, with my writing and drawing, but recently I have found enjoyment in small adventures.

A relationship with me is one where we could either co-op a game, share a book, or have a fun day at an arcade. And one day I'd enjoy to just sit with my partner in a park field, just enjoying the peace. And if we ever run into bumps, I may take a little time to collect myself, but after I always come back ready to listen.

The woman I'm looking for is a passionate one, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. And I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to a cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes.

A side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud in con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're my type. Though if you got other ideas, feel free to say them. And yeah, we'll be the couple that gets others inspired.

I came out when I was 22 and have run the gamut of WLW relationships, hookups, celibacy, brief stints in heterosexuality, kink, you name it.

I'm off the dating apps as I seek to have more IRL experiences, looking for something more organic. I've been single for about 15 months now.

Well today I went there and ordered a coffee and she was there again, giving me that same intense eye contact and a smile. It's throwing me off because my seasoned gaydar seems to be reading into her energy as something more. Otherwise, I'd just say this is nice customer service.

You might wonder why I started this with ""the man I hope finds me,"" and not ""The man I hope I find"" and that's valid, so here it goes:

Right now I'm spending a lot of time working on myself, and working from healing from things that weigh heavily on me. It wouldn't be fair to seek you out only to weigh you down with my fears that I might never become a mother, or that anyone I take a chance on will eventually leave when I am too much or life gets to be too much. Instead, I'm entering my second year of therapy and still doing the work. It's not always easy, but there are a lot of realizations I've arrived at that bring relief and hope. Sometimes the realizations are sad or uncomfortable, but they're mine to sit with. Just like, wherever you are right now, you are sitting with yours.

I read a lot of Rilke and Rumi in my twenties, and the older I get (thirty-seven now, wow, the time does fly) the more I realize the kind of love they speak of is the kind you don't find when you're out there looking for it. I don't think it finds you when you lock yourself away from the world either. It's probably a delicate balance and I just don't think I'm ready quite yet.

When you find me, I guarantee my walls will be high. It's not a test to see how good of a climber you are: it's a defense mechanism that has come from years of feeling chronically unseen and unchosen. I will evaluate you for the reasons we couldn't work before I evaluate you for the reasons we might. I've had men tell me I'm beautiful, open their arms for a hug when they see me with a giant smile on their faces. I've had men treat me like static background noise in their lives. I am giving myself the care I used to give to people who couldn't meet me halfway.

If you do make it to the top of those walls and over, there's a flower garden not many people have had access to on the other side. Right now, the flowers are withered but with my effort and time I know they can thrive. I don't need you to caretake them. I want you to be able to rest in a bed of them.

I want to be a safe place for you and I want you to be one for me. I want you to talk to me when you have concerns. I want you to tell me when you're happy, or if you're not. I want you to tell me what you were like as a kid. I want to wake up before you and put on coffee. I want to hold you to sleep sometimes, and I want to be held by you until I fall asleep sometimes.  I want to take care of you sometimes in a way that is voluntary and not necessary. I want to hear all your stories and see all the picture of you from other lifetimes. I want to spend the entire day in bed sometimes and other times I want to go on adventures and make new memories together. I want to be tender with you and I want you to be tender with me. I want mutual effort. I want us to give each other the benefit of the doubt, even when it's challenging.

1q2f9mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell/comments/1q2f9mw/why_do_people_continue_to_eat_at_taco_bell/,Why do people continue to eat at Taco Bell regularly?,"I love Taco Bell. It's been in my blood from the time I was a child to now as a 42 year old. I would write silly posts on Facebook dedicated to my love for Taco Bell, and people would always joke with me if I had eaten Taco Bell that day again.

But, as with everything, there is a huge value proposition relating to the things we spend money on. For example, 8 dollars isn't a lot of money for a meal, but it's a lot of money for a single coffee or boba drink. There has been a huge misalignment in value for Taco Bell that started around the middle of the covid pandemic. Taco Bell used to be a good value, now it is the exact opposite. Yes I know prices in general have exploded, especially in fast-food.

But why do people keep eating there regularly, when there are still other better options available? I always knew Taco Bell wasn't super nutritious, but it tasted good, and it had a strong value proposition relative to other fast food places. This seems to have been upended entirely.

I stopped eating at In-N-Out burger for personal reasons, but why wouldnt you get two real-food cheeseburgers and a fry for the same price as 5 basic tacos or a box of quasi-food? Or fast casual places such as Chipotle or Panda Express that have huge, filling, higher-quality meals for the same price I end up coming out of Taco Bell for? I don't have Del Taco in the Bay Area any more, but Del Taco's value proposition and quality are so much higher than Taco Bell's. They actually cook their chicken on site, and it's real chicken, not a reconstituted, reheated chicken formed thing. Their killer well-filled and sauced chicken soft tacos can be had for like $1.30 each on special, and their app offers real actual specials, in addition to always-available daily specials.

There are things that Taco Bell does really well. I could literally eat a Cheesy Gordita Crunch every day and be perfectly happy in life, and when I largely eat vegetarian, swapping for black beans isn't much of a compromise. But is it worth 6 dollars? Hell to the no. The online-only box makes it slightly more affordable, but not by much. Also, Taco Bell has the best sauces in the game. If I had an endless supply, I would slap Chipotle and Jalapeño sauce on everything I eat, and the new garlic sauce is pretty good too.

I would still eat Taco Bell a couple times a week if their prices weren't insane. Now, it's just a few times a year when I get the craving, but it always just leaves me so angry that it costs so much after the fact, being ripped off so badly. I end up paying 14-20 dollars for a box and a few extra value-menu items (and still mourning the loss of the spicy tostada). To have to pay this much money for ultra-processed reconstituted 'food' that is cooked off-site and re-heated in-store is insane.

I kept hoping their visitation would decrease to the point they had to do something about their prices and restore the value menu to some semblance of how it used to be, adjusted more for normal inflation rates, but it hasn't been the case.

So, why are you and others still going there regularly? I am genuinely confused by it.",0,1767399196.0,tacobell,38,0.35,False

Location (A): \~2 hours by car from Tianfu airport costing around ¥500 for a minivan (half that for a normal car). There is basically no way in or out of the resort once you arrive.

Accomodation (A+): beautifully appointed quiet rooms with heated floors, a big soaking bath, tea coffee machines, one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept on in a long time (and 2x2 meters so really big), fast wifi and big sliding windows which offer a great view

Service (A+): super attentive, they knew who we were, tried to meet our every request, delivered fruit, chocolate, tangyuan soup to our room, and were super warm and friendly

Resort (A): not huge, but tucked into a misty green valley — really quiet and peaceful. There is a bamboo outdoor lounge that serves coffee, a calligraphy room, and an outdoor fire pit — the staff put on a big bonfire on our second night and served free bbq, cake and drinks and had a professional singer taking requests. 

Food (B+): this was probably the part that could have been better. It was nice, but was expecting to use more local ingredients and have more variety — there are a few different hotpot choices and maybe four of five other dishes. Breakfast is noodles and some other plates like corn, sweet potatoes, mantou and warm milk. Staff take your order in advance for each meal, and you can choose your own dining slot. 

Overall (A): if you just wanna chill out in an out of the way, relaxing, high-end boutique resort, I would strongly recommend suggest this place.

What should I do?,"My mum and dad separated nearly 3 years ago due to his cheating and drinking. I was the one who found the flirtatious/ sexting messages with his female coworker on his phone. My mum kicked him out that night and he threatened to kill himself and said it would be my fault. 

I never saw him again. I didn’t message him for about a year but I have two half brothers on his side who still see him and they have always told me to start seeing him again. He has had multiple episodes where he drinks too much and sends worrying messages to us which implied he was on the edge and we have had to call the police. He will then say he is fine and then the same happens. 

In the 3 years he has never asked to see me. He messaged me tonight saying he is finally better and wants to see me. I told him that it’s not a great time for me as I need to get my life together first but his words were “I want you and need you to be in my life, I think and know we need to be in each others life. Please meet me for coffee” 

I just don’t know how to feel because we weren’t close before they separated as he was always emotionally distant. It just feels that the message isn’t genuine and his intentions are to make himself feel better. I also feel he isn’t giving me the choice which makes me quite uncomfortable.

1q2eveo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q2eveo/which_machine_should_i_get_cad6000/,"Which machine should I get? [CAD$6,000]","Hello everyone,

First, I wanted to start thanking you for reading and/or commenting. I appreciate very much the help.

\# Current Setup

Second, I new-ish to espresso. I do have a Breville Bambino (BB) and a Breville SmartGrinder (BSM), but I am looking to upgrade to a prosumer.
We consume more Light and Medium roasts. 
With the current setup, pull a shot of light roast has been a challenge. 

\# Goal

Purchase a machine and grinder that will last me 10 years following the appropriate maintenance, and/or replacing some parts here and there.

Get a machine that will allow me to grow into this hobby even more. Something that won't ""block"" me from experimenting with the extraction, latte art, etc.

That's why the budget is high.

The philosophy is ""I am too broke to buy stuff that won't last"".

\# Routine

My routine is simple: two milk drinks in the morning, two in the afternoon

\# Specs

\## Espresso Machine

\[X\] Heat Exchanger or Dual Boiler

\[X\] PID

\[?\] E61 Group Head  
I've seen some machines that don't have it but are highly recommended

\[?\] Rotary pump  
Wife wants it to be as silent as possible. Saw some machine that have ""ultra-silent Vibration pump tech"", I guess that works too.

\## Grinder

\[X\] Large Flat burrs

\[X\] Stepless Adjustment

\[X\] Low retention

\[?\] Single dosing

\# Options

There's a store ([iDrinkCoffee.com](https://idrinkcoffee.com/pages/boxing-week-2025)) having a Boxing Week promo (until Jan 05th) and hopefully I can make a decision to go get it tomorrow (Jan 03rd).

Here's a list of machines that check those boxes



|Name|Price (CAD)|Boiler Type|PID|Group Type|Pump Type|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bezzera Aria TOP|$2,800|HX|Y|E61|Rotary|
|ECM Mechanika Max|$3,250|HX|Y|E61|Rotary|
|Profitec Pro 400|$2,250|HX|Y-ish|E61|Vibration|
|Bezzera Luce|$2,200|HX|Y|E61|Vibration|
|Bezzera Magica|$1,800|HX|Y|E61|Vibration|
|La Marzocco Micra|$5,600|DB|Y|Integrated|Rotary|
|Profitec MOVE|$2,900|DB|Y|Integrated|Vibration|
|Magister Stella|$2,200|DB|Y|E61|Rotary|
|ECM Synchronika II|$4,900|DB|Y|E61 (enhanced)|Rotary|
|Bezzera Duo MN|$3,400|DB|Y (dual)|E61|Rotary|
|Profitec RIDE|$3,150|DB|Y|E61|Vibration|
|Nurri R-Type|$4,500|DB|Y (triple)|E61|Rotary|
|Bezzera Duo DE|$3,500|DB|Y (triple)|E61 Electric|Rotary|

  
Even though the machines are checking all the boxes their price range is very different, so I imagine there must be something that I am not aware of.

And I didn't even start on the grinder, because just the machines are overwhelming decision.

So, again, I appreciate any input on this.

Ask me any other questions on the comment section.

Got a pretty stacked line up of events to kick off January for any Seattle people who love pourovers! 

https://luma.com/user/airworkscoffee 

All the listings for these events are on the link above!

Trying out some new things this month. In addition to the tastings (sorta like a wine tastings where we try a bunch of coffees side by side), we have a new idea we're calling a brew bar. This works pretty similarly to Substance in Paris if you've ever been there. You pay $5 (which gets taken out of your total bill) to reserve a slot to come by for brews. We make a new menu each day of coffees you can choose from, or we can do a flight of coffees. You don't need to stay the full 2 hours, and you can also bring laptops to work if needed! Sort of a hybrid between a standard cafe experience and one of our tastings.

We also have some fun collab events (one with Pocket DB at a Korean restaurant in Lynnwood {details are pending on this, so the listing isn't fully ready yet}, a walk up slow bar with Numa at Driftwood in West Seattle, a collab tasting with Papaver coffee roasters in Olympia, and a cupping with Homage in Ballard!). 

We might be in PDX next month (I know a lot of you live down there), which will be really exciting!

Hope you had a great holiday season! Happy new year!

Feel free to ping me with any questions :) usually lurking on here lol. More active on IG/discord if you're on there. I also have a website where a bulk of my business is on.

The tubes are stored at the back of the freezer and it is not Opened frequently and never for more than a  few seconds.

I just really need to hear some encouragement. Like I really need to hear it. I need a push because I know what I need to do, but it is just so hard to walk away. 

Anyways…

It happened again today with my wife leaving the house with our son because she knew my mother was coming by to drop off my daughter. (I have a 15 year old daughter from a previous relationship that I have every other weekend and she was spending the afternoon with her.)

I’m just fed up with it. My parents are to the point of going off on her and her parents. 

My wife’s parents and adult brother have been living with us for the past year while they look for a new house in the area since they have sold their’s. 

So far there is something wrong with every single house they have looked at. 

Anyways, they have access to seeing my son at all hours of the day every single day but my wife makes it super difficult for my parents to see our son. 

She will literally make plans out of thin air at the slightest hint that I might take my son to see my parents or if they ask if they can stop by. 

My wife will make sure we are unavailable or come of with some excuse why they can’t stop by. 

She has even gone as far to say my parents only prioritize their granddaughters and not our son even after asking my parents to buy him a very expensive Christmas gift the started a fight about us going to their house for him to open it. 

Like I really hate it because it makes me sound crazy even trying to describe all of this. 

But she literally nearly ruined Christmas because she was telling my parents that I treat her horrible and I am the problem and I need to change. 

(I made a post on here recently about when she dug her nails into my arm)

My parents are absolutely livid right now and they were trying to make peace but my mom left my house today after dropping my daughter off and called me  balling her eyes out not getting to see her grandson. 

I told her exactly how it went down, how my wife took off with my son and left after I told her not to. 

I don’t know. 

I’m just at the end of my rope here. 

After the interaction with my mom today I have avoided her and her family in my house and stayed upstairs with my son and daughter just trying to hold back from breaking down. 

I really am trying to hold off until her parents buy their house nearby so that I could keep my soon to be ex-wife and my son close to so that they don’t move 80 miles away back to where they are moving from. I really feel like an ass towards her parents because they really don’t deserve this but I absolutely can not continue to live in the hell that it is being married to their daughter. 

I hate the time I will miss out on getting to raise and bei with my son post divorce but I am also constantly told by my wife how to parent our son. She will ask me to watch him and then tell me how to watch him. Don’t give him this, don’t give him that. I also work a night shift (4pm to 12:30am) and she expects me to be awake at 8 am in the morning to chase our son around while she sits on the couch drinking coffee. Weekends when I am off are even worse she expects me to watch him all day. 

I’m really not trying to complain about all of that. It’s just the way she does it.

I just need encouragement that I am making right decision here to go through with this divorce and any advice on what I need to do financially like freezing/injunction on bank accounts, etc. 

she stays at home with our son and doesn’t work but has a masters degree in business administration. I’m a simpleton with a high school degree and an electrician journeyman card. ",1,1767397870.0,Divorce_Men,0,0.67,False

In front of the clock on the dashboard there's an extremely slipperly flat space that is clearly meant to be a place to put things. I've debated for a while to purchase a silicone mat of sorts and cut it to size but I've never seen anything marketed directly for this dash shape/spot for grip. It's convenient for a sec before I put the car in drive but the vehicle can't move or that item is going flying. Any tumbler or disposable coffee cup larger than 16oz won't rest without contacting the windshield if at all.

What do you use it for? Is it really a [fairly] large space meant for nothing more than a phone mount? Put your phone there for a moment before you get comfy and move it elsewhere? I've wondered this for years but first time actually asking about it. I feel like it should have been designed with cuts/walls so things could get ""trapped"" like a phone, rather than ramps for them to launch from lol

**The following acts performed at OSL 2025. Note that no act has ever returned quicker than a three year gap. Lizzo would have been the first to do this with a two year gap had the 2020 festival occurred. Post Malone performed a Country cover set in 2024 after headlining in 2023. VNSSA & Nala returned in 2025 as the duo “Girl Math,” after each performing solo in 2024.**

These acts are unlikely due to being in the top 13 at Bottlerock 2025, The Flaming Lips in 2013 were the highest billed act to ever go on to play OSL the following year, thus allowing us to assume anyone in the top 13 or higher are unlikely for OSL 2026:

**“Moonshadow foxes. Do. Not. Exist!”**

Derek bellowed, loud enough for the whole guild to hear.

He flipped his empty mug over and slammed it to the bar.

“Old bag says her moonshadow fox went missing. Nuttier than Trogg’s mum’s fruitcake.”

“Hey! You no talk ’bout Trogg’s mom! She good cook!” Trogg bellowed from the back table — seven-and-a-half feet of offended orc who sounded like he gargled boulders for breakfast.

I rolled my eyes.  

*Snare me sideways, he’s unbearable.*

Trogg has been an ass to me since day one. 

“I never should’ve taken this stupid bounty,” Derek grumbled, ignoring Trogg. “Bloody waste of time.”

“Trogg like mom’s fruitcake,” Trogg muttered to someone at his table.  

*Rusted bolts, Trogg.* 

He's the guild’s biggest mama’s boy — and everyone knows it.  

Makes it almost *too* easy. But still… I love it.

“Been on this bounty a full day and all I found was a damn collar!” Derek went on. “The old bag swears her fox never wore it — which makes sense, because…”

The entire guild hall shouted in unison: **“Moonshadow foxes don’t exist!**”

Derek froze.

*Yes, you’re that predictable, Derek.*

Wiping the ale from his chin, he stomped to the bounty board and slammed the notice back in place — tack hitting like a coffin nail.

*And that’s when I knew I’d be hunting a moonshadow fox before sundown.* 

**Because really — why would the guild approve a bounty for a beast “everyone knows” doesn’t exist?**

\------------------------------------

**The challenge:** track a creature that shimmers, fades, and leaves no trace behind.  

*I am so in.* 

My heart racing, I slid off the stool — boots hitting the floor with a soft thump.

At three feet, I’m considered tall for a gnome, though humans tend to be ridiculously stretched out.

On my tiptoes, I tore the bounty free. The parchment’s rip drew a few looks my way, and thank the gods Derek’s on the shorter side — spared me the indignity of needing a stool.

I know, I know — they “don’t exist.”  

But the few sketches I’ve seen were adorable, so obviously I memorized everything I could about them.

Per Lark, my dryad friend at the Conservatory and knower of all things foresty, moonshadow foxes don’t leave tracks or scent, just shimmer where their paws touch. Pretty and fleeting, which is why most hunters don’t believe they exist.

Here’s what I know: they shimmer in moonlight. They’re drawn to shiny things. Their pawprints fade fast, like ale in the guild hall.

And if they’re bonded, they stay bonded—loyal enough to sit by a master’s grave every night.

Cute as all get out… and still on my top-100 cuddle list.

If Derek struck out, there were only three possibilities:

1. The widow’s losing it, and there was never a fox. A chat with Bram would settle that.
2. The fox doesn’t want to be found—scared, stubborn, or bonded to someone new.
3. It can’t be found—because someone took it, or it’s hurt.

But… what if?  What if moonshadow foxes are real?

How soft is their fur?

Do they shimmer when they fade—do they glow?

What does it even feel like to touch moonlight?

Rusted bolts… imagine holding one.

Wait! 

Moonshadow foxes bond for life.  Every bit of lore says so. They never leave their companion.

So what in the cinnamon-free hells would make this one run?

\------------------------------------

**I love Bram’s bakery. Love it.**  

Warm and cozy, with the buttery aroma hanging so thick in the air it coats your tongue.  

And in the far corner—*my* table.  

My little nook where I can curl up with a mug of coffee and a cinnamon bun the size of my face and just… melt.

The bell over the door chimed—bright, cheerful—but the bakery… wasn’t.

No greeting.  

No chatter.  

Just a strained, uncomfortable quiet.

My boots clicking on the tile sounded so out of place.

The staff—normally buzzing, smiling, arguing over who gets to sneak me the biggest cinnamon bun—stood stiff behind the counter, eyes lowered, voices swallowed.

My jaw tightened, teeth grinding against the silence.

Bram's is my go to place. This is where I go to get away from... the guild.  Its where I relax, let go, and just... be. 

And right now it felt violated.

Golem balls—I wanted to hit something.

I scanned the room until I spotted Bram near the back, talking in low tones with the widow Derek had mentioned. His apron was dusted with flour, and the set of his shoulders told me he wasn’t just making polite conversation.

I hovered near the counter.  

Normally, I can out-wait a stump.  

Today? Nope. Zero patience left in the tank.

Bram glanced up, met my eyes, and I knew instantly—he needed a moment.

Fine. He could have a minute — one minute.

But the longer I stood there, the more that wrongness in the air crawled under my skin.

Bram finished his quiet conversation with the widow, gave her a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder, and finally made his way toward me. His mustache lifted in a tired half-smile.

“Izzy,” he said softly, “I figured you’d wander in sooner or later.”

I crossed my arms. “Yeah, well… the whole place felt weird the moment I walked in. So.”  

I jerked my chin toward the widow. “Is her fox real, or is she just—”

I caught myself before saying *nuttier than your muffins*.

“…imagining things?”

Bram sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “Ashwhisper is real. Was her husband’s familiar — loyal as they come. Came in with her this morning, just like always.” 

*Real. Rusted bolts… they’re real.*  

The corners of my mouth twitched, begging to lift, but I pressed them flat.  I cleared my throat. “And then?”

“She picked up her order, stepped outside, and…” 

He spread his flour-dusted hands helplessly. 

“Gone. Just gone. No tracks. No noise. No nothing.” 

“Nothing?” The word snapped out of me, harsher than I meant, but I didn’t pull it back. 

Bram shook his head, eyes dropping. 

My fingers curled into fists against my thighs, nails biting into skin I barely felt. 

“Was it prone to wandering? Could it have gone home?""

Bram shook his head again. “Ashwhisper is too loyal. He would never leave without her.”

“Wait,” I said slowly, “you said he was bonded to her husband. Not her?”  

I nodded toward the widow, still dabbing her eyes in the corner.

“Yeah,” Bram said. “A mage. Odd fellow. Died a few years back. Why?”  

Confusion tightened the lines around his eyes.

“Moonshadow foxes bond for life,” I said, the words tumbling out. “Every bit of lore says so. So… could he have gone to the husband’s grave?”

Bram shook his head, firm this time. 

“Before the old mage died, Ashwhisper promised he’d protect her. The fox would never leave her side.”

*He wouldn’t leave her. Not willingly.* 

Something must have scared him off…  

So what could make a moonshadow fox leave its bonded companion?

\------------------------------------

**Bram cleared his throat, reached under the counter, and set something on the table between us.**

The collar.

“The hunter who came in earlier found it out back,” Bram said, nodding toward the alley door.

Derek’s collar.  

The one he’d been bitching about at the guild.

I picked it up carefully, turning it over.  

Up close, it was… in terrible shape.

Worn leather.  

Cracked edges.  

Half-faded runes that had been scratched out—with someone’s \*\*clumsy\*\* attempt at deactivating them. Whoever used this thing had reused it… a lot.

Two runes had been re-engraved, fresh cuts in the leather.

*One I recognized immediately: an anti-scrying rune.*  

Cheap, messy, but functional enough.

“Flux,” I muttered. “That’s why Derek’s spell came up empty.”

Most hunters don’t check for spell interference unless they have reason to.  

Derek never stood a chance.

The widow swore Ashwhisper never wore a collar.  

So if this really had been on him…

My finger brushed the inside seam, and **something gritty** clung to my skin.  

I rubbed it between thumb and forefinger.

Metallic and sharp.

I fished a small lodestone from my pocket and tipped my fingers over it.

The dust jumped, coating the loadstone.

**Iron filings**\*.\*

That made my jaw tighten.

Moonshadow foxes aren’t fae.  

Iron might slow them, maybe irritate them, but it wouldn’t stop a phase.

If I were trapping something aetherial, I’d use **aether-binding dust.**  

More expensive. More specialized.  Definitely not something you waste on a sloppy trap.

So whoever did this was—either cheap or inexperienced.

I tilted my head, considering it.

Definitely both.

That’s when my eyes caught on the only fresh rune on the old collar—the one engraved right over a cracked piece of leather.

It wasn’t familiar.

Not fully.  

It tickled something in the back of my mind… but I couldn’t place it.

Flux, that's going to bug me all day.

I jotted the pattern into my notebook.  

I’d have to research it later.

I turned the collar again, slower this time, and something caught the light.

A few hairs, barely visible, caught deep in one of the older cracks. I tilted the leather, watching them shift.

“Bram,” I said quietly. “Look at this.”

I held the collar up between us. The hairs didn’t shine. They… bent the light. Silver-gray one moment, almost colorless the next.

I've seen wolf fur, feline fur, and even a whisperback once.

“That fur,” I murmured, more to myself than him. “That’s not normal.”

Bram leaned closer, squinting.

“Yeah,” he said slowly. “That’s… that’s what he looks like.”

Bram glanced toward the widow still sniffling near the back of the shop, then back at the collar.

“One second he’s there. Clear as day. Then the light shifts and you’re not sure you saw him at all.”

My grip tightened on the leather as I followed Bram’s gaze, my heart breaking.

Ashwhisper didn’t wear a collar.

He didn’t need one.

And he wouldn’t leave her. Not willingly.

My thoughts raced, spiraling into a place I didn’t want to go.  

A problem our town hadn’t faced in a long, long time.

A chill traced its way down my spine, the hair on my neck prickling.  

That primal feeling you get when you realize you’re being hunted.

I spun.

A dark figure was already moving—cloak pulled low, slipping past the front window and around the corner.

I bolted for the door.

Cold air hit my face as I burst outside, boots skidding on stone as I rounded the building.

Just in time to see the last of it.

Thin lines of sickly green light flared along the seams of the cloak—etched runes igniting for a heartbeat before the fabric drank the light back in.

The shadows folded around the figure, swallowing them whole.

We’re both single. The problem is… I never make the first move. Ever. It’s been my pride for as long as I can remember.

But this time it’s different. I fell for him way faster than I expected and it’s honestly driving me a bit crazy.

We don’t really talk much unless it’s about work. There was one time we had a longer conversation about work and college life, and he even offered me a ride home. That moment stuck with me more than it probably should have. After that, I really wanted to message him — even just something casual — but I froze. I just couldn’t do it.

Now, the only time we chat is when there’s a legit work-related reason. I keep waiting for a “natural” opening but it never comes, and I’m stuck between wanting to respect boundaries and wanting to at least try… even just asking him out for coffee.

Has anyone else been in this situation? How do you make a move without feeling like you’re forcing it — especially when it’s a coworker and you’re used to never being the one to initiate?",0,1767397362.0,WhatShouldIDo,13,0.25,False

1q2egxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2egxw/not_a/,Not a,"I’m not a liar. Not a conspiracy theorist. Not a man known to exaggerate.

No one’s listening. I’m throwing this message in a bottle online, hoping someone relevant picks it up. If you know me, you know. You have my number. Call me. Let me explain.

I’ll start from the beginning.

 

I’m a South Dakota boy. Came from a small community near the bend of the river by Crow Creek. Us east river folk live by a different tempo. We don’t get a lot of big headlines, and we keep our dreams close enough to see them from our bedroom window. I wanted to be a cop like my dad. I followed in his footsteps, got my badge, and now I’m a cop too.

Before this whole shitstorm started, I’d been doing this job for four years. I was no stranger to death or disease, but it’s from places you expect. Some guy overdosing outside a fast-food joint. A diabetic running a stop sign into oncoming traffic. We see gruesome stuff; you can’t avoid that. It comes with the job. But it was never intentional, you know? It was always a consequence of bad choices, or random happenstances. Or plain bad luck.

But one day we got a call about something I’d been dreading. A driver called about spotting something off the road west of Wessington. We didn’t get a lot of details, but me and my partner were the closest to check it out. Apparently, they’d found a head.

A human head.

 

Out there, it’s all flat. No hills, just the occasional tree blocking the horizon. We could see this guy parked by the side of the road long before we got there. There was a couple of other people there; an old man with a bloodhound, two teenage boys taking pictures with their phones, and a man in overalls that reminded me of a walking blueberry with a sunflower patch on his chest. That was the driver, the guy who made the call.

Russel and I parked and got out. Russel’s my partner, had been for about 9 months at that point. We worked well together, but we had no contact outside of work. It was better that way. The few times we’d got personal, we figured out we were nothing alike. We had vastly different opinions and experiences. West of the river kind of folks, you know.

We go up to this blueberry guy. He tilts his cap and points at the end of a fence with the butt of a cigarette.

“Right there,” he says. “Shit’s right there.”

He was trying to play it off as something casual, but I could tell he was mortified. There were three cigarettes scattered around his feet, and at least two of them weren’t even half-finished. He was shaking bad enough to drop them.

The old guy with the bloodhound had to hold his dog back. Not that it was angry or anything, but it seemed desperate to sniff the thing. And from where I was standing, that’s what it looked like, a thing. Not a head. Not a person. Just this pale blotch of skin lined up against a fence pole.

“I was stopping to talk to Chris when I saw it,” the driver continued. “That’s Chris.”

The old man raised a hand and snapped at his dog who finally calmed down.

“I stepped back and called you guys. I barely looked. Not a peep.”

Russel asked the mandatory questions. Establishing a timeline, asking about witnesses, what he was doing, all that stuff. Meanwhile, I asked the teenagers to step back and explained to the old man that we had to keep the area clear.

 

I was the first one to step up close and take a good look. Someone had to confirm that it was a human head. And it was. It was fresh. Young woman, maybe 20-25 years old. Mouth half-open as if letting out a long sigh. Eyes closed. Without touching anything, I took some pictures. It’s important to be able to show a crime scene the way you find it, you never know when the weather takes a turn.

I made a couple observations. She didn’t have any makeup on, and there was not a large pool of blood or gore. The head was sort of propped up against the fence, making me think someone left it there intentionally. This was not a accident. No way. It dawned on me that I was witnessing what might be my first murder scene. Well, not a murder *scene*. A murder *display*, if anything.

 

We called in the cavalry. As I mentioned, things like this don’t happen where I grew up. Accidents, yes, but this was no accident. Couldn’t be. We got a whole bunch of cars out there in less than an hour. We sectioned off a part of the farmlands to check for further body parts. We got the cadaver dogs, we called to prep for an autopsy, and we had crime scene investigators on-site by late afternoon. I’d never seen that kind of mobilization.

Now I’m sure they wanted to bring in some expert from Sioux Falls, but time was of the essence. We needed an early call on whether this death was the result of an accident, animal, or tool. Yes, it all pointed to a murder, but we couldn’t know for sure. That wasn’t our job. Before anything, we needed an initial statement. We had a coroner and a medical examiner ready. Problem was, these were local guys, and they weren’t prepared. Not in the least. Me and Russel were sent along to get them up to speed as a sort of go-between. We were the first to get there, after all. We got the pictures and the initial statements. Also, we knew these people. That’d make things easier.

 

Russel and I got there just before dinner time. The medical examiner had gotten there about ten minutes ahead of us, but the coroner was already getting work done. The medical examiner was a lady named Coreen. Early forties, mother of four, no-nonsense kind of woman with a bad but honest temper. The coroner’s name was Daly. Man ought to have retired by then, but he was still going at it. Almost 70 years old but as sharp as ever. When we stepped in, he was already turning the head over, making observations about the wound.

“Daly,” Russel said as we entered. “How you holding up?”

“Just dandy,” Daly said, making a note. “I’m more worried about our friend here.”

Coreen pushed us aside and made her way to the examiner’s table. Russel got a pretty good shove and rolled his eyes at her.

“Since you’re still looking, I take it you haven’t come to a conclusion,” Coreen sighed. “What’s the verdict?”

“It’s… easier to explain what it’s *not* at this point,” Daly said. “The wounds are about halfway patterned, halfway… something else. But it depends on the time they were inflicted.”

“So what’s the TOD? We talking days or weeks?”

“I haven’t got the slightest clue.”

That made her pause.

 

There were several inconsistencies that Daly noted. For example, several of the usual markers that we see in corpses just weren’t there. There were no flies or maggots, and many common shows of decomposition had either not manifested at all or manifested in an order that didn’t make sense. For example, the inner lining of the mouth showed signs of advanced decay around the soft tissue, but there were no signs of bacteria or strong active smells. Daly couldn’t make sense of it.

Russel and I stood back and watched them work. We knew Daly had a habit of not answering his e-mails or checking his phone, so it was better to have some boots on the ground to keep tabs on their progress. We were all gonna be on call for most of the night anyway, so we figured we’d settle in for the long haul. I took a dinner break while Russel stayed behind; he’d brought leftovers that he forgot to eat for lunch. I got an hour to clear my head and fill my stomach while they kept working.

I checked in with the guys still out in the field. They hadn’t found anything else. No witnesses, no footprints, no track marks, no wheels, not a thing. They were checking traffic cameras going in and out of the area, but the distances required and the amount of cars passing through made the potential numbers go up in the hundreds. I could tell it was a dead end. Hell, I could tell that just by the tone of their voice.

 

By the time I got back, Daly and Coreen were arguing. They were listing things on a whiteboard, going through them one by one, crossing things off. You could tell who’d written what; Daly had this old-fashioned cursive, while Coreen kept it simple and blocky. The smell of chemicals tickled the ranch-sprinkled taste buds on the back of my tongue, making me wish I was back outside. Russel gave me a pat on the shoulder and took a break, leaving me alone with the arguing professionals. Coreen was in the middle of a monologue, pointing at one thing at a time on the whiteboard.

“Not a hacksaw. Not a chainsaw. Not a… what did you say? Piano wire?”

“Not a piano wire,” Daly agreed. “Not a knife. Not an axe.”

“And we got *nothing* certain,” Coreen continued. “Not a fragment, no nothing.”

Daly turned to me.

“You got any ideas? You saw anything out there? Anything?”

“Not a thing,” I shrugged. “Witness statement in the folder.”

“This is *shit*,” Coreen spat, flipping the folder over. “Not a *single* thing we can use.”

“You don’t think it was wildlife?” I asked. “Wolves? Bears?”

“We have to find *some* kind of baseline before we start eliminating things it *ain’t*,” Coreen explained. “We can’t just start listing things it’s *not*.”

“Well, it’s better than standing here saying nothing,” Daly argued. “Hold on.”

He flipped the whiteboard over, uncorked his pen, and started at the top.

“It’s not a wolf,” he said. “What else?”

 

They went at it for hours. Not a wolf. Not a bear. Not a coyote. Not a bobcat. Just a long list of things to exclude. They checked for fur, claw marks, teeth marks, anything. All the while Russel and I went up and down the stairs, calling the chief to let him know there was nothing to report. By 8pm we were running in circles. We called it a night.

Coreen packed up first, then Russel and I got off the clock. Russel headed home immediately, but I noticed Daly sticking around a little longer. I pretended to look for my keys as I kept an eye on him. He was still talking, but not to me.

“We’re missing something,” he mumbled. “We’re missing something big.”

“Like what?” I asked.

He looked up at me, snapping out of whatever thought was running through his head.

“I’m just making conversation. Pay me no mind.”

“Alright. You good to lock up?”

Daly waved me off with a smile, and I didn’t think much else of it.

 

The next morning, we got a call about feds wanting to join in on the action. I tried to get a hold of Daly, telling him to come in a little early, but the man really can’t be reached by e-mail or text. He was coming in whenever, and that was that. Coreen, on the other hand, was already there by the time Russel and I pulled into the parking lot. She was leaning against a streetlight, tapping a pen against a notebook.

“Not a big machine,” she mumbled. “Not a small machine. Not a tool. Not a saw.”

“Mornin’ Coreen,” Russel yawned. “Trying to get some work done before the feds get here?”

She ignored us. We’d gotten the spare keys to open; Daly got the other pair. Coreen wasn’t usually the one we called for these kinds of things. Then again, we’d never had this kind of thing. Not really.

The moment Russel clicked the lock open, Coreen shoved her way past him; this time with even more force. It was enough to make Russel go ‘hey’, but she had no visible reaction. She kept mulling over whatever list she’d made on her notebook. She was eager to get back to it. We only had about an hour or so before reinforcements would come knocking on the door. Coreen wasn’t wasting any time. She ran down the stairs, put on the bare minimum equipment, and rushed to pull the slabs out. We barely had the time to keep up with her, like she was racing against the clock. But when she pulled the slab out, there was a whole other problem.

The head was *gone*.

 

Russel stood there, mouth agape. He snapped out of it the moment Coreen turned to us, her eyes sunken and red. Something was off. She’d always been a bit short and snippy with us, but this was something else. I don’t think Russel saw it, but I could tell she was up to something. She looked from him to me, and then at the door.

“Not a little girl,” she mumbled. “Not a old lady. Not a teenager…”

“You alright there?” Russel asked. “You slept okay?”

I could tell she wasn’t listening. There was something about the white of her eye that bugged me, a sort of micro-twitch. Like a nervous dog. When she suddenly burst into a sprint. I was ready. Russel wasn’t.

I stepped in front of her, and she ran straight into me. She knocked herself to the ground, landing face-first on the hard floor. I could hear the air pass from her lungs in a huff. I got a pretty nasty landing flat on my back, but nothing was broken. A bad bruise, but I got lucky. Russel was on her back within seconds, putting her in handcuffs.

“Not a snakebite,” Correen mumbled. “Not a hound. Not a housecat. Not a gunshot.”

“What the hell?” Russel gasped. “What’s wrong with you?”

“Not a thing wrong. Not a question answered. Not a long way to go.”

“Coreen!” Russel yelled. “You hear me?”

I was already calling for another squad car. Time was off the essence. We had a missing head, and Daly wasn’t around. I prayed to God he’d just overslept, but I had this sinking feeling in my gut that he hadn’t. There was something about the way he’d lingered the other night that made me think he might’ve done something he shouldn’t.

 

Another car was sent to check on Daly, but he wasn’t at his apartment. Another car went to check his office, but there was no one there either. We ended up combing through whatever contacts we thought might be useful. Russel and I had our coffees, making mental lists out loud.

“His ex-wife,” I said. “I know he got one of those.”

“I don’t think he made it to Florida overnight. His car’s still in the driveway.”

“So… not a ex-wife,” I said.

“Not a ex-wife,” Russel agreed. “Not a chance. Not a…”

I turned to look at him as he tapered off. He stared at the steering wheel, coffee hanging limp in his hands. His eyes glassed over, and I could see a bubble of spit pooling in the corner of his mouth. He wasn’t blinking.

“Russel?”

He blinked, dropping his coffee straight into his lap. It wasn’t that hot, but he was up and about within less than a second, cursing like a sailor. He kicked the cup down the street like it owed him money and got back in the car, wiping the seat and his pants with a blanket from the glove box.

“You okay?”

“Not about to get sick. Not now.”

“You sure? You seem out of it.”

“You really think Daly stole that damn head?” Russel said, changing the subject. “You think he’d do that?”

“He could’ve. I mean, it’s possible. What’s the odds of them both disappearing without him being involved?”

“Not a snowball’s chance in hell.”

“Exactly.”

“Not a chance.”

I gave Russel another look. He was clearly thinking about something, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I tapped him on the shoulder and handed him my coffee.

“I think you need this more than I do. I’ll take the wheel for a bit.”

 

We spent most of the early day driving around town, asking questions. We had a couple of vague leads, but it’s like we were spinning tires, stuck in the mud. Russel was getting frustrated, so the chief asked us to do something else for a bit. They were busy dealing with the feds anyway, and they had four different squad cars out looking for Daly.

We were sent to check on a roadside diner. Old folks kind of place. It had been closed all day, and the waitress working the lunch shift was getting worried. The owner wasn’t answering their phone, and there’d been no notice ahead of time. There was just a note in the window saying “Closed”. It wasn’t a high-priority call, but it gave us something to do.

That is, until I noticed something curious.

We went to check up on the place before we headed to the owner’s registered address for a house call. But when I got a closer look at the sign, I noticed it was written in a beautiful cursive. I elbowed Russel and pointed.

“You see that?”

He nodded, moving in to get a closer look.

“Not a common thing around here,” Russel said. “Owner’s got arthritis.”

“You don’t think he wrote that?”

“Not a… no,” he coughed. “Now that I think about it, I think I’ve seen Daly around here before.”

“You have? When?”

“Not a… not a long…”

Russel trailed off, falling silent. I gave him a couple of seconds. This time, I wasn’t going to snap him out of it, I wanted to see what was going on.

 

He stood there for a full minute. I counted; it was a full minute. Then he almost toppled over, tipping forward like a falling tree. That’s when I rushed to catch him. If I hadn’t, he’d have gotten a face full of gravel. He immediately went on the defensive, straightening his back out.

“I’m okay,” he insisted. “I’m okay.”

“You gotta talk to me.”

“I’m okay, whatever. I’m okay. Not a-“

“Stop saying that. You keep saying that, and you zone out.”

“Saying what?”

I blinked. I didn’t want to say it. There was something dangerous in it. Like turning a key to a door you didn’t want to open. I shook it out of my head and headed for the car. Before I got halfway, Russel was going around the back. He wasn’t about to wait; he was heading inside, with or without me.

 

I had to stop whatever I was doing to catch up with him. I called out to him, but he was heading for the back door. Before I got to him, he’d cracked a window and shoved the door open. He was rushing inside with the same urgency that Coreen had, except I wasn’t there to tackle him. Last thing I saw before he rounded the corner was him pulling out his gun. I called out for backup as I ran after him.

I stopped dead in my tracks a couple steps inside the kitchen. The owner was on the floor, face down in a pool of blood. You could smell death on him. Russel had stepped over him, heading straight for the front of the diner. This wasn’t like him; Russel was not a hothead. Not a thrill seeker. If anything, he was the controlled one.

“Russel!” I called out. “Gotta step back! Backup’s on the way!”

There was no answer. Instead, he rushed straight to the front – and stopped. I followed him, rounding the corner.

 

The blinders were shut, casting the whole serving area in a gray shade. A couple streaks of sunlight made their way through the shutters, lighting up the white spaces with spots of red. Daly had been busy. Without a whiteboard, he’d been writing on the furniture with whatever pen was closest. Turns out that pen was blood. The first few sentences seemed familiar.

Not a cougar. Not a lion. Not a panther. Not a gator.

More animals. But the further in you got, the text got smaller, more concentrated. And the sentences grew stranger.

Not a lot. Not a little. Not a lord. Not a queen.

Then, at the far end, there was something written on a table. Russel was already there, picking something up from it. As I got closer, I saw the text, while trying to keep an eye on my partner. The text was cleaner, underlined.

*Not a person.*

 

“Not a person,” Russel nodded. “Yeah, that makes sense.”

“What’s that you’re holding?” I asked. “What are you doing?”

He dropped his handgun to the floor and cradled something between his hands. As I got closer, I saw what it was. The *bottom jaw* of the missing head, torn loose.

“Not a person,” Russel repeated. “Not a threat.”

“You oughta put that down. We got people coming any second.”

He looked up at me, elated. This immense sense of relief spreading over his face.

“It’s not a person,” he repeated. “It’s okay. Not a person. Not a corpse.”

“What’s not a corpse?”

He held up the jaw, looking me in the eye. And without looking away, he put it up to his lips, and bit off a mouthful.

 

It didn’t make the sound I thought it would. Instead, there was a soft and mushy kind of noise, like someone biting a jelly-filled marshmallow. He barely chewed for a second before he got another chunk.

“Shee?” he said, mouth full. “Itsh fine. Not a pershon.”

I kept shaking my head, backing away. I didn’t even notice I’d pulled my gun. He held the flesh out to me, looking like I’d said something hurtful.

“Try it,” he smiled. “Try a little.”

“No way,” I said. “Not a… not a-“

 

I had to stop myself. I had to *physically* stop myself. Thinking about this sentence made my head spiral into a pattern of repetition over and over again, like an allergic reaction in the back of my mind. I slapped my hands over my mouth, smacking my front teeth with the metal of my gun. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t shoot Russel, but I couldn’t stay. I turned away.

I hadn’t noticed the bathroom door opening. The one in the back, near the grill. And I hadn’t noticed Daly waddling out of it. Turns out he’d had a meal of his own.

He’d eaten most of it the head. Hair was still hanging out the side of his mouth. His glasses were clinging to the tip of his nose, a single good shake from falling to the floor. In the dark, his hands looked black rather than bloody, but you could tell from the smell. I ran straight into him, almost knocking him over. He fumbled his steps a little, leaned back against the wall, and braced himself.

“It’s… it’s okay,” Daly burped. “It’s… it’s not a person.”

“Not a corpse,” Russel added. “Not a soul.”

I could hear myself finishing the sentence. I was just a syllable or two away. I wanted to say it was not a person, too. Not a problem. Not a. Not a. Not a.

 

Instead, I pushed past Daly. I rushed forward, leaping over the dead body, and threw myself out the back door. I got a good ten, fifteen feet out past the door before I looked back. Daly and Russel were both standing by the door, looking at me. They weren’t chasing me off or trying to talk me down. They just stood there, mumbling the same pattern, the same rhythm. They couldn’t figure out what the hell this thing was, so they were just listing things it wasn’t. Not a this. Not a that.

Then, I heard something. A dragging sound. And I realized they weren’t looking at me. They were looking at something *behind* me.

Something cold and mucus-covered wrapped around my eyes like wet seaweed. I screamed, but that only served to open my mouth. Something cold got pushed in past my tongue, tickling my tonsils, and I swallowed. I choked as something bitter and meaty swirled down my gullet. It felt like someone had thrown a sack of bricks off a tall bridge, landing hard in the bottom of my stomach.

I fell forward, gasping for air and scraping my knees. I was dry heaving to get that thing out of me. My eyes were covered in grease, and all I see is this… figure. It emerged from behind me, moving past me. I barely saw the shape of it, but it had something like a big arm coming out of its side. It looked like a big corncob, but instead of kernels, there were *pieces*. There was the shape of a foot, a hand, long hair from a scalp. As it moved past me, Daly and Russel silently joined it.

Before they disappeared down the northern field, I heard something snap and tumble to the ground.

I got to my feet, stumbling. I made it to the bathroom. I shoved fingers down my throat, but no matter what I did, nothing came of it. Something was stuck in the pit of my stomach, and by the time backup arrived I was sobbing on my knees, bent over a bloody toilet seat. I was screaming into the porcelain, begging for whatever was inside of me to leave. But it didn’t. They had to drag me out by the arms. It didn’t get any of it out.

Not a piece. Not a little piece. Not a single, little, piece.

 

They didn’t find Daly, or Russel. I ended up with a two-night stay at the hospital. Apparently, something similar happened to Coreen. She’d had a breakdown, and they were still trying to figure out the problem. Some signs pointed to a fungal infection, but they couldn’t find the cause. The doctor determined that it was not a virus. Not a bacterial infection. Not a misfolded prion. They had to put her on an IV, as they couldn’t get her to shut her mouth long enough to eat.

They were still trying to figure me out when I got sent home. They said I wasn’t as far gone. Paid leave, three weeks. Three weeks turned to six as the test results came back inconclusive over and over again. At one point they thought I had some kind of contagion, but they couldn’t say for sure. Someone mentioned narcotics, but it just turned into a long list of negative tests. I switched doctor three times as they kept tripping over their own diagnoses. One of them ended up taking their own sick leave after a while.

I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get rid of this. I sit up at night, staring at the wall, drawing on my cheap wallpaper with a black pen. I want to help them. I want to figure this out. I write what I know to be true, over and over.

It’s not a threat. Not a person. Not a human. Not a corpse.

 

I had to give myself a reason to write again. I’ve been trying to resist it for so long. It’s like whistling a song that you know you can’t stop humming. If you start, it’ll be on your mind all day. But I’ll just do it. I’ll do it until I get it out of my system. I don’t care if it takes days, or weeks, or months. I’ll figure it out. I’ll get it out. And once it’s gone, I’ll be back here to figure this out.

Not a day. Not a week. Not a month. Not a year. Not a threat. Not a person. Not a killer. Not a beast. Not a thing. Not a Not a Not a",15,1767397152.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

Recently at work, I was talking about a coworker to another group of coworkers. I know this is inappropriate, but I didn't stop myself in the moment. The context is: I work in a grocery store. I was working at the coffee bar and one of the cashiers came up with a free drink request (we have coffee cards and after the 12 punches, you get one free). I realized though that she had gotten a free coffee 4-5 times in a month span. I thought this was suspicious and I basically speculated how she could be getting these freebies to those coworkers. Never did I directly say she was stealing.

I even confronted her and asked her where she got them from and she said ""customers"". We're not even supposed to take things from customers so that's also against the handbook. Anyway, someone overheard what I said and reported it to her. They told her I was talking bad about her and that I said she was stealing. She was understandably mad and went off. I formally apologized in person and told her it was inappropriate of me. She felt relieved and was happy I talked to her about it.

Next day, my manager says she's still mad and reported me to HR. I'm worried because I'm a manager and I don't want to lose my job. I was just looking out for my department. Is this grounds for termination? I apologized to her profusely and told her I never accused her. I didn't even think about bringing this to HR and wanted it to be behind us. At least I learned my lesson on thinking before I speak.",1,1767397142.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1q2eflh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1q2eflh/i_was_sure_id_hate_jeanne_dielman/,I was sure I’d hate “Jeanne Dielman”,"I’d had it in my watchlist for ages, dreading it the same way I do Infinite Jest in my bookshelf. By reputation, it seemed the kind of formal exercise I rarely have patience for, especially at 3+ hours. What I was not prepared for, when I finally sat down to get it over with, was the performance at its center, around which the entire film revolves, and that is just utterly captivating. Delphine Seyrig as Jeanne Dielman of no. 23, quai du Commerce makes peeling potatoes a harrowing experience of existential dread, makes the search for a lost coat button a quest of epic proportions. Without her, this film would have been torture. With her, it’s a masterpiece.

I’ve beens staying at my mom’s for Christmas, and I watched the film there. She kept passing in and out of the living room, occasionally asking questions like, “Did something happen yet?” I would reply, “She dropped a fork” or “She ruined the potatoes,” only half joking. Those moments are genuinely harrowing in context, because Seyrig’s performance, along with the hyper-static formal conceit of the film, makes us feel them the way Jeanne does. When, in the end, the camera shifts and we see the kitchen from a new angle for the first time in three hours—three days for Jeanne—I audibly gasped. Later, when she (spoiler) stabs her client in the neck with a pair of scissors, I was far less shocked. At that point, the world she inhabited had already come undone. The dropped cutlery, the spoiled potatoes, the ruined coffee, the occupied café table, the missing button—all of it had built up to that shift, that sense of reality itself cracking. After that, all bets were off. In the final moments, as Jeanne sat staring into thin air, white blouse stained with blood, I was reminded of that Yeats poem:

“Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.”

Afterwards, my mom said, “It seemed a bit pretentious.” And she’s right. As much as I loathe that word, this film is literally the prime example of what people who make jokes about cinephiles describe. “Some European film where no one speaks and a woman just walks around and has sex and is depressed” would not be an inaccurate synopsis. On a different day, I might not have seen much more in it, but I was really moved by this film, and it makes me a bit sad that so many people (myself included, up until today) would never even give it a shot.",20,1767397059.0,TrueFilm,15,0.82,False

Chapter 1
The Miller's kitchen. Rob is struggling to get his Costco name tag on the tag being so old that it doesn’t have wholesale on it, sporting a slightly stained Maple Leafs jersey. Sarah is meticulously applying blood red lipstick in the reflection of a shiny toaster. Tom is hunched over a soggy bowl of cereal. Lily is practicing soccer tricks with an orange in the air, never letting it drop.
Sarah: Rob, must you wear that jersey every Saturday? It's seen better days…like, maybe before the '93 playoffs?
Rob: This jersey has history, Sarah! It’s lucky! Besides, what's wrong with it? A man can’t support his team anymore?
Tom: It smells like beer and desperation, Dad. Just saying.
Rob: That's the smell of victory, son!
He bumps into Lily, who catches the orange with his foot and kicks it back up. 
Lily: (Smiling) Nice recovery, Dad! But you should probably focus on not losing your nametag. It looks like it's hanging on by a thread. 
Rob: Worry about your fancy-pants soccer, Lily. I got this. 
He tugs at the nametag, ripping it completely off. 
Rob: Crap.
(Sarah smugly) Well, that's just perfect. I have a closing in ten minutes. You'll have to go to work without it. Prepare for the Costco Gestapo.
(Rob groaned) This is going to be a long day. 
Tom was texting Carol walking outside when he looked up to see Michelle, who lived across the street, walking by. 
Tom: Hey, Michelle! 
Michelle stopped, her head tilting at an unnatural angle. A strange whirring sound briefly escaped her throat, barely audible. 
Michelle: Greetings, Thomas. I am…engaging in a pedestrian constitution.
Her words were perfectly chosen, yet her delivery was stilted, almost robotic. 
Tom: Looks like you're wearing your shirt backwards. 
Michelle blinked. A slow, deliberate blink. 
Michelle: Observation noted. Recalibrating visual perception algorithms.
Tom’s eyes narrowed. 
Tom: Recalibrating visual perception algorithms? No normal person talks like that…Algorithms? You okay, Michelle?
Michelle smiled, a wide, unsettlingly symmetrical smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. 
Michelle: Optimization is proceeding as scheduled. Have a pleasant solar cycle, Thomas. 
With another unsettling tilt of her head, she continued her walk. Tom watched her go, a knot tightening in his stomach. 
Tom: I know, deep down, that something is profoundly wrong with Michelle. Carol would never believe me. It isn't just awkwardness or a strange personality anymore. This is something else entirely.
Dr. Boseman lowering her welding mask
Dr. Boseman: Anya. This is a marvel of engineering! It utilizes a gyroscopic stabilization system, allowing it to scale vertical surfaces, traverse underwater, and…well, you’ll see.
(Anya Dryly) I’m sure I will. What is the use case, Mother? Who asked for a vehicle that can climb walls and drive underwater?
(Dr. Boseman wiping her brow) The applications are endless! Think about it! Search and rescue! Underwater exploration! Extremely dramatic grocery shopping!
Anya: Dramatic grocery shopping?
(Dr. Boseman ignoring Anya) Today's the day for the test drive! I'll be needing a highly motivated assistant.
Anya sighs, resigning herself to her fate. 
Gladys: Miller, you know the rules! No nametag, no shift. It's Costco policy! How are our valued members supposed to know who to complain to if they can't identify you?
Rob: Gladys, listen, it was an accident! My kid ripped it off. Can't you just give me a temporary one? I'll even wear two hairnets! 
Gladys: Excuses, Miller, excuses! I need to keep this ship running! I'm not running a daycare here!
A frustrated Rob walks to the front, muttering to himself, and bumps right into Sarah.
Sarah: Hey, Rob! Shouldn't you be stocking mega packs of Angel Soft?
Rob (grumbling): I ripped my tag. I'm out of a job. Any way you could get me in on one of those real estate deals?
Sarah (exasperated): Definitely not, sorry but these guys are still deciding whether they want the place. 
Rob: I can do it! Don't underestimate my powers! 
Young Couple: Do you know if the house is big enough to store those Costco paper towels…
Rob: I rest my case.
Dr. Boseman and Anya are in a contraption that resembles a cross between a submarine and a monster truck. They're parked in front of the Miller house. Dr. Boseman at the wheel. 
Anya: Are you sure this thing is safe, Mother?
(Dr. Boseman enthusiastically): Of course! I built it with my own two hands! Well, mostly. I did have a little help from that online tutorial video about building a subterranean escape pod. 
The vehicle suddenly lurches forward, nearly hitting the Miller's mailbox.
Dr. Boseman: Whoops! A little sensitive.
Tom: Okay, Lily, remember, you gotta jump over the lava pit and then double tap the X button to unleash your special attack!
(Lily, staring blankly at the screen): Lava pit? Special attack? But I thought we were fighting in the Battle of Gettysburg.
(Tom facepalming): No, Lily! That's what you were doing before I switched the game! Focus! 
Suddenly, a loud CRASH echoes from outside. The house shakes. Lily drops the controller.
Lily: What was that!?
Tom runs to the window and sees Dr. Boseman's bizarre vehicle halfway up the side of the Miller house.
Rob: Oh my gosh! I think Dr. Boseman is trying to climb our house!
Dr. Boseman, inside her vehicle, is wrestling with the controls.
Dr. Boseman: Almost there! Just need to recalibrate the gravity inverter!
(Anya mutters): We're doomed.
The vehicle's grappling hooks find purchase on the roof, and with a final, earth shattering groan, it pulls itself to the top. 
(Dr. Boseman triumphantly): We…have reached...the summit!
(Anya groans): I need a nap.
Sarah exits the car, holding court with the Young Couple, oblivious to the mechanical monstrosity now perched on her roof. Rob walks over, a defeated slump in his shoulders. 
(Rob): Well, this day just keeps getting better and better…
Just then a zoom sounds over the roof and a wheel drives down the road. 
Rob: What the heaven? 
Everyone dives to the ground as the All Terrain begins to dismantle itself. Everything falls, including the giant battery. The battery falls right in front of the Young Couple. 
Sarah: Welp. That's it, Boseman. I'm calling the police! And the HOA! And probably the national guard.
(Dr. Boseman, poking her head out of the hatch, covered in soot): Now, now, Sarah, let's not be hasty! I'm sure we can work this out. Maybe a mutual agreement.
Rob jumps up rubbing his hands
Rob: Don't worry everyone, I'll handle this! 
Rob strides up to the Young Couple.
Rob: Look, I know this looks bad, but believe me when I say that that house comes with a lot of character. And you know what else comes with character? Free Costco membership for life!
(Sarah looking distraught): Rob! I want her to move far away.
Dr. Boseman walks up.
Dr. Boseman: Don't listen to her Rob you love me right?
Rob looks down.
Rob: Yes.
Sarah: Rob! 
Dr. Boseman: You know? I have a time machine, I can get you a job at the first Price Club in 1977.
Rob: The first price club!
Sarah: Rob! Come back here! If you don't get back here I'm getting a divorce! 
Dr. Boseman: Don't listen to her look at this, it's my time machine, it's made out of a Cyber Truck.
Rob: Oh, yeah I know you have a Cyber Truck. I stare at it constantly, also you have a time machine? This is a world changing invention, why don’t you sell it?
Dr. Boseman: If I gave my time machine away to just anyone, it would be absolute chaos. I prefer to keep my insanely powerful time machine in my driveway with unlocked doors with the keys in the ignition.
They get into the time machine.
Rob: How smart are you?
Dr. Boseman: I have an iq of 277, Anya here is in the top 0.00001% of human intelligence
Dr. Boseman then sits there silently and she raps her fingers on the steering wheel. 
Dr. Boseman: Do you wanna bring any of your kids? Rob: No, Sarah would never forgive me, and the moment we come back she would have the police waiting.
Rob: Alright lets get this refrigerator running.
Dr. Boseman: I’m driving. I don't think I should be opening the center console right now.
Rob: Wait there's literally a fridge in here?
Dr. Boseman: Okay all we gotta do to time travel is put the car in park and drive really fast.
The car zooms and lightning bolts surround the car. The car appears in the garage of a house. 
Dr. Boseman: Here we are! April 13th 1977! San Diego California, location of the first Price Club!
Anya: Damn it! I really thought my wireless apps would still work but nothing on my phone does. Wait, Mother! We have no money, no fake IDs, and no plan! We’re just…here! 
Dr. Boseman, ever practical, opens the glove compartment and pulls out a wad of cash. 
Dr. Boseman: Relax, I anticipated this. I siphoned funds from my ‘highly experimental research grants’ account. And as for a plan…improvisation is the spice of scientific discovery!
Anya: You siphoned grant money? Mother!
But it’s clear she’s secretly amused. The trio walked through a bustling San Diego street. Rob, dressed in his slightly too small Maple Leafs jersey, sticks out like a sore thumb. Anya, Dr. Boseman is fascinated by everything, taking notes on a small pad. 
Anya: Mother, focus! We need to find the Price Club, not vintage synthesizers.
Rob, overhearing her, perks up.
Rob: Price Club! That’s my cue! Excuse me, kind sir! Can you direct me to Price Club? 
The man, sporting a thick mustache and bell bottoms, looks at Rob skeptically. 
The man: Price Club? You mean Sol Price’s new warehouse store? It’s down on Morena Boulevard. Can’t miss it. Just look for the giant pile of discounted tires.
Rob: Discount tires! My lucky day!
Rob beams. Cut to the exterior of a slightly less imposing, but equally warehouse like, Price Club. Rob practically sprints inside, leaving Anya and Dr. Boseman in his wake. Inside, the Price Club is a chaotic mix of bargain hunters and overflowing pallets.
Rob: Oh, sweet mother of bulk discounts! Look at those industrial-sized jars of pickles! Anyone a pallet of toilet paper taller than Lily! This is heaven!
Anya and Dr. Boseman finally catch up to him. 
Dr. Boseman: Yes right, right, right, focus, Rob, focus. Think like a Costco employee…but from the past!
He spots a man in a slightly rumpled suit talking to a group of employees. 
Rob: This must be Sol Price!
Rob steals himself and approaches. 
Rob: Excuse me, Mr. Price? I’m Rob Miller, and I’m here to apply for a job! I’m a hard worker, I know my way around a pallet jack, and I’m not afraid to wear a hairnet! Plus, I know all the best sales tactics! 
Rob exclaims enthusiastically. Sol Price looks at Rob with a mixture of amusement and confusion.
Sol: Son, have you been hitting the hard cider?
Rob: No, sir! I’m serious!
Sol Price strokes his chin thoughtfully. 
Sol: Well, I’ll be…You know what? I like your enthusiasm. And frankly, finding good help in this town is harder than navigating a forklift through a maze of stacked watermelons. Tell you what, I’ll give you a trial run. Start tomorrow. And lose the hockey jersey.
Rob throws his fist in the air.
Rob: Yes! I got the job! Thank you, Mr. Price! You won’t regret this! 
Anya and Dr. Boseman exchange weary glances, but a small smile plays on Anya’s lips. 
Anya: Maybe this crazy scheme actually worked.
As they leave the building they see a man who is dressed as Elvis who is wearing a Hawaiian lei. Rob runs up to him 
Rob: Elvis! Can I please have your autograph? I'm your biggest fan!
The Elvis performer looks confused but happy. 
Elvis: Sure thing! What's the name? 
Rob is giddy
Rob: Rob
The performer signs away. Rob walks away.
Rob: This is the best day ever!
Anya: How many months does the real Elvis have left?
Anya is staring at her phone in frustration. 
Anya: Okay, so no social media, no streaming services. This is officially the dark ages.
Rob is bouncing in his seat, practically vibrating with excitement. 
Rob: I can’t believe I’m going to work at the original Price Club! I wonder if they have a break room? I hope they have those little powdered donuts…Oh, man, this is going to be so great!
Dr. Boseman: Alright team, mission accomplished! Rob’s got a job! That means we can relax and enjoy the 70s! Anya, think of the fashion opportunities! Rob, think of the cheaper bulk discounts!
Tom watches Michelle leave her house. Tom follows her down the road. Tom follows her over to a clearing and hides behind a bush. A big spiky spaceship zooms down to earth in a rainbow in a beam that removes her real body from her robot body suit then zooms her back down in a replaced body. Tom's jaw dropped. He scrambled back further into the bushes, his heart hammering against his ribs. 
Tom: I’ve always been a bit of a sci-fi geek, but I never, ever, thought I'd witness something like this. A spaceship? A robot body suit? What in the actual heck is going on?
He risked another peek. The spaceship, a bizarre concoction of sharp angles and pulsating lights, was already retracting its rainbow beam. In its place stood…Michelle. But she was different. She stretched, her movements almost catlike. 
Michelle: Ah, much better. 
She murmured, her voice now softer, richer, and definitely not synthesized. She turned, and Tom froze, realizing she was looking directly at him. 
Tom: Has she seen me? 
His breath hitched in his throat.
Michelle: I know you're there, Thomas. Come on out.
Tom slowly emerged from the bushes, his hands raised in a gesture of surrender.
Tom: I...I don't understand. 
He stammered, his voice barely a whisper. 
Tom: What...What was that? 
Michelle smiled, a genuine smile this time. 
Michelle: That, Thomas, is a very long story. One I'm not sure you're entirely ready for.
She gestured towards the clearing.
Michelle: But since you've witnessed my little…commute, perhaps a little explanation is in order. The truth is, Thomas, I am not from Earth.
She pauses, letting the full weight of her statement sink in. Tom could only stare.
Tom: Not…from Earth? You're…an alien? Like, a real alien? 
Michelle chuckled, a warm, melodic sound. 
Michelle: As real as the air you breathe. My name is actually Michelle, of course. And this is my bio suit.
Tom: Bio suit?
Tom echoed, his voice still shaky.
Tom: The robot thing…that is a bio-suit? Why?
Michelle: To blend in, of course.
Michelle explained, her tone matter of fact. 
Michelle: Imagine trying to navigate your society in my natural form. I'd cause quite a stir, wouldn't I?
Tom: So…why are you here? What are you doing?
Michelle: I'm here to live on your planet and see what it's like.
Tom stared at her, speechless. 
Tom: But…Why us? Why this neighborhood? Why Michelle…I mean, why the bio-suit you chose?"" Michelle: I just landed here, I don't know.
Tom: You just landed? So, you've never been here before? You just pick a planet at random and...visit?
Michelle: I'm here to learn. To experience your world, your culture.
Tom couldn't help but crack a small smile. 
Tom: So, what happens now? What do you want me to do?
Michelle stepped closer, her gaze intense. 
Michel: That, Thomas, depends entirely on you. You've seen something you weren't supposed to see. You have a choice to make. You can keep my secret, which would allow me to continue uninterrupted, or you can tell everyone what you know, and risk…consequences I can't fully predict. 
Tom: And the consequences for me if I tell? 
Michelle: I am allowed to harm any native life. However, revealing my presence could trigger reactions from various parties. Governments, scientific organizations...even other alien factions. Your life could become…complicated, and potentially dangerous.
Tom swallowed hard. 
Tom: And if I keep your secret?
Michelle: Then you become…a confidant.
Michelle said softly. 
Michelle: Someone who knows the truth and can, perhaps, offer a unique perspective on the absurdity of your own existence. And who knows, you might even get to see things that no other human ever has.
She held out her hand.
Michelle: So, Thomas Miller, do we have a deal?
Tom looked into her eyes, searching for any sign of deception, any hidden agenda. All he saw was curiosity, a hint of loneliness, and a genuine desire to understand. He took a deep breath and shook her hand. 
Tom: Deal. But I have a lot of questions.
Michelle's smile widened. 
Michelle: I expected nothing less. 
Rob, looking strangely out of place in an ill fitting collared shirt and pants, stands nervously. He is surrounded by other employees, also looking somewhat bewildered. Sol Price walks up, clapping his hands. 
Sol: Alright everyone, listen up! Today’s a big day! We’ve got a lot of new members to sign up, a lot of pallets to move, and a whole lot of discounts to give! Let’s get to work!
Rob, ever eager, practically leaps forward. He grabs a pallet jack and starts zooming through the aisles. He spots an elderly lady struggling to reach a top shelf. 
Rob: I’ll give you a hand there, ma'am? I used to wrangle toddlers! This is nothing! 
Meanwhile, Anya and Dr. Boseman are enjoying a more leisurely morning. Dr. Boseman is intently studying a newspaper muttering to herself. 
Dr. Boseman: This is all so fascinating!
Anya: Mother, can you please focus? I need a decent latte. No, a proper milk based drink not some weak drip coffee.
Dr. Boseman waves her hand dismissively. 
Dr. Boseman: Latte? In 1977? Anya, you're living in a fantasy world.
Back at the Price Club, Rob is causing both chaos and delight. He stacks toilet paper into a giant pyramid, organizes the canned goods by color, and even starts an impromptu hockey game with some hockey sticks he found in the sporting goods section. Sol Price watches with a mixture of horror and amusement. 
Sol: This guy is a hurricane of enthusiasm…and a liability lawsuit waiting to happen. 
He walks towards Rob. 
Sol: Miller! A word! 
Rob stops his hockey game, panting. 
Rob: Yes, Mr. Price?
Sol: Look, I appreciate the…gusto. But maybe tone it down a notch, okay? We don’t want any customers getting injured or any more product pyramids collapsing. Just focus on stocking shelves and smiling, okay?
Rob nods eagerly. 
Rob: Yes, sir! Understood! Tone it down! Stock shelves!
That evening. Rob returns to their house, exhausted but beaming. 
Rob: I survived my first official day at the Price Club! 
Anya raises a skeptical eyebrow. 
Anya: Survived? Or caused widespread pandemonium?
Rob ignores her. 
Rob: Mr. Price says he is going to promote me to manager. He says I'm an asset to this company. 
Anya turns to Rob. 
Anya: So, what happens now? Are we staying here forever?
Rob:  I don’t know. I’m kind of enjoying this. I'm important. I’m the manager of the original Price Club!
Sarah wakes up and turns around.
Sarah yawns.
Sarah: Good morning Rob, oh, right, he’s gone.
Sarah makes eggs over the stove.
Sarah sighs.
Sarah: I know Rob ran away with Dr. Boseman cause I got mad at him but, I miss him, life just isn't the same without him.
Tom: Yeah, dad said he was going to teach me how to drive.
Lily: And he was going to teach me how to dance so fine that when the dance comes all the boys will want to get with me.
Sarah: Really? Cause I don’t remember any of this.
Tom: He told us yesterday at breakfast.
Sarah: No he didn’t, I was there.
Rob sits in bed. Dr. Boseman walks out of the bathroom wearing teddy lingerie. 
Dr. Boseman: Hi Rob.
Rob looks over. 
Rob: Anita no!
Dr. Boseman: Come on Rob, your wife doesn't like you anymore she said that if you left she'd divorce you, she's just guilting you into not choosing your own path.
Dr. Boseman says. Rob looks, thinking for a second. 
Rob: Okay, fine. 
It's dark when suddenly, the door to their room bursts open, and Sarah walks in, looking furious. She is flanked by Tom and Lily. The lamp turns on. 
Sarah: Rob Miller! You thought you could just run off to the 70s and abandon your family? Well, think again!
Rob stares at Sarah. 
Rob: Sarah? How did you even find us?
Sarah smirks. Tom and Lily look excited. 
Tom and Lily: We’re staying in the 70s?! Cool! Can we go to a disco?
Dr. Boseman, startled awake. 
Dr. Boseman: Sarah? What in the name of scientific anomaly are you doing here? 
Sarah glares at Dr. Boseman. 
Sarah: You! You are the reason my husband is gallivanting through time, abandoning his responsibilities!
Rob, bleary eyed and confused, tries to sit up but gets tangled in the sheets. 
Rob: Sarah, honey, it's not like it looks! I...I just...got a job!
Anya, drawn by the commotion, peeks into the room, looking mortified. 
Anya: Oh, good lord. This is even worse than I imagined.
Dr. Boseman, recovering her composure, sits up in bed.
Dr. Boseman: Now, Sarah, let's not be hasty. Rob is thriving here! He's found a purpose! And besides. 
She adds with a wink.
The 70s have so much to offer! Bell bottoms, disco, questionable fashion choices…
Sarah: I don't care about bell bottoms, Anita! I care about my family! And my husband's sanity! 
Sarah retorts.
Sarah: Rob, are you coming home or not?
She holds up a jersey and looks pleadingly. Rob looks at Sarah, then at Dr. Boseman, then at Tom and Lily. A wave of guilt washed over him.
Rob: I…
He stammers. 
Rob: I...I think I need to go home.
Dr. Boseman's face falls. Sarah softens. 
Sarah: Okay, then. Let's go home.
She says excitedly. With a sigh of relief, Sarah gathers the family together. 
Sarah: Alright, everyone, pile into the time machine- I mean...Dr. Boseman's car. Let's go home!
They walk away.
Sarah walks in the Real Estate building where she works. 
Sarah: I quit!
Sarah: I am so glad that you're home.
Rob: Me too, but I really did like working at Price Club. They had everything.
Sarah: It will be okay Rob, you can find another job. 
Sarah sighs. 
Rob: Okay okay…How did you get to the past anyway?
Sarah: I used an emergency machine that can send us into the time machine. Necessity is the mother of invention, or in this case, retrieval. Besides, imagine the commission I could have made selling those mid century modern houses to someone from the future! Missed opportunity. That house will not sell, I know it!
She pauses for a moment, thinking. 
Sarah: Although, maybe I can use it to sell houses in the 1950’s. Oh I can make a fortune!
Rob stares at her, bewildered.
Rob: Sarah, are you even listening to yourself?
Sarah: Fine, maybe I got a little carried away. But hey, at least you’re home, right?
Rob smiles and puts his arm around Sarah.
Sarah: I do feel a little bad though, Anita and you were dating then I met you, I was her best friend and I replaced her now she's living next door, a lonely widow. Maybe I could get a job at Knockers.
Tom walks by the door.
Tom: Mom, please no.
Sarah: So what? It’s not as bad as the job I used to have.
Tom: What? Mom, what are you talking about?
Sarah: Go to bed Tom.
The next morning, Rob sets out to find a new job. Dressed in his best suit, he walks into a local Nike store
Rob: Excuse me?
He says to the clerk, a bored-looking teenager with green hair.
Rob: I'm looking for a job. I have experience in…managing…inventory…and…enthusiasm!
The clerk raises an eyebrow. 
Clerk: Enthusiasm? Is that even a skill?
Rob: It is when you're selling hockey sticks!
Rob exclaims, grabbing a nearby stick and demonstrating a slap shot in the middle of the store. 
The clerk jumps back, startled. 
Clerk: Okay, okay, calm down. We’re not hiring right now. But…come back next week, and maybe we’ll have something.
Dejected, Rob leaves the store. As he walks down the street, he sees a sign in the window of a small, independent bookstore: Martha's Books. 
Help Wanted: Must love books.
Rob: Books? I don't know much about books…but I can learn!
He walks into the bookstore, which is filled with the scent of old paper and leather. Behind the counter is a kind looking young woman.
Rob: Hello, I saw your sign in the window. I'm looking for a job.
Martha smiles. 
Martha: Tell me, old man, what's your favorite book? 
He glances around the store, desperately searching for inspiration. His eyes land on a shelf filled with sports biographies.
Rob: Well, I'm a big fan of…'The Life and Times of Wayne Gretzky'!
Martha raises an eyebrow. 
Martha: Wayne Gretzky? Do you even know who that is?
Rob: Of course I do! He's the greatest hockey player of all time! He's a legend! He's…he's…a real page turner!
The woman bursts out laughing. 
Martha: Okay, I like your spirit. Tell you what, come back tomorrow for a trial shift. You might not know much about books, but you definitely know how to sell them!
Rob beams.
Rob: Thank you! You won't regret this!
Michelle is standing in front of a mystical council on her home planet. 
Person: The one known as Tom Miller harbours your secret. If word gets out that we exist it could be catastrophic. Many people will die either true or false so one thing becomes clear: you must kill Tom at all costs, even the Miller family if necessary. If you do not do this you will be banished on Earth forever.
Michelle: I will kill Tom I promise.
The Miller house was quiet, Michelle is standing in the driveway. 
Michelle: Okay, it's simple kill Tom or face banishment.
The window slides open.
Tom whistles in his sleep.
Michelle freezes.
Tom snores.
Tom: What the?
Michelle: Tom, this doesn't have to be messy. Just let me slide your body out the window, your life will end on impact of your head hitting the deck, you'll die instantly.
Tom: No, I didn't even reveal your secret.
Tom rolled off the bed just in time.
Tom: Help! Someone!
He shouted. Down the hall, Rob and Sarah stirred in their room. Sarah sat up first, her maternal instincts kicking in. 
Sarah: Rob, did you hear that? It sounded like Tom!
Rob groaned, rubbing his eyes. 
Rob: Probably just the kid having a nightmare. 
Sarah: Oh, for heaven's sake, That's no nightmare. That's trouble. Up and at 'em, you lout!
Sarah and Rob burst into the hallway just as Michelle corners Tom in his room. She has him pinned against the wall.
Michelle: This is for the greater good, Tom. You shouldn't have come.
Rob, charged forward like a defensive lineman. 
Rob: Get away from my son!
He tackled Michelle, sending them both crashing into the dresser. Sarah grabbed a nearby baseball bat, a relic from Tom's old Little League relic and swung it wildly. 
Sarah: Rob, what is this? Is this some kind of break in?
Michelle: Stay out of this, humans!
Lily peeked around the corner, her eyes wide with fear.
Lily: Tom! What's happening? Is that...Michelle? But she's Carol's friend!
Tom: Everyone, listen to me! That 'woman' is no friend, we need to get out of here. Dad, the car keys now!
Tom, finally free from Michelle's grip, grabbed his phone and shoved it in his pocket. 
The family bolted for the stairs, with Rob leading the charge. Michelle recovered quickly, her alien agility allowing her to spring to her feet and pursue them. 
Michelle: You can't run forever!
As they tumbled out the front door, Sarah scooped up Lily in her arms
Rob: The car get to the car!
Rob fumbled with the keys, unlocking the minivan just as Michelle burst through the doorway. 
Sarah: Drive, Rob!
Rob revved the engine, and the van squealed out of the driveway, leaving Michelle in a cloud of exhaust.
Rob: Everyone okay back there?
Rob called, glancing in the rearview mirror. Tom nodded, panting.
Tom: Yeah, but what now?
The Miller family were crammed into the cramped space of a Budget Inn room, the kind with questionable stains on the carpet and a lingering smell of stale cigarettes. Rob sat on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands.
Rob: I can't believe this is happening.
He muttered.
Sarah: Okay, everyone, let's try to stay calm. We're safe for now. Tom, you and Lily take the bed. Rob and I will take the floor.
Rob: I have an idea, it's a little insane, but it just might work.
Michelle runs up to the desk.
Michelle: Excuse me, what are the flight details of the Miller family? 
Flight person: Lets see…ah yes flight AY123 to Moscow, Russia. Departs in thirty minutes.
Michelle in the back rooms of the baggage belts she unzipped a heavy duty suitcase and climbed in in the fetal position and zipped it closed. The plane took off into the night. 
Rob: Good thing I've got a friend who works at the airport. We got him to forge a plane ticket and we didn't actually get on.
Rob is awkwardly shelving books, his movements clumsy and uncoordinated. He keeps accidentally knocking books off the shelves, startling the other customers. The bookstore owner, Martha, watches him with a mixture of amusement and exasperation while reading a copy of The King Never Smiles.
Martha: Dude, perhaps you'd be better off organizing the sports section? Less chance of literary casualties.
(Rob embarrassed) 
Rob: Right, right. Good idea, Martha.
He shuffles over to the sports section, relieved to be in more familiar territory. He starts straightening the shelves, humming to himself. 
Martha: Rob, I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first. But you really surprised me. You have a knack for connecting with people, especially kids. And you certainly know your sports!
Rob: Thank you, Martha. I really enjoyed it. I never thought I'd like working in a bookstore, but...it's actually kind of fun.
Martha: I'm glad to hear that. How would you like to come back tomorrow? Same time, same place?"" (Rob, smiling)
Rob: I won't miss it!

All my searches have suggested it comes from the play, The Misunderstanding; so I read it, and as much as I enjoyed it, I couldn't find this quote anywhere in the text. I even looked at possible variations of what it could have been in the play, but I would prefer evidence stating it is explicitly in there or somewhere else before I extrapolate anything.

I also hope this isn't another case of us in the modern age misquoting him, like the infamous coffee quote. 

Much appreciated, y'all!

1q2ecmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1q2ecmd/how_common_is_the_phrase_childfree_in_online/,"How common is the phrase ""childfree"" in Online Dating?","So I am pretty new to online dating after getting divorced last year. On Bumble, I have my ""More about me"" info set to ""Don't want kids"" and ""Don't have kids."" In my Bio, I also have a sentence that says ""Happily childfree and looking for same!"" Now I am questioning whether the meaning of ""childfree"" is as commonly known as I thought. Is there a way I can/should be clearer in my profile that I don't want kids and don't want a partner that has kids?

I had posted about an experience with someone mentioning they have kids at the last possible minute when finalizing a coffee date, on a different sub. A Redditor made a comment that ""*Being childfree just means you don't have kids currently. Doesn't mean you wouldn't want kids of your own or to take on another person's kids via a relationship That would be like me saying I'm 'not married,' and expecting someone to infer that means I never want to be married*"". I thought ""childfree"" was a common phrase and everyone knew what it meant, but maybe that's not actually true outside of certain circles?",4,1767396857.0,childfree,5,1.0,False
1q2eclu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q2eclu/am_i_overreacting_for_ending_a_10_year_friendship/,Am I overreacting for ending a 10 year friendship after being blown off for her douchebag new boyfriend?,"I'm sorry this is so long. I (46F) have stopped talking to my best friend (48F) after she blew me off for a new boyfriend. We met when our oldest children were in 4th grade together and also friends. I've been there for her through thick and thin - her getting divorced, helping her move, watching her kids, etc. She had always done the same for me, until recently. She is very busy so usually we hang out at her place. She also doesn't have a ton of expendable income so when we go out, I usually treat. 

One thing we've done for the past few years is season tickets to our local Broadway shows. Recently I've been experiencing a lot of pain and had laproscopic abdominal surgery to hopefully rectify it. We also had a show 2 days after surgery. She asked before if I'd be able to make it and I said I think I should. Also, when I couldn't make the previous show due to this pain I sent her the tickets the day before so she could go with her daughter. I knew it was too much for me and I wouldn't be able to recover quickly enough.

Come the day of the show, post surgery. She texted me in the morning asking how I was doing. I'm a night owl and we currently have matinee tickets because of her co-parenting schedule so I usually wake up with just enough time to make it to pick her up and go to the show. It's an hour drive for me, but she's at the halfway point so it still gives her a 30 minute heads up when I leave. I texted that I'm about to leave and we should have plenty of time. She got weird and starting saying things like I haven't had my morning coffee and I guess I can go if I can wear jeans. She's worn jeans almost every time we've went. Finally I tell her the stuff she's saying doesn't make sense and just don't go. ""It's fine.""

Luckily my kid saw me getting upset and went with me. I was still shaky on feet from surgery and afraid of walking such a long distance and in a crowd. If he didn't decide to go with me I'd either have had to go by myself and chance it or it miss out on a show I'd been looking forward to for a long time and lose expensive tickets that I couldn't even put up for resale due to the short notice. Afterward I let her know that I was hella pissed!

She came back saying I'd been distant and inconsiderate towards her new bf and it was a communication error and she'd consider her role in the mix up. I believe that because it was a weekend without her kids that she had stayed the night at his place and couldn't be bothered to go to show with me. She could've met me there and gone back to hanging with him, I would've been completely fine with that. But, after this I realized that I always went to her, we always talked about her, and always when it was convenient for her. I'd ask questions about her and her family and she'd answer them, but not ask about mine. When she went through something hard I was always there with how can I help, what do you need, let's go out and get your mind off it. But when I struggled this time, I got none of that. Since seeing the new guy she wouldn't ask about me and my life and when I spoke about it she wouldn't interact. Just listen until I stopped talking and then go back to herself. She was mad that I didn't like the guy despite her opinion of him. But she'd also tell me he'd say shit like he'd like to have a harem, and how he doesn't want anything to tie him down from doing what he wanted when, or how could she not close his expensive car door so hard (ew). She's quite petite so it isn't like she's a gym bro slamming the door. She's also now a single mom with 3 kids, the youngest being 10. I told her to have fun with him, but be careful because it probably isn't going to work out long term.

It took her a month to apologize, even though in my last message I said I was tired of a one way friendship and didn't want to share my life with her any more. I haven't responded because I flip flop between telling her that her apology was mostly good and if it had come right away we'd be fine or telling her off and that saying she's ""sorry I felt she chose the guy over me"" isn't good enough and she's still denying responsibility and giving her a piece of my mind. And that an apology from ChatGPT isn't a real apology. All my messages had been very thought out and I worked hard to remove any petty or overly angry tones. I'm especially sad about not getting to see her kids any more because I'm close to them. Her youngest is very much struggling with the divorce so I hate to abondon him and her middle even calls me Auntie. So, am I overreacting?",1,1767396856.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1q2eadm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1q2eadm/long_time_friend_of_30_years/,Long time friend of 30 years,"This is a throw away account. I had a best lady friend since high-school, I'm a guy. We were really close for 30 years. We ended up in an FWB situation that went on for several years. She then  takes a leave of absence from her job. Her mental health seems to be deteriorating, and she gets some mental help from professionals. She gets into a support group and starts doing overnights with them, makes other lady friends. She then starts acting very odd and nervous around me. She doesn't want to be alone with me anymore but won't tell me what is up. This goes on for 16 months, and I try to give her space and not bug her to meet up so often. One day I text her, that I'm down near her home and would like to get together for a coffee. I hear nothing for a week. Then I get a text, ""I don't live there anymore"". I try and call her, she won't answer. A couple of weeks go by, I call her parents. They tell me she has indeed moved but they aren't at liberty to say what or why, but that she is safe. Finally, I get her to text me. She tells me she reconnected with another guy from her childhood. This was around the time she started acting odd. She was very vague when their relationship started, but she move in with him, and actually got married shortly after. She hid all that from me. She never once talked to me about this guy or anything. All she told me was how special he was and everything to her. She used to tell me this all the time. How much I was her best friend and how much she loved me. I thought after everything we shared, that she would have at least told me the FWB was over, and that she wanted to start seeing other people. But no, she literally moved in and married this guy. She was previously divorced by the way, with a guy whom she had a child with. That guy is no contact with her. Her own daughter stop talking to her 6 years ago as well for unclear reasons to me. In hindsight I had hints of what was going on, but I thought that this is just my own insecurity,  that she would just tell me. One of her support lady friends lived in the same town as this guy. She would go and see both. In her mind she was not lying to me, but omitting some very key information. When I found out all this, she told me she was diagnosed with BPD, OCD, and depression. She was even suicidal at one point. She called this guy to come down and save her. She agreed to meet in person to talk to me. Of course that was 8 months ago and that never happened. I was very upset at the time, and I made that clear to her that. I told her she could have just talked to me from the very beginning and I would have understood and supported her. I felt so much loss, anger at being mislead, and that my friend of 30 year who I literally shared everything with could have done this. She has ghosted me since. I deleted her number, unfriended her, but I can't seem to stop looking at her profile from time to time. I finally know who she met and married. She told me she told everything about me to this guy, except of course the FWB thing that may have had overlap. I'm obviously heart broken in all this and feel so lost. I have a cycle of anger, sadness and straight out depression. My mental health has absolutely downturned from this. I just wanted to talk to her in person to get some kind of closure. To try and make sense of it all. She was so important to me as a friend, I don't even care about the FWB part. I tried blocking her on Facebook for awhile, but a part of me just wants to leave an open channel in case she wants to reach out. Another part of me wants to tell this guy he wasn't the only one and he was mislead. Fortunately those feelings are fleeting. I have read a lot on this sub and have seen so many similar examples. I at least feel I'm not alone. But there is a huge gap in my life where this person filled, for almost as long as I have been alive. The were family to me, and I still miss them, even if at times I feel angry about it. This is probably more an off my chest than anything. I know the obvious advice is to just block everything and move on, but this has been so incredibly difficult for me to get over.",2,1767396700.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False

1q2e67k,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoidGates/comments/1q2e67k/realities_of_the_void_body/,Realities of the Void Body,"# The Misconception

People read about void body capabilities and imagine:

""You become the void body. You fly around in space all the time. You abandon your physical body completely.""

Not how it works.

# Where the Void Body Actually Is

After void shell formation completes:

**The void body exists within your Dantian (elixir field) in lower abdomen.**

That's its default location. That's where it stays most of the time.

Your physical body continues functioning normally:

* You walk around like normal
* You eat, sleep, work
* You interact with the world physically
* Nothing looks different from outside

The void body is INSIDE you. Like a car inside a parking garage. It is only taken out of the garage and used when you need it.

# Why This Makes Sense

**The void body is:**

* Your Yang Shen (spirit body) with void shell
* Capable of independent existence
* But doesn't need to be separate constantly

**Your physical body is:**

* Still functional
* Still convenient for daily life
* Still your interface with physical world
* Why abandon it?

**Most of the time:** You just live normally. Physical body doing physical things. Void body resting in Dantian.

Like having a UFO in your garage. You own it. You can use it. But you don't drive it to the grocery store.

# Projecting Awareness Into Void Body

When you want to use void body capabilities:

**You cast your awareness into the void body.**

This is a conscious action:

* You shift focus from physical body to void body
* You now perceive from void body perspective
* Like switching cameras
* From physical body perception → To void body perception

Same spirit. Different vehicle.

# Exiting the Physical Body

Once awareness is in void body:

1. You can move it out of the Dantian
2. The void body exits your physical body
3. The physical body remains where you left it
4. The void body is now independent, outside, mobile
5. You are now perceiving and operating from the void body

# What Happens to Physical Body

When void body exits:

**Your physical body doesn't die or collapse.**

Why?

**A duplicate Elixir remains behind.**

When the void body (which absorbed the original Elixir) exits, a copy of the Elixir stays in the physical body's Dantian.

This duplicate Elixir:

* Keeps the physical body alive
* Maintains vital functions
* Provides energy
* Operates autonomously

Your physical body:

* Stays alive
* Breathing continues
* Heart beats
* Like sleeping, but deeper

No conscious attention needed. The duplicate Elixir handles everything automatically.

# Why You Leave Physical Body Somewhere Safe

Before exiting as void body:

**You put your physical body somewhere secure.**

Why? Because while your awareness is in the void body:

* Physical body is unattended
* No control of it
* Vulnerable to physical interference
* Needs protection

**Common practice:**

1. Lie down in secure location
2. Lock the door
3. Ensure no interruptions
4. Then exit as void body

Like leaving your car in a parking garage before taking the subway. The car (physical body) stays safe while you travel another way (void body).

# The Practical Usage Pattern

**Daily life:**

* Operate in physical body
* Void body rests in Dantian
* Normal human activities
* Convenient and unremarkable

**When you need void body capabilities:**

1. Secure physical body location
2. Cast awareness into void body
3. Exit physical body
4. Void walk, explore, whatever
5. Return when done
6. Re-enter physical body
7. Resume normal life

# Why Not Stay in Void Body Always?

You could, theoretically.

Void body doesn't need:

* Food
* Sleep
* Physical environment
* Could stay in void body indefinitely

**But why would you?**

Physical body offers:

* Easy interaction with physical world
* Normal social functioning
* Eating (enjoyable)
* Physical sensations
* Convenience

Most of the time, physical body is just easier.

Like having a race car. You own it. But you don't drive it to get groceries. You drive your normal car for daily tasks. Race car for the track.

# The Duplicate Elixir Mechanism

**Original situation (before void shell):**

* One Elixir in Dantian
* Yang Shen absorbs it
* Yang Shen + Elixir = unified

**After void shell forms:**

* Yang Shen + Elixir + Void Shell = Void Body
* All unified in Dantian

**When void body exits:**

* Void body (Yang Shen + Elixir + Void Shell) leaves
* Duplicate Elixir manifests in physical body's Dantian
* Automatic process

**The duplicate:**

* Functions like original Elixir
* Generates energy perpetually
* Sustains physical body
* Maintains life

Automatic mechanism. Built into the system.

When void body exits, duplicate forms. When void body returns, duplicate reintegrates. Seamless.

# Returning to Physical Body

When you're done using void body:

1. You return to where physical body is
2. Void body approaches physical body
3. You direct it back into the Dantian
4. Void body re-enters the physical body
5. Settles back into Dantian
6. Duplicate Elixir reintegrates
7. You're back

Spirit perception shifts from void body perception → back to physical body perception. Like switching cameras again.

Physical body wakes up (in a sense), you're back in control, resume normal function. Seamless transition.

# What This Looks Like From Outside

**Observer perspective:**

They see you:

* Living normal life
* Working, eating, socializing
* Looking completely ordinary
* No indication of void body

**When you exit as void body:**

* You go somewhere private
* Lie down, close eyes
* Appear to be sleeping/meditating
* Physical body left behind

**When you return:**

* Re-enter physical body
* ""Wake up""
* Resume normal activity
* No one knows where you've been

# Why People Don't Notice

If void body practitioners exist, you'd never know because:

* They look normal most of the time
* Physical bodies operating in society
* Void body usage is private (done alone, secured location)
* No visible indication
* Completely hidden

They could be your coworker, your neighbor, random person on the street. Anyone. And you'd never know.

Because they're living in physical bodies most of the time, just like everyone else.

The void body? Resting in their Dantian. Waiting to be used when needed.

# Summary

**Void body realities:**

* Exists in Dantian by default ✓
* Physical body used for daily life ✓
* Exit to void body intentional and occasional ✓
* Awareness cast into void body to use it ✓
* Physical body left in safe place ✓
* Duplicate Elixir maintains physical body ✓
* Return process seamless ✓
* Outside observers see nothing unusual ✓

Like having a private jet. You own it. But you don't fly it to the local coffee shop.

Most of the time, you drive your car. Sometimes, when you need it, you take the jet.

Outside of work, my boyfriend and I have an amazing relationship- A LOT of fun, adventure, romance, and a very intense emotional connection.

At work, however, no one knew about us because the relationship wasn’t really allowed and to protect his job.

While we worked together, a new girl started. I felt that she and my boyfriend became overly friendly. These were behaviours that felt questionable:

He began going out with her for quick cigarette breaks, coffee, and lunch without telling me. Since we worked together, he said he wasn’t hiding it from me, as it was right in front of me.  
One night, they went out to dinner after work. He didn’t tell me and when I called him three times that night, he didn’t answer, even though I knew he had seen my calls.  
They also started carpooling together. She lived along his route, so he would pick her up on his bike and drop her home.  
When her dog passed away, he made her personalised keyrings as a gift: her dog and her on his bike.  
He frequently messaged her, checking in to see if she needed help or if she was okay being alone after hours when she stayed late at work ie made sure she was safe.  
He joked about me having “great senses” to her, implying that I was watching or monitoring them.  
They messaged each other a lot, both during and outside of work, sharing GIFs, inside jokes, love hearts and love yous.

None of this was something he could do openly with me as he said we have a real relationship.

I know that no one likes to feel controlled. We’ve had many conversations about this, and he promised not to engage with her in ways that would undermine our relationship. To improve our relationship, I have left work. However, he continues to interact with her behind my back. e.g. they recently added each other on Instagram and he made his account private so I wouldn’t know. How do you know when attraction to someone else is harmless versus a threat to your relationship? At what point do repeated secretive behaviours become a dealbreaker?

TL;DR : I 25F am in a loving relationship, but my boyfriend 35M became very close with a new colleague in ways that made me uncomfortable: secretive outings, frequent messaging etc",1,1767395979.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

He didn’t let me disappear,"Last Tuesday just before new years eve at exactly 7:00 PM, I had everything ready to check out of my life. My apartment was spotless. My debts were calculated. The only loose ends were my twelve-year-old Golden Retriever, Barnaby, and the grumpy Vietnam vet next door who hadn’t spoken more than three words to me in three years. If you checked my social media, you wouldn’t have known I was drowning. I’m 29. A “digital nomad.” Three freelance gigs just to afford a shoebox apartment that smells like damp drywall. Online, it looks like freedom. Offline, it feels like running a race where the finish line keeps moving. The world feels unbearably loud right now. Everything is yelling—news, politics, prices, expectations. I felt invisible, scrolling past weddings and house keys while deciding which meal to skip so I could afford gas. That night, I didn’t want a scene. I just wanted the noise to stop. So I packed a bag. Not for me—for my dog. I grabbed his food, his favorite chewed-up tennis ball, and his leash, then walked down the hall to Apartment 1B. Mr. Miller lives there. He’s late 70s, built like a brick wall that’s starting to crack. Every evening he sits on his porch with a cheap beer and watches the street. No phone. No headphones. Just watching. In three years, all we’d exchanged were nods and grunts. I asked him to watch Barnaby “just for the night.” I told him I had a last-minute work trip to California. The shelter would pick the dog up in the morning. The lie tasted like ash. He wouldnt take the leash. He studied me for a long time, then said one word: “Bull.” I froze. “You’re not going to California,” he said. “Same sweatpants for three days. Red eyes. My wife had that look. The look of someone who’s done fighting.” I sat down because I didn’t know how not to. He handed me a Pabs. We sat in silence while Barnaby leaned into both of us. After a while, he said, “You kids think you’re alone. You’ve got the whole world in your pocket, but you don’t know the guy living ten feet from you.” He told me about how neighbors used to show up. How community wasn’t efficient, but it worked. He said “You think you’re a burden. That if you disappear, the math works out. That’s a lie.” I broke. He admitted he sits on that porch every night hoping someone will stop—just to prove he’s still here. We were both lonely. Just wearing different uniforms. He looked at my dog. “If you leave tonight, he waits by the door for a week. He doesn’t understand ‘California.’ He just knows his person didn’t come back.” Then he made me a deal. Every morning at 7:00 AM, I bring Barnaby over. We drink coffee on the porch. He watches the dog while I work or look for work. In the evening, I come back and tell him one thing that happened in the world that wasn’t bad news. “You don’t have to fix your whole life,” he said. “You just have to do tomorrow.” I went home. Unpacked the bag. Fed the dog. Set my alarm. The next morning, I showed up. We didn’t solve anything. But for the first time in years, the morning didn’t feel like a threat. It felt like a start. If you’re reading this and feel invisible, exhausted, or replaceable—you’re not broken. You’re disconnected. Look up. Knock on a door. Sit on a porch. You don’t have to fight the whole war alone. See you at 7:00 AM.

1q2dumd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2dumd,"My opinions on the new SNAP restrictions, and why some don't make sense.","Color code-
Green: Makes sense to me as to why it's allowed/banned
Yellow-Orange: It has good reasons and bad reasons as to why it's allowed/banned
Red: Why the actual *fuck* is this allowed/banned

I'm using the information I know. If I get something wrong, please feel free to correct me, and I'll edit my post with your information.

I'm trying to be a neutral party, but I am biased toward some things, which I will mention beforehand.

I'm not a reporter, journalist, or dietary expert. I'm just an autistic adult who's pissed that I have to spend money that I may not have on some safe foods/drinks now.

I will admit I am extremely overweight, but that is caused mainly by binge eating rather than unhealthy food choices. I'm making an effort to lose weight through medicine and changing eating habits, however.

My source to these documents is the [FSSA website.](https://www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/snap-food-assistance/smart-snap/smart-snap-retailers/)

Explanations:

Pediatric electrolyte drinks: Makes sense, as electrolytes are important to keep your body functioning. Can also be considered a medical necessity if a child (or even an adult) is vomiting/dehydrated.

Unsweetened water, unsweetened ice tea: It's unsweetened. No different than brewing a cup of tea for yourself or getting a cup of water from the tap.

Soda: The most obvious ban imo. Normal soda is packed full of sugar and carbs. However, I do believe that Diet and Zero Calorie soda should be allowed. Why do I think this? Simple answer, diabetics may need a fast sugar boost when their sugar is low. I have seen people who have low blood sugar and it is disturbing. They should not have to spend time searching for an allowed product or be made to spend money they may not have on a drink just so they don't die.

Candy bars/pieces: I hold the same opinion to this as I do to soda. Low sugar candy should be allowed.

Fruit Juice: This is certainly an interesting allowed product. Sometimes fruit juice is packed with as much if not MORE sugar than soda. I think fruit juice should be allowed or banned based on sugar content, rather than the fact that ""Oh it's fruit so it must be healthy."" Maybe we could even use a similar system to Japan's fruit juice law, which is as follows:
""If the percentage of the fruit juice is less than 5%, it is forbidden to draw a realistic fruit illustration to the label.

If the percentage of fruit juice is equal to or more than 5% and less than 100%, it is possible to draw a realistic fruit illustration, but it is forbidden to draw a cross-section of the fruit to the label.

If the percentage of fruit juice is 100%, it is possible to draw a realistic fruit illustration and a cross-section of the fruit to the label.""

I don't think this is the exact wording of the law, but it still explains the law perfectly. The same system could be applied to the sugar content, but in reverse. High sugar content only allows for a cartoon illustration, in between allows for a realistic fruit but no cross-section, and low sugar content allows for a realistic cross-section. I know this is an unrealistic expectation, but if this ban continues to spread across the US, it may prove useful.

Sweetened ice tea: Simply put, I have the same opinion as Fruit Juice. There should be a system in place based on the sugar content.

(Bias) Energy Drinks: These can be high sugar, which is understandable, but once again, low-sugar options should be allowed, but this is because of a different issue. Caffeine is used by people as a self-medication. Migranes, ADHD, and other issues. I use it as ADHD treatment on days I know I need to focus. You could counter by saying ""Oh, what about coffee for the same purpose?"", and there are a few reasons. Some people are allergic to the tannins in coffee, while some people don't like the taste, while for others, coffee isn't enough caffeine.

Fruit: This depends completely on the sugar amount once again. Examples shown seem to be dried fruit, but where do things like chocolate-covered and yogurt-covered fruit fall? This needs more specification.

Kettle and Caramel popcorn: Once again, sugar content. If it's kettle corn, how sugary is *too* sugary for their standards? I've had savory kettle corn, extremely sweet kettle corn, and in between. Specification is key. Caramel corn makes perfect sense though, since caramel is mainly sugar.

Chocolate chips and marshmallows: These are baking ingredients. If sugar isn't banned due to it being an ingredient, why are these banned? Also who eats chocolate chips straight...? Marshmallows are more understandable as they're simply whipped gelatin and sugar, and people will eat those straight from the bag, but that does not negate the fact that they are baking ingredients.

(Bias) Water mixed with Sweeteners: More often than not, this is lightly sweetened water or simply flavored water. Sugar Content is key once again.

Sports Drinks: High sugar? Yes. High Electrolytes? Also yes. People use these to recharge and recover nutrients lost from exercising. It should be the same as the Pediatric Electrolyte Drinks.

Potato Chips: Yes, potato chips can have low fat content if baked or air fried, and I do believe those should be allowed, but for regular fried potato chips, those can be covered in fats and grease, and shouldn't be allowed.

Ice Cream and Fruit Rolls: What in the cinnamon toasted fuck were they smoking when they made this decision bro. Ban fruit strips but ice cream is fine??? A single serve cup of Ben and Jerry's Cookie Dough has 30g total carbs, 21g being added sugar. That's 42% of your daily value for added sugar. Meanwhile, a single serving of BEAR fruit rolls has 13g total carbs, with NO added sugar. Literally only 4 ingredients, but it's not allowed on SNAP anymore. I'm not even gonna try to justify this, these two need to be swapped. Fruit Rolls allowed, Ice Cream banned.

Gum and Mints: If people are eating gum and mints to survive, that speaks more for the affordability of food rather than the bad nutritional value of gum and mints.

1q2duj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q2duj8/should_i_22m_tolerate_disrespect_from_my/,"Should I, [22M] tolerate Disrespect from my Girlfriend [22F]?","Me \[22M\] and my girlfriend \[22F\] have been together for 2.5 years.

She gets disrespectful during arguments, but tells me it's my fault. I'm not sure if I should believe her or if she is gaslighting me.

First I'll give you an example of disrespect.

This August she wanted to sign up for a gym membership, and we went together to check out the gym, as she is a newbie and I have some experience. As we were approaching the front door, we asked each other who will talk to the cashier. She said she wanted to talk because she wants to train her social skills. When we went up to the reception, the clerk noticed us, but  my girlfriend didn't immediately speak, so I jumped in and talked to the cashier. After the cashier told us to wait to get our tour, she angrily told me ""why did you speak? I wanted to speak!"". Ok, I shouldn't have jumped in! A few minutes later the instructor was giving us a tour. My gf had asked me to see if the gym had all the leg machines she needed. So when we got to the 1st floor, and I saw the machines, I immediately asked the instructor how much the membership is. My gf then told me ""not now"". And I ask her why.. And then she ""scolded me"" that ""We do not talk about price stuff in this floor, we talk about this stuff on the ground floor"" she said in a disrespectful and angry tone. After that we had a huge fight. I told her how disrespectful she was and she kept saying that I started all this by not listening to her and talking to the clerk instead of her, and how I shouldn't have insisted after she told me ""not now"" when I asked about the price. I think she didn't even realize that her tone was disrespectful.

This hasn't happened many times out in public (about 3 times), but it happens almost every week in private.

Our story:

However she says it's all justified, because I am not trying to make her happy by taking her on dates. And she is not completely wrong. She has been asking me to take her on more dates from our 8th month together. But due to our weekly fights (first about jealousy, and then about small things she slowly started snapping about), it was rare for me to be in a good mood for a date. Especially since I have a better time with her at home, when I am more relaxed and don't have to be alert. I also never went out in coffee shops etc when I was single, so it feels performative for me to plan dates to places that don't excite me. Especially when I barely have time to recover from fights.

To my defense, I have tried things: Going out on my own to scout cute bars (however the bars I found weren't her taste), going on some dates, going on some hiking trips... But lots of dates felt performative for her. Either because I wasn't enjoying it or because she didn't like the place. After a certain point she was saying how fed up she is with us not going out and if i suggested a new place and she didn't like it, she would get moody/angry. After a certain point I felt like everything I would do would end up in her telling me how bad it was. She wouldn't tell me at the time of the date but on our next fight. She kept reminding me that we should be going on more dates and now it has been 2 years since she first asked me.

During this time, she has started snapping and being disrespectful over small things, and the worst part is she cannot take accountability for it (examples incoming).

Example:

1 month ago we were talking on the phone and I was telling her something not important about some videos I made for a client. At the same time she was trying to find the videos to see how many views they got. As I was in the middle of my sentence, she interrupted me saying ""Wow why did they get so many views?"". I thought that she was literally asking me, so I told her that she interrupted me. Then she angrily told me ""Ok go on!"". I told her I didn't like this. She started telling me that I was not saying something important and I was finishing my sentence anyways, so it was ok to interrupt me. I disagreed and told her that I didn't like her ironic/angry tone when she said ""Go on!"" and that it's not nice to think that you are the one judging what is important or not. She started getting angrier and saying things like ""I got assignments to do"" in a mean and dismissive tone. Eventually we hang up angrily. Later she was ranting and saying things like ""Dont you have anything else to do?"" and ""Who asked you"" referring to me saying that she interrupted me.

She has also told me stuff like:

""Let's break up""

""I've never had a good time with you"" (and later took it back)

""I'd be better off with someone else""

When I was jealous she told me that it's unattractive, but when she was jealous she ALSO told me that it's unattractive.

...most of these in situations where I was trying to communicate with her healthily.

Sometimes she takes accountability for her disrespectful tones, but only after 2-3 days of us being in bad terms and me using all my brain power to persuade her. But the next time we fight and we mention the past, she takes back all the times she admitted to being disrespectful. It feels like she has 2 personalities...

I have tried to help her to fix it and suggested better communication. But her reaction to examples of healthy communication (like Jimmy On Relationships's Videos) was: ""Ew I don't wanna sound like Chat-GPT, talking like that has no soul; I'm human"".

When she is not angry though, she is very supportive (even offering to help with chores at my parents house), very soft spoken, feminine and sweet.

I am ok if some things like these slip out of her mouth. We're human and make mistakes. But I'm only OK if she recognizes and apologizes immediately.

She says that it is my fault that that ""bad side"" of her gets out, because I don't try to take her out more. I understand that I might not be helping her, but I think it's too much to say that it is my fault she loses her temper. This raises the ""philosophical""-sounding question:

To which extent can disrespect be tolerated?

I am willing to work through this but if she thinks that her ability to keep her temper is my responsibility, I don't know...

TL;DR:

My girlfriend loses her temper and gets disrespectful easily. She says it is my responsibility because I don't take her out on dates much.",0,1767395622.0,relationships,17,0.5,False

I was at one of the local shops I like to go to. It was pretty busy inside, so it was loud with all the chatter. I order my beverage, and the Barista asks for my name. I tell her it is Randall.

After a little bit my drink is ready, and they called it out by the drink name. Although it was busy, I had been the only one in line, and nobody came in after me, so I knew it was mine. The Barista [a different one from who took my order] handed me my drink and said that she liked my name. I thought that was interesting to hear, but took the compliment and thanked her.

When I got to my vehicle [coffee was to-go], I happened to look at the sticker label on the cup. That's when I saw it. My name did not show as Randall. It showed as Rainbow. 🌈

1q2dop6,https://i.redd.it/dvcwq80jl0bg1.jpeg,Do the dragons have refrigerators? Or something?,"I ask this because I was rereading Winter Turning and had a thought. Dragons have things like milk, ice cream, raw meat. Do they need to freeze or fridge these foods?

Apart from IceWings and SkyWings (and maybe the old Night Kingdom), no tribe has access to ice or general cold areas. 

Take the Kingdom of Sand as our primary example. They use milks, they have chocolate, and they also have raw meats that they store for days. Now, dragon biology could allow dragons to have more resistance to carrion, ESPECIALLY the NightWings. But milk needs to be stored in a cold environment, otherwise it spoils. One possible explanation is that that the SandWings either drink or use the milk in recipes before it has time to spoil, that that means that there is only about an hour-long window of time the milk will be safe to drink or use

Maybe they just bury it underground, and take it out at night when it's cooler? That just sounds like a recipe for sandy milk. Also, fruits. Most fruits will shrivel up in the desert conditions. Do the SandWings have a liking for dried things? Is there SandWing beef jerky?

Well, there is one explaination for this, and even that is a bit iffy with the timeline. That is that SkyWings and IceWings would supply ice to other tribes, post modern-day fridge style. IceWings would be the primary supplier due to their frostbreath, heck, a similar thing is shown with Mink's snow sculpture being shipped to Jade Mountain Academy in a box of snow and frostbreath

However, the iffy thing is shown when the wars come. Take the old Night Kingdom, for example. They are shown to have cheese, which comes from milk, which needs to be refrigerated. However, they would've had no ice from the Ice Kingdom at the time. Either the SkyWings would stock it for them, or there is a certain area in the Night Kingdom cold enough to act like a fridge

And the MudWings! They also have milk, even inventing a frozen cream-and-melons delicacy, when they have no cold areas nearby! Again, the only explanations could be ice shipments from the two cold kingdoms, or maybe some far-off corner of the Mud Kingdom is cold enough to support cream-based delicacies

AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED WITH PANTALA, AND ITS *CHOCOLATE* AND *COFFEE*, WHEN IT DOSEN'T EVEN HAVE A COLD AREA TO SHIP ICE FROM!

Or, maybe Pantala had just invented refrigerators. We know they have plumbing.

THAT DOSEN'T EXPLAIN HOW LEAFWINGS HAD CHOCOLATE

Actual cigar details: slim Laguito format not something I
usually smoke, Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, Ecuador binder, fillers from Nicaragua + DR (made at El Titan de Bronze in Miami). It’s one of those “small ring gauge = flavor compression” sticks where everything feels tighter and more defined.

Pre-light had that clean, slightly sweet tobacco smell with some cedar. Cold draw was easy—creamy wood, a little nuttiness.

Lighting up: first third was cedar + toasted bread with coffee bitterness and a controlled pepper tingle on the retrohale. No harshness, just polished. Middle was the best part—creamier, more nut-forward, espresso/dark cocoa vibes, and this weird subtle sweet note that pops in and out (not sugary, more like fruity/maybe seemed banana-ish). Final third stayed balanced, more toasted oak and coffee, some warm sweet-spice on the retrohale, and it never went sour or ashy on me.

Burn/draw were solid, but you can’t rush it. Puff too fast and it gets hot and loses the finesse.

Bottom line: I enjoyed it, it’s classy and complex, but I’m still not paying full freight for it. Great “try once” cigar, especially if you can get it via sub/sampler or at a reasonable price.

The drinks I make are milk drinks and they have been OK, not Cafe quality by alot but decent. I've been getting alot more into espresso and wanted to try just straight shots to see if I could figure out what kind of coffee I actually like when not aided by a bunch of milk.

Here is the issue, I've gotten a few different styles of coffee from a store called sprouts. I ground them in store and then drove home and tried them all within an hour of grinding.. But they all taste awful, super sour and completely unpleasant.

I measured the coffee in at 16 grams, used a wmd, stamped, used a puck filter thing, and the fluid came out at 36 grams, but they all just taste horrible still. So my question is is it just this machine is just bad? Because I'm totally up for getting a better quality one if that's all it is. Or should.

""Tris..."" I whisper.

His head snaps up and he freezes.

""How long?""I asked quietly.

""Just-just today,"" he blurted. ""I swear.""

Then he took a step toward me, reaching out. ""Baby, please listen-""

""Don't touch me!"" I shouted, jerking back. ""You still smell like her. Do you even realize that?""

""I'm so sorry,"" He said, the words tumbling out. ""She means nothing to me. You're my wife. You're my whole life.""

""And yet,"" I whispered, ""your mouth was on her.""

I wiped my face with the back of my hand, shaking. ""You already took us, the moment you chose her.""

————————

Layla

""You what?"" Snow said, stunned.

I leaned against the counter, arms crossed, staring down at the coffee mug in my hands. Snow. One of my closest friends at McClean and Hardmann-and Henry's wife. A few years older than me, calm, collected, two kids and one on the way. Always the voice of reason. And right now, I needed her voice more than ever.

""I don't know..."" I whispered, my words barely audible over the hum of the air conditioner. ""I... I can't seem to put myself out there. I'm scared, Snow. What if I get pregnant again... and we lose the baby again?I've already... I've already lost three..."" My throat tightened.

""Hey,"" Snow said sharply, putting her hand over mine. ""Stop that. Don't you even say that. It was never your fault. All of it. None of it was yours.""

I shook my head, eyes stinging. ""But why does it feel like I'm failing him?"" I admitted, voice cracking. ""Again and again, Snow. I know he wants a complete family. I know he's always dreamed of having a happy family of his own. And I... I can't give it to him.""

Snow's eyes softened, full of empathy and a quiet frustration at my self-blame. ""Layla... you need to give yourself a break. You and Tristan... you need to talk. Honestly. It's been months. Seek professional help if you have to. Therapy. Both of you. You've been through so much.""

I swallowed, nodding slowly. ""Lay... I know I love Tristan. So much.""

""I know,"" Snow said gently. ""You don't have to be strong all the time,"" Snow says softly. ""Just don't shut him out. Let him be there. And let yourself need him.""

I let out a shaky breath. ""Alright,"" I whispered. ""Maybe I can... drop by his office tonight. Bring him dinner. Since he became chief of surgery, he's been staying up late, buried in admin work.""

Snow leaned back, a small smile tugging at her lips. ""Go get your man back.""

I couldn't help but let a faint smile lift my face. She was right. Tristan... he wasn't just my husband. He was the one I wanted to fight for, even if I didn't know how anymore.

""Thanks, Snow,"" I said softly. ""I... I needed this.""

""Always,"" she replied. ""Now go. And don't you dare overthink it. Just go.""

I nodded, a new resolve stirring in my chest. I would see him tonight. I would sit across from him, plate of food in hand, and maybe we could find our way back. Even if it was just for tonight.

\---

The hospital smells like antiseptic and coffee that's been sitting too long.

Some things never change.

My heels echo down the corridor as I clutch the paper bag tighter to my chest, heat still seeping through the bottom, the faint smell of butter and toasted bread curling up toward my face.

Grilled cheese and jelly.

His comfort food.

Our thing.

I spot Sophie at the nurses' station, glasses perched on the tip of her nose, chart in hand.

She looks up.

And smiles.

""Well, look who's back,"" she says warmly. ""Good evening, dear.""

""Hey, Soph,"" I say, stepping closer. ""You look great.""

She laughs softly. ""And you look beautiful, dear."" Her eyes flick to the bag in my hands. ""You here for Dr. Scott?""

""Yes,"" I nod. ""I brought him dinner.""

Her brow lifts. ""Is that grilled cheese and jelly?""

I smile despite myself. ""Yep.""

She chuckles, shaking her head. ""You know I adore your cooking, but I still can't get behind that combination.""

""Want some anyway?"" I tease.

She waves me off. ""I'll pass. That's strictly a Tristan Scott specialty.""

Her gaze softens as she looks at me. ""He's been in surgery all day. Eight hours. He'll be exhausted.""

""I figured,"" I say quietly.

""Go on,"" she adds gently. ""He'll be glad to see you.""

I nod, throat tight. ""Thanks, Soph.""

I turn-and almost run straight into Aiden.

""Hey, hey, hey,"" he says, grinning. ""Look who's here to grace us with her presence.""

""Aid,"" I breathe, stepping into him.

He wraps his arms around me and pecks the top of my head, warm and familiar.

""I thought you were planning to become a hermit and burn yourself alive at work,"" he says.

I huff a small laugh. ""Tempting.""

He pulls back just enough to look at me. ""You okay?""

I hesitate. Then nod. ""I'm... trying.""

He glances at the bag. ""Is that what I think it is?""

""Unfortunately, yes.""

He grins. ""Man, I don't get it. But he loves that stuff.""

""He does,"" I murmur.

Aiden jerks his head down the hall. ""Tris should be in his office. Just got out of surgery. Probably starving. And grumpy.""

""Shocker,"" I say faintly.

""I think,"" he adds, voice softer now, ""he needs his gorgeous wife more than food.""

My chest tightens.

""I hope so,"" I whisper.

He gives my shoulder a squeeze. ""Go. I'll pretend I didn't see you if he turns into a lovesick idiot.""

I manage a small smile and head down the corridor.

The closer I get to his office, the louder my heart pounds.

What if he's too tired?

What if I'm too late?

What if I don't know how to talk to him anymore?

I stop outside his office.

The little space where Greta's desk should be is empty. No clicking keyboard. No voice on the phone. Just silence.

The light under his door is on.

A shadow moves behind the frosted glass. Too close to be alone.

My heart starts to pound.

I lift my hand.

Hesitate.

Then I hear it.

A soft gasp.

A low murmur.

A woman's laugh-light, breathless, intimate.

My stomach drops so hard I feel it in my throat.

No.

No, no, no.

My fingers are shaking when I reach for the handle.

The door creaks as I push it open.

And everything inside me shatters.

For a second, my brain refuses to understand what I'm seeing. Like if I blink, it'll turn into something else.

It doesn't.

Tristan is in his chair.

Not alone.

A woman is on his lap, straddling him, her legs wrapped around his hips like she belongs there. Her blouse is gone, lying crumpled on the floor. Her bra is pushed down, forgotten.

And Tristan-

his hands are on her waist, yes...

but his face-

his eyes are closed, jaw tight, like he's somewhere else. Like he's bracing for something instead of chasing it.

Her head is tipped back.

And my husband-

My husband-

His mouth is on her skin. At her chest. Pecking. Sucking. Lost in her. Like the world has narrowed to the sound of her breath and the curve of her body.

She giggles.

A soft, breathy laugh that curls around his name.

And he makes a sound I recognize.

Low. Intimate. The sound he used to make with me.

The room tilts.

My vision tunnels, black creeping in at the edges.

This is what it looks like.

This is what it feels like.

To watch your life burn in front of you.

The paper bag slips from my fingers.

It hits the floor with a soft, stupid sound.

No one hears it.

This isn't real.

This can't be real.

This is some cruel hallucination my mind has made up to punish me.

I taste metal.

My heart slams so hard against my ribs it hurts.

""Tris..."" I whisper.

The sound is so small I almost don't recognize it as my own.

But he does.

He freezes.

His head snaps up.

Our eyes meet.

And in that instant, I watch his face change-confusion, then shock, then something like horror tearing through him.

He shoves her back without even thinking, like she's burned him.

""Layla-""

His voice breaks on my name.

That's all he gets out.

I step back like I've been struck.

Like his voice burns.

I shake my head, once, twice, my breath coming in shallow, broken pulls.

""No,"" I whisper. ""No, no, no...""

My hands are trembling so badly I have to press them to my stomach just to keep myself standing.

This is what it looks like.

To watch your life shatter in front of you.

""Lay-this isn't-please, just let me talk,"" he rushes out, scrambling to his feet as she slips off his lap, fumbling to find her blouse, to find anywhere else to be.

I don't look at her.

I can't.

If I do, I might scream.

""If you say another word,"" I choke out, ""I will fall apart right here.""

He stands, panic all over his face. ""Lay, please-""

""Don't,"" I say, louder now. My voice cracks, splits down the middle. ""Just-don't.""

Tears blur everything. The room. His face. The life we built.

My chest hurts so badly I think I might actually be dying.

I thought I was coming here to fight for us.

I thought I was bringing him home.

I thought-

God, I was so stupid.

""I brought you dinner,"" I whisper, a hysterical little laugh bubbling up through my sob. ""Grilled cheese and jelly. Because I thought... I thought maybe it would remind you of us.""

He looks like I've stabbed him.

""Layla, I'm so sorry,"" he says, voice breaking. ""I never meant for you to find out like this. I swear, I-""

""Stop,"" I sob. ""Just stop. I can't hear this. I can't hear you.""

I take another step back, then another, until my hand hits the doorframe behind me.

I can't breathe in this room.

I can't exist here.

I shake my head again, harder. ""I hope she was worth it,"" I whisper. ""Because you just killed me.""

His face crumples. ""Lay-""

I turn.

And I run.

Down the hall, past faces that blur into nothing, past the smell of antiseptic and old coffee and everything that used to feel like home.

Now it just smells like betrayal.

By the time I reach the elevator, I'm sobbing so hard my chest feels like it's tearing open.

And when the doors slide shut, I finally let myself break.

\---

Tristan

I don't remember getting dressed.

I don't remember grabbing my coat, my shoes, my phone.

All I know is that one second I was in my office, the echo of her sob still tearing through me-and the next, I was running.

""Dr. Scott? What happened?"" Sophie shouted as I flew past the nurses' station.

I didn't stop. Couldn't.

All I could see was Layla's face.

The way her eyes found mine just before the elevator doors slid shut.

Wide. Shattered.

Like I'd reached into her chest and crushed her heart with my bare hands.

That look undid me.

I did this.

For the first time since the day I met her-since the day I promised to protect her-I knew, with terrifying clarity, that I might have finally lost her.

""Tristan!""

Aiden's voice behind me, sharp with worry.

""Not now, Aid!"" I yelled, already taking the stairs two at a time.

My lungs burned. My legs screamed. I didn't care.

By the time I pulled into our driveway, her car was already there-parked crooked, half over the line, like she hadn't even seen it.

Panic punched through me.

I bolted up the steps, shoved the door open, and ran straight for our bedroom.

""Layla!""

She was there.

Standing at the dresser.

Back to me.

Both hands gripping the edge so hard her knuckles were white.

Her shoulders were shaking.

My chest caved in.

""Lay..."" My voice broke. ""Baby...""

She didn't turn.

""How long?"" she asked quietly.

The calm in her voice scared me more than if she'd been screaming.

""How long have you been cheating on me?""

My mouth opened.

Nothing came out.

""Answer me!"" she snapped, finally turning, eyes red, face streaked with tears. ""How long, Tristan?""

""Just-just today,"" I blurted. ""It just happened today. I swear. God, I'm such an idiot. I didn't plan it. I didn't-""

I took a step toward her, reaching out. ""Baby, please-""

""Don't touch me!"" she shouted, jerking back. ""Don't you dare touch me!""

Her voice cracked on the last word, and it felt like being stabbed.

I froze, my hands falling uselessly to my sides.

""Look at you,"" she whispered, laughing brokenly. ""You still smell like her. Do you even realize that?""

I swallowed hard. I hadn't. I couldn't think past the image of her walking away from me.

""I'm so sorry,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Layla, I hate myself. I wasn't thinking. I was weak. I was lonely. I-""

""Lonely?"" she echoed. ""You were lonely?""

She shook her head, tears spilling again. ""I was right here. I was killing myself trying to be okay again for you. For us. And you were lonely?""

""That's not what I meant,"" I said desperately. ""I didn't mean you weren't here. I just- I felt like I couldn't reach you anymore. And that doesn't make this okay. Nothing makes this okay. I know that. I know.""

She pressed a hand to her chest like it hurt to breathe.

""So you found someone who made you feel wanted,"" she said. ""Someone who laughed with you. Someone who let you touch her.""

Each word was a blade.

""It meant nothing,"" I said quickly. ""Nothing, Lay. She means nothing to me. You're my wife. You're my whole life.""

She looked at me then.

Really looked at me.

""And yet,"" she whispered, ""your mouth was on her.""

I flinched.

""I saw you,"" she went on, voice trembling. ""Do you have any idea what that does to someone? To burn that into their brain? I will see that every time I close my eyes.""

""I know,"" I said, tears finally spilling. ""I know, and I will regret this for the rest of my life. But please-please don't give up on me. On us. We've lost so much already. Don't let this be the thing that takes us too.""

She wiped her face with the back of her hand, shaking.

""You already took us,"" she said. ""The moment you chose her.""

""That's not true,"" I said, stepping closer despite myself. ""Layla, I choose you. I will always choose you. I made the worst mistake of my life, but I'm here. I'm begging you. Let me fix it. Let me try.""

Her lips trembled.

""You can't fix this,"" she whispered. ""You can't unsee what I saw. You can't undo the way you made me feel like I was nothing.""

""You are everything,"" I said hoarsely. ""You are my heart. My home. I don't know how to exist without you.""

She closed her eyes, fresh tears slipping free.

""I don't know how to exist with you right now,"" she said.

The words hit harder than any slap.

""I need space,"" she continued. ""I need to breathe. I can't even look at you without breaking.""

My chest seized. ""Layla, please-don't push me away. Not tonight. Not like this.""

She shook her head. ""Sleep in the guest room.""

The finality in her voice was devastating.

""I'll do anything,"" I said. ""I'll move to a different hospital. I'll go to therapy. I'll give you my phone, my schedule, my life-""

""I don't want your phone,"" she said. ""I want my husband back. And I don't know if he exists anymore.""

I had no answer.

She turned away from me, climbing onto the bed and curling into herself, back facing me again.

That was it.

Dining outdoors unmasked is not risk free of course but far safer than indoors. 

When I look online for restaurants with patios, they have so far all been closed with plastic sheeting on all four sides, so for all intents and purposes they might as well be indoors.

1q2dmrp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2dmrp,"Ebbe (*) - Tampa, Florida","Overall: 

The concept is elevated Nordic food, and everyone is sitting around a single huge U shaped communal bar, which is a nice idea in theory but theres not really any cooking or anything too interesting going on inside the bar.


Food had some highlights and lowlights, and overall id say met expectations, though service was definitely lacking in some areas. Note that for some of the dishes the portion sizes were very small even for a tasting menu, so i would not recommend skipping lunch before coming here.


Service/etc: First of all water is $10 which i dont like and this was the only restaurant I went to in Tampa that had this fee. Plus they actually double charged me for the water and i had to notify them and then they fixed it. The servers are also the chefs, and I think the service suffered due to this. They were all friendly enough and met expectations in that regard, but everything else was lacking. For example they never cleaned the crumbs from the bread (and there were A LOT of crumbs from it) until like 20 minutes and multiple courses later, and even then when someone finally noticed and tried to clear them they only cleared like 25% of the crumbs? They also never took away the empty bread/butter plate, and some silverware wasn’t there for my one of my courses (though they did quickly correct that).

Food:


squash cracker (pic 2):
Nice flavors and cool texture kind of like a great chip 6/10, 


roe on cheese tart (pic 3): 
Too simple and i just didnt really like it 3/10


 Sunchoke eclair (pic 4):
Very good eclair with great flavors 7/10


Mushroom sponge with mushroom cream filling (pic 5): very light and elegant but tasty 8/10



Snow Crab (pic 6):
Cold crab with a miniscule bit of sauce u could barely taste, and tasteless flowers, with cucumber that also has basically no taste. Basically tasted just like a small dollop of cold crab that i think was style over substance, to be fair i dont really like cold crab dishes, but still i think any decent sushi spot with snow crab has a crab dish thats at least as good as this in terms of flavor 3/10


White tuna with kohlrabi, elderflower sauce (pic 7):
Quite good and delicate flavors. Note that this is tiny and even smaller than it looks like in the photo and you can probably fit all the tuna on a single spoon: 7/10


Turbot in white sauce (pic 8): 
Nice clean flavors and well cooked and quite tasty so its hard to fault it, but ultimately not memorable: 7/10

You cant really see most of the dish from the pic because its under the licorice, but i loved the flavors here and this was one of my absolute favorite dishes in Tampa. 10/10


Venison (pic 11):
This actually had some good flavors but unfortunately was almost cold when i got it and i didn’t love the cook on it, though it did look better on other tables. The flavors were there but the final product of my dish was just was just lacking for some reason, probably if i tried it again and got luckier i would like it a lot more but as it stands 4/10


Apple, blackcurrant, goat cheese (pic 12):
Very acidic sauce that contrasts a lot with goat cheese, but over all still a nice pallet cleanser with the delicate twirl 6.5/10


 Coffee, hazelnut, brown butter (pic 13):
Basic and not memorable but it did have good flavors 5/10


Petit fours (pic 14):
They were ok 4/10



Overall despite some misses I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area interested in this type of food, and this was my second favorite meal in Tampa. I had the full tasting menu for $295 but in terms of value i would probably recommend the shorter tasting menu, which still has most of the dishes including the foie gras and venison, and I think is just missing the 1 biters and pallet cleanser, (most of which were small but I did enjoy) but costs $110 less.",8,1767395102.0,finedining,0,0.9,False

For me, it was my weekly coffee run, and even that still stings a little.

1q2diz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/comments/1q2diz3/what_gloomhaven_taught_me/,What Gloomhaven Taught Me,"Two weeks ago, I finished my solo run of Gloomhaven (1e). I played for a year (251hrs), with a solid 3-month long break in the middle during which I wasn’t playing anything. I hit most major milestones in the game – finished the main story, finished the town records, unlocked every character and played all but four – but I didn’t complete every available scenario. Only about 2/3 – I think it was 67 total?

The 3-month long break hurt my progress for sure. Contributed to a “flavor fatigue” that I didn’t anticipate. Prior to Gloomhaven, I spent a year playing through all of Etherfields (reported [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/comments/1fdtuht/a_year_playing_etherfields/) \-- edit to add actual link). No fatigue there. Instead, Etherfields lingered like a ghost I regularly compared Gloomhaven to. Not the games directly, but the experiences.

Gloomhaven doesn’t need another review. My brief take on the game – it’s the right amount of challenging and I enjoyed it but not nearly as much as I anticipated. I don’t anticipate buying Gloomhaven (2e), but at least once I have some distance from this “flavor”, I’ll return to play the next block of content – the remaining scenarios and other x-haven content I already own.

Gloomhaven confirmed some important preferences for how I enjoy the hobby, preferences that have already informed how I’ve approached my next big game.

**DIY Organization** (Strangely, a preference I confirmed while just trying to eliminate lid lift) – For Gloomhaven, I assembled a nice, wooden insert – the kind that ensures that everything is in its “just right” place when packed, that setup and play are as expedited as possible, and that it looks nice on the table. Equal parts function and fashion as these things go. That said by the end of my run, I had shed so much of it in favor a DIY solution, patched together by burger token deckboxes, cellophane bags, discreet jewelry cases, and foamboard. I gave up a “good look” for a camera I will never be on and question why I ever bought into it beyond “they thought of everything so I don’t have to, right?”

**Analog Play** – I began understanding this preference with Etherfields, but Gloomhaven really drove it home. Even with the advent of digital tools, and even when those tools have obvious, positive impacts on play (i.e. reducing setup and admin), I deeply prefer to keep all play analog. No digital script books. No helper apps. This extended to the digital implementation of Gloomhaven as well – I bought it, tried it, shelved it.

Some preferences are beyond reason, and the best explanation I’ve pitched to others is a comparison to my coffee setup. Nothing crazy, just whole beans ground at home for a French press. It doesn’t make the most coffee, but it makes enough in a just-right way. “Most” has never been the point.

**Default Narrative** – I reasonably suspected this preference with my purchases, and my play patterns have now confirmed it. Not every game that has a narrative is right for me, but every game that’s right for me has a narrative. Not strictly speaking a multi-session narrative – I love several games that we can consider vignette play. Consequently, my collection grows slowly and I play through it even slower.

Another way I’ve thought of this is the narrative in the game vs. the narrative of the game. In part, this is why games like Spirit Island and Mage Knight haven’t appealed to me. Maybe for group play they would, but I largely don’t buy games for group play anymore – the only one I did in the last 4 years was Arcs, I think?

**Default Solo** – I realized this preference toward the end of my Gloomhaven run when someone in my weekly friend group (not a boardgame group) asked if there’s a boardgame I had been itching to play. After a moment’s thought, I told her honestly there wasn’t. I love these friends – there’s a reason we hang out nearly every week – but I didn’t itch to play a particular game with them because I had scratched the itch enough by myself. The games I prefer to play (default narrative) I prefer to play alone. They can’t realistically commit to the games I want most to play, but even if they hypothetically could, I don’t want to share these games.

Again, I love these friends. I enjoy playing boardgames with them too when they volunteer it, and if they don’t, I can’t imagine ever choosing to play a solo game vs. choosing to engage in a group activity with them. When looking at games, however, when looking at what I volunteer, I have a deep-rooted preference now.

Maybe I’ve swayed too far afield. I’m not sure. I am sure, however, that I’m enjoying myself and no one is upset about it (yet if ever).

My next big game that I’m playing is my white whale – Kingdom Death: Monster. I passed on the original kickstarter, but my wife surprised me with it for Christmas, and I was psyched to play. I have many hours (19hrs) of play-time and even more hours of organization and model building already logged. Knowing my preferences have made for a very smooth start.

I have no illusions about “finishing” this game, setting more realistic goals about what I might accomplish in a run, and this brings me to the lesson Gloomhaven made sure I learn.

**It’s okay to step away** – I would have preferred to finish what I set out to finish. Originally, I wanted to finish all of base Gloomhaven, all of Forgotten Circles, and all of Jaws of the Lion. As the flavor fatigue set in, I had to let go of that goal and I had to get comfortable with that fact. Otherwise, I would have made myself miserable. I’m not looking for misery.",34,1767394848.0,soloboardgaming,10,0.94,False
