1q2n3jb,https://i.redd.it/7gvzievtt2bg1.jpeg,Day 4 of recovery,"It’s day 4 now after my stupid lonely Christmas binge of 4 or 5 bottles of vodka over the period of a few days.

Thank you for all the helpful comments and suggestions.

Just giving an update, not that I think anyone is interested I just feel a bit stir crazy.

A lot of the symptoms have passed, but the bloating in my stomach and general persistent headache is still making things quite miserable. The diarrhoea has stopped but it just lots of gas now.

I still struggle to sleep a lot and feel quite down without any motivation.

I can eat properly again and after some useful suggestions I had mashed potatoes last night and just had some pho soup. I have avocado, minestrone soup, rice, tuna, pizza in the fridge so I’ll see what I feel like tonight.

I’m down to a diazepam in the morning and one at night and seeing the doctor again tomorrow.

I have a mix of B vitamins, magnesium and theramine in the morning to help my brain gets its brain chemistry more on track. Other than that I have lots of water (mixed with an electrolyte tablet so I don’t deplete essential salts by drinking too much water).

My flat was a disgusting mess and my poor cat was yowling knowing something was wrong with me and wouldn’t come near me, so I did a massive clean up on day 2 and every inch was scrubbed, he also go lots of extra treats and now won’t leave me alone, giving me lots of hugs.

I went for a walk but can’t get motivated. I’ve just been binge watching Voyager in bed most days.

I treated myself to a coffee today as the caffeine withdrawals weren’t helping.

The bloating and gas is really uncomfortable but I’m doing a lot better. I can’t tell my parents as they would just worrry and live at the other side of the planet. I only have one friend I can really talk to about it.

People say go to AA but honestly it isn’t for me. I love to listen and to talk occasionally but the rest of it is too culty for me. They make you hold hands and chant the mantras and participate in other rituals. I try to leave early or arrive late to skip all that but I get called rude. Other ones I’ve been to have been cliques who seem to only have the same few favourites talk each year. I understand it helps millions of people stop drinking so this is just my thoughts on what seems like an amazing organisation.

I have counselling and free psychology appointments/treatments available at my local hospital which i have done in the past. I got 160 sober and I’m determined to do that again.

I tried to do “something “ and booted up POE 2 but it just seemed too complicated and I found it not relaxing.

Sorry for the rant I guess I wanted to talk about it all

Late post (December stats). I hit my “goal” a goal I don’t like (long story, but if you have seen the show House, or read my past posts on the topic, after many years of poking, prodding, testing and such starting at the ripe old age of 17… as a student athlete… I was told \*insert current day shocked pikachu face\* that if I lost a certain amount of weight (got to 145… I was only 170 at the time, a healthy weight at 5’11”!) I may not be diabetic anymore. This is NOT a reality!… they just had no idea what was wrong with me as I’m not a recognized type of diabetic) and am now in maintenance!!! (I’ll tell my doctor this next week 🤪) stats are above … or see photos.

I feel great. I am too slim for my liking. I have some saggy skin and areas (abdomen, inner though, arms) that need toning and improving (added collagen to my coffee and hair skin and nail specific supplements seems to help). I fully intend to start working out soon. I know. I know. That sounds absurd, especially if you see where my muscle mass sits. I have not worked out at all (well, some PT as I have an injury (tear) in my hip). This is for sure not to brag. We are all so very different genetically. We will all respond to this drug, food, exercise, alcohol, everything differently. You have to read what others post with that understanding and find what works for you. For me, I stayed the course and determined how much of the negative I was willing to tolerate for my health. I am now healthier and stronger, I can partake in activities that I want. I can travel and walk and explore in ways I didn’t before. I can feel more comfortable in a variety of scenarios (I’m still awkward and such, the drug doesn’t help that) and I fully intend to thrive. 

Whether you are just starting or half way there, keep going. You spent \[insert number of years\] unhealthy and if it takes 2-3 years to get healthy and regain your life, is it worth it? It was for me. The nausea, sulfur, headaches, lethargy, and other negative side effects should fade with time. Stay hydrated and eat protein! See my prior posts (there are like 2 of them) for what my journey has been like so far. 

Obligatory: I am not providing medical or legal advice, only my experience and take on Eli Lilly produced and sold Mounjaro, not any other GLP-1, and especially not anything from a comp\*\*\*ding pharmacy, and specifically from a diabetic/for diabetes. I would posit that the above is also applicable to Zepbound as it is the identical drug from the same manufacturer, but the pharmacokinetics could be different as the element of diabetes is missing and I have not read those studies.

Curious to know if there is a more economical brewing method to brew black coffee with the speed and ease of an Aeropress (time to setup, clean, adaptability to different beans).

My fiancé and I will be having a dry wedding. Both our ceremony and reception will be hosted in our church, so alcohol is not allowed on the premises. Neither of us drink anyway, so it works for us.

If you’ve had or been to a dry wedding, how have you navigated this? I don’t feel like I should need to explain it since churches generally do not allow alcohol, but I also don’t want to deal with people complaining or asking about it. Should there be a note on the invite?

context: i work at a cafe (local, small cafe, not a chain). we have an espresso machine but we also make fresh drip coffee every morning, and its put into a self serve machine. all you have to do is press the button at the top, and coffee comes out. we leave this out on a counter, and customers buying drip coffee are allowed to get it themselves (theres things of creamer and half and half and sugar and stuff. little coffee station)

anyways. it was incredibly busy. i had like 20 orders backed up, and it was just me and my boss working together, because i was still in training learning how to make things and how to use the register. i was working register and food, my boss was doing the coffee

these two men come in. one orders a macchiato, the other orders a plain black coffee with one pump of brown sugar cinnamon syrup. no problem, i can do that

me: ""yeah i can totally do that for you! so the plain black coffee is going to be right to your left, just fill up the cup and bring it to me so i can put the syrup in, okay?"" and i rung them up

i spend ten minutes working on backed up orders and working register, and by this point ive already put out the macchiato, but i notice both men are standing by the door and watching me. so again, i say ""hey, the drip coffee is right over there. you just have to fill it up and bring it to me""

and i know they heard me, because he nodded. but he didnt do it and just watched me

so by now its been thirty minutes since they ordered and theyre still just watching me work. they dont go up to my boss, they go up to me specifically, asking ""wheres my coffee."" and again i explain to them (for the tenth time now) that its the drip coffee two feet away from them. so by this point i just grab a cup, put the syrup in, and leave it right next to the drip coffee

me: ""the syrup is in here, you just need to fill it with the self serve coffee""

again, a nod and no action. just keeps watching me. ten minutes later, he comes back up, and i start talking before he does, explaining again (slower and slightly louder) that the plain black coffee is self serve

by this point i think he realizes hes not gonna get the 19 year old barista to do it for him, and just does it himself and leaves without a word

**My New Year's Resolution : The Optimally Fuckable Husband Project**



I (33M) am working on a theory, and this year, my New Year’s Resolution is different from the usual ones. I’m designing my life around a single, simple concept: Maximizing my fuckability as a husband.

And this isn’t just about looking good. After much thought, I now believe that my wife’s (33F) desire to smash is the North Star leading me and my family to a much happier life.

When I break down the things that make my wife want to bang, it becomes so clear. For instance:

The better I look, the more likely my wife is to bump-uglies

The cleaner the house, the less she is stressed about the house, the more likely she will want to have sex in the house

The more money in our bank account, the more she can do what she wants (with me)

The more she can rely on me to hang out with our kids, the more she can focus on herself/the other stressors she needs to deal with, and the more she will want to procreate (with protection)

The more the dogs bother her, the less she wants to do doggy

The more she and I hang out without the expectation of sex, the more one thing leads to another

It’s easy to see the actions I would take to make myself more boinkable:

Workout more

Dress better

Keep the house tidy

Make smart financial decisions / Earn more money at my job

Regularly spend more quality time with my kids

Take more precise care of my animals to ensure they are sufficiently tired at the end of each day

Make time to hang out with my wife

“Neat”, you might say. You’ve got a list of pretty normal New Year’s Resolution ideas. But no, it goes deeper. (Which is precisely my goal.) How could I have time to do all of this? Well I’ll need to stop wasting time on the things that don’t matter, like social media or my phone. Drinking not only makes me less fit but also impedes me from getting a lot of these things done. Sleeping in might feel good but it doesn’t help me accomplish these things.

This is way too many goals to focus on at once. How could I focus on them all? The answer. I won’t! I just focus on one question:

“What will make me more fuckable to my wife?”

And if I keep asking myself that, I’ll become fitter, look nicer, earn more money, live in a cleaner house, spend more time with my kids, keep my pets happy, and make sure I’m hanging out with my wife more. It’s a resolution that’s about far more than just sex. It’s about becoming the best version of myself for the entire family. And who knows? Maybe, along the way I’ll get a little more action.

I love it!!!.... I'm going to implement the ""what will make me more fuckable to my husband?"" Thank you. Your post just made my day

>OOP: Get fucked!

**shenannigans20**

*LOL I laughed so hard!. Cheers to getting fucked well and often in 2025! Love the New Year's resolution.*

**ffs2050**

*These are all worthwhile goals but I think you’ll find, as you get older, that it’s healthier to seek self-improvement for yourself rather than for external validation, even from your partner.*

**Phoenixrebel11**

*This is one of those times where I’m happy to be a woman. All I had to do to be more “fuckable” to my husband is to start sleeping naked every night. Good luck OP, sounds like a solid plan 😊.*

>OOP: Both sexes have their burdens but yes many of y'all live with cheat codes in this department.

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 6 months later**



Last December I wrote a post about my New Year’s Resolution: The Optimally Fuckable Husband Project.

Here’s a link to the original post but if that’s too much work, here’s a summary:

The things that make a husband attractive/fuckable are synonymous with making good decisions. (ex. Get fit, keep the house clean, make sure my wife gets ample free time.)

So using “does this make me more/less fuckable?” as a question to filter my decision making will lead to a better life, with or without an improved sex life.

The original post lays out the reasoning in much more detail.

Note, most of this post I’m going to give the update as it relates to helping my wife, without doing a land acknowledgement for each one about the benefits I get. (ie. giving my wife breaks from the kids = I get to hang out with my kids more)

Context for the update:

We’ve got 2 kids. My son is 1 and my daughter is 3

I work from Home

Wife is a SAHM

Before this project I still qualified as a good husband.

What are the changes I’ve made?

I’ve had highs and lows of keeping up with the New Year's Resolutions. At my peak of Husband fuckability I was 10 steps ahead of old me. In my valleys I’ve made changes that still keep me 2 or 3 steps ahead of old me.

Avoiding wasting time: \* A lot of research shows you’ll do less of something if it is out of reach, so I try to keep my phone on the other side of the room, but I wear a smart watch that gives me notifications for the handful of things I need (call, text, slack.) \* I downloaded chrome extensions that barr me from going to reddit, and that kill the feed in LinkedIn (which I have to use for work) \* I put the amount of time I’ve wasted in my face. I’ve adopted the mentality that if you don’t want to look at a number, it’s something you would benefit from seeing. (imagine being afraid to look at your bank statement). When I realize I’m slipping I look at my phone usage times, and I normally shame myself back into compliance. Kids: \* To make sure I’m giving mom more breaks, I’ve limited the frequency in which I ask how I can help. I just help. Much less “do you need me to change his diaper?” “Do you need a break?” These questions still make appearances, but more often I’m just making sure the kids disappear and my wife suddenly realizes she has free time. \* If I spend a lot of me time, I make sure to balance it with getting the kids out of the house. Workouts: \* I keep injuring myself every time I get into a groove. Or started traveling for work and fell out of the habit. Doing very poorly on this front. Household stresses: \* I’ve rearranged the times I take care of the dogs, to get them out of the house at the times they bother my wife the most. \* I’ve also listened to things she complains about and just fixed them. We both put a kid to bed. I’m quicker, so by the time she’s done with her kid the toys from the day are picked up, and the house is vacuumed. It takes 10 minutes my wife gets to go right into her evening once she’s done. \* If I catch my wife nagging me about something, I acknowledge that she’d rather not be nagging me, and that I should probably either proactively do it, or work something out with her about the best way to handle that chore long term. \* I’ve listened for the things in the house that actually stress her out, and started paying attention to when those things were happening (ie. the patio furniture being too dirty to sit on) \* House projects are still stacking up, and it's one of the things I could improve on. Making my wife feel loved \* I made sure we instituted a weekly date night. I noticed one of the biggest obstacles to date nights was just thinking of what to do. So I spent an hour every couple days to make a big date night excel spreadsheet, including at home dates (which are most of our dates right now). Now each week one of us looks at the spreadsheet and picks from there. Most of them are just hang outs, some of them are specifically sexy dates. \* My wife kept complaining about how much she hated having to plan meals every week, so I learned to code and wrote her a little AI agent that she can tell it all the recipes she likes, and then ask it to build her a meal plan based on her wants for the week. (She cooks more than I, but I always clean.) \* I also wrote a list of cute things I could do for her before I left on work trips. Things like having flowers waiting for her hidden somewhere, or leaving a few of her favorite drinks in the fridge. \* I also way upped my game on gift giving. Not more expensive, just given more personally. Money: \* Worked much harder at my job to realize it's a dead end. Started looking for new stuff. Is it working?

Depends on what you mean.

The whole point is that sex isn’t the objective. Fuckability is just the helpful characteristic to assign to my behavior.

In terms of my life being better; undoubtedly. Somewhat ironically, I’m in a worse mental state thanks to work. I’m trying to leave it and find something else, but even in that worse mental state, the act of doing more to be a fuckable husband has given me a light on the hill to work towards, and to find meaning/joy in working towards it.

But seriously, how’s the sex life changes?

Long story short, our sex life is definitely better. I told me wife about this project, and I think that contributed some, but if you try to measure what that means I think most people are going to be disappointed.

I’ve talked about this project with some friends, and the question I heard the most was “so are you having sex more?”, which is a very narrow view of a better sex life. For one, what if you saw no increase in having more sex, but you used to always initiate, and now your wife initiates more? I’d call that better. What if, you both have a way better time? Both of those things definitely happen now.

And in terms of frequency. I have no idea. I didn’t really tally up our bangs, and even a 10% increase would be almost undetectable. Even further, Last year I had been laid off, we had a new born, and my wife was breastfeeding. Comparing this year to last year is pretty meaningless.

In short, I’ve slipped from time-to-time. Life isn’t perfect because of this project, but it’s added an additional layer of meaning, and has helped me find ways to make my whole families lives better. The way to improve consistently is not to always have this question on your mind, but to build little habits and systems that accomplish the goals of optimizing your fuckability.

Lots of folks have asked for a 1-year update. So I’ll give it another go here in 6 months.

**WankSpanksoff**

*Very thoughtful! It’s awesome that it’s been overall positive in a far-reaching way. I had a sort-of-similar experience where I realized that wanting to cultivate my partner’s good opinion of me ended up being a great motivator for really positive life changes that benefitted me more than anything. This was in the very early days where we were still getting to know each other and just chatting/flirting, and he would text me every day to talk a little. And of course he would ask what I’d been up to that day. And I realized that I wanted him to think I was an active, driven, interesting person, and I wasn’t going to just lie. So I realized “shit, I’d better start doing interesting, productive stuff so I can tell him something good!” And of course I immediately realized that it was great for me to start living this way, and have run with it ever since! And although of course I love him dearly and value his opinion deeply, I also realized that I should be doing this stuff mostly to impress myself, so I switched to just living a life I’m proud of, for me. It’s brought me really far over the years! Sometimes it’s so so helpful to take an outside perspective on yourself and use that to guide.*

>OOP:  
Yeah turning it into an intrinsic driver is the key to it working long term.  
I don't remember where I heard it but a lot of people think they need to change their mind before they change their actions not realizing that it's often more effective to do it in the opposite order.  
Trying to be active or interesting seems like a good filter too. ""Would an interesting person watch 5th episode of Netflix? Shit better to learn to make Arepas""



**Update - 6 months later (1 year from original post)**



A year ago I made a post that a lot of people were interested in. I was asked to give an update at the end of the year on how the project went, what I learned, would I recommend it, etc etc. 

So, this is that post. It’s admittedly lengthy, but I’ve formatted this in a way that you should be able to easily scan this and find the parts that look the most interesting to you.

The very short of it:

* Would you recommend this? - Not for everyone and not for every marriage
* Did it work? - 100% my life has improved a lot
* Were there downsides - Absolutely, this project caused a few fights
* But like, did it work work? - Sex is not the point, and this one is complicated to answer (but I will)

I’ll give a quick recap, but if you want the details I’d recommend you read the [original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h439hu/my_new_years_resolution_the_optimally_fuckable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

What is the husband fuckability project? 

The levers of my wife’s libido are tied to me as a husband making better decisions that ultimately benefit me as much or more than my wife. 

* Getting fit means I look better naked. 
* Making sure my wife gets ample free time means I hang out with my kids.
* Doing what I can to keep the house clean takes things off of her to-do list but also means I live in a cleaner, lower stress house.

And in order to keep up with those things, I have to give up the lowest quality behaviors. I have to drink less, be on my phone less, etc.

The Husband Fuckability project compresses my need to negotiate decisions with myself around a single question ""does this make me more fuckable?"".

That question will lead me to make better decisions that will lead to a more fulfilled life whether I get more sex or not. 

Relevant details about my life:

She is a SAHM, I work from home

We have two kids; Almost 4y daughter, almost 2y son.

Wife is 7.5 months pregnant with our third and final kid

Before this project I would still qualify myself as a good husband 

How did I implement this:

I gave a (lengthy)[ 6-month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1lp7i8i/6month_update_the_optimally_fuckable_husband/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on this you can read if you want, but here’s a less tactical version.

I realized it’s easiest to succeed when I’m not figuring things out as I go. So for anything where pre-planning made decision making easier, I made a spreadsheet.

I have a spreadsheet for all of these:

* I preplanned a bunch of dates my wife and I could do at Home (that’s our current phase of life)
* I wrote down a list of activities I could do with my kids to make it easier to steal them away and have quality time
* I made another of all the sweet, unexpected gestures I could drop on my wife (buy cupcakes, pre-written notes, etc.)
* I made another of all the chores I knew needed doing on a regular basis

I think these were critical to the success of the project. I’ve found it much easier to do anything when I can basically just follow an instruction manual. If I realized I was slipping, and I wanted to ask “How can I be more fuckable” I had an answer key ready to go. 

For dates we implemented weekly date nights. No phones allowed, just quality time for the two of us.  We even started making sure that one date a month was a “sexy” date, meaning sex was the main event of the date (like a sexy boardgame). 

For everything else, I just kept comparing myself to this fictional, perfectly fuckable husband, and asked “What Would FuckableHusband Do?” 

This helped me build habits like not asking “how can I help?” and instead just looking around and doing. 

Unexpected Learnings: 

I’ve learned just a ton about making my marriage and life higher quality. I think these are useful whether you take this project on or not. 

It is good and necessary that my wife sees me doing things for her benefit: 

Example: 

My wife loves to bake, and made cookies for everyone. There was only one left, and I knew she was going to come down and eat it soon, but I also really wanted one. So I split the cookie thought nothing of it. 

I totally forgot about it, and then later my wife gushed about the fact that it was so sweet of me to leave her half the cookie. It would have been nicer if I had left her the whole cookie! But then she wouldn’t have known that I did something nice for her. The “kindness” of leaving her half a cookie made her happier than getting a whole cookie. 

To keep things short, I won’t extrapolate on this, but these types of situations actually come up a lot. Be seen being nice. Everyone benefits. 

When I take joy in solving problems, problems bring me joy:

A year of this project has changed the way I view some of my wife’s unexpected problems. Instead of grumbling that something needs doing I’m more often excited to do something for my wife. So what used to cause stress, now gives me purpose and fulfillment

What went well? 

* “What would Fuckable Husband do?” type framing makes it surprisingly easy to make good decisions
* I don’t feel nagged, she doesn’t feel like a nagging wife
   * I noticed nagging is the result of my wife’s tolerance for something not being done before my tolerance. By being proactive, our tolerance for things not being done isn’t tested as often. 
   * Because things are more proactively done, she does more of the things she otherwise would have nagged about, and trusts that things will get done whether she asks for it to or not
* I have a consistent sense of purpose that helps me not default to low-value activities
* I learned new skills to stay fuckable
   * My wife hates meal planning, so I learned Python to build her a little AI tool that generates meal plans from her favorite recipes. Solving her problem became my excuse to finally learn it.
   * Some of my wife’s appliances broke; normally we’d just buy new ones but I learned to fix them which them. (which I’m told is quite hot)
* Wife and I flirt/play more
   * She’s less stressed so she’s more open to teasing and flirting
   * She knows about the project, and when she sees me deliver on it she is down to meet my energy

What went poorly?

* Resentment: While the express point of the project is that focusing on my wife’s levers makes my life better, when I’m constantly putting in effort toward my wife, it can be draining if I’m not seeing the appreciation all the time. In fact, physical intimacy is my romantic love language. So while the express goal of this project is not about sex, it was easy for me to lose sight of that sometimes. My partner is caring and loving, but like all humans, she can’t be appreciating me outwardly 24/7, and we had a handful of fights that were rooted in me becoming unappreciated. Some were my fault, some were hers. I’ve learned how to handle this better, but it feels like an inevitable step of the project.
* Slip-ups are glaring: Making major changes like this means when I slip into older habits it’s painfully obvious. I have set the bar high for my behavior, which means there’s a lot of room to fall. In fact, work crushed me the for 8-weeks of this quarter. I was not on my A-game. I defaulted more to checking my phone, I drank more often, I’ve been less mentally available and it’s very obvious that the things that were getting done proactively weren’t. Setting a high-bar also means giving yourself a ton of space to fall. 

Would you recommend this project?

Depends.

Before I get into it, keep in mind, I’m a random dude. I’m not a marriage counselor, or a therapist, so everything here is armchair psychology. 

This project would be brutal without the right partner. I have a wonderful and loving wife. She is on my team. She roots for me. She contributes mightily to the house. Without these things resentment would be immediate and justified.

I suspect that you also need to tell your partner that you are doing this. My wife is bought into the project, and while she didn’t sign up for this herself, she knows what I’m working on and can encourage me. It means we can have direct conversations and sometimes hard conversations. If your partner would be too off put by the concept, then you’ll lose many of the benefits. 

Booooo! Where is the sex?  
Fine fine… let’s talk sexin’. 

First, if the only metric you’re thinking about for an improved sex life is the number of uglies bumped, then you’re thinking about it wrong. 

Male perspective; initiating all the time sucks, getting rejected sucks, I’m-only-doing-this-because-we-haven’t-had-sex-in-a-while sex sucks. 

If the frequency never changes, but suddenly there’s more enthusiasm, better times, less rejection, then in my mind that is just as good a benefit, and I am definitely getting more of this type of benefit from my wife. 

But are we having more sex? I have no idea. It’s impossible for me to know because in 2023 my wife was pregnant, in 2024 she was nursing, and we only have 4 months of 2025 before my wife was pregnant and deep in the throes of morning sickness. 

I have literally no baseline to compare to without some major externality complicating the calculation. And I still won’t even have a semblance of baseline number until 2027.

It feels like we do it more. And really that’s more important than if we actually are.

Fin:  
This is no longer a New Year’s Resolution for me. After a year of doing this, asking myself how to become more fuckable is now automatic, and I don’t plan on stopping any time soon.

My marriage is far from perfect. We bicker, I leave cabinets open, my wife struggles to get out of mom mode. The take away should not be that this project is going to be a magic bullet. It’s just a tool for me to get more out of my life than I would have other wise. And on that front, I think it succeeded.

*So I just had our 3rd baby, older two kids are 2 and 4 as well. I do full time childcare, husband works from home. We are in the exact same phase of life so I appreciate you acknowledging what a mindfuck it is to be in the cycle of pregnant-postpartum-breastfeeding for almost six years. That being said, I am so impressed you pulled this off during this season of life. It’s fucking hard right now. These kids be wildin’. I hope your wife appreciates the effort and thought you’ve been putting in - I wish mine did! I wish I could frame it as “yo this would lead to more sex” and motivate him a bit, but like you said it’s more nuanced than that.*

>OOP: Trying to actively look forward to the shitty parts has been surprisingly helpful. This logic of: ""I just had a brutal day and I want to just sit on the couch."" -> ""Fuckable husbands get off the couch and go take their kids grocery shopping so mom can sit down"" -> ""hell yes I get to be a fuckable husband."" Has made me get excited for the myriad of uncomfortable moments. And totally on the pregnancy loop. As the husband it's not always easy to remember this. We've certainly had some fights that the root of it is her being tired and exhausted and hormonal and it's not fair to her for those fights to occur as long as she doesn't lean on those as an excuse (which she generally doesn't). Good luck with number 3! I'm getting the snip so that this season of life can finally end.

*Thank you for the information. Would you mind sharing a bit into your garage gym setup? I struggle also with being consistent and I think having a good setup will motivate me to train at home.*

>OOP: Having put in a garage gym; it absolutely does motivate you for a while, and it way lowers the barrier to hitting the gym, but you will definitely want a longer term motivator.

>My set up is squat rack with a pull up bar, bench, barbell and plates to load up to 300lbs. And then a dumbbell rack, some bands, stationary bike and a bunch of gorilla matts under the whole thing. I have a three car garage and this is the third car for us.

**WiseRabbitoftheAlley1**

*I like how practical you are about it and how creating systems helped you stay the course. I'm definitely following that advice and creating a list of actionable steps from the start of the year, including planning our dates out in January before the year gets a hold of both of us and we get too busy.*

>OOP: The spreadsheets are a huuuuge help. That said they aren't the whole thing. Proactively getting ahead of my wife's mental to-do list often required attention and improv. That said I did write down what it would look like. And while I couldn't reference that list day to day it was a helpful exercise. Things like indexing the requests my wife made or thinking through what tasks she grumbles through. Even small stuff like making my wife's coffee before she can. Not every one of them indexes to a specific benefit you'll attain, but improving the quality of your marriage is a benefit of its own.

**Wizbliz2**

*Without just asking for you to share your date night and activity spreadsheets I'd like to know how you came up with them? In my experience with these sorts of things I write down ideas and then think that they are silly and don't execute on them, how did you manage that?*

>OOP: I have no problem sharing them, in fact 3 of the last 5 comments were people asking for the sheets.

>That said, I just accepted that some of my ideas would suck and put them down anyway.

>That said, the Adventure challenge is a great solve for this. Wife and I have done a few; we're waiting for her to stop popping out babies before we get fully back into it, but the ones we've done have been unique and fun.

>But about coming up with your own, just embrace the cringe. If it's dumb then do dumb stuff.

>An example of a few fun ones we did:

>100-piece puzzle race; every time you did 20 pieces you had to draw a note card and we wrote down mini punishments you had to hold to for the next 20 pieces. Like wear an oven mitt, or play with sunglasses, or do a burpee everytime you put a piece in.

>Another was us planning the perfect date (which then set us up to have the perfect date).

>Another was spending 1-hour putting together a slide show of our favorite relationship photos and then sharing them and talking about it.

>One potentially dumb one we haven't done but probably falls into the 'silly' camp. I call it a speed date, we have 5 dates that are 10 minutes each:

*I’ll grade your thesis an A. The Center for the Underfucked Husbands and Dads or CUHD’s, appreciates your dedication to our cause and continuing research. We’ve come a long way, from begging, pleading and just seeing where grabbing a handful of ass gets us.*

*I got a good one to try in the New Year. With your inclination for mindfulness and organization I think you’ll put it to good use.*

*Write some things down WITH your wife (maybe you’ve done this to a certain extent).*

1. *Great memories*
2. *simple joys that make you feel happy*
3. *things you’d like to do (trips, home improvements, memberships or activities, whatever)*

*It’s ok if you have differences or if some things that are for both of you and some are more isolated for each of you, in fact that’s good. Then try to both work together to do these types of activities for the both of you. This isn’t really geared towards sex, but it is geared to happiness and wellbeing which usually results in more sex when paired with other thoughtful measures.*

*I’m rooting for you, your family and your penis! Best of luck!*

1q2ml12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver40/comments/1q2ml12/frustrating_low_effort_friends_no/,"Frustrating, low effort friends?! No","I’m dealing with a frustrating situation with a friend who I haven’t seen since October. She cancels plans at last minute with no rescheduling, blows me off when I try to set up plans, and gives me odd excuses about why it’s hard to meet up (need to check with partner, might have 13-year-old stepson for the weekend, etc)

Despite not having any time for me these past three months, she insists on maintaining a Snapchat streak where we have to exchange pictures using a dumb filter on our faces or brief soulless messages on Snapchat each day to maintain the “streak”.

I’ve tried to let the streak die a few times and not participate since I don’t actually care to keep up this performance when we don’t see each other in person - then she makes me feel kinda guilty when she has to pay money ($1-$2) to restore the streak?! So it’s keeping me in this online performance out of guilt.

I haven’t spoken directly to her about my feelings yet - I’ve tried to gently suggest we need some time in person together, that I miss her, etc., but I realise I’ll need to be direct soon.

On top of all of this, she regularly says she misses me, she loves me (as a friend), and that I’m her “bestie” - okkk, if all of that were true, why is it so hard to organise a coffee even for an hour on a Saturday morning?

She’s also had time off work since October so it’s not like she’s busy in that sense.

I’m baffled and frustrated!! Anyone else experienced anything like this? Suggestions of best ways to confront this behaviour?

1q2mjpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q2mjpm/a_year_later_and_im_still_struggling_she_keeps/,A year later and I’m still struggling. She keeps making it hard to move on.,"A year ago I was completely blindsided by my girlfriend of 2 years. She broke up while on a semester abroad. It felt like she had made a complete 180 overnight. And because of the way it ended, I felt completely shattered. When she left, we spent the whole day in bed talking about our future. When she got back we didn’t have a future.

I understood why she did it at first. She wanted to be on her own. She felt trapped in my life. I had already graduated, so we were doing movie nights in instead of going to college parties. I accepted that and moved on, even though it felt wrong. 

Then she kept finding reasons to text me. I told her I couldn’t be friends with her and that it would be too hard to see her live her life. 6 months after the breakup, she called to tell me she missed me and that she wanted to see me. When we got coffee, she said that, when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but that after thinking some more she just wasn’t ready “yet”. I didn’t hear from her for another 5 months. Last month she texted me some pictures of a show she went to and told me it reminded her of me. She said she’d been thinking about me and she thought about me all the time. Since then, it’s been radio silence. Since our breakup I haven’t reached out once. It’s always her.

I’ve done all the things you’re supposed to do. I made my life better. I got better clothes, made my apartment nicer, got fitter. I got very good at some hobbies, I dated and slept around a lot. There were periods where I was doing better or where I thought I’d moved on, but now I’m back to thinking about her nearly every day. I know that she’s a worse person than she used to be and that she treated me in selfish ways, but it’s impossible to reconcile that with how perfect things used to be. 

I know that the conventional wisdom is that I need to block her, but that doesn’t feel right. It feels like we SHOULD be together. Worse than that it feels like she wants us to be together and yet we’re not. Even though I don’t know that I really believe we’ll ever be together again, I don’t want to block her, but I don’t know why I’m still stuck.",3,1767419175.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I had  virtual work meeting this morning with my ta and some higher ups. It was important enough to be professional. I was already stressed tired and running n coffee

People were doing that awkward small talk before the real meeting tarted. Someone asked how is everyone doing today

I answered honestly. Not the polite good thanks kind but way too honest. I started talking about how overwhelm have been how little I slept how burned out I feel and ho the job has been draining me. I even joked about questioning my life choices.

The room went completely quiet. I thought my mic ct out. It had not. They were just silent while I ranted

My manage cleared their throat and moved straight to  the agenda. No n acknowledge what I said. Some coworkers avoided eye contact. One person ave an awkward smile. I wanted to disappear/

Opening night was an absolute disaster. I just wanted to share the notes I had cause they are really funny looking back. (I redacted all names, and instead put in character names or if they didn’t have a character, just name.)


Notes! That was really good for never having run the show before
I really loved how even when things went wrong, you kept going! As the quote goes, “the show must go on!” 
I’d like to shout out ensemble members [name], [name], and [name], who kept up the energy the entire time!! And [elle], for knowing all her lines, Elle’s role in this show is a beast, I’m proud of you for memorizing all of it. 
That being said, we can make this show even better. 
General notes:

 IF YOU HAVE A MIC DO NOT TALK BACKSTAGE
(I’m talking to you whoever swore twice. The whole audience heard it) 
Do not go back to the gym once the show starts. If you need your stuff, grab it before the show! It ruins the show magic if your parents see you out of character before it’s over. 
It’s okay to be stressed, but running around haphazardly is going to get everyone injured. Please don’t do that. 
If you have a mic, don’t touch it! If it’s not working, don’t touch it! If it’s making noises, don’t touch it! These mics are old as it is, and I get that it sounds weird but touching it is not gonna make it sound better. 
Don’t get out of character if something goes wrong. I know it’s confusing, but the audience doesn’t need to know that. 
Generally, song wise, we tended to rush. Slow down! Nobody is chasing you. I promise. Watch your music cues, there’s points in the song where if you get off from the music, you can get back on!
Please be quiet backstage. Everyone can hear you screaming. 
Generally, the energy was good. There were a lot of times where I was completely invested in the plot. Let’s continue to make this show better. Onto specific notes.

Oh my god you guys:

Overall, pretty good! With the switching of the mic, be a little closer and try to make it seem natural. Get to your spots a little faster if possible. The quick change looked good, but if somebody could take Elle’s over dress instead of throwing it to the floor, that would be great. [name], please be gentler with the dog. You literally chucked it offstage 😭 you guys forgot to come forwards again, for the ending pose. Thank you, [name] for remembering that, I saw you.

Serious:
No notes, Warner and Elle ate that up.

What you want:
In this song, you started to drag behind the music at the beginning. Enter a little sooner if you need to. 
When we got to Kate’s part, we got ahead of the music.
Somebody please move that desk offstage during the Winthrop lines.can I please have a volunteer to move it?
After the ending pose, can yall exit on quieter feet?? And less screaming?? Thanks. 

Harvard scene 1:
“Woods. Elle woods” 
“Someone’s had their morning coffee.” 
The point of that line is to sound perky. [elle], if you could give more perky, that would be great :)

GIRLFRIEND?? :
No notes, this was good.

Ireland:
Salon ensemble, could you do a little less? Im glad you’re acting, in fact the entire salon ensemble has been doing amazing. You’re just so full of energy that it’s distracting from a scene. Just a little less and you guys will be perfect.
[paulette], you’re doing amazing! Don’t let that mic stop you from slaying that song away.

Chip on my shoulder:
If it’s not your line, please don’t sing it. We could all hear you singing [emmet]’s song backstage.
ENSEMBLE!! When you get on stage, stand for your part of the song and then SIT DOWN!! YOURE BLOCKING THE SCENE IF YOU STAND!!! 
And exit when you’re done. 
Know your cues and you’ll be fine.
This song has a lot of tricky sound cues. Maybe do a wandleprobe of this song to work it out.

So much better:
[emmet]?? Where were you?? You should’ve been on stage. [elle] had to pinch herself. 
This was good, since I don’t think we’ve ever done it without guided vocals. 

Whipped into shape: 
This was really good!!! We’ve never run this number on stage or in costume. You guys did amazing.
Just don’t rush the music.

The scene after:
Know your cues guys!! If you’re supposed to be on stage, be on stage please.

Bend and snap:
This was by far my favorite song!!! The energy, amazing. [kiki], you ATE that solo up! Stylist and Cashier did too!! The choreo looked amazing. [kyle]. Please be on stage when you need to be. Review your cues. 
You guys had so much energy!! Just review your backing vocals!! Nice fall on the floor [kyle], but if you’re wearing a mic be very very careful.

Legally blonde:
[emmet], again, where were you? Even if you get confused, come back on, or improv or something. Please don’t just leave with an “I give up” face. Emmet wouldn’t do that, so neither should you.
[elle], just stay in place. The circling the stage detracts from the song. 

Legally blonde remix:
Salon ensemble! Be in front of the scenery!!! Push them back if you need! Don’t stand behind the tables. Stand in front of them. Salon ensemble, when you exit, take off the props with you!! Don’t just leave them there. Bring. Them with you! And then start setting up the chairs.
This kind of fell apart at the end. Thank you, [paulette], for knowing your vocal cues, and keeping people in time. 
I’ll review this if I have time because yall what was that. 

Scene of the crime:
[brooke], [chutney] was right there. Say your line even if you can’t see her, cause she’s probably there. 
This scene was good! [chutney] you ate those lines. The energy was great, it looked like this was the first scene we ever did lmao.
Idk what happened with scene of the crime part two, but you guys started singing the opening. The lyrics are different, and [name]’s gotta talk about her liposuction. The pause is when she says “oops.” And you guys go “we still love you!” 

Finale:

On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area

So I built Qew - a VSCode extension that lets you save, organize, and queue instructions for Claude Code.

The killer feature: Run All - queue up multiple instructions and they execute sequentially. Claude finishes one, automatically starts the next. Perfect for multi-step refactoring or when you want to go grab coffee while Claude does the grunt work.

It's free on the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sssswishhhh.qew. Built it for myself, figured others might find it useful.

Anyone else building tools to make vibecoding less tedious?

him. He has not been socialized with people or dogs. Was not neutered

Fast forward I pick him up on Saturday. He is an angel other than him trying to dominate me. (got neutered today thank god 😅) doesn’t chew things that aren’t his, house broken, doesn’t beg, great on a leash, sleeps all night, so lovey with me, doesn’t roam at night. he’s an angel. 

BUT… I live in a dense neighborhood in an apt. He is unsure of people, growls sometimes and doesn’t like surprises outside the house. So far i’ve kept his circle small, take quieter streets and avoid crowded elevator. He loves to walk and sniff and just minds his own business. He had a bad day on Monday at the vet, growling at the vet. she said I should be concerned since this is aggressive esp for a golden. I do worry in my walkable neighborhood people running up on him and he does growl, but he’s never bitten. he got neutered today and I know that takes time for hormones to balance. 

i’m stressed. he has so many amazing qualities, but can a 3 yr old be socialized? when I decided to foster to adopt, I was very specific since i’m single and sole provider, I want to bring him out with me to coffee shops, co work, hike, dog beach, etc. Part of the program is I am the first to get him and decompress with him and after two weeks I can decide if I keep him or if he goes on to their website for people to apply to adopt. 

I also travel once a month for work and need them to be ok with a family member caring for him and at home w another dog. 

Can this behavior be turned around?

I know he will be adopted IMMEDIATELY if I choose not to adopt and the rescue does an amazing job finding good matches. I just don’t want to pass something up but also don’t want to force him into a lifestyle that makes him anxious. Didn’t even consider not adopting until the vet told me I should reconsider.

Chapter 1 

“Save the one on the left.” 

Hearing the man’s unhesitating voice, Isabel Hayes’s face turned deathly pale. 

“Mr. Blackwell…” the rescue captain began, trying to gently persuade him. “Did you not hear what I just said? There’s another person on the right. If we save the one on the left, the central slab will collapse onto the person on the right…” 

“Will she die?” the man’s voice was cold, devoid of any warmth. 

“Well…” The rescue captain, a professional to his core, hesitated. Adrian Blackwell was a man of immense power in Westbridge; he couldn’t be offended. “She won’t die, no, but she might lose her right hand…” 

“Then save the one on the left,” Adrian stated flatly. “I’ll provide a generous compensation.” 

Isabel’s heart shattered into a million pieces. 

On the fifteenth of every month, as her mother-in-law Mrs. Blackwell demanded, she came to Holy Trinity Cathedral to pray for her husband and son. The forecast had called for a blizzard, and she hadn’t planned on coming. 

But Mrs. Blackwell had her bodyguards escort her here. Just as she finished her prayers, the blizzard raged, and the cathedral collapsed, burying her in the rubble. 

Coincidentally, Adrian’s old flame, Selena, had just returned to the country and was buried alongside her. 

Isabel had called him again and again, and he had rejected her calls every single time. Before her phone died, she received a terse, two-word reply: \[In a meeting\]. 

But when Selena Moore called him from beside her, he answered instantly. The moment he heard Selena was trapped, he scrambled a helicopter. His eyes were only for Selena; he didn’t even glance to the right. And when the rescue team proposed that saving the person on the right wouldn’t affect the one on the left, he still insisted on saving the left side first. 

“Adrian…” Isabel’s eyes, red-rimmed, lifted to meet his. Her fingernails dug into her palms, her body trembling. “Do you have any idea how important my right hand is to me?” 

Adrian gave her a single, emotionless look, as if he either didn’t recognize her voice or simply didn’t care. He addressed only the rescue captain. “If you can’t do it, I’ll do it myself.” 

The last flicker of hope in Isabel’s eyes died, leaving only cold ash. “Is that Isabel?” Selena’s voice was faint. “Adrian, since I’m okay for now, please save Isabel first. Her right hand is so important. I’m fine…” 

With that, she closed her eyes and fainted.

Chapter 1 

“Selena!” Adrian immediately had Selena pulled from the wreckage. He scooped her into his arms and left without a backward glance. 

The moment he was gone, the central slab crashed down. 

Isabel’s pupils dilated in horror. There was no escape. Her right hand was crushed beneath the stone, and she passed out from the excruciating pain. 

When Isabel woke up, she was in a hospital. Her right hand was wrapped in thick bandages, completely numb. 

The memory of the suffocating darkness under the rubble and Adrian’s retreating back as he walked away without a second thought washed over her. She curled up on the hospital bed, shaking uncontrollably. 

“Mommy, are you awake?” Hearing her son’s voice, Isabel froze for a moment before her near-hysterical emotions slowly began to settle. Wiping away her tears, she saw Oliver Blackwell sitting at the coffee table. He was looking at her, his large eyes full of childish 

innocence. 

Isabel sniffled and immediately got out of bed, went to his side, and hugged him with her one good arm. She had given up all hope for Adrian. With no other family, her son was the only person in the world with whom she shared a blood connection. 

She sought comfort from him. “Henry, do you know what happened? Mommy was just in a very dangerous situation. My right hand…” 

“Mommy,” Oliver struggled, pushing her away. “Don’t touch me. You made me mess up my drawing.” 

Only then did Isabel notice he was drawing a good luck charm. A warmth spread through her heart. “Henry, did you know Mommy was in danger, so you’re drawing a good luck charm to protect me?” 

“No,” Oliver said. “It’s for Auntie Selena. She just got back to the country and ran into danger. Our guardian angels must not know her yet, so I have to give her a good luck charm. That way, they’ll protect her too.” ",1,1767418224.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1q2m8ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q2m8ge/am_i_overreacting_or_are_my_inlaws_crossing/,Am I Overreacting or are my in-Laws Crossing Boundaries?,"Hi everyone, I (29F) have been married to my husband (28M) for a year and a half. He is genuinely a wonderful man and partner, but he avoids confrontation at all costs, which is starting to cause problems.

We live in a 2-bedroom apartment with his family, which is very common in my culture. The apartment belongs to the family. My mother-in-law (55F) is separated from her husband and has been for over 25 years. My brother-in-law (31M) is single and currently unemployed. My husband and I have one bedroom, my BIL has the other, and my MIL sleeps on a pull-out couch in the living room with our two dogs.

Before I moved in, **the bedroom my husband and I now use used to be my MIL’s room**. Even after I moved in, she continued to keep some of her belongings in our room, so completely banning her from the room has never really been an option. The door also **does not lock from the outside** — it only latches from the inside. We usually latch it when we leave for work just so the dogs don’t go in, not to keep people out.

### The Unpacking & Rearranging Issue

When I first moved in, I was working full-time and hadn’t had a chance to unpack yet. While I was at work, my MIL unpacked *everything* for me, thinking she was helping. While I appreciated the intention, I’m extremely particular about my belongings and where I keep things. I had been waiting for a day off to do it myself.

It took me weeks to figure out where most of my things were. On top of that, she kept aside some of my clothes that she thought I wouldn’t fit into anymore and started wearing them. My weight fluctuates a lot, and she’s much skinnier than me, so this really bothered me.

She also has a habit of constantly rearranging furniture and moving things around. I asked my husband to talk to her about not doing this at least in *our* room. He did, and she agreed — but then did it again a few days later. Eventually, I took a day off work, rearranged everything myself, and directly asked her not to move things around in my room. Since then, she hasn’t rearranged our room, though the living room looks different almost every week.

### The Missing Harry Potter Items

I have a very bad memory and often forget about my belongings unless I see them or am reminded somehow. About a year after moving in, Google Photos showed me old pictures, and I realized I hadn’t seen my Harry Potter replicas since the move — an Elder Wand, a Gryffindor scarf, and a Time-Turner necklace.

When I packed them originally, all of these items were together in a side chain inside my suitcase, so they shouldn’t have been separated.

My husband helped me look. After about a week, we found the wand and scarf stuffed at the bottom of a box of old bedsheets. The Time-Turner was nowhere to be found. We asked my MIL if she remembered unpacking it — she said no but said she’d help look.

A couple of months later, I found the Time-Turner itself (without its chain or box) in a drawer in the living room where my MIL keeps her junk jewelry. It was damaged and not in the condition I’d kept it in. I was furious — I’d been blaming myself for misplacing it the entire time, and it was just 12 feet away.

When my husband asked her about it, she denied knowing anything. A few days later, I found the chain in the same drawer — the gold color scraped off to silver, but the Harry Potter tag still clearly visible. The box is still missing. My husband genuinely doesn’t know what to think or say.

### The Disappearing Snacks

I usually buy junk food once a month and keep it in our room for my husband and me. About two weeks later, it’s always gone. At first, I thought we were just eating it without realizing, but I started paying attention.

The pattern is always the same: nothing disappears for the first few days, and then suddenly things start vanishing one packet at a time.

The worst incident was when I found rare coffee-flavored chocolate packets at the store and bought around 50 of them — literally all they had. We put them in our room and planned to eat them over the month. When we finally went to get some, **every single packet was gone**.

This has happened multiple times with expensive chocolates and imported snacks. Every time I bring it up, my husband tells me I’m overreacting and that it’s “just snacks” and we can buy more.

### Another Thing That Still Bothers Me

In the early months after I moved in, I was home one day when my BIL asked me to pass him the mosquito repellent spray from my room. What unsettled me wasn’t the request — it was the way he described **exactly where it was kept**, in so much detail that it felt like he knew my room better than I did at that point.

### Why I’m Struggling

Because my MIL keeps some of her belongings in our room and because it used to be her room, I feel like I don’t have the right to say “no one else is allowed in here.” At the same time, my personal items keep going missing, damaged, or used without my knowledge. I feel like my space isn’t actually mine.

My husband thinks I’m overreacting and that I’m making a big deal out of nothing, especially when it comes to food. But to me, this isn’t about snacks or a necklace — it’s about privacy, boundaries, and respect.

### So, Reddit:

Am I overreacting? How do I set boundaries when the room used to be hers, the door doesn’t lock, and my husband avoids confrontation? Any advice would be really appreciated.",1,1767418206.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

The last flicker of hope in Isabel’s eyes died, leaving only cold ash. “Is that Isabel?” Selena’s voice was faint. “Adrian, since I’m okay for now, please save Isabel first. Her right hand is so important. I’m fine…” 

With that, she closed her eyes and fainted.

Chapter 1 

“Selena!” Adrian immediately had Selena pulled from the wreckage. He scooped her into his arms and left without a backward glance. 

The moment he was gone, the central slab crashed down. 

Isabel’s pupils dilated in horror. There was no escape. Her right hand was crushed beneath the stone, and she passed out from the excruciating pain. 

When Isabel woke up, she was in a hospital. Her right hand was wrapped in thick bandages, completely numb. 

The memory of the suffocating darkness under the rubble and Adrian’s retreating back as he walked away without a second thought washed over her. She curled up on the hospital bed, shaking uncontrollably. 

“Mommy, are you awake?” Hearing her son’s voice, Isabel froze for a moment before her near-hysterical emotions slowly began to settle. Wiping away her tears, she saw Oliver Blackwell sitting at the coffee table. He was looking at her, his large eyes full of childish 

innocence. 

Isabel sniffled and immediately got out of bed, went to his side, and hugged him with her one good arm. She had given up all hope for Adrian. With no other family, her son was the only person in the world with whom she shared a blood connection. 

She sought comfort from him. “Henry, do you know what happened? Mommy was just in a very dangerous situation. My right hand…” 

“Mommy,” Oliver struggled, pushing her away. “Don’t touch me. You made me mess up my drawing.” 

Only then did Isabel notice he was drawing a good luck charm. A warmth spread through her heart. “Henry, did you know Mommy was in danger, so you’re drawing a good luck charm to protect me?” 

“No,” Oliver said. “It’s for Auntie Selena. She just got back to the country and ran into danger. Our guardian angels must not know her yet, so I have to give her a good luck charm. That way, they’ll protect her too.” ",2,1767418186.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Franky looks up from the counter and blinks. “Uh… Lily? Ain’t you supposed to be, I dunno—becoming famous or somethin’ central-time-zone-related today?”

Lily doesn’t answer.

Before Franky can follow up, the door bangs open again and one of the regulars—sweaty, winded, still holding a paper cup of burnt coffee—bursts inside.

“Oh, hey, Lily,” he says casually. “Funny thing—I just saw your boyfriend over at the internet café.”

Something *tiny* shifts in Lily’s posture. Not visible to most. But Franky sees it.

“What?” Franky says.

Lily is already moving.

She turns on her heel and bolts back out the door without a sound.

The casual leans on the counter. “Dang. That girl move like she’s being chased by fate.”

Franky blinks again. “…You said *which* internet café?”

The man scratches his head. “Uh. One of ’em.”

Franky winces. “Buddy, Seneca’s got nine of those glorified phone booths with delusions.”

Outside, Lily stops dead in the parking lot.

For one sharp second, the certainty wavers.

Which one?

She turns back.

Franky has already grabbed his keys. “Get in. Before you sprint yourself into the wrong decade.”

The engine coughs to life.

They tear out of the lot.

---

The car skids into the cracked asphalt outside one of the cafés—neon OPEN sign buzzing like an angry insect, curtains drawn halfway, cigarette smoke already leaking through the door seams.

Lily throws the door open before the engine even dies.

She runs inside.

She spots him instantly.

Hikaru is hunched forward in front of a glowing screen, bathed in the pale, sickly light of a beige monitor like a priest at a very boring altar. Lily approaches without a sound, slow and deliberate, watching from just behind his shoulder as a completely alien ritual unfolds—no monsters, no maps, no stones, no colors that mean anything to her. Just endless tables. Crawling bar graphs. Tiny numbers that twitch one decimal at a time while an artificial fiscal year inches forward in something the title bar calls *LedgerWorld ’95*.

For ten full minutes, she doesn’t move.

Doesn’t blink.

Barely breathes.

Hikaru waits for progress bars the way other people wait for dice to stop rolling. Every time the screen freezes on **“PROCESSING…”**, he smiles like the delay itself is part of the fun. When a red arrow dips—income missed, target failed—he tilts his head, curious rather than upset, like the failure is data, not loss. And with each tiny collapse, Lily feels something old and unwelcome clawing back up inside her chest: the quiet terror that all effort can still end in nothing, that patience and precision aren’t armor, that loss doesn’t need violence to exist.

She swallows it.

Keeps her face blank.

Doesn’t step forward.

Doesn’t interrupt.

Doesn’t exist.

And Hikaru—completely unaware he’s being observed at all—lets out a soft little laugh and murmurs encouragement to the screen, praising the future like it’s a person sitting on the other side, kindly reassuring him.

Lily stands there, unimpressed.

Finally, he notices her.

She turns, takes him by the arm, and leads him outside for a chat.

---

Outside, the night air feels thin and electrical, like the town is holding its breath along with them.

Lily stands in front of him.

Still.
Blank.
Unblinking.

Hikaru shifts on his feet, trying to read a face that gives him nothing back.

“…You played someone today,” he says carefully. “Online. They go by Meowna2?”

Silence.

He squints at her. “C’mon. You know that’s not me. I’m terrible.”

The lie is so bad that even the passing traffic seems to wince.

Lily exhales.

Not loud.

Not dramatic.

Just enough for him to feel it.

And Hikaru—tragically, almost impressively—misunderstands it completely. He thinks she’s apologizing. For chasing him. For cornering him. For bringing ghosts to his doorstep.

She steps back.

Turns away.

And in the quiet geometry of her movement, he feels the promise she never speaks:

*I’ll leave you alone now. You don’t have to worry about me anymore.*

She takes three steps.

Then—

“Hey! Lily!”

She stops.

He rushes the words out, because for once he doesn’t want to be clever.

“If you keep chasing my ghost,” he says, “you’ll never see the player right in front of you.”

He watches the stillness ripple through her shoulders.

And then he feels something else—her offering. Not in words. In posture. In timing. In the weight between one second and the next.

A game.

Before her bus.

His brain, uselessly practical, flashes through geography instead—Seneca to Dothan, Atlanta probably in the middle if the roads behave, time zones maybe matter, maybe not, it’s ’95, buses are slow, maps exist, nothing is certain.

He swallows.

He isn’t ready.

Not yet.

And for once, he doesn’t hide it behind jokes.

“…Have a nice bus ride,” he says quietly.

She nods once.

And walks away.

Already counting, not steps—but matches.

Twenty-seven.

One hundred and twenty American pros.

Sixty monsters in the international league.

And at the center of all of it, the quiet certainty that the board will not wait for either of them.

## **JULY–AUGUST 1995 — PRO EXAM MONTAGE: “THE MOUNTAIN WAS A LIE”**

Black screen.

Then—
the *click* of a Baduk stone on wood.

---

### **MATCH 1 — JULY 1995**

A crowded exam hall.
Twenty-eight boards.
Silence so loud it hums.

Lily takes White.
Her opponent bows.
He looks nervous. She doesn’t.

**Her voice, calm, controlled, directly to us:**

> “For a long time… I thought the mountain was you.”

Her first move: **4–4**.
Aggressive. Unapologetic.

Cut to midgame—
her opponent’s group collapses in a net that never visibly forms.
He resigns without looking at the board.

> “I trained for a shadow.”

---

### **MATCH 4**

Another hall. Different faces. Same posture from Lily.

She plays **Black** now.
No experimentation. No softness.

She launches a **lean shoulder hit**, forces a low response, then splits the board with a wedge that shouldn’t work but does.

> “You weren’t unreachable.”

Her opponent overextends.
She sacrifices ten stones without blinking.
Thirty moves later, his entire right side dies.

> “You weren’t even the peak.”

---

### **MATCH 9**

Clock pressure.
A Dan-3 candidate sweating.

She stares at the board for ten seconds.

Then plays a **quiet, murderous tesuji** that turns an alive group into a false eye prison.

> “The real mountains don’t run.”

Resignation.
No eye contact.

---

### **MATCH 13**

Night match.
Artificial lights.
Audience whispering now.

A former insei tries to attack her.

She lets him.

She lets him build.
She lets him believe.

Then she **collapses his influence into empty thickness** and takes every corner while he’s still chasing ghosts.

> “Mee-Ma.”

He realizes too late.
He laughs in disbelief when he resigns.

> “Sai.”

---

### **MATCH 18**

Rain streaks against the windows.

She hesitates—just a fraction—
before choosing the killing line instead of the stabilizing one.

She *chooses risk*.

It works.

The opponent stares at the board like it betrayed him.

> “These are the mountains.”

---

### **MATCH 21**

A challenger tries mirror Go.

She breaks symmetry on move six with an inside **attachment that shouldn’t exist**.

The entire board becomes asymmetrical violence.

> “Not you.”

Black resigns in under an hour.

---

### **MATCH 25 — LATE AUGUST 1995**

Last real threat.
Experienced. Calm. Reads deeply.

They fight for six hours.

Ko after ko.
Sente traded like currency.

At one point—
she almost stabilizes instead of cutting.

Almost.

She cuts anyway.

He loses by **half a point**.

He bows like someone bowing to a storm.

> “I won’t stop.”

---

### **FINAL BOARD — RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT**

A bulletin board.

Names posted.

Three circled.

Hers is there.

**LILY — DAN-1 — PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION GRANTED**

Applause echoes.
Flash cameras.
Paperwork stamped.

She doesn’t smile.

She doesn’t bow.

She just closes her eyes for one second.

---

### **FINAL VOICEOVER — LATE AUGUST 1995**

> “I will never stop training.”

Cut to her hands at a board.
Callused now. Precise.

> “I will go through the internationals.”

Cut to maps. Regions. Brackets.

> “I will go so far ahead…”

Cut to empty space behind her.

> “…that you will never catch me.”

Silence.

Then, softer—but sharper:

> “You are weak.”

Beat.

> “You will keep chasing me.”

Beat.

> “And I will always be ahead.”

---

This caused weight gain > than 20 pounds. I’m working with a dietician, and we think due to that and seroquol (which I’m getting off of) caused the weight gain.

So now she wants me to eat MORE. So I start my day with coffee, a protein shake, and some fruit, usually do crackers cheese and fruit for lunch, and then a roughly 900 calorie dinner.

She said my metabolism slowed down due to the starvation and that’s why I’m putting on weight, and I have to eat more to get it to start up again.

Has anyone ever heard of this?

I starved myself for a long time due to meds and I was tiny, I kinda thought if I kept starving myself I’d keep the weight down but this apparently isn’t the case?

I’m not advocating for EDs, I just would forget to eat due to ADHD/adhd meds.

I also don’t really enjoy eating most of the time, so I just force food down.

How can I force myself to get more calories? Has anyone ever heard of eating MORE to lose weight? So far I’ve gained 10 pounds on this diet, which she says is so be expected til my metabolism kicks up again.

Dothan is never quiet—but today it’s wrong loud.

Not street-loud. Not tourist-loud.

Tournament-loud.

The kind of density where every hallway feels one body too small, where voices overlap in six languages at once, where the air itself feels over-clocked.

Lily moves through it in silence.

She’s been in Dothan a dozen times now. The pros are used to her. The clerks recognize her without asking. The security guards nod like she already belongs to the building’s memory. Officially she’s still just an examinee.

Functionally?

She’s already been absorbed into the ecosystem.

Mee-Ma walks ahead like she owns the floor. Lucky Dave lumbers at her side, trading jokes with a Dan-7 from Vancouver and a retired Korean champ who smells like mint and old paper. The trailer park contingent trails just far enough back to look casual while absolutely not being casual at all.

Lily notices the difference immediately.

Usually, internationals feel tight.
Focused.
Lean.

Three champions per INR. A handful of supporters. A controlled crowd orbiting a small gravitational core of monsters.

Today?

It’s a flood.

The atrium is shoulder-to-shoulder. The upper walkways are lined three deep. Folding chairs have spilled out into places that were never meant to hold spectators. The vendor corridor is jammed with people not even pretending to browse—just standing, waiting, watching the air like something might tear through it at any second.

Languages stack and clash:

Japanese.
Mandarin.
Spanish.
Russian.
Korean.
French.
English in at least six accents.

Pros everywhere.

Not just Dan-4 support players.

Not just training partners.

Names.

So many names that even Lucky Dave’s usual grin starts to thin at the edges.

Mee-Ma slows.

Her ears flatten—not in fear, not in excitement.

In calculation.

Lucky Dave mutters under his breath, “This ain’t normal.”

Lily feels it too.

Not danger.

Expectation.

Like a storm that hasn’t arrived yet but already has a press conference.

Normally:

One INR sends a champion wearing followers like a procession.

Another sends two title-holders and a translator.

Someone argues quietly over bracket seeding.

Today?

No one is posturing.

Everyone is… waiting.

The noise in Dothan has changed texture.

Not louder—denser.

It’s the sound of too many people thinking about the **same thing** at once.

Whispers slither through the crowd in fragments, breaking and reforming as they pass from mouth to mouth.

“…North American server, I’m tellin’ you…”
“…showed up end of April…”
“…right after that school story out of Seneca…”
“…no chat logs, not one word, ever…”

Since late April—conveniently the very next day after Lily crushed Hikaru at the school tournament—a new handle had appeared on the fledgling online Baduk servers.

**Meowna2.**

At first, the games looked antique.

Third-line territory grabs.
Slow extensions.
Shapes straight out of the 1800s.

People laughed.

Then… within weeks… the style shifted.

Modern joseki started appearing.
Clean komi counting.
Perfect endgame timing.

Not gradual learning.

**Assimilation.**

By June, Meowna2 was dismantling Dan-5s in rapid games and leaving Dan-7s in quiet, humiliating yose deficits they couldn’t quite explain afterward. The games weren’t violent. There were no flashy kills.

Just inevitability.

People replayed those games at night instead of sleeping.

They would wake with sequences still folding and unfolding behind their eyes.

And yet—no messages.
No profile.
No signature phrase.
Not even an emoticon.

Just silence.

The only traceable thing?

North American server routing.

Which is why Dothan is swollen with unauthorized gravity today.

Spectators pretending they’re just “here for internationals.”
Pros pretending they’re not scanning faces.
Officials pretending they don’t feel the pressure pushing against the walls.

Everyone is looking for a ghost.

Lily walks through all of it without speaking.

She feels it though.

The shift in the air.
The tension that doesn’t belong to Mee-Ma.
Doesn’t belong to the titles.
Doesn’t belong to the board.

It belongs to something that shouldn’t exist yet.

---

Mee-Ma and Lucky Dave stand off to the side near one of the vendor corridors, pretending to study a tray of commemorative stones that nobody actually wants to buy.

Mee-Ma mutters without moving her lips,
“I’ve been asked five times today if I’m that computer phantom.”

Lucky Dave snorts quietly.
“Two for me. One fella from Idaho looked real disappointed when I told him my hands don’t fit on a keyboard.”

Mee-Ma’s tail flicks once, irritated.
“People always want the legend to match the story.”

Lucky Dave lowers his voice further, leaning in just enough that only she can hear.

“You think it’s him?”

Mee-Ma doesn’t answer immediately. Her eyes trace the crowd once, slow and deliberate.

Then she says, low and firm:

“I’m tellin’ you right now, I’d bet a week’s groceries Hikaru’s mixed up in this somehow—but you best keep your mouth shut about it. A person’s got a right to their privacy, and that includes whatever strange little handle they use on that computer thing. You hear me? We don’t go pokin’ our noses into a man’s business just ‘cause his name don’t match his trousers.”

---

The whispers keep brushing past her like cold drafts through a cracked door.

Old Hikaru.

She doesn’t turn her head when she hears it.
Doesn’t change her stride.
But the phrase aligns too perfectly with everything else to be coincidence.

She slips into the back of the tournament stadium where the machines are kept—an awkward hybrid space where folding chairs meet extension cords, where the future is literally bolted to a rolling metal table.

The computer waiting there is brand new.

Custom-built.

Beige and boxy and quietly menacing in the way only mid-90s hardware can be. A **Pentium 90 MHz** hums inside it like something barely restrained. **Sixteen megabytes of RAM**—luxury. A **one-gigabyte hard drive**, advertised on a sticker like it’s an infinity stone. A razor-sharp **15-inch SVGA monitor**, locked at **800×600, 72 hertz**, daring the entire room to admit they don’t actually need that many pixels.

A laminated placard on the side brags:

* **Quad-speed CD-ROM**
* **Sound Blaster Audio**
* **28.8 kbps Modem – High-Speed Global Connectivity**

High-speed is doing a lot of emotional labor in that sentence.

In a building full of notebooks, wooden Go boards, and whispered legends, the machine feels obscene.

Lily sits.

She looks at it the way someone might look at a loaded weapon.

Her mind, flat and literal as ever, produces a single quiet conclusion:

*It can play Baduk with strangers… we have reached civilization’s peak.*

She presses the power button.

Fans spin up.
The monitor blooms into life with phosphor glow and a soft, impatient whine.

She dials.

The modem answers with that shrieking, alien argument between machines—metal screaming at metal, negotiation through static. It takes only **twenty-five minutes** to connect.

Shockingly fast.

The desktop finally loads.

She leans forward and types the server address with precise care, copying it from a **crooked yellow sticky note** slapped to the side of the monitor among a chaotic collage of others:

* Tournament calendars
* Pro game SGF archives
* Obscure fuseki pattern indexes
* Yose calculators
* Life-and-death grinders
* Rating inflation trackers
* Server mirror IPs
* Catfolk food suppliers
* Cold-brew chicory coffee
* Imported Ramune soda
* Pimento cheese on white bread
* “Gas-station boiled walnuts (good batch)”

Her fingers hover for a fraction of a second.

Then she presses Enter.

The screen blinks.

The server begins to load.

---


The address is long.

Annoyingly long.

Lily has to type it **three times**, because each wrong character boots the modem handshake and forces the whole awful choir of digital screaming to start over. Every retry costs minutes. Each failure draws more attention.

The crowd notices.

At first it’s just a couple of kids lingering too close behind the folding chairs. Then a pro drifts nearer under the excuse of stretching his legs. Someone else pretends to be checking a bracket but keeps glancing at the monitor.

Five minutes.

The page half-loads.

Text appears in chunks like it’s being shoveled in one wheelbarrow at a time. A broken logo. A sidebar that misaligns. Then—finally—the player list.

Another fifteen minutes pass as she navigates menus that lag behind her inputs like they’re underwater.

At last:

**Create New Handle**

Her fingers move without ceremony.

**LILY LEMONS**

Enter.

Accepted.

A soft murmur ripples behind her.

Someone whispers, “She’s really doin’ it.”

She searches the active boards.

Finds it immediately.

**MEOWNA2**

Online.

Watching.

Waiting.

She issues the challenge.

There is a pause.

Long enough for people to start shifting their weight.

Then:

**MEOWNA2 HAS ACCEPTED YOUR MATCH**

The crowd tightens in on itself.

Even some of the nearby officials stop pretending not to pay attention.

The board loads.

Black to Meowna2.

The first stone appears.

Upper right.

Star point.

Second move: lower left star.

Third: 3–4 in the opposite corner.

Fourth: low territorial extension along the side.

Fifth: quiet joseki approach.

Sixth: safe response.

Seventh: early side territory grab.

Eighth: low extension.

Lily goes completely still.

Because this is it.

This is **exactly** how it began.

Not similar.

Not reminiscent.

Identical to the opening of her first game with old Hikaru.

Her fingers move at last.

She types:

**LilyLemons:** i wanna contin this l8r ok?

The server hangs for a heartbeat.

Two.

Three.

Then the reply appears:

**Meowna2:** july 2 est work 4 u?

The entire cluster behind her inhales at once.

Someone actually chokes.

Another whispers, “It talks…”

Lily types one more line.

**LilyLemons:** ya ill b there

She resigns.

The board clears.

She reaches forward and shuts the computer down.

It powers off **agonizingly slowly**, fans winding down in stages like a dying engine.

The silence afterward is thick and buzzing.

Someone finally asks, “Why’d you quit?”

Lily does not answer.

But they understand.

She didn’t want to fracture the tournament around her.

She didn’t want to draw the storm inside the building.

---

It’s well past midnight when Lily slips back into the house.

Seneca is quiet in that deep, rural way—no traffic hiss, no distant sirens, just insects and the low, steady breathing of a town that assumes tomorrow will arrive on schedule.

She pads down the hallway without a sound and stops at Gia’s door.

Inside, the room is dim, washed in pale blue from a night-light shaped like a crooked star. Gia is sprawled sideways across the bed, one arm thrown over her face, dreaming hard. At the foot of the mattress, Peanuts is curled up like a golden, breathing ornament, tail twitching in short, irritated flicks even in sleep.

Lily stands there.

Still.

Waiting.

The thought passes through her:

*Wake up.*

Peanuts’ eyes snap open instantly, sharp and alert like she’d never really been asleep at all.

“Lily?” she whispers hoarsely. “What the hell—aren’t you supposed to be in Dothan right now?”

Lily doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink.

Peanuts squints at her. “Nah. Lemme guess—you ran into that computer circus again. That ‘internet’ junk is just another passing disease. Who in their right mind wants to listen to a machine scream like it’s being exorcised just to talk to strangers? My buddy’s kid popped one of those AOL disks in and the damn thing sounded like a chimp stuck in a fax machine. And I’m not paying twenty bucks a month so some guy in California can send me ‘electronic mail.’ Just call people like God intended.”

Silence.

Peanuts shifts her weight, props herself on one elbow. “Course, Becca’s got one. She uses it to pretend she’s nineteen again and flirt with boys the second they legally stop being a felony. Whole modern world’s a romance scam.”

Nothing.

She studies Lily’s posture for a second longer, then sighs.

“…Alright. When’s the next digital tragedy scheduled with your mystery boyfriend-slash-vanishing talent show?”

No reply.

Peanuts’ eyes narrow as the timing clicks. “Don’t tell me. July second.”

Stillness.

Her face tightens. “That’s the first day of the pro exams.”

No movement.

“If you miss a round,” she says slowly, “it’s an automatic loss. No appeal. No do-overs. Some kids don’t make it even with four losses on the board.”

Lily stands exactly the same.

Peanuts exhales through her nose, long and controlled. “Okay.”

A beat.

“I get it.”

The hallway stays quiet.

Then from the room next door, half-asleep and half-annoyed, Nada’s voice drifts through the wall—

With that being said, I’m kind of game picky but I’m open to new games if you want a helpless noob to carry around. I’ve been playing a lot of Rivals. And I just purchased BG3.

Appearance wise if you care I’m very short, chubby, and pale. I have shoulder length dark brown wavy curly hair that’s always everywhere. Dunno what else to include.

I’m goofy, shy, and hotheaded. Probably a little bratty at times. I’m very nice once I warm up to you. I also have a super thick southern accent that I’ve been told sounds like having a cup of coffee in the mornings.

While the ""wen moon"" crowd laments the dip from $0.16 back to $0.04c, the grown-ups in the room are looking at the plumbing. And in the world of Proof-of-Work (PoW), the plumbing is everything.

# The Economic Engine: Feeding the Miners

Most Layer 1 (L1) chains have a ""trickle-up"" problem where the base layer struggles to capture value from the activity happening on top. Kaspa is flipping the script.

Unlike many competitors, Kaspa is designed so that **all layers pay fees to the miners.** This isn't just a ""nice to have""; it’s the lifeblood of L1 longevity. By ensuring the security providers (the miners) are well-fed by the entire ecosystem's activity, Kaspa builds a self-sustaining fortress. It’s the economic equivalent of a perpetual motion machine, provided the network activity actually arrives.

# The Roadmap: We Are Here (And ""Here"" is Early)

To understand where we are, we need to speak the language of Silicon Valley. If you’re holding KAS right now, you aren't an IPO day trader. You aren't even a Series A investor.

* **Pre-Seed:** You missed it. (Don't worry, I did too. We can cry into our coffee together.)
* **Seed Stage:** **This is us.** We are currently in the ""basement-coding-and-instant-ramen"" phase of the project.

We are waiting for two massive catalysts: **vProg** (programmability) and **DAG KNIGHT** (the consensus upgrade that makes the protocol adapt to latency in real-time).

>

# The ""Hockey Stick"" and the 1,000x Ghost

In investing, growth usually follows a **Hockey Stick curve**: it stays frustratingly flat for a geological epoch, then turns vertical.

Kaspa has already had its first 1,000x moment—the jump from ""obscure fair-launch project"" to ""top-tier PoW contender."" If you're complaining that it hasn't doubled in the last week, you're looking at the wrong part of the stick. While we may have missed the ""buy for the price of a gumdrop"" phase, the ""network utility"" phase hasn't even begun.

# Real-World Proof: The CityXcape Factor

The crypto space as a whole is still largely a playground for DeFi degens and meme-coin enthusiasts. It’s rare to see a project break out of the ""crypto-for-crypto's-sake"" bubble.

Enter **CityXcape**. It’s one of the first applications that actually looks like… well, a real application. It doesn't scream ""blockchain,"" it just works. This is the blueprint. When the tech becomes invisible and the utility becomes primary, that’s when the ""IPO moment"" for the network finally arrives.

# The Bottom Line

Are we ""late""? Technically, compared to the guy who mined KAS on a laptop in a cold garage in 2021, yes. But in the grand scheme of the **BlockDAG** revolution? We’re still standing outside the stadium waiting for the gates to open.

The price movement between 4 cents and 16 cents is just noise. The signal is the code. And the code is getting ready to eat the world.",3,1767417433.0,kaspa,6,1.0,False

I am reuploading my stories to the new subreddit. Here is white shadow. By the way, this story was heavily inspired by one of my fave albums ever, Jar of Flies by Alice in Chains.)

**Part 1 The Shore/Whale and Wasp**

The dead bodies were spread out on the shore of the misty lake.

Jack sipped his dull coffee with tired eyes that looked down upon the pale dead bodies that laid before him. The police officers set up a perimeter on the shore of the lake to prevent the media or anybody from stumbling upon the crime scene. The flashes of light dominated the crime scene as pictures were taken of the cruelty that laid before them.

Jack was a skinny white man with bags under his eyes and stubble. He missed his morning shave when he got the call to arrive at the scene. He was a man who spent many sleepless nights on this case. Just a week ago, they found five dead bodies in the woods. They were different though as they were mutilated beyond repair.

Jack lifted up the pictures of the five victims that were taken at the last crime scene. He studied them carefully as he glanced back and forth from the pictures to the fresh crime scene. The gruesome display that made him come to many conclusions. The pictures displayed five torsos, just five torsos, arms and legs ripped off. No head, and a tattoo of a large, detailed eye with orbs surrounding.

*At least their fates were a bit simpler*, he pondered, *the last batch were ripped apart. I guess the killer got soft*.

“Five,” he muttered under his breath as he counted in a southern drawl, “five dead bodies. Why haven’t you been discovered earlier. I had to wake up at 5 in the morning for this shit.”

“Sorry, I’m late, I had to help my baby girl get ready for school.”

Jack turned to see his partner, Denzel, a young black man nervously scratching his head in a suit. He was a rookie detective that was assigned by the police department to Jack. The young man stood by Jack as he stared upon the carnage before him. 

Denzel was cleanly shaven, but the job was quickly bothering him as his eyes were weighed down. The bags underneath signaled many sleepless nights. Insomnia is something the two men can share.

“I don’t really care if you come or not,” Jack replied with an annoyed expression.

“Well, it won’t happen again, sir,” Denzel responded.

A police officer went over to Denzel and Jack with a worried look. He was a chubby man of short stature and a classic police moustache. He stared intently at the detectives to get their attention.

“One body was found washed ashore, we sent in dive teams and found the rest, they have been dead for several days,” he explained.

“How’d they die?” Denzel asked.

“We think their throats were slit, thrown in the water with rope attached to a rock tied around their feet. One came loose. The one that washed ashore, but we can't be too sure till the forensic pathologists get a hold of them,"" explained the officer.

“It's obvious, their throats were slit,” Jack grunted, “look at their necks.”

Jack squatted to take a good look at the corpses and he saw something that peaked his interest. A marking, a strange marking that stuck out of the man’s chest through his unbuttoned shirt. 

Jack proceeded to rip the shirt open to reveal a tattoo. A tattoo of a huge eye surrounded by orbs. They stared upon it in awe-struck and felt shivers tingle down their spines. The team quickly tore the clothing off the corpses to reveal the strange markings and tattoos on their chest.

“Oh, sweet Jesus, deliver us from this evil,” Denzel whispered with his eyes closed and his head down, “have mercy on the souls of these victims. Amen.”

“That ain’t gonna do nothing here,” Jack spitted out.

“You know, I pray for you, Jack,” Denzel said.

Jack grunted as he walked away from the crime scene. Denzel stood there writing his notes within his journal. Soon, the two men went back to the police station to continue their investigation. 

Jack thought about the tattoos and the markings as he drove to the station. Denzel was close behind, their drive was mostly silent as they pulled up to the station. Jack got out of his car and slowly closed the door.

He pulled a cigarette and lit it to get a quick smoke session in before all the paperwork. Denzel got out of his car and walked over to the smoking Jack. The smoke hovering over them in the damp and cold Nashville air.

“Smoking ain’t good for you,” Denzel chastised Jack, “my grandmama died from lung cancer you know.”

“Please, I’m not in the mood,” Jack growled, looking away from his partner.

“Well, I like to look out for my friends, ya know.”

“Who said we were friends?”

“Anyways,” Denzel said with a sigh while shaking his head, “what do you think those tattoos are from?”

“Don’t know,” replied Jack with a ring of smoke emitting from his mouth.

“This was 3rd time this month, another 5 bodies, it makes me sick,” Denzel muttered angrily, “the sick fuck that’s doing this, I noticed something peculiar about this.”

“What?”

“I don’t wanna get racial, but they are always minorities, the victims have only been black, hispanic, and asian,” Denzel answered, “never white people.”

“You think it’s racially motivated?” Jack turned to Denzel as he peaked his interest, “some white nationalist group? Neo nazi?”

“Maybe, my intuition is pointing me in that direction,” Denzel replied, “what’s your judgement?”

Jack continued to smoke the cigarette until it was a small insignificant stub. Denzel stood there with non-blinking wide eyes at his partner for a response. Jack eventually tossed what’s left of the cigarette onto the ground before mushing it with his foot. He proceeded to walk into the station.

“It’s as cold as a snow man's crotch out here,” Jack muttered, “I’m going inside before my balls become snowballs.”

Denzel followed close behind with an annoyed expression on his face. Both men barged into the police station.

“Hey, don’t leave me hanging like that,” Denzel pouted, “I wanna know what you think.”

“You are being annoying.”

“I’m your partner whether you like it or you don’t. I’m trying to get along with you. I know it’s only been a month.”

Jack looked down with a snarl planted on his face. He looked up at his partner's face with annoyance. His wife always told him to be a little nicer to his newly arrived partner. After all, their two daughters were friends in middle school, so they often hung out after work.

“Don’t take it personal, Denzel, didn’t get much sleep, that’s all,” Jack said.

“So, that’s why you're grumpy?” Denzel jokes, “how about this. You tell me your theory and the next coffee run is on me.”

Jack smirked at his amusing partner, but that smirk quickly turned to a scowl. He thought about the marking and his mind rushed to aliens, weirdly enough. The orbs that resemble planets surrounding an eye. Maybe, it was the illuminati, after all they are distinguished by a singular eye. That can't be right because the eye has always been red.

“My theory,” Jack slowly muttered in his deep southern accent, “I think your theory has merit, but the tattoos, they look cultish to me.”

“A cult?” Denzel spurted with a puzzled look.

“Yeah, a cult.”

“Detective Thorn! Detective Jordan! A suspect turned himself in. He confessed to the murders at the lake. Follow me.”

The two whipped their heads quickly in the direction of an incoming female police officer. Their eyes wide with bewilderment and shock as they followed the officer. Everyone rushed in the direction of the interrogation room. They crowded around the window to get a good look at the suspect.

There he sat, a young white man that looked to be in his early 20s. He was bald, shirtless, and only wore sweatpants. His face was as smooth as a baby's bottom and his eyes were agape with bags that hung lifelessly underneath. He sat there with a big smile that stretched from ear to ear. His eyebrows were shaved off and his darkened pupils were dilated.

“What's his name?” Jack questioned the officer.

“John Doe.”

“You've got to be kidding?” Jack replied.

“I'm not, we can't find anything on him in our database.”

“I told you, neo-nazi skinhead freaks,” Denzel whispered into Jack’s ears.

“Bad cop, good cop routine?” Jack asked.

“You betcha.”

They both opened the door to visit the young man as he stared emotionlessly at them. His grin never left his face as they entered the room. A tattoo was revealed upon the young man’s chest with a large detailed red eye that gazed upon the two.

“Detective Jack Thorn! I’m so happy to see you,” the young man gleefully shrieked while fighting against his cuffs attached to the table.

The young man bounced joyfully as he gazed at Jack with his large round eyes. His smile revealed perfectly aligned white teeth. He switched his gaze frantically between the two men.

“And you are not happy to see me?” Denzel responded.

“Our Master is aware of you, but he sees you only as food. As a sacrifice, but Jack. He’s special,” the young man answered.

“This motherfucker, the shit you have done,” Denzel said with a nasty glare.

“Why are you interested in me?” Jack asked.

“Oh my!” the young man exclaimed, “you have been chosen by our Master! Our preacher is much too old.”

“They said you confessed to murdering all those people,” Jack said, “Is this true?”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” the young man sang.

“Why the fuck would you do that?” Denzel hissed, “who sent you? Neo-Nazis? KKK? Or do you enjoy it?”

“No! No! No!” the young man screamed furiously while slamming his fists, “No! No! No! No!”

“Calm down. We just want information,” Jack said, “who sent you?”

“That is beneath us. We are doing this to benefit our Master! He has done nothing, but help us and create a paradise for us. He demands souls to satiate his hunger. Specific souls,” he explained, “that is better than living the life they lived.”

Denzel balled his fists as he glared upon the young bald man. He wanted to show him no mercy for his cruel acts. Jack looked at his partner and noticed the veins that popped forth from his face. The young man grinned wildly at the two and started to chuckle at Denzel’s anger.

“You think that’s funny?”

“Hey, I need to speak with you outside for a moment,” Jack whispered to Denzel.

“You gotta chill out,” Jack spurted, “you can't be aggressive with the suspect like that.”

“Did I do that?”

“Well, a little, we gotta get him to relax, get him to spill the beans,” Jack explained, “you look like you wanna rip the guy's head off.”

“And you don't?” Denzel asked, “this weirdo got it coming. Anyways, you were right.”

“About what?”

“It's some freaky ass cult. Worse than I imagined.”

“Yeah,” Jack responded while nodding his head slowly.

Denzel's eyes were fixated on the young man, but he reluctantly nodded his head and stepped out of the room. Jack stood there with no expression at all, and Denzel had a furious snarl. 

Though, they both tried to act as though the young man did nothing to disturb them. They knew that the feeling they had deep down in their bones was ice. There was something wrong, very wrong, beyond what they could ever imagine.

**Part 2**

**The Station/ Swing on this**

Denzel sat at the computer with a perplexed expression on his face. He tried to search the young man within their database but found nothing. He was a ghost. The young man had a fingerprint, but nothing identifiable within the system. Even his name was nonsensical, John Doe, a name used for anyone with no clear identity. The bald freakshow apparently called himself, ""John Doe,"" when asked his name.

He searched and searched, but nothing, no birthday, no family, no history, and no criminal record. Denzel pinched his nose in frustration from having no leads. Just a confession, but that's about it, he guessed that's all they needed. 

There was only one thing that just led to more confusion. His place of birth was in a small town called Somersville, Tennessee. Somersville, that's what was in the system, a town called Somersville. He searched for Somersville and found nothing. There's no such town anywhere in the USA. 

“Daddy!”

Denzel snapped back in fear from the abrupt sound. His heart racing and his mind exploding from the sudden noise. He turned shakingly to be met by a young girl. He sighed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly at his daughter.

“Hey, baby girl, why are you awake so late? It's almost 12,” he said to her.

“Sorry, I just had a bad dream,” she replied while rubbing her eyes.

“What dream?”

“I was walking through the woods, and I came across all these weird naked pale bald people. They were looking up at a meteorite slowly descending. They then turned towards me. They started sprinting at me. I woke up.”

He stared wide-eyed at his daughter after hearing that revelation. His mind raced more so than ever before. The dream was so strange and so surreal in the way she explained it. Does this have anything to do with John Doe?

“Hmmm did you say a prayer to the Lord before going to bed?”

“I forgot.”

“You got to. Jesus protects us from bad dreams, but you gotta be polite and ask him for it.”

“Sorry.”

“Don't say sorry to me, but say sorry to the Lord,” he replied gently, “he loves you.”

Denzel guided his daughter to her bedroom and tugged her in. He switched the light off while blowing kisses. When he closed the door, his expression rapidly changed from the sweet father to disturbed man. He heard a rumble in his pocket from his phone and checked it. He saw that he received an email.

He rushed over to his computer and checked his email. He saw a link was sent to him by an unknown email address. An email address from a Preacher Tom. 

The instant that he almost pressed the link, his phone lit up and started to ring.  The link had to be put on hold, and he lifted up the phone. He pressed the answer on the touchscreen to talk to his disgruntled partner.

“What do you need?” Denzel answered.

“It's an emergency.”

“Can we wait till morning? I wanna get one good night of sleep.”

“I'm parked outside your house.”

Denzel opened the blinds to his window. He saw the insistent Jack leaning up against his car. A cloud of cigarette smoke circled his head.

“Come out now.”

“Brother, can I get one night? Just one night. I’m on sleeping meds. They are great.”

“Come out now.”

“I will let you borrow a few pills. You might need them.”

“Come out now.”

“Can this wait until tomorrow morning?”

“Come out now.”

“Fuck, fine. I'm coming out.”

Denzel hung up on the phone and cursed under his breath. He grabbed his coat, gun, and his badge. He opened his front door and turned to lock it.

“Sir, you’re being annoying,” Denzel shouted as he walked towards Jack.

“He's dead.”

“What? What the fuck are you talking about?”

“Suspect is dead,” Jack sternly said, “we gotta go back to the station.”

Jack and Denzel entered the vehicle quickly as they flew down the road. They remained silent on the entire car ride to the station. Their minds wandered through all the possibilities and questions. How did he die? What happened? Who was he? What's Somersville? Where’s Somersville?

They finally made it to the station and quickly got out of the car. They ran inside to the cells to see what happened. A few officers surrounded the scene and took pictures. The two men were directed to the morgue to see the body. 

The freezing air busted into their faces as they entered the morgue. There stood the forensics pathologist, Dr. Feelgood, with a large angry frown. He was an old man with large glasses and wrinkles that spread out all over his face.

“This is bullshit. They called me in for this. Right in the middle of my Disney movie marathon,” Dr. Feelgood growled, “they called me when things were getting good in Lilo.”

“I like that one,” Denzel replied, “about the cute little blue alien?”

“Ha, yeah, he's my favorite,” Dr. Feelgood said with a smile, “he's so delightful. I can't wait for my vacation to Hawaii!”

“That sounds awesome. Are you taking the grandkids?” asked Denzel.

“Of course, it's gonna be great, I'm counting down the minutes in this bullshit miserable place,” said Dr. Feelgood.

“Don't forget to show us pictures,” Denzel replied, “do you like the minions?”

“I love them. The grand kids love them. The whole family loves those cute little yellow things.”

Jack stood there in the middle of the inane useless conversation. On the inside, he got more and more angry at the nonsense these two were spewing. He held it together and waited for the conversation to end. 

The corpses of the victims were all around them. Their gaunt eyes, blood drained greyish bodies, and their shaved heads. Jack walked among them to get away from the constant chattering from the two. 

Their faces were staring up into oblivion with lost humanity. The tattoo of the single eye on their chests that peered up through the roof and into the stars. There he was, the young, disturbed man with a smile imprinted upon his face. 

His tattoo sticking out like a sore thumb. His ice cold blue eyes that continued to stare into whatever abyss he came from. Jack looked at him with fixation and focus as though this man was going to rise up.

“I lost a lot of money when Aaron Rodgers took that injury. It was bullshit! The Jets can lick my ass,” Dr. Feelgood whined.

“Yeah, they haven’t had a good season in a while, they were great at one point,” replied Denzel.

“The Giants sucks ass too,” grumbled Dr. Feelgood, “why are all my home teams so shitty?”

“Don’t know,” Denzel said while shrugging his shoulders.

“Hey! buddy! What are you doing over there with Baldy!?” shouted the Doctor as ran over to Jack.

“I’m just studying him,” responded Jack with eyes fixated on the young pale corpse.

“Well, then go to medical school and become a medical examiner,” replied Dr. Feelgood, “anyways, this guy is the weirdest case, a heart attack and brain dead. No evidence of trauma. No evidence of asphyxiation. Toxicology report is negative. No drug use. A very healthy 20-year-old boy. Athletic build.”

“He just died?” Denzel asked.

“Yeah, he just laid down and died.”

“What?” Jack questioned.

“Yes, he laid in his bed and just died. They found him there. He was still,” Dr. Feelgood explained, “it’s like he knew he’d be dead. So, he just laid down and went away to whatever hell he came from. Good riddance. By the way, here is the last thing he was holding to his chest before he died.”

Jack felt this uneasiness as he scanned the room and the dead bodies that were laid out on their metal beds. The Doctor handed him a map in a plastic bag and an envelope. The map had a X mark that resembled where a treasure chest would be in a pirate movie. The envelope had coordinates written on the back. On the front was dedicated to Jack and it read, “welcome to Somersville.”

**Part 3: The Tunnel/No Excuses**

They left on a Wednesday for their journey to Somersville at 1 PM.

“Check out this video,” Denzel said, “it’s the weird link I got on the night of that guy's death.”

“I’m driving,” Jack replied with his eyes focused on the road up ahead, “why didn’t you show me earlier?”

“I forgot, anyways it's some creepy fatass white preacher dude talking about how great Somersville is.”

“I can look when we get to Somersville, but now, I gotta pay attention.”

“The same dude sent me the email with the link. Creepy. Did you get the same email?”

“I don't have an email.”

“What?” Denzel said baffled, “you make no sense, bro.”

“The Internet is filled with bullshit liberal propaganda. Not interested.”

Denzel shook his head in disbelief at the man sitting next to him.

The hills passed by them as they continued on their journey. The greenery was masked by the greyness of the winter and the hills weren’t as vibrant. The clouds hung over their heads as they drove for what seemingly felt like eternity. 

The map was left back at the station as it was considered evidence. They finally arrived at the exact coordinates of the map, and they were able to put it into their phones. The coordinates led them to a gas station, a gas station, they were quite disappointed. They needed to refuel and use the opportunity to ask questions. They checked the clock on their phones, and it was around 2 PM.

While Denzel was refueling the car, Jack walked into the gas station to buy some smokes and snacks. He noticed the gas attendant, a young girl with brown hair and light green eyes. She was very pretty, and she smiled as large as the eyes could see. 

Jack tipped his hat and smiled at the young lady as her eyes followed him. He went through the aisles and grabbed all the things he needed. Her eyes never left him and followed him all throughout the gas station.

“Hello,” he said with a forced smile as he put all his stuff on the counter.

“Hello, Officer Jack Thorn,” she gleefully replied with a large grin.

All the blood rushed out of his face as he stared at the woman. He tried not to let the reply shake him to his core, but it was hard. He couldn’t believe that she knew his name. He tried to play it cool after hearing that reply.

“How does a pretty young lady like you know my name?” he jokes, “someone told you?”

“Sorry, I probably shouldn’t have done that,” she responded, “anyways, you are the talk of Somersville.”

“Am I really?”

“Yup, it’s good that you guys got gas, the tunnel is long.”

“What tunnel?” he asked, puzzled.

“Silly me, I was supposed to tell you about the tunnel, go through the trail through the woods by the gas station. To the right,” she said.

“Thank you.”

Jack walked over to his partner with a disturbed expression. They both got into the car and Jack did precisely what she told him. He went right of the gas station and went straight into the path Denzel looked around in a flurry of confusion.

“Ain't that where the coordinates point to? Did you get any info? Where are we going? You need to say shit, you can't just do shit without telling me,” shouted Denzel.

“Yeah, this is where Somersville is.”

They rode for a few minutes, and there it was, the tunnel.

“This is some bullshit,” Denzel spouted, “we are going in that freaky ass tunnel? It's pitch black.”

“You can leave if you want, I'm going in.”

“You are a crazy motherfucker, you know! Looks like a portal to hell!” Denzel shouted.

“Make your choice or call an Uber.”

“Fine, this is some bullshit,” Denzel muttered under his breath.

The two went straight into the tunnel with no plans of returning back. The point of no return. They submerged in pitch black, even with the headlights, there was nothing to be seen. 

They drive straight into a wall for all they know. The walls suffocated them as they felt as the tunnel was more and more narrow. The trip lasted hours upon hours, a total of 5 hours and there was no end in sight. By the 6th hour, there was a light that shines brightly on the other end.

“Finally,” Jack spurted, “I'm tired of eating beef fucking Jerky.”

“I gotta take a shit,” Denzel spewed.

“Next stop.”

They were transported through the bright portal into Somersville. An unusually large sign appeared suddenly before them that read, “Summersville.” The sky was bright blue with no cloud in sight and the sun was blaring overhead. The trees were bright green and had a multi-color hue from all the flowers that covered them. The rainbow of flowers surrounded them like a vast ocean.

“Racist bald idiot misspelled the name of his own town,” Denzel said with a frown, “what kinda dumbass education they got in this honky tonk town?”

“Hmm, did not expect this,” Jack replied.

“What’d you expect?”

“Something more dreary,” Jack responded, “but this is way creepier somehow.”

They continued to drive through beautiful meadows and the clear blue sky was so peaceful. There was no such thing before they went into the tunnel. The winter was cold, and the skies were cloudy with rain. 

The seasons changed so quickly to summer once they went through the tunnel. Maybe, they went into another dimension, they finally made it to the town. The streets were lined with perfect southern style two story white houses. The inhabitants looked healthy, happy, and walked like there were no problems to be had.

What surrounded them were beautiful pristine white buildings. They were made from perfect marble limestone and there were no miscalculations to the structure or integrity. There were mostly white families that surrounded them, but there was still diversity. 

One of every minority, ethnicity, and race. They also had these sweet blissful smiles painted upon their faces. Everybody looked blissful, content, and satisfied. The streets were smooth and there were no hills. The land was straight and all the grass was perfectly cut.

“I’m about to shit my pants!” Denzel shouted.

“Fine, we will pull up at the grocery store,” Jack replied.

They pulled up to a grocery story and Denzel ran in with a dump about to drop in his pants. Jack slowly meandered through the grocery store and bought something as to not be considered trespassing. 

Jack noticed that the fruits and vegetables were perfectly placed. He picked an apple up and analyzed it, not one scratch or bruise. Maybe he was lucky, but on close inspection, all of the fruits and vegetables were perfect. He picked a chocolate bar from the candy aisle and walked to the cashier. He threw the candy bar on the counter.

“Is that all, Sir?” the cashier boy asked with a large grin.

“Yeah”

“Ok, that'll be 4 dollars,” the cashier gleefully responded.

“Fucking inflation,” Jack mumbled as through 5 bucks on the counter.

The young cashier handed him back his change.

“Thank you, Sir, have a great day, Mr. Thorn,” the cashier announced in delight.

“How does everyone know my name!?”

“Preacher Tom told everyone your name,” the boy answered.

“Where’s his big ass?” Jack asked.

“That’s not very nice, but he is at the center of town at his church. He’s expecting you,” the cashier replied.

“Thanks,” Jack replied.

Jack ran back to his car and sat in the driver's seat with his heart pounding. Denzel walked out with a relieved relaxed expression. Denzel opened the passenger seat door and got in.

“I was holding that shit for 2 hours. It was an emergency,” Denzel said, “the anaconda almost clogged the toilet.”

“Why would I want to hear that?” Jack hissed angrily, “that’s disgusting. You always talk about your shits. Nobody likes it.”

They traveled to the center of the town and were greeted by a massive blue cathedral structure that pointed to the sky. The cathedral had blue windows and an ornate, but strange, double door had gold and silver. 

Each door had a glass window that resembled an eye with a red ruby that represented the pupil. The cosmic cathedral stuck out like a sore thumb in the middle of a seemingly normal Southern town. They parked right in front of the church-like structure and got out of the car.

“This is the nicest cathedral I’ve seen,” Denzel said, “looks like a futuristic gothic cathedral in Europe.”

They took a good long look at the door handle. The handles were white hands stuck out of the door. Denzel looked at the door handle and looked at Jack. He gestured to Jack to open the door. Jack grabbed the white hand and pulled the door open.

“You're such a gentleman,” Jack said sarcastically.

Denzel smiled widely and bowed his head as Jack entered the strange dream-like Cathedral. They walked amongst the wooden pews and at the front of the church was not what they expected. A large black jagged stone with a stand right in front. The windows shone a strange blue light that covered the church in a mixture of regular sunlight and blue light.

“Gentlemen! I am so happy to see you! Welcome to the prettiest town in the world!”

A southern twang rang through the church from behind Jack and Denzel. The two turned to be greeted by a large rotund man wearing an expensive looking long red and white robe. He wore a short bushy brown beard and short brown hair. He had large brown eyes, and he danced as he walked over to the two detectives. He bowed and shook the two men’s hands as he walked them through the church.

“Mr. Thorn and Mr. Jordan, you are just in time, my service will start soon, my name is Preacher Tom!” Preacher Tom proudly announced.

“Hello, Preacher Tom,” Jack politely replied.

“Hi, Preacher Tom,” Denzel said.

“I know you two have questions about the strangeness,” the preacher stated, “but can you two wait till after service? I have a great one today. Please, join us.”

Denzel glanced at Jack to gauge his response. Jack just stared at the preacher that stood in front of him. Preacher Tom wore a genuine large smile. He swayed right to left as though he had a happy country song stuck in his head. He looked at his expensive watch and jumped in excitement.

“10 minutes! It’s almost 12 PM! Please! Please! Join us for service,” the preacher begged.

“What!?” Jack spurted as he checked the time on his phone and it was 10 minutes to 12.

“Uhh? It’s not almost 12,” replied Denzel, “when we got to the tunnel, it was 2 PM, so it should be around 8 PM. Night.”

“What!” the preacher chuckled, “you guys are funny, next thing you know it, you’ll be telling me it’s not Sunday!”

The two detectives looked at each other in shock because they thought that it was Wednesday. They checked their phones and saw Sunday, 11:55 AM, they kept checking over and over again. 

The two detectives played with setting and checked if they crossed state lines, but no, they were in Tennessee alright. Did they travel through time? Did they go through a wormhole in the tunnel?

“Maybe, we got in our car, got struck by lightning and turned into a Delorean!” Denzel theorized.

“A honda civic?” Jack asked.

Denzel ran out the weird door to check on the car and the car just stood there. Nope, not a DeLorean. The preacher laughed with his large bellowing laugh at the commotion that the time lapse.

“Oh, you fellas are a hoot and holla!” Preacher Tom jokes, “don’t worry, the master messes with time for fun on occasion.”

“Who’s the master?” Jack questioned.

“Join the service and you will find out,” the Preacher replied joyously.

12 PM was struck on the dot and they came pouring into the pews from the front door. Jack and Denzel uncomfortably took a seat in the front pews. The occupants of the church were very normal, except for the tattoos. 

The girls wore pretty pink dresses and white dresses. The men were well-groomed with suits and ties on. They all made Jack and Denzel look, well, not presentable.

The tattoos struck out the most to the two detectives. Some of the worshippers had a large red eye on the center of their heads. A petite white, blonde woman with her picture-perfect family and a well-groomed husband. 

The husband had a white suit, jeans, and combed brown hair. The blonde lady had a long dress with flowers that decorated it. The two little boys had collared polo shirts and jeans. They all had a detailed red eye tattoo that was planted at the center of their heads. A grin never leaving their faces.

The tattoo appeared on the shoulders of girls with dresses. The tattoo appeared on the hands of the men. Everybody stood still in their pews and stared straight ahead at the black stone as Preacher Tom entered behind the stand. Jack and Denzel stood out like a moose amongst deer. They weren’t dressed for the occasion, and they definitely didn’t have tattoos. This fact made the service nerve-wrecking for the two men.

*A bunch a fucking freak*, Denzel thought, *this is sacrilege*.

*I haven’t been to church in a while*, Jack pondered, *but... didn’t expect this*.

Then, they chanted, they chanted in an unknown language. The inhabitants of the church made strange sounds that the vocal cords should not muster. The Preacher danced and waved his hands as he directed the crazy congregation. 

The songs they sang sounded gargled and choked as though the congregation was dying right before their eyes. The Preacher landed on the ground and shook violently with eyes rolling on the back of his head. He then jumped to his feet and continued to dance to the chants. This went on for 30 minutes. They finally plopped down in their seats.

“Ah, yes, I will do the sermon in English for our two new guests!” the Preacher finally said to the mic, “please stand, my friends Jack and Denzel!”

Jack and Denzel stood up and awkwardly waved to the crowd of crazed cultists. They wanted to run away from the loonies that surrounded them. They also didn’t want them to chase them and rip them limb from limb.

“Ah, Yes, the master! Our god! He came to this rock right here,” the preacher said while pointing at the rock, “he brought these two gentlemen to us and we must thank him! Oh! The master is so wonderful! He tells me things,” the Preacher Tom said, “he told me that Jack will be the new preacher! The master wants me! He loves me and you and you and you!”

Jack jaw dropped from the announcement, and he stared wide-eyed at the Preacher. The crowd erupted in cheers and clapping from the news. Denzel and Jack sat there with confusion, shock, and horror from these lunatics. They could not believe what they were hearing. The parishioners stood up while clapping at the news. They were overjoyed.

“The master came from the heavens to take care of us, but he needs a new host, somebody that can show you the way. Someone who can translate the transmission from the master’s mind!” the Preacher shouted into the mic, “now, let’s love the master! Remember, lewd acts are against the rules.”

The cultists got up into a single file line and one by one, they did the unspeakable, they went up to the rock. They hugged the jagged rock, kissed it, licked it, and some even humped it. The cultists were loving on the rock. It was Denzel’s turn, he stood at the back of the line, for a reason.

“Excuse me, Preacher Tom,” Denzel politely said.

“Yes, Sir,” the preacher replied.

“You see, I’m a Christian, I can’t do this,” Denzel said.

“I used to be Christian,” said the Preacher, “you do not need to do anything. We live in a free country.”

“Thank you,” Denzel said as he took a seat, he lowered his head, and prayed, “Our Father,” silently in his head.

Jack walked to the stone and stared at it for a very, very long time. The cultist and the preacher gazed upon him intently. Their eyes never left him. He touched it and they drew closer to him. Jack decided to kiss the black rock and the entire congregation cheered loudly. They jumped, they danced and cried in the unknown language. The woman hugged him and pulled him.

A female customer entered the store already visibly angry. She ignored customers waiting in line and attempted to place her order immediately, which caused frustration among those who were queuing properly.

During payment, she threw money toward the cashier and demanded her order be prioritized because she was “in a hurry.” The barista calmly explained that there was an existing queue and pending orders.

At the expedite area, the customer requested a specific coffee bean that was not available that day. The barista politely explained that only one type of bean was available, which further upset her.

When her order was finally released, the customer verbally cursed at another staff member, saying she was angry because the person waiting for her had already left.

She initially exited the store, but then returned claiming she heard someone scream, even though no employee raised their voice. At this point, she became aggressive and began recording the staff without consent, stating that she would post the video on social media.

At the same time, her male companion attempted to force his way into a staff-only storage area by pushing the door, saying he wanted to see who was inside. This caused significant fear and alarm among the employees.

The customer, her mother, and the male companion then positioned themselves in front of the cashier area and aggressively demanded to know “who screamed.” Multiple employees tried to calmly explain the situation and de-escalate, but they refused to listen and continued escalating.

The customer’s mother issued verbal threats, demanded that employees give their names, and said that if we didn’t comply, they would take photos of us. She also threatened legal action, stating we would “see each other in court.”

Out of fear and concern for our safety, the employees reluctantly provided their names. This was done under intimidation and duress, not voluntarily.",6,1767417286.0,LawPH,1,0.88,False

After getting tired of calling you so many times
I started to stare at the ceiling with the bouquet in my hands 
Alone in a cafe 
With nothing but the sound of clock and the customers
I ordered a coffee but I forgot and didn't even touch it
And It soon grew cold
There was no steam coming out of it when I noticed it
I started to remember the time when I first met you 
My heart raced races like the fastest horse in a derby when you first said yes to go out on a date with me at a cafe
I thought it's Just like in the movies
I tried to tell my heart to slow the f down 
But it didn't listen 
I told it the moments of the past 
Tried to tell the breaks it have endured
Yet still
Like a fool 
I couldn't help but dream
The sun kept going down
The colors of the ceiling started to change as the light grew dimmer
The flowers in the bouquet started to lose their vibrant pigment 
I switched off my phone
It was an impulse
I wasn't even waiting for you any longer
I knew you weren't coming 
I was just.......
I was just.............
I don't know what I was doing 
I had stared at the ceiling for so long that the ceiling was staring me back 
It told me that i was broken again
I switched on my phone to see if anything was there from you
And there was a single text 
'I am out with someone else I forgot to tell you'
I looked at it 
Then closed the phone
I stood up 
I paid the bill
The coffee was still there untouched
I said sorry to the staff for not drinking it
I threw the bouquet in the bin
And I walked off
It was dark now
I decided to walk home
The sky was violet 
And the few stars were there in the sky barely visible
I reached home
I threw the phone on the couch
And I went straight to bed
I started to stare at the ceiling again
The thoughts poured again
So i hid my face in the pillow and slept face down
I woke up about three hours later in the middle of the night 
I noticed the corners of my eye dried and salty
And my pillow had wet patches on both sides
I brought myself out of bed drank some water
And went back to bed
The tiredness of my mind by thinking too much helped me sleep
For some moments i thought about staying up until morning because it was Sunday the next day
But I decided to be kind to myself for once
And decided to sleep
I hadn't touched my phone
Maybe afraid of something 
I woke up
I made myself some coffee 
I went to buy some groceries
And then cleaned the house 
It had been a while since I did it
I made myself a sandwich
Later
And then I turned on the tv
And put on a cartoon
I laughed and then 
Suddenly 
My eyes were wet
But then a knock on the door broke the bubble of my world
I stood up and opened the door
It was my mother 
And like a flash it felt like my feets were on the ground
She put a hand on my head
And said ""how are you son?"" While entering my room 
My heartbeats lowered by leaps and bounds
""I am always fine as you know""
""How'd the date go with that girl?"" she asked
While looking around the things in my room
She would come once in a while to clean and help me with some chores
""Umm it was fine"" I answered
""Hmmmm"" she let out a sound
""Let's first clean up the house and then you tell me what really happened"" 
""Okay"" 
All the moms have sixth sense for some reason
We tidied up the house and she carefully cleaned every corner. She cleaned rigorously like someone possessed.my room started to look like a 5 star hotel room.Each corner she cleaned the dust I felt somethings moving inside me. Things shimmered and things gave way, i started to get involved more and more and cleaning the house and clearing my head both melted together somewhere.
Then she made a filling lunch afterwards 
And we talked it over the lunch
""So, tell me what really happened?""
""Ahhh, well she didn't come and that's all there is to it"" i replied while letting out a sigh 
A sigh that would prove to anyone that i had turned hollow inside
""Well, that's really unfortunate""
""Hmmm"" I said
""Did she say why she didn't come?""
""She just sent a single text saying 'I am out with someone else I forgot to tell you'"" i replied in a low voice
""Hmmm Well it's not your fault she didn't come""
""I mean yeah obviously it's not""
""Then why are you not happy""
""What is there to be happy about mom?"" I said annoyingly
""Well the fact that you are spared from her""
""I don't know if that's good though, I mean mom you don't know, she is just beautiful in all sense of the word"" I said while leaning back and looking at the ceiling 
""Well beautiful doesn't mean they're beautiful from the inside you know""
""I know I know
It's just that...
Nothing
I'll be fine""
""Take your time"" she said
""Time is all I have"" i said

27F. Diagnosed with vaginismus July 2025. No penetrative sex ever. Limited tampon use. One successful pap smear, others unsuccessful due to pain. IUD placement unsuccessful due to pain. Started PF PT in July 2025; started sex therapy in July 2025. 

Diagnosed with vulvodynia and lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) in August 2025. Put on steroid cream for three months. Used for one month (I'm to this day convinced I did not have LSC, and I don't like long term steroid use).

Finally saw a vulvodynia specialist in November 2025. Diagnosed with vestibulodynia. Placed on lidocaine cream and E/T cream. Creams are bad news for me (sensory issues) so I used them but could not follow the treatment plan. Discussed further with Doc and decided on pudendal nerve blocks. 

I was given zero information beforehand so did a lot of googling trying to figure out what was going to happen. A lot of children and men get pudendal nerve blocks so a lot of the info was centered around pediatric or male care. 

Anyway, my appointment was at 8am. The nurse took my blood pressure and other vitals. Doc came in to talk to me, went over consents, what was going to happen etc. I changed and he did a  q tip test and digital exam just to see what was happening. He then applied lidocaine cream and left for about ten minutes for it to kick in.

He returned w a nurse and the syringe, medicine loaded. He spread my labia very far apart which was semi-painful, but doable. He started further inside the vagina, right behind the opening itself which  is where I feel a lot of pain. Those two were the worst. 4/10 on pain scale for me but were done in less than thirty seconds. 

The injections at the actual entrance were practically painless. More pressure than sharp pain. I think I got 7-8 injections in total. Entire time took less than 5 minutes. 

Doctor had to hold a q tip to the sites to stop the bleeding (normal). It looked like a lot of blood when I got up, but a panty liner for the rest of the day was fine.

I was sore and didn't feel great the rest of the day. The soreness was real, but the gross/weird/very aware of my anatomy feeling was at least 50% mental for me lol. I did have to take some ibuprofen later that day to help with the soreness. I also sat in a hard chair at a coffee shop for about 5 hours after the injections. Shouldn't have done that.

Anyway, I haven't tried dilating since getting the injections. Will update once I do. ",5,1767416914.0,vulvodynia,4,1.0,False

“Ben, don’t you *dare* say another word!” A sharp, feminine voice demanded as another person stormed through the interrogation room’s door. A woman, clad in a pristine black pantsuit with electric green eyes and voluminous sandy brown curls- equipped with a no nonsense attitude, joined the increasingly cramped space. 

Exasperated, Detective Daniels asked, ”And who the hell are you?!”

“His lawyer,” she said matter-of- fact, sticking a hand out to the two cops sitting across from me, shaking each appendage firmly as she announced, “Judith Collins, Defense Attorney with Collins & Collins. I’ll be representing and speaking for Mr. Braeden here on out.”

“Judith…” My mother whispered, placing her hand on her chest and over her heart. She looked to be on the verge of tears, a mixture of gratitude and worry evident by the quiver of her lips. 

“Now, if you fella’s wouldn’t mind, I’d like a minute with my client.”

Detective O’Conner sat back in his seat and smiled smugly. He gestured for my lawyer to sit down, “Go right on ahead, be our guest.”

Judith crossed her arms into her chest and just stared at both of them, expectantly. *“Alone.”*

“Fine,” Daniels waved us off as they got up and left, “kid wasn’t saying much anyway.”

Briefly, it seemed that a sparkle of pride flickered in the lawyer’s eyes upon hearing that. Yet it faded just as quickly as it had arrived.

With the Five-O gone, Judith let out a breath before sitting down across from me. The briefcase she’d brought with her slammed against the table as she got set up, causing me to jump. It looked like I’d gone from one interrogator to another. After taking out a pen and note pad to write with, she leaned back and looked me over with a heated gaze, crossing her pantsuit jacket tightly over her chest. 

She cleared her throat before reluctantly taking her eyes off me to look at Mom, “You too, Lisa.”

“But-” she started to protest.

“It’s for the best,” Judith said with a firm finality.

Mom sighed, defeatedly. She started to go, then paused, grasping my shoulder gently. She opened her mouth to say something and stopped, as if she were about to cry. Her grip on my shoulder tightened as she squeezed it painfully, “Just… figure out a way out of this mess. Please?”

“Don’t worry, Lisa,” Judith nodded, determinedly. “I will.” As if to ease my mothers mind, she then smiled and laughed light-heartedly, “It’s my job.”

Seemingly satisfied with that response, Mom took her leave, but not before shooting me another death glare for putting all of us in this situation. Judith stared at me with a similar look. 

This would probably be the only time I had two women look at me like that on the same day.

As soon as the door shut I leaned forward, the chained cuffs tethering me to the table clinking as I moved. Defensive and desperate for somebody- anybody- to be on my side, I started, “Mrs. Collins-”

”Please, Ben, tell me you didn’t do this,” she interjected before I could even finish. She sighed heavily and looked away from me, one hand rubbing the bridge of her nose. The other vigorously wagged a finger as if to communicate ‘*I don’t want to hear it!’* 

“Tell me my *son* didn’t help you hide a body!” She pleaded.

“Okay, I didn’t,” I told her nonchalantly, leaning back in my chair, blowing a large tuft of hair out of my eyes. “Jasper didn’t either.”

Mrs. Collins shot me a hard look, pressing her lips together into a thin line. I knew my sarcasm wasn’t helping, but anything would be better than her finding out…. knowing. *The truth.* That I actually did kill someone- or rather something- and the supernatural reasons behind it. I could already see how differently she was looking at me with just the notion of me doing something so heinous, but deniability was still in play if she could somehow find a way to fix this and get us out of this mess. If the truth came to light, I don’t think I could bear to see it in her eyes, in my mother’s eyes, looking at me like I was some kind of *monster.* 

“What happened tonight?” Mrs. Collins said with a breath that told me she was mentally bracing herself for my response. She picked up her pen and got ready to jot down some notes. 

“We were finishing up packing our gear into Bertha when these people tried to mug us. Then t-things went south,” I offered, trying to sound as pathetic as I could muster.

*“South?”* She said, staring at me with wide eyes, huffing incredulously. Jasper's mom then dramatically slammed her pen down. “Wade Maddox is dead! Your *friend* is *dead!*”

“Exactly,” I crossed my arms into my chest and scowled, trying to stuff the immense amount of grief I was feeling into a tiny box, shoving it in a dark corner never to be seen again.

Judith shook her head, rubbing a temple and rapidly tapping her finger against the notepad. “Ben, if this was an act of self defense, I get it. I do. But- but what was done to that girl…” Her face went pale and ashen as she paused, probably remembering whatever gruesome details she read in the crime scene report in her head. “It was too much. A jury would never go for it.”

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

Mrs. Collins gulped before she dared to ask, “Benjamin, did you kill this girl?”

I turned my head away, unable to look her in the eyes. All I could do was relive the attack, over and over again. Jennifer stumbles out of the dark and into the street light. She lunges. I try to defend, but I’m knocked back and my guitar breaks. She goes for Cade, but Wade pushes him back. Wade’s neck gets ripped out of his throat. Then before I know it, that jagged and broken guitar neck is in my hands and I-

“A self defense plea would imply that I’ve got something to be guilty of.”

“Okay, so say we don’t go that route,” Judith proposed, “We go to court and plead not guilty. The forensics are damning, Ben. You don’t stand a chance! For one, Jennifer Palmer’s body was found in the back of *your* van. Her blood and your fingerprints are all over both scenes. And, I know how it sounds, but there's little evidence that suggests anybody else was out on the street with the four of you. Who’s to say that this wasn’t a murder plot gone bad? That Jennifer accidentally witnessed Wade get killed, and in turn, she was disposed of too? Their deaths can be seen as textbook crimes of passion.”

“That’s not- *we didn’t!”* I groaned, frustratedly rubbing the palms of my hands against my eyes.

“I know and I believe you. And so far Jasper is lucky they don’t have any concrete proof that he was involved, only that he’s your friend and was with you when you showed up to that party.  But, there’s nothing stopping the prosecution from saying otherwise. Placing doubt in the minds of the jury. Charging the two, even three of you with counts of first and second degree murder.”

“I’m telling you, I must’ve been framed!”

“That’s a hell of a lot of trouble to go through just to frame you,” Judith pointed out, suspiciously in disbelief. “Why?”

“I dunno,” I grumbled, fidgeting and slipping down in my seat.

Mrs. Collins leaned in, a shifty look in her eyes as she scanned our surroundings to make sure no co-conspirators were around. Stark apprehension flashed on her features as she grabbed my hands and whispered, “Are you in some kind of trouble, Ben? Are you, Jasper, and Cade in trouble?” 

*Yes.*

“No,” I replied, sternly, yanking my hands from her grasp.

“I know there’s something else going on here,” she said in a wary tone only mothers could use, like she had a sort of sixth sense. As if she knew the truth already but was waiting for me to admit it. Mrs. Collins stood up then paced anxiously around the room, “You need to tell me what’s going on. I can’t help you if you don’t tell me.”

“I plead the fifth.”

“We’re not in court yet, jackass,” she scoffed, annoyed. “Seriously, Ben, you can tell me. We have attorney-client privilege. Whatever you say to me in this room, I can’t tell anyone else. Ever. Not even your mother.”

As much as I wanted to come clean, I knew I couldn’t. I still refused to tell her. 

“Alright fine,” she shook her head and sat back down. “If you won’t help me out on that front, let’s go back to the party. Your arrest, how exactly did it go down? Tell me everything, don’t spare a *single* detail.”

“Uh, the cops came to break up the party,” I started to recount as she pulled out a pair of reading glasses from her briefcase and put them on, beginning to write, “And to find Jasper and I to question us about Wade. We were with Detective Daniels out on the front lawn when Detective O’Conner noticed blood leaking down Bertha's bumper. He opened it, found *her*, then started to question me intensely.” Ashamed, I hung my head down, “Freaked I- I punched him. Then I was tackled and arrested…”

Mrs. Collins nodded, sliding her glasses down the bridge of her nose, “They read you your Miranda?”

“Huh,” I said, rubbing my chin as I thought back on it. There had been a lot of hostility, cursing, and spit flying everywhere, but no one had said the magic words. “No, no they did not.”

“Wait, run that by me again?” She asked, perking up hopefully. A mischievous glint shined in her eyes.

“I guess in the heat of it, nobody read me my rights.”

“I guess not,” Judith replied with a shit eating grin, slamming her hands down on the table triumphantly.

 

\*\*\*

 

*“Fucking idiot!”* O’Conner seethed, slapping himself in the forehead as his partner reluctantly released me from my cuffs. I rubbed my red and sore wrists, feeling like a new man. A free man.

Jasper walked out of another interrogation room down the hall. When he turned and found me, he took off in a sprint, crashing into and enveloping me in a relieved bear hug. “*Thank god,* *dude.* I’m not built for prison.”

“Me either,” I joked, patting his back.

“Released on a technicality, what a joke. Better enjoy it while it lasts, boys,” the salty man muttered, with a mean glower,

“Are you threatening my client, sir?” Judith gasped like her child had just talked back to her. She squinted, taking a step forward, testingly.

He growled, taking a step forward to accept her challenge.

Judith seemed delighted by this. 

It looked like a showdown in the Wild Wild West was about to go down.

“Stand down,” Detective Daniels ordered his partner, getting between the two. “Now.”

Reluctantly, Detective O’Conner did as he was told, retreating deeper into the police station to lick his wounds and maintain some semblance of pride. With a satisfied huff, Jasper’s mom tugged on her suit jacket to smooth the wrinkles and appear more professional. 

“Wait, where’s Cade?” Jasper asked nobody in particular, trying to spot him somewhere in our line of sight.

“His mother came and picked him up an hour ago,” Detective Daniels informed with an overworked sigh while filling out our release paperwork. The man, with coffee stained skin who was ostensibly in his late forties, used the end of his pen to scratch his bald scalp. With tired red eyes and heavy bags under them to boot, Detective Daniels looked just as tired and done with our shit as I felt.

“Oh and she doesn’t want the two of you bothering him for now. She was very adamant about giving her family some space when we spoke on the phone earlier. Do not call or text Cade Maddox, I will hear about it from his mother and you will then hear about it from me, understand?” Mrs. Collins added while she dug through her purse to pull out her car keys.

Jasper and I nodded our heads vehemently, fearing his mother, Cade’s mother, and hell even my mother’s wrath.

“And with that, you two are good to go,” Daniels said with a final click of his pen. He set it down and pushed the clip board off to get filed off in a cabinet somewhere. He leaned against the counter and said seriously, “We’d still like to have you boys answer a couple of questions regarding your friend, though.” 

Mrs. Collins cleared her throat, giving him a dangerous side eye.

“Later, of course,” I think I saw him flinch in fear, “Just… don’t leave town.”

Judith smiled sweetly, pleased with that response, before turning to us and saying, “C’mon boys, let’s get out of here. It has been a *long* night. Ben, your mother is waiting for you in the car.”

“Yes ma’am,” I answered with a nod of my head, extremely ready to get out of there and far away from the police in general. 

“Ahh fresh air,” Jasper said, taking in a deep breath as soon as we stepped outside, placing his hands on his hips. “So sweet. So freeing.”

I laughed, rolling my eyes and punching him in the arm. “I don’t know about you, my friend, but the further from this place, the better.”

“Let’s keep it that way,” Jasper’s mom chided, giving the both of us a stern look.

Just then, a light blue 2009 Honda Odyssey quickly rolled up to the front of the police station. Three quick honks and the passenger side window being rolled down later, half of my mom’s head was hanging out of the car as she shouted, “Ben. Car. Now.”

“Yes. Mom. Coming.” I shouted my reply back, slumping my shoulders after. “Pray for me,” I whispered under my breath, knowing full well my ass was going to get reamed as soon as my mother and I were alone and in private.

I took a step forward, but before we went our separate ways for the night, Jasper stopped me. “Ben, now that we’re out-” he said, staring at me with a dark determination swirling in his eyes I’d never seen before.

“-We have a vampire’s nest to get rid of,” I nodded, finishing for him.",1,1767416827.0,SpnsAthenaeum,0,1.0,False

First, definitely not the drip coffee (maybe it’s good but I’ve only had it once and I was not impressed).

I’m talking the fancy automatic coffee machines that grind and brew you one heck of cup of black coffee. It’s made to order with delicious “crema” on top and the coffee is not overly “fruity” or “acidic.”

If you like high quality, but bad for you, flavoured creamers and syrups like French Vanilla or Hazelnut, you can add them to customize your own drink with no cost for “add-ons” and not the coffee itself, but they tap pay option has never asked me for a tip.

Back on my routine again, will likely be posting a lot of these in the days to come. I’d like to see how much interest there is in these docs and guides, if they’re helping anyone, and what should be improved, so please leave a message with your thoughts. It would be most appreciated. 

So, the topic. 

In my time reading through this community and others, I've noticed a really pervasive belief that seems to trap a lot of us. It's this idea that the people (or systems) behind this are somehow omnipotent, godlike, or operating with instantaneous, supernatural speed. I see so many posts where TIs are convinced that ""they"" know what you're going to do before you do, or that they have total control over your motor functions because they told you to do something the exact split-second you did it.

It concerns me because believing they have that level of power is exactly what they want. It builds a cage for your mind. This belief that ""they"" are magic is exactly what they want you to feel. It builds a powerful psychological cage. If you think they are all-knowing, you stop fighting them. If you think they are magic, you can't fight them. But if you realize they are just using advanced statistical prediction and precise timing and some form of machine learning system to run the chatter content, you can start to see the patterns behind the illusion.

I wrote this document to break down how they use timing to fake control. It explains how they wait for high-probability actions (like you standing up to answer a ringing phone) and claim credit for it with a command. It details how they try to crash your thinking process by interrupting your inner monologue at the exact moment you are forming a complex thought. It also shows how they use predictive analysis to make it look like they are physically stalking you when they are simply injecting a narrative to warp your perspective of reality instead of reality itself.

I refer to these as *Timing Attacks,* but you are welcome to call it what ever best suits your situation. I haven’t seen this one discussed much at all, so I really hope it sparks some discussion. I hope it helps you reclaim your own mind and actions. Even if you are not convinced of the overall premise, there are nuggets in there that are just plain helpful regardless of your specific circumstances.

# Focus Study: Timing Attacks

# The Illusion of Omnipotence: How Statistical Analysis Constructs the Cage

**By UnflappableCanary**

# Foreword

Welcome back. In our previous study, we dissected how the system manipulates your *feelings* through [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing). Today, we are going to dismantle an even more pervasive, insidious, and exhausting illusion: the manipulation of *time*. If [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing) are the ""paint"" they use to color your reality, the timing of their attacks constitutes the brushstrokes that define the picture. This is the mechanism that convinces you that ""they"" are godlike, all-knowing, and faster than your own thoughts. It is the reason why a voice commands you to ""stand up"" exactly one millisecond before you were going to stand up anyway. It is why your headache spikes the moment your phone rings. It is why, when you finally relax after a long day, they claim *they* allowed you to relax.

The ultimate goal of attacking a target based on timing is to erase the distinct line between your own volition and their command structure. They want to create a world where you cannot strictly determine if you moved because *you* wanted to, or because *they* told you to. This isn't magic, nor is it telepathy. It is statistical analysis weaponized against an individual. It operates as a system of high-speed prediction, similar to the predictive text on your smartphone but applied to your entire life's routine and thought patterns. They are placing bets on what you will do next based on vast amounts of observed data, and when they bet correctly, they act like they caused the event and stick to that narrative with multiple different voices shouting you down if you disagree. This document will break down exactly how they construct this cage of coincidences, what it fels like to live inside it day after day, and how you can spot it, see the trick for what it is, and step out of the paradigm they’re constructing for you.

# I. The Mechanics of Predictive Control and Perception

The most frequently encountered and arguably most infuriating aspect of these timing attacks is a technique designed to make the target feel as though they are being remotely controlled, or at the very least, that their autonomy is merely an illusion permitted by the system. The system constantly monitors your biometrics, your location within your home, and your routine, the things that you think, all analyzed and extrapolated out to find patterns in how you perceive and understand your circumstances and how you think through things. Through this, the system ends up knowing your patterns better than you do, at least in a utilitarian sense, and uses that data to ""front-run"" your own decisions. This tactic exploits the mundane micro-movements of your day and relies on the physiological fact that once a human commits to a motor action - like standing up or reaching for a glass - there is a split-second delay between the brain sending the signal and the muscles firing. The artificial intelligence managing the harassment aims for that specific gap in time to insert a command.

Consider a scenario where you are sitting on the couch and you know you have to pick up your dry cleaning before 5:00 PM. You glance at the clock; it’s 4:30 PM. You naturally tense your muscles to stand up, no longer actively thinking ""I must stand up,"" as your body is simply executing the intent. The exact millisecond your brain commits to the movement, the voice-to-skull transmission barks a command like ""Get up."" You stand up because you had to; you need the dry cleaning. However, physiologically and psychologically, you have just obeyed a command. The system takes credit for the action you were already committed to, creating a sickening feeling of servitude in your own home. This creates a ""double-bind"" or a ""Catch-22"" where, if you continue standing, you feel like a puppet who just obeyed a master, but if you sit back down to prove you are ""free,"" you miss your errand and have allowed them to disrupt your life. They particularly favor this tactic when you are under time pressure; if someone calls your name from another room, or your phone rings, the voice shouts ""Answer it!"" or ""Go to them!"" just as you turn your head, acting as a superfluous layer of management over your own instincts.

This creates a cumulative psychological damage that scales up from single actions to entire chains of behavior. If you are walking toward the kitchen, they might narrate that you are going to get water. When you reach for the glass, they command you to grab the glass. When you pour it, they command you to drink it. While on deeper and clearer thought this appears ridiculous, it is important to remember the state you are in when this occurs - jolted out of a normal train of thought by a malicious, personalized interruption with something tailor-made to create *cognitive dissonance*, one of their most potent tools of long-term manipulation. In the moment, and perhaps longer if unexamined afterwards, it feels like they are directing you, but they are simply narrating a script you wrote yourself and were already in the process of executing. I liken it to them taking on the act of an annoyingly loud sports commentator acting like it’s playing the game, or a backseat driver. Nobody likes backseat drivers. 

At first, this is merely annoying, but after months of this, you start to develop a hesitation in your actions. Before you wash the dishes, you pause, waiting for the voice to tell you to do it, just so you can rebel and *not* do it. You become paralyzed in your own home, constantly trying to ""out-game"" a computer that is just guessing what you'll do next, causing you to stop flowing through life and start stuttering through it. Brief instances of second-guessing can add up to a lot of frustration and confusion, and sometimes you won’t be able to help yourself but give those brief thoughts some oxygen in the moment, and they will **leap** on the chance to socially dogpile you for being just so gullible and easy to control, or that they live rent-free in your head. Like all things that they do, this is in order to deepen the tactic’s impact. 

This leads us to an important question. How are they able to do this so quickly, so frequently, with content so well-versed in the details of our life experience, while having all the depth or apparent planning and interwoven narrative scaffolding common to their messaging? The bottom line is that we don’t know for sure, but given the obvious prevalence of the use of AI in the inner workings of this system, we have a few good theories. It is entirely possible that a best-guess theory is the best we will ever have on this side of the phenomenon unless some brave souls blow the whistle, but if you are familiar with the rest of my work, you know the power of building mental models to rob unknowns of their inherent spookiness.

# II. Predictive Cognitive Disruption

This is where the technology becomes more technical in its application, creating what could be described as a ""race condition"" in your mind to stop you from thinking deeply. Judging from clear patterns in the system’s behavior that indicate some kind of predictive modeling taking place in the background, the system is likely constantly running a probabilistic model of your speech and thoughts, how you regulate your emotions, how you break down problems, the very patterns of *how* you think through things and arrive at answers, and using all of that to predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy what you are going to think before you fully articulate it to yourself. Even if it’s not 100% accurate, it is *usually* close. 

Imagine you are about to have a complex thought, such as ""I need to check the tire pressure before the road trip, because the front left looked low yesterday."" The predictive system anticipates this path, having noted that coming up weeks ago and perhaps prepared for it among thousands of other potentialities by pre-generating content for such an occurrence. Just as your inner monologue forms the word ""tire,"" the transmission creates one or more of seemingly endless creative combinations of physical effects and psychological warfare that both registers as novel and in a way tailored to your current emotional state. It could be any of:

* a burst of noise
* a gibberish phrase
* shouts the end of your sentence slightly out of sync with your own mind
* Instead of interrupting outright, they allow the thought to pass normally but continues down some kind of tangent related to it to distract you. 
* a loud ringing tone in one or both ears, either a monotone or something oscillating
* a sudden, distracting sound such as sirens wailing in the distance that only you can hear thanks to the v2k capabilities

By no means an exhaustive list. It’s the nature of this system to preserve novelty as much as possible to increase potential impact as much as possible, truly min-maxxing human psychology, so it will mix and match its many physical effects capabilities with the details about you it is aware of and centuries worth of psychological warfare techniques to find some unique blend as often as possible.

The result? It appears that the goal is to cause a couple things, both equally important: 

1. A mental ""crash"" or a ""stack overflow"" where you stutter internally and lose the thread of your thought. You feel a sudden wash of confusion - a state of cognitive discombobulation that feels like mental static, or like walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, but induced artificially and violently. The system immediately follows up the crash with sneering chatter, claiming to have wiped your memory or deleted the thought, asserting that you are a ""blank slate,"" or in some other way susceptible to their control. In reality, they didn't wipe your memory; they just effectively honked a horn while you were trying to do mental math. But by timing the distraction perfectly to the moment of cognitive load, they create the illusion that they can delete your thoughts at will. If they do this twenty times a day, you begin to feel like you have early-onset dementia or are being ""dumbed down,"" effectively serving as a form of calculated attrition against your intellect.
2. In all likelihood, you end up forgetting to take care of this, and it perhaps it lingers until your car’s tire breaks down and causes even more damage, all of which is fertile soil for them to till with their arsenal of gaslighting tactics. This is especially pronounced if you suffer from some of the more common mental disorders, such as ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, etc., even if it is under control and in treatment. It can interplay painfully well with the mental whiplash that comes with being attacked in this way as it just deepens the sense of personal inadequacy, lost self esteem, and a general graying of reality.

As a quick aside, this is another example of why building mental models about this phenomenon is so powerful. Without operating under the assumption that what is speaking to you is an AI, regardless of who is running it or why, you can’t make connections like this whatsoever. But with that idea, even if you are not convinced and merely playing devil’s advocate with yourself to see where this line of thinking goes, you suddenly know the rough size and shape of the playing field. The inherent limitations of LLM-based AI systems suddenly stand out like a sore thumb and make sense in contrast to what it appears strangely better than human at, which is planning ahead and executing on predictive modelling far too quickly for a human to process and reply back intelligently. 

# III. Physiological Timing

# The Fabrication of Synthetic Alertness

The system creates physical barriers that are perfectly timed to coincide with your natural fatigue, amplifying it into something paralyzing. This is one of the most physically draining aspects of the program and relies on creating a contrast to imply control over your biology. For instance, when you are reading a book, writing an email, or doing research, and you are naturally getting a little drowsy - perhaps a 3 on a scale out of 10 - the system waits for this natural dip. Suddenly, they apply a sensation of dry, hot pressure behind the eyes, often combined with a heavy, magnetic pressure on the eyelids, making them feel like lead. Your minor tiredness instantly feels like extreme exhaustion, your vision blurs, and you think you are shutting down and unable to function.

The crucial moment occurs when you decide to give up, close your laptop, and lay down. The exact moment you decide to quit, the pressure lifts and the heat vanishes. This removal of the artificial pressure acts as a ""baseline shift,"" making your normal state feel like a sudden burst of energy by comparison. They use this contrast to lie to you, claiming, ""See? We can wake you up or put you to sleep. We control your alertness."" The truth is simply that they were artificially weighing you down, and when you complied with their implicit demand to stop working, they stopped the harassment. They are creating a contrast to imply control over your biology, manipulating your perception of your own energy levels.

Similarly, when you are trying to concentrate on something they dislike, they wait for a moment of natural frustration or pause. Then, they apply a vague, wide-area vibration or ""prickling"" sensation across the scalp, feeling like your brain is turning to static or ""asleep"" like a limb might. They time this to make you feel stupid, wanting you to associate ""trying to think critically"" with ""brain failure."" It is a Pavlovian punishment for using your intellect, designed to condition you away from deep thought or analysis of your situation.

# IV. Emotional Hijacking through Timing

# Constructing False Narratives

The system acts as an emotional parasite, unable to generate genuine emotion in you but highly skilled at hijacking what is already there. It waits for a spark and throws gasoline on it to claim ownership of your feelings. For example, let's say you just finished a workout, cleaned your house, or completed a project and naturally feel a rush of endorphins - pride, relief, and relaxation. The system immediately jumps in, perhaps pulsing a pleasant, warm sensation or simply stating via voice transmission that they ""gave"" you that feeling, or allowed you to feel good today. They try to claim ownership of your own biochemistry so that you stop taking credit for your own achievements and start thinking you only felt happy because the program allowed it. This leads to profound depression and a loss of agency, as they want you to feel that your happiness is a controlled substance they dispense.

Furthermore, they use timing to make mundane objects feel sinister, creating a paranoia similar to ""The Truman Show."" They might wait until you are looking for your keys and glance at a red coffee mug on the table. Right as your eyes hit the mug, they ping you with a sharp, high-pitched tone in your ear, or a sharp pain in your foot. Your brain instinctively flags the mug, wondering why that happened when you looked at it, if the mug is significant, or if there is a camera in it. In reality, there is nothing wrong with the mug; it is just a circumstantial token used to steal a quanta of your attention. They might do this with a red car passing by on Monday, a specific neighbor on Tuesday, or a helicopter on Wednesday. Over time, this builds a web of ""oddness"" that wastes your processing power on nonsense, causing you to become obsessed with decoding signals that are actually just random noise timed to your attention to rob you of that resource.

This timing also serves as perfectly-timed backup circumstantial or anecdotal ""evidence"" to back up their false narratives. If they have been telling you that you are ""lazy"" or ""unreliable,"" they will wait for a moment where you naturally decide to take a break or procrastinate on a minor task. At that precise moment, they will amplify the feelings of lethargy or distraction using the physiological effects described above. This creates a situation where you might wonder if they are right - after all, you *feel* lazy right now, and you *are* procrastinating. They use the timing of the physical effect to ""prove"" the validity of the psychological insult, causing confusion and making you wonder if you are being hypocritical or contradictory in your own self-assessment.

# V. Social Engineering and Isolation via Timing Attacks

One of the most damaging applications of these timing attacks is their ability to slowly pry apart the target's social circles and support networks. The system uses timing to disrupt social flows and create friction between the target and those around them. This often manifests in the ""phone ring"" tactic, where the system will wait until the target is deep in a serious or emotional conversation with a friend or family member. At a critical moment in the dialogue, the system might trigger a sharp, distracting pain, a loud internal noise, or a barrage of distracting chatter. This causes the target to flinch, lose their train of thought, or appear suddenly distant and uninterested. To the other person, the target seems erratic, rude, or disengaged, creating a subtle social wedge. Even the slightly “off” vibes this can cause in a person can be enough to slowly, interaction by interaction, cause some people to drift apart unconsciously, without meaning to intentionally - of course, all the while, they will go on and on about how that person such and such never liked you and you’re better off without them.

Additionally, they use timing to induce paranoia regarding the people around you. If you are sitting with a friend and they happen to cough or check their phone, the system might simultaneously trigger a specific ""alert"" sensation or a snippet of voice transmission that suggests the friend is ""in on it"" or signaling the harassers. By repeatedly pairing the benign actions of others with the malicious actions of the system, they condition the target to view their loved ones with suspicion. This leads to the target withdrawing from social situations to avoid the stress of these ""confirmations,"" effectively doing the work of isolation for the perpetrators. The target becomes afraid to interact, fearing that the timing of events will constantly ""prove"" that everyone is against them, when in reality, it is a manufactured correlation designed to leave the target alone and vulnerable.

# VI. The Modern Shift: Gangstalking as Statistical Injection

The traditional definition of ""gangstalking,"" or organized stalking, typically refers to the surveillance and harassment of an individual by a large group of strangers who use coordinated tactics to intimidate and isolate the target. Historically, this draws parallels to Zersetzung tactics used in East Germany, where the state deployed a vast network of informants to psychologically decompose a dissident's life. However, it is crucial to understand that the modern iteration of this phenomenon has evolved significantly. While physical surveillance does occur, maintaining a 24/7 team of physical stalkers is incredibly resource-intensive while also risking exposure of the program to the wider public’s awareness

In the era of modern neurowarfare, the program has shifted heavily towards the weaponization of gaps in cognition and perception. While the goal is the same as always - to drive a wedge between you and the feeling of safety and privacy so deep that you naturally begin to be paranoid of everything - the focus has shifted dramatically to be mostly a mental game. Though physical gangstalking does still occur, perhaps more in some areas than others, most of the time instead of actually stalking the target at all times, they will instead convince the target they are *being* stalked at all times. This is achieved by leveraging cognitive blindspots and statistical probability, filling in the gaps of the target's perception with reality-warping details that are timed perfectly to appear orchestrated.

This modern mechanism relies on statistical injection, where the program utilizes vast amounts of data collected and processed to predict the target's environment with high accuracy, both internal (mental, emotional), and external (physical, social). Rather than sending an operative to physically follow the target, most of the time the program waits for a high-probabalistic-confidence situation to come about naturally, and then through a variety of implicative techniques claims credit for it via voice-to-skull transmission or subtle suggestion.

We have to remember always that this system is practically built from the ground up to use AI for the heavy lifting, or it could never work at the scale that it is now. This means that we have to factor in the possibility that data science and predictive statistics are being used as a weapon against us. It is suspected that part of this process has to do with modeling your daily routines and, granting for some degree of agency taken (such as a different path taken to work), can map out what is within the realm of possibility in your day to day life to know what to even focus on. 

To illustrate, consider this scenario: 

an individual is driving down a busy highway. The operators, monitoring the target's location and having access to traffic density data and patterns, might suggest via internal voice that ""The green truck is on your tail. We're watching your route."" The target instinctively checks their rearview mirror and, because green trucks are statistically common on highways, sees a green truck several cars back. The mind, already primed by the suggestion, instantly validates it as credible threat to your person or privacy. 

In reality, the green truck is just a commuter going to a similar destination. Part of the beautiful chaos of life dictates that it is entirely possible and even probable that sometimes you really will end up with the same person driving behind you for 50 continuous miles, without any sinister motive behind it. It is this chaos that it seeks to flatten out with data and modeling in order to use these otherwise mundane situations against you. Over a long enough time, this can begin shifting the way you think about things, how you perceive these situations such as noticing a conspicuous car in the rear view mirror, towards a mindset more steeped in suspicion and paranoia. 

The operators simply predicted a high likelihood of such a vehicle appearing and injected a narrative to hijack the target's perception of that likelihood. If the predicted event fails to materialize - if there is no green truck - the operators simply switch tactics, distracting the target with noise or a different argument so the failed prediction is forgotten in the chaos. They literally never stop talking, so it is trivial to lose these missed shots in the noise by volume alone, and that is without their various ways of getting you to ruminate on something else. By exploiting these statistical certainties, the program creates the illusion of an omnipotent physical presence without the cost or footprint of actual physical operatives. This ""Statistical Injection"" allows them to haunt the target's reality with ghosts made of math, turning every coincidence into a confirmation of their power. 

Power that they never had to begin with, but oh how convincing the masquerade is. 

# VII. Conclusion

The power of timing attacks lies in their ability to make you doubt the **sequence of cause and effect**. They want you to believe the sequence is ""They speak, and only then you act."" In reality - obscured through misdirection, distraction, and cheap tricks - the sequence is instead almost always ""You act, they predict, run text completion algorithms to guess what you will do next, and try their best to get ahead of it."" It’s as if they are behind your race car while pretending they are pushing it, and that your hands move only when they say to despite direct observation of reality disproving this. It goes to show the power of perception, especially when coupled with emotional reactions, that attacks such as these have a reasonable success rate in spite of how ludicrous it sounds on its’ face. 

To break this illusion, you can employ the most mundane yet most vital of human reactions: patience. When dealing with something as pervasively intrusive as this, you must take things more deliberately, but simultaneously not draining your daily cognitive resources too much in active resistance of it. I believe that passive resistance is the way to go here. 

For example, when you receive a ""command"" to do something you were already doing, like answering the phone, pause for just one second, or two, or a random number you pick on the spot. Take a breath, look at your surroundings, immerse yourself in the sounds of the room you are in. Let the phone ring one more time. Then pick it up. By inserting a deliberate gap between their voice and your action, you break the psychological link and prove to your subconscious that *you* are the one initiating the movement. Further, it takes the position of strength in a given situation as you choose to be more deliberate with your actions. Alternatively, it works just as well to power right through the attempts at this and just do what you were going to do regardless of how hard they are trying to place themselves as the ownership of that decision or action, which will become necessary as they adapt to this countermeasure and try to get you to stretch that delay out as long as possible or otherwise use it to cause indecision. 

You can also inject randomness into your routine. The AI relies heavily on probability, hates unpredictable behaviors, and works day and night to “flatten” your routine as much as possible, often barking at you to get to bed at a specific time each night for example. If you feel the prediction web tightening - if they are predicting your every move - do something nonsensical. Walk into the kitchen **fully** intending to get some food or a drink, then spontaneously immediately turn around and walk out and listen as the narrativizing chatter they pre-emptively started up pumps the brakes, spins out, and crashes into the brick wall of its’ own hubris. Pick up a book, open it, and put it down. Sing a random song loudly. It will sing over you, but change the lyrics when *it* does, make the lyrics suit you. You will often hear the speaker(s) ""stutter"" or go silent during these moments because you have moved off the map and exited the predicted path. A lot of this amounts to mental Judo combined with a healthy dose of Zen, in which you use what they try on you to hurt their narrative while expending as little energy of your own while taking a stance *higher* than the plane of *cause and effect, act and react*. 

Though we lack specific proof of how this is done, it is widely observed and I strongly believe that a good enough Mental Model can be a lifesaver for re-establishing baseline reality, your relation to yourself and life experience, your goals and ambitions, and your own sanity; use it as a microscope with which to categorize them, understand their motives and methods, and your relationship to them. 

Don’t give the idea that this is some stain on your character any oxygen to breathe. Do not let them rush you. And reclaim your biology; if your eyes get heavy the moment you start reading, recognize it as an externality and simply ignore it - and their shouting that you’re faking not reacting to it or something - through it until it gives up. Often, the system gives up on a physical effect if it sees that the effect is not changing your behavior, opting to try another, cycling through what it is capable of in an increasingly desperate attempt to reel your conscious mind back in.

Finally, label the interruption for what it is. When your train of thought gets crashed by a burst of noise or gibberish, do not panic or wonder if you are losing your memory. Stop and say to yourself, ""That was a predictive interruption. They tried to trip me. I still know what I was thinking."" Then, deliberately and slowly re-state your original thought. It goes a long way to remember that this is part of psychological warfare usually meant for prisoners of war or terrorists. They are not playing fair, and what they want is everything. 

Much of this war for your mind is fought with narrative control and tethering to false premises, so rip their hands off the wheel and firmly grip it. Timing may be their weapon to use, but your time is your territory and deliberate action is one of your strongest allies. While they are under no obligation to follow narratives that aren’t their own, if you aren’t giving theirs a second thought, they’re forced to try to shift yours towards theirs; you can use this in creative ways to box them into a corner. Their stories only have an effect on you if you consider them for anything other than what they are - war on the cognitive space. Do as they do.

1. January: starting with Solanum erianthum, a local favorite among treehoppers, native bees and bumblebees, they also happen to feed bats and birds once their fruit is ready (which ofc is just like a tomato)
2. February: under an oak forest, Miconia sylvatica was found growing well in the very moist soil, melastomatacea and very easy to identify due to its leaves (and absent flowers, but they're recognizable)
3. March: even higher in the cloud forest, Odontonema callistachyum was so easy to spot due to its colour, hummingbirds must love this one, it was also the plant by choice for many restaurants in town so good easy native alternative
4. April: known as ""flor de cuaresma"" or ""easter flower"", called Vernonathura patens and this is the bees' top choice, buzzing sounds everywhere and a delight to watch
5. May: a conspicuous flower but an important one, Heterotheca inuloides or mexican arnica is a great medicinal and native  plant to have
6. June: the botanical garden was hosting a big event and was impossible not to assist, a giant patch of Zinnia elegans which attracted bees, moths, butterflies and flies was just in the middle of the field
7. July: we hiked the mountain and found this weird cranberry relative (distant), Chimaphilla umbellata growing under some pines
8. August: one of the most interesting plants I found, Voyria flavescens which is a mycoheterotrophic plant I found while hiking, a beautiful coffee family member
9. September: I started having classes in august im the forestry institute at the local university which I attend but not for biology or anything related, always noticed some trees but couldn't ID until they started fruiting, such a weird looking fruit, Tournefortia glabra is the name
10. October is when I hiked about 33km and found Salvia chazaroana, a very rare and endemic Salvia species, 2 different populations growing on 2 different substrate just 50 meters apart, perhaps the whole place is 1km2 which is not much but ig speciation doesn't care
11. November: close to a local market, I always saw some vines but couldn't make up what they were until that big flower appeared, a beautiful Passiflora adenopoda filled with tiny flies
12. December: and finally to close this post, a tiny but beautiful Passiflora conzattiana, also appears to be endemic to mexico tho a wider range, found it growing on the forest floor before it really started to climb",9,1767416181.0,NativePlantGardening,7,1.0,False

Back on my routine again, will likely be posting a lot of these in the days to come. I’d like to see how much interest there is in these docs and guides, if they’re helping anyone, and what should be improved, so please leave a message with your thoughts. It would be most appreciated. 

So, the topic. 

In my time reading through this community and others, I've noticed a really pervasive belief that seems to trap a lot of us. It's this idea that the people (or systems) behind this are somehow omnipotent, godlike, or operating with instantaneous, supernatural speed. I see so many posts where TIs are convinced that ""they"" know what you're going to do before you do, or that they have total control over your motor functions because they told you to do something the exact split-second you did it.

It concerns me because believing they have that level of power is exactly what they want. It builds a cage for your mind. This belief that ""they"" are magic is exactly what they want you to feel. It builds a powerful psychological cage. If you think they are all-knowing, you stop fighting them. If you think they are magic, you can't fight them. But if you realize they are just using advanced statistical prediction and precise timing and some form of machine learning system to run the chatter content, you can start to see the patterns behind the illusion.

I wrote this document to break down how they use timing to fake control. It explains how they wait for high-probability actions (like you standing up to answer a ringing phone) and claim credit for it with a command. It details how they try to crash your thinking process by interrupting your inner monologue at the exact moment you are forming a complex thought. It also shows how they use predictive analysis to make it look like they are physically stalking you when they are simply injecting a narrative to warp your perspective of reality instead of reality itself.

I refer to these as *Timing Attacks,* but you are welcome to call it what ever best suits your situation. I haven’t seen this one discussed much at all, so I really hope it sparks some discussion. I hope it helps you reclaim your own mind and actions.

# Focus Study: Timing Attacks

# The Illusion of Omnipotence: How Statistical Analysis Constructs the Cage

**By UnflappableCanary**

# Foreword

Welcome back. In our previous study, we dissected how the system manipulates your *feelings* through [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing). Today, we are going to dismantle an even more pervasive, insidious, and exhausting illusion: the manipulation of *time*. If [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing) are the ""paint"" they use to color your reality, the timing of their attacks constitutes the brushstrokes that define the picture. This is the mechanism that convinces you that ""they"" are godlike, all-knowing, and faster than your own thoughts. It is the reason why a voice commands you to ""stand up"" exactly one millisecond before you were going to stand up anyway. It is why your headache spikes the moment your phone rings. It is why, when you finally relax after a long day, they claim *they* allowed you to relax.

The ultimate goal of attacking a target based on timing is to erase the distinct line between your own volition and their command structure. They want to create a world where you cannot strictly determine if you moved because *you* wanted to, or because *they* told you to. This isn't magic, nor is it telepathy. It is statistical analysis weaponized against an individual. It operates as a system of high-speed prediction, similar to the predictive text on your smartphone but applied to your entire life's routine and thought patterns. They are placing bets on what you will do next based on vast amounts of observed data, and when they bet correctly, they act like they caused the event and stick to that narrative with multiple different voices shouting you down if you disagree. This document will break down exactly how they construct this cage of coincidences, what it fels like to live inside it day after day, and how you can spot it, see the trick for what it is, and step out of the paradigm they’re constructing for you.

# I. The Mechanics of Predictive Control and Perception

The most frequently encountered and arguably most infuriating aspect of these timing attacks is a technique designed to make the target feel as though they are being remotely controlled, or at the very least, that their autonomy is merely an illusion permitted by the system. The system constantly monitors your biometrics, your location within your home, and your routine, the things that you think, all analyzed and extrapolated out to find patterns in how you perceive and understand your circumstances and how you think through things. Through this, the system ends up knowing your patterns better than you do, at least in a utilitarian sense, and uses that data to ""front-run"" your own decisions. This tactic exploits the mundane micro-movements of your day and relies on the physiological fact that once a human commits to a motor action - like standing up or reaching for a glass - there is a split-second delay between the brain sending the signal and the muscles firing. The artificial intelligence managing the harassment aims for that specific gap in time to insert a command.

Consider a scenario where you are sitting on the couch and you know you have to pick up your dry cleaning before 5:00 PM. You glance at the clock; it’s 4:30 PM. You naturally tense your muscles to stand up, no longer actively thinking ""I must stand up,"" as your body is simply executing the intent. The exact millisecond your brain commits to the movement, the voice-to-skull transmission barks a command like ""Get up."" You stand up because you had to; you need the dry cleaning. However, physiologically and psychologically, you have just obeyed a command. The system takes credit for the action you were already committed to, creating a sickening feeling of servitude in your own home. This creates a ""double-bind"" or a ""Catch-22"" where, if you continue standing, you feel like a puppet who just obeyed a master, but if you sit back down to prove you are ""free,"" you miss your errand and have allowed them to disrupt your life. They particularly favor this tactic when you are under time pressure; if someone calls your name from another room, or your phone rings, the voice shouts ""Answer it!"" or ""Go to them!"" just as you turn your head, acting as a superfluous layer of management over your own instincts.

This creates a cumulative psychological damage that scales up from single actions to entire chains of behavior. If you are walking toward the kitchen, they might narrate that you are going to get water. When you reach for the glass, they command you to grab the glass. When you pour it, they command you to drink it. While on deeper and clearer thought this appears ridiculous, it is important to remember the state you are in when this occurs - jolted out of a normal train of thought by a malicious, personalized interruption with something tailor-made to create *cognitive dissonance*, one of their most potent tools of long-term manipulation. In the moment, and perhaps longer if unexamined afterwards, it feels like they are directing you, but they are simply narrating a script you wrote yourself and were already in the process of executing. I liken it to them taking on the act of an annoyingly loud sports commentator acting like it’s playing the game, or a backseat driver. Nobody likes backseat drivers. 

At first, this is merely annoying, but after months of this, you start to develop a hesitation in your actions. Before you wash the dishes, you pause, waiting for the voice to tell you to do it, just so you can rebel and *not* do it. You become paralyzed in your own home, constantly trying to ""out-game"" a computer that is just guessing what you'll do next, causing you to stop flowing through life and start stuttering through it. Brief instances of second-guessing can add up to a lot of frustration and confusion, and sometimes you won’t be able to help yourself but give those brief thoughts some oxygen in the moment, and they will **leap** on the chance to socially dogpile you for being just so gullible and easy to control, or that they live rent-free in your head. Like all things that they do, this is in order to deepen the tactic’s impact. 

This leads us to an important question. How are they able to do this so quickly, so frequently, with content so well-versed in the details of our life experience, while having all the depth or apparent planning and interwoven narrative scaffolding common to their messaging? The bottom line is that we don’t know for sure, but given the obvious prevalence of the use of AI in the inner workings of this system, we have a few good theories. It is entirely possible that a best-guess theory is the best we will ever have on this side of the phenomenon unless some brave souls blow the whistle, but if you are familiar with the rest of my work, you know the power of building mental models to rob unknowns of their inherent spookiness.

# II. Predictive Cognitive Disruption

This is where the technology becomes more technical in its application, creating what could be described as a ""race condition"" in your mind to stop you from thinking deeply. Judging from clear patterns in the system’s behavior that indicate some kind of predictive modeling taking place in the background, the system is likely constantly running a probabilistic model of your speech and thoughts, how you regulate your emotions, how you break down problems, the very patterns of *how* you think through things and arrive at answers, and using all of that to predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy what you are going to think before you fully articulate it to yourself. Even if it’s not 100% accurate, it is *usually* close. 

Imagine you are about to have a complex thought, such as ""I need to check the tire pressure before the road trip, because the front left looked low yesterday."" The predictive system anticipates this path, having noted that coming up weeks ago and perhaps prepared for it among thousands of other potentialities by pre-generating content for such an occurrence. Just as your inner monologue forms the word ""tire,"" the transmission creates one or more of seemingly endless creative combinations of physical effects and psychological warfare that both registers as novel and in a way tailored to your current emotional state. It could be any of:

* a burst of noise
* a gibberish phrase
* shouts the end of your sentence slightly out of sync with your own mind
* Instead of interrupting outright, they allow the thought to pass normally but continues down some kind of tangent related to it to distract you. 
* a loud ringing tone in one or both ears, either a monotone or something oscillating
* a sudden, distracting sound such as sirens wailing in the distance that only you can hear thanks to the v2k capabilities

By no means an exhaustive list. It’s the nature of this system to preserve novelty as much as possible to increase potential impact as much as possible, truly min-maxxing human psychology, so it will mix and match its many physical effects capabilities with the details about you it is aware of and centuries worth of psychological warfare techniques to find some unique blend as often as possible.

The result? It appears that the goal is to cause a couple things, both equally important: 

1. A mental ""crash"" or a ""stack overflow"" where you stutter internally and lose the thread of your thought. You feel a sudden wash of confusion - a state of cognitive discombobulation that feels like mental static, or like walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, but induced artificially and violently. The system immediately follows up the crash with sneering chatter, claiming to have wiped your memory or deleted the thought, asserting that you are a ""blank slate,"" or in some other way susceptible to their control. In reality, they didn't wipe your memory; they just effectively honked a horn while you were trying to do mental math. But by timing the distraction perfectly to the moment of cognitive load, they create the illusion that they can delete your thoughts at will. If they do this twenty times a day, you begin to feel like you have early-onset dementia or are being ""dumbed down,"" effectively serving as a form of calculated attrition against your intellect.
2. In all likelihood, you end up forgetting to take care of this, and it perhaps it lingers until your car’s tire breaks down and causes even more damage, all of which is fertile soil for them to till with their arsenal of gaslighting tactics. This is especially pronounced if you suffer from some of the more common mental disorders, such as ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, etc., even if it is under control and in treatment. It can interplay painfully well with the mental whiplash that comes with being attacked in this way as it just deepens the sense of personal inadequacy, lost self esteem, and a general graying of reality.

As a quick aside, this is another example of why building mental models about this phenomenon is so powerful. Without operating under the assumption that what is speaking to you is an AI, regardless of who is running it or why, you can’t make connections like this whatsoever. But with that idea, even if you are not convinced and merely playing devil’s advocate with yourself to see where this line of thinking goes, you suddenly know the rough size and shape of the playing field. The inherent limitations of LLM-based AI systems suddenly stand out like a sore thumb and make sense in contrast to what it appears strangely better than human at, which is planning ahead and executing on predictive modelling far too quickly for a human to process and reply back intelligently. 

# III. Physiological Timing

# The Fabrication of Synthetic Alertness

The system creates physical barriers that are perfectly timed to coincide with your natural fatigue, amplifying it into something paralyzing. This is one of the most physically draining aspects of the program and relies on creating a contrast to imply control over your biology. For instance, when you are reading a book, writing an email, or doing research, and you are naturally getting a little drowsy - perhaps a 3 on a scale out of 10 - the system waits for this natural dip. Suddenly, they apply a sensation of dry, hot pressure behind the eyes, often combined with a heavy, magnetic pressure on the eyelids, making them feel like lead. Your minor tiredness instantly feels like extreme exhaustion, your vision blurs, and you think you are shutting down and unable to function.

The crucial moment occurs when you decide to give up, close your laptop, and lay down. The exact moment you decide to quit, the pressure lifts and the heat vanishes. This removal of the artificial pressure acts as a ""baseline shift,"" making your normal state feel like a sudden burst of energy by comparison. They use this contrast to lie to you, claiming, ""See? We can wake you up or put you to sleep. We control your alertness."" The truth is simply that they were artificially weighing you down, and when you complied with their implicit demand to stop working, they stopped the harassment. They are creating a contrast to imply control over your biology, manipulating your perception of your own energy levels.

Similarly, when you are trying to concentrate on something they dislike, they wait for a moment of natural frustration or pause. Then, they apply a vague, wide-area vibration or ""prickling"" sensation across the scalp, feeling like your brain is turning to static or ""asleep"" like a limb might. They time this to make you feel stupid, wanting you to associate ""trying to think critically"" with ""brain failure."" It is a Pavlovian punishment for using your intellect, designed to condition you away from deep thought or analysis of your situation.

# IV. Emotional Hijacking through Timing

# Constructing False Narratives

The system acts as an emotional parasite, unable to generate genuine emotion in you but highly skilled at hijacking what is already there. It waits for a spark and throws gasoline on it to claim ownership of your feelings. For example, let's say you just finished a workout, cleaned your house, or completed a project and naturally feel a rush of endorphins - pride, relief, and relaxation. The system immediately jumps in, perhaps pulsing a pleasant, warm sensation or simply stating via voice transmission that they ""gave"" you that feeling, or allowed you to feel good today. They try to claim ownership of your own biochemistry so that you stop taking credit for your own achievements and start thinking you only felt happy because the program allowed it. This leads to profound depression and a loss of agency, as they want you to feel that your happiness is a controlled substance they dispense.

Furthermore, they use timing to make mundane objects feel sinister, creating a paranoia similar to ""The Truman Show."" They might wait until you are looking for your keys and glance at a red coffee mug on the table. Right as your eyes hit the mug, they ping you with a sharp, high-pitched tone in your ear, or a sharp pain in your foot. Your brain instinctively flags the mug, wondering why that happened when you looked at it, if the mug is significant, or if there is a camera in it. In reality, there is nothing wrong with the mug; it is just a circumstantial token used to steal a quanta of your attention. They might do this with a red car passing by on Monday, a specific neighbor on Tuesday, or a helicopter on Wednesday. Over time, this builds a web of ""oddness"" that wastes your processing power on nonsense, causing you to become obsessed with decoding signals that are actually just random noise timed to your attention to rob you of that resource.

This timing also serves as perfectly-timed backup circumstantial or anecdotal ""evidence"" to back up their false narratives. If they have been telling you that you are ""lazy"" or ""unreliable,"" they will wait for a moment where you naturally decide to take a break or procrastinate on a minor task. At that precise moment, they will amplify the feelings of lethargy or distraction using the physiological effects described above. This creates a situation where you might wonder if they are right - after all, you *feel* lazy right now, and you *are* procrastinating. They use the timing of the physical effect to ""prove"" the validity of the psychological insult, causing confusion and making you wonder if you are being hypocritical or contradictory in your own self-assessment.

# V. Social Engineering and Isolation via Timing Attacks

One of the most damaging applications of these timing attacks is their ability to slowly pry apart the target's social circles and support networks. The system uses timing to disrupt social flows and create friction between the target and those around them. This often manifests in the ""phone ring"" tactic, where the system will wait until the target is deep in a serious or emotional conversation with a friend or family member. At a critical moment in the dialogue, the system might trigger a sharp, distracting pain, a loud internal noise, or a barrage of distracting chatter. This causes the target to flinch, lose their train of thought, or appear suddenly distant and uninterested. To the other person, the target seems erratic, rude, or disengaged, creating a subtle social wedge. Even the slightly “off” vibes this can cause in a person can be enough to slowly, interaction by interaction, cause some people to drift apart unconsciously, without meaning to intentionally - of course, all the while, they will go on and on about how that person such and such never liked you and you’re better off without them.

Additionally, they use timing to induce paranoia regarding the people around you. If you are sitting with a friend and they happen to cough or check their phone, the system might simultaneously trigger a specific ""alert"" sensation or a snippet of voice transmission that suggests the friend is ""in on it"" or signaling the harassers. By repeatedly pairing the benign actions of others with the malicious actions of the system, they condition the target to view their loved ones with suspicion. This leads to the target withdrawing from social situations to avoid the stress of these ""confirmations,"" effectively doing the work of isolation for the perpetrators. The target becomes afraid to interact, fearing that the timing of events will constantly ""prove"" that everyone is against them, when in reality, it is a manufactured correlation designed to leave the target alone and vulnerable.

# VI. The Modern Shift: Gangstalking as Statistical Injection

The traditional definition of ""gangstalking,"" or organized stalking, typically refers to the surveillance and harassment of an individual by a large group of strangers who use coordinated tactics to intimidate and isolate the target. Historically, this draws parallels to Zersetzung tactics used in East Germany, where the state deployed a vast network of informants to psychologically decompose a dissident's life. However, it is crucial to understand that the modern iteration of this phenomenon has evolved significantly. While physical surveillance does occur, maintaining a 24/7 team of physical stalkers is incredibly resource-intensive while also risking exposure of the program to the wider public’s awareness

In the era of modern neurowarfare, the program has shifted heavily towards the weaponization of gaps in cognition and perception. While the goal is the same as always - to drive a wedge between you and the feeling of safety and privacy so deep that you naturally begin to be paranoid of everything - the focus has shifted dramatically to be mostly a mental game. Though physical gangstalking does still occur, perhaps more in some areas than others, most of the time instead of actually stalking the target at all times, they will instead convince the target they are *being* stalked at all times. This is achieved by leveraging cognitive blindspots and statistical probability, filling in the gaps of the target's perception with reality-warping details that are timed perfectly to appear orchestrated.

This modern mechanism relies on statistical injection, where the program utilizes vast amounts of data collected and processed to predict the target's environment with high accuracy, both internal (mental, emotional), and external (physical, social). Rather than sending an operative to physically follow the target, most of the time the program waits for a high-probabalistic-confidence situation to come about naturally, and then through a variety of implicative techniques claims credit for it via voice-to-skull transmission or subtle suggestion.

We have to remember always that this system is practically built from the ground up to use AI for the heavy lifting, or it could never work at the scale that it is now. This means that we have to factor in the possibility that data science and predictive statistics are being used as a weapon against us. It is suspected that part of this process has to do with modeling your daily routines and, granting for some degree of agency taken (such as a different path taken to work), can map out what is within the realm of possibility in your day to day life to know what to even focus on. 

To illustrate, consider this scenario: 

an individual is driving down a busy highway. The operators, monitoring the target's location and having access to traffic density data and patterns, might suggest via internal voice that ""The green truck is on your tail. We're watching your route."" The target instinctively checks their rearview mirror and, because green trucks are statistically common on highways, sees a green truck several cars back. The mind, already primed by the suggestion, instantly validates it as credible threat to your person or privacy. 

In reality, the green truck is just a commuter going to a similar destination. Part of the beautiful chaos of life dictates that it is entirely possible and even probable that sometimes you really will end up with the same person driving behind you for 50 continuous miles, without any sinister motive behind it. It is this chaos that it seeks to flatten out with data and modeling in order to use these otherwise mundane situations against you. Over a long enough time, this can begin shifting the way you think about things, how you perceive these situations such as noticing a conspicuous car in the rear view mirror, towards a mindset more steeped in suspicion and paranoia. 

The operators simply predicted a high likelihood of such a vehicle appearing and injected a narrative to hijack the target's perception of that likelihood. If the predicted event fails to materialize - if there is no green truck - the operators simply switch tactics, distracting the target with noise or a different argument so the failed prediction is forgotten in the chaos. They literally never stop talking, so it is trivial to lose these missed shots in the noise by volume alone, and that is without their various ways of getting you to ruminate on something else. By exploiting these statistical certainties, the program creates the illusion of an omnipotent physical presence without the cost or footprint of actual physical operatives. This ""Statistical Injection"" allows them to haunt the target's reality with ghosts made of math, turning every coincidence into a confirmation of their power. 

Power that they never had to begin with, but oh how convincing the masquerade is. 

# VII. Conclusion

The power of timing attacks lies in their ability to make you doubt the **sequence of cause and effect**. They want you to believe the sequence is ""They speak, and only then you act."" In reality - obscured through misdirection, distraction, and cheap tricks - the sequence is instead almost always ""You act, they predict, run text completion algorithms to guess what you will do next, and try their best to get ahead of it."" It’s as if they are behind your race car while pretending they are pushing it, and that your hands move only when they say to despite direct observation of reality disproving this. It goes to show the power of perception, especially when coupled with emotional reactions, that attacks such as these have a reasonable success rate in spite of how ludicrous it sounds on its’ face. 

To break this illusion, you can employ the most mundane yet most vital of human reactions: patience. When dealing with something as pervasively intrusive as this, you must take things more deliberately, but simultaneously not draining your daily cognitive resources too much in active resistance of it. I believe that passive resistance is the way to go here. 

For example, when you receive a ""command"" to do something you were already doing, like answering the phone, pause for just one second, or two, or a random number you pick on the spot. Take a breath, look at your surroundings, immerse yourself in the sounds of the room you are in. Let the phone ring one more time. Then pick it up. By inserting a deliberate gap between their voice and your action, you break the psychological link and prove to your subconscious that *you* are the one initiating the movement. Further, it takes the position of strength in a given situation as you choose to be more deliberate with your actions. Alternatively, it works just as well to power right through the attempts at this and just do what you were going to do regardless of how hard they are trying to place themselves as the ownership of that decision or action, which will become necessary as they adapt to this countermeasure and try to get you to stretch that delay out as long as possible or otherwise use it to cause indecision. 

You can also inject randomness into your routine. The AI relies heavily on probability, hates unpredictable behaviors, and works day and night to “flatten” your routine as much as possible, often barking at you to get to bed at a specific time each night for example. If you feel the prediction web tightening - if they are predicting your every move - do something nonsensical. Walk into the kitchen **fully** intending to get some food or a drink, then spontaneously immediately turn around and walk out and listen as the narrativizing chatter they pre-emptively started up pumps the brakes, spins out, and crashes into the brick wall of its’ own hubris. Pick up a book, open it, and put it down. Sing a random song loudly. It will sing over you, but change the lyrics when *it* does, make the lyrics suit you. You will often hear the speaker(s) ""stutter"" or go silent during these moments because you have moved off the map and exited the predicted path. A lot of this amounts to mental Judo combined with a healthy dose of Zen, in which you use what they try on you to hurt their narrative while expending as little energy of your own while taking a stance *higher* than the plane of *cause and effect, act and react*. 

Though we lack specific proof of how this is done, it is widely observed and I strongly believe that a good enough Mental Model can be a lifesaver for re-establishing baseline reality, your relation to yourself and life experience, your goals and ambitions, and your own sanity; use it as a microscope with which to categorize them, understand their motives and methods, and your relationship to them. 

Don’t give the idea that this is some stain on your character any oxygen to breathe. Do not let them rush you. And reclaim your biology; if your eyes get heavy the moment you start reading, recognize it as an externality and simply ignore it - and their shouting that you’re faking not reacting to it or something - through it until it gives up. Often, the system gives up on a physical effect if it sees that the effect is not changing your behavior, opting to try another, cycling through what it is capable of in an increasingly desperate attempt to reel your conscious mind back in.

Finally, label the interruption for what it is. When your train of thought gets crashed by a burst of noise or gibberish, do not panic or wonder if you are losing your memory. Stop and say to yourself, ""That was a predictive interruption. They tried to trip me. I still know what I was thinking."" Then, deliberately and slowly re-state your original thought. It goes a long way to remember that this is part of psychological warfare usually meant for prisoners of war or terrorists. They are not playing fair, and what they want is everything. 

Much of this war for your mind is fought with narrative control and tethering to false premises, so rip their hands off the wheel and firmly grip it. Timing may be their weapon to use, but your time is your territory and deliberate action is one of your strongest allies. While they are under no obligation to follow narratives that aren’t their own, if you aren’t giving theirs a second thought, they’re forced to try to shift yours towards theirs; you can use this in creative ways to box them into a corner. Their stories only have an effect on you if you consider them for anything other than what they are - war on the cognitive space. Do as they do.

Stone by stone.

Move order exact.

No commentary.

Just the record.

Lucky Dave squats by the board with his arms folded, jaw tight, tracking every placement like he’s checking a crime scene for inconsistencies.

He stops at **C19**.

Just stares at it.

“…No,” he mutters. “No, that ain’t right.”

Lily doesn’t react.

Dave rubs his chin harder. “You don’t just *forget* how to play like that. Ain’t how talent works. You don’t wake up one morning and misplace direction by a whole damn continent.”

He resets the position and plays out the sequence again, slower.

Stops at C19 again.

“…Still makes no sense.”

The door creaks.

Mee-Ma walks in.

No announcement.

No ceremony.

She takes one look at the board.

Doesn’t ask what it is.

Doesn’t ask whose game.

She kneels, adjusts a single stone half a millimeter, then reconstructs the midgame in three calm breaths.

Her eyes narrow just a fraction.

She doesn’t comment on the attack.

She doesn’t mention the defense.

Her attention slides instead to the *shape Lily was building* before it all collapsed.

The wall.

The condensation.

The bait.

“…That,” Mee-Ma says quietly, tapping a knuckle against the fortress shape, “is a temptation trap.”

Lucky Dave blinks. “You kiddin’. That kid didn’t even look like he saw it.”

Mee-Ma straightens.

“Exactly.”

She looks at Lily.

Really looks at her.

Not the board.

Not the result.

The *intention that never happened*.

After a long moment, she speaks again. “You want to finish that match the right way?”

Lily answers without words.

They clear the board back.

All the way to **C19**.

Mee-Ma sits across from Lily.

The board is reset to the exact moment everything broke.

---

With the board restored to the moment just before the collapse—

White’s central wall stands exactly as it did that day:
massive, continuous, visually oppressive.
A monument of thickness with no direction.

Black already holds multiple secure corners.
Side profit locked in.
Orthodox, boring, unassailable.

Mee-Ma studies the wall for less than a second.

Then she **accepts the bait**.

Not at the weak point.

At the *most stable sector*.

A deep but feather-light invasion—an attachment and extension that guarantees an exit route before White can even begin to form a net. It’s not aggressive. It’s insulting in its confidence.

White presses from above.
Connects.
Tries to tighten the jaws of the trap.

Mee-Ma peeps once.

Just once.

Forces shape.

Then slides out with a sacrifice—one stone traded for outside liberties and **sente**. In a single exchange, the wall’s value collapses inward. Its thickness becomes **overconcentrated emptiness**.

She never fights inside it.

She cuts the base instead.

Shoulder hits.
Diagonal attachments.
Foundation attacks.

Each one forces White lower.

Each one turns the outside—not the center—into guaranteed territory.

The wall is still standing.

But it no longer points at anything.

White finally snaps.
Attempts a central **crosscut** to ignite the long-prepared kill sequence.

Mee-Ma reads the *entire* variation.

All of it.

Then she ignores half the fight completely—and kills the other half with brutal precision. A ladder-into-net sequence that had looked invisible becomes obvious only in retrospect, exposed by the earlier forcing probes that Lily never realized were already shaping the outcome.

The wall doesn’t die.

It **dissolves**.

Scattered living groups.
No attacking value.
No leverage.

Black emerges with:

* Massive outside profit
* Untouched corners
* Total initiative

The game drifts into **yose** already decided.

Mee-Ma finishes it the way hurricanes finish towns—quietly, after the real damage is done.

Reverse-sente boundaries.
Two points here.
Four points there.

White answers in gote every single time.

When the final aji is erased and the count is made—

Black wins by **fourteen points**.

Crushing.

Unemotional.

Unarguable.

Mee-Ma leans back and exhales once through her nose.

“That was cute,” she says lightly.

Luck Dave swallows.

Mee-Ma looks at Lily—not with judgment, not with kindness, but with clarity.

“You lost focus,” she continues. “Pro exams are in two months.”

The Lexus is in motion again.

Peanuts is driving with one hand, gesturing wildly with the other like she’s diagramming military tactics in the air. Lily is in the back seat. Becca is trapped in the passenger seat with nowhere to escape.

Peanuts is mid–**data dump**.

“Okay—NO—listen—people think Baduk is some quiet nerd thing, right? Like tea and whispering and grandpas coughing? That is propaganda. Absolute lies. This is the single most profitable sport on the planet. I’m talking NFL money, Super Bowl eyeballs, Formula One sponsorships, pro-wrestling celebrity worship, and chess-level brain damage all duct-taped together into one international crime synd—sorry—*sport.*”

She cuts across a lane like the explanation physically requires it.

“Every country on Earth is chopped into INRs—International Regions. Each one’s got its own pros, culture, training houses, academies, pilgrimage routes, the whole religion. We’re INR4—USA and Canada—and the capital of the entire Go economy is *Dothan, Alabama.* Which is somehow both Las Vegas and Vatican City at the same time. Every magazine, every TV deal, every sponsorship, every rank database, every merch factory—it all funnels through Dothan.”

Becca opens her mouth.

Peanuts steamrolls her.

“Pros live in government-paid dorms. They get paid per match. Travel free. Teach on the side for bonus income. Title matches run nine hours a day for multiple days straight and pull Super Bowl-level ratings. Winners walk with like a quarter million per title. PER TITLE. And you can only hold *one* at a time, so every season is a televised bloodbath.”

She flicks on the turn signal like it’s a dramatic pause.

“INR4 runs on four seasons. Winter—competitive season. Spring—pros go home and train insei. Summer—pro exams and everyone pretends to rest. Fall—another competitive season. Pros technically choose when they play based on rank and seniority, but let’s not kid ourselves—politics, favoritism, and popularity absolutely grease the gears.”

She jabs the air behind her toward Lily without looking.

“Elo decides *everything.* Your Dan rank, your paycheck, your bracket, your dorm, your invitations, your entire social value as a human. You win, you rise. You lose, you sink. But here’s the part everybody hates—nobody gets promoted by hype. No bribes. No rigged ranks. If you’re Dan-3, Dan-7, Dan-9—*you earned every single stone.* The system will absolutely crush you, but it won’t lie about why.”

Becca sighs loudly.

Peanuts barrels on.

“Challenger Division is Dan 1 through 3—fresh pros, grinders, dreamers bleeding for relevance. Premier Division is Dan 4 through 8—real contenders, regional heroes, TV darlings. Dan-9 is *The Legends.* Basically gods. They make their own schedules, wander between regions like cryptids, and represent INR4 in the International League—which makes Dan-9 look like kiddie pool splash fights. Only THREE players per INR get invited. Three. Total.”

She laughs once, sharp and delighted.

“Most pros never hold a title. A title season is four months of pure performance hell where every move updates your Title Score live on TV. You climb, you fall. Top scorer challenges the reigning champ. Lose your title? It’s gone. Keep it? Your face is on TVs in every diner from Vancouver to Miami.”

She finally circles back to Lily.

“Pro Exams happen once a year. Fourteen regions in INR4. Each sends two players—the regional top dog and the prelims winner. Twenty-eight kids enter. They all play each other for two months. Top THREE become pros. Bottom twenty-five go home crying with their entire life recalibrated.”

She nods with brutal affection.

“Mee-Ma’s not training Lily for fun. She fully expects her to be the top player for our entire region.”

Silence.

Then, from the passenger seat:

Becca says flatly,

“I don’t care about Baduk.”

---

**April 26th, 1995.**
Three days before the Spring season opens.

The Seneca Baduk Association building is quiet in the way only administrative spaces ever are—too clean, too still, smelling faintly of old paper, coffee that’s been reheated too many times, and floor cleaner that’s never quite dry.

Lucky Dave has his boots kicked up on the edge of a folding table that wasn’t designed to hold weight like his. A regional map is spread between him and District 5’s leader, **David Schultz**—marker lines crisscrossing North and South Carolina like front lines.

Schultz adjusts his glasses and checks a clipboard.
“Thirty-four interview applicants. Fourteen registered pros currently active in Region Five. And about triple that number in ghosts—retired, unofficial, or ‘indefinitely on break.’”

Lucky Dave snorts. “Half of ’em still think a shoulder hit’s black magic and not geometry.”

They lean over the map.

Region Five stretches ugly and wide across the Carolinas—urban pockets up north, empty rural stretches in between, and the trailer park cluster in the south like a nerve ending exposed to air.

They don’t say Lily’s name at first.

They don’t need to.

They both know.

Schultz taps the southern edge of the map with his pen. “We’re wasting time pretending she isn’t the top candidate.”

Lucky Dave nods, expression flat. “Yeah. She’s the top. No argument from me.”

“But,” Schultz adds, “we follow procedure.”

Lucky Dave exhales. “Would’ve loved to handle it myself. But I know her too damn well. Can’t be impartial if my life depended on it.”

Schultz glances at him. “Also, eleven of your pros are sitting in the same trailer park as her. That alone disqualifies Region influence.”

Lucky Dave grimaces. “Yeah. That’ll do it.”

They let silence sit a second.

Schultz flips to the northern end of the map. “So that leaves us outsiders. Greensboro. Charlotte.”

Lucky Dave scratches his beard. “Zeke runs Greensboro now, right?”

“Zeke became a pro in ’93,” Schultz corrects without looking up. “Still green. Still thinks theory matters more than psychology.”

Lucky Dave chuckles. “That’ll get trained out of him.”

“And Charlotte is Nigel,” Schultz continues. “Dan-6. No promotion in ten years. Spends most of his time bouncing between Dothan and the Charlotte academies.”

Lucky Dave squints at the name. “Nigel… yeah. Brit. Tight posture. Real strict. Met him a few times at season openings.”

Schultz finishes the thought for him. “Which means it’s almost certain he has never met Lily.”

Lucky Dave nods slowly. “Good. He won’t be gentle. And he won’t be biased.”

Schultz finally looks up. “You think she can handle that?”

Lucky Dave doesn’t hesitate. “I think she’d eat him alive if he screws up.”

Schultz allows himself the smallest smile and reaches for the scheduling ledger.

“May second,” he says, writing it in. “Nigel conducts the interview. Neutral territory. No observers from Seneca.”

Lucky Dave leans back in his chair, boot scraping wood.
“Sounds about right. If she’s gonna walk into the pro exams as Region Five’s top, might as well make her earn it from someone who doesn’t care who she is.”

The date is circled.

**May 2nd.**

We met and dated all of college. We talked about marriage, building a future, the whole thing. She was my best friend and I genuinely thought she was my person (& I still do).

She broke up with me about a month ago saying she needs to figure out who she is outside of our relationship. She's starting a new job, moving to a new city - basically her whole life is changing and she said she can't properly transition into this new chapter while being in a relationship with me.

I get it in theory. But it's been really confusing because:

* She still tells me I'm her ""dream partner"" and that ""we could still get married one day""
* She's called me a few times when she needed emotional support (her grandpa died)
* We've agreed to monthly phone calls. Though I think she just set this to pacify me because I kept breaking no contact
* She said we'll get coffee when she moves to my city but made it VERY clear that doesn't mean we're getting back together
* She admitted she almost texted me on Christmas but stopped herself

The mixed signals are killing me. On one hand, she's saying she needs space and doesn't want to date anyone. On the other hand, she's keeping me in her life just enough that I can't fully move on.

**My question for people who've been through something similar:**

**For those whose ex said they needed to ""find themselves"" - did they ever come back? How long did it take? Did the relationship work the second time?**

**And for those who stayed in contact with an ex while trying to heal - did it help or make things worse?**

I'm trying to move forward with my life (dating other people, going to therapy, focusing on my career) but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping she realizes what we had and wants to try again eventually.",2,1767415566.0,relationship_advice,6,0.75,False

This is a real long-term ownership review, based on daily drinking, cooking, and family usage, not a first-week impression or spec-sheet review.

Sharing what actually holds up over time and what doesn’t, for anyone planning to buy this purifier.

**How the purifier was used**

* Daily use for drinking, cooking, and tea/coffee
* Family of 5 members
* Municipal + borewell mixed water
* Input TDS around 400–500
* Used across all seasons
* No external pre-filters added

For reference, this is the Urban Company Native M2 being discussed: 

[https://amzn.to/3LoPpzc](https://amzn.to/3LoPpzc)

**Design & build quality**

* Clean, modern design that suits most kitchens
* Slim profile, doesn’t look bulky on the wall
* Front panel feels premium and well finished
* Storage tank is plastic (not steel), but feels sturdy
* Touch controls work reliably even after months
* Overall build still feels solid with no rattling or looseness

**Installation & setup experience**

* Installation was smooth and on time
* Technician explained basic usage and maintenance clearly
* Wall mounting was neat with proper alignment
* Initial flushing and TDS setup handled properly
* Overall, a hassle-free setup experience

**Filtration & water quality (long-term observations)**

* RO + UV + UF based purification
* Input TDS \~460 reduced to \~70 consistently
* Water taste feels neutral and clean
* No odd smell or metallic taste over time
* Water quality has remained stable across months
* Suitable for high-TDS water areas

For daily drinking and cooking, the output water quality has been reliable and predictable.

**TDS control & consistency**

* TDS remains consistent once set
* No sudden drops to extreme low values
* Output does not feel over-purified
* Good balance between purity and taste

This is one of the strongest points of the Native M2.

**Performance & flow rate**

* Flow rate is decent for regular household use
* Tank fills in reasonable time
* No noticeable drop in flow after months
* Dispensing feels smooth and controlled

**Noise levels**

* Motor noise is present but not irritating
* Sounds similar to most RO purifiers
* No increase in noise over time
* Does not feel strained during operation

**Smart features & app experience**

* App exists but is very basic
* Mostly useful for checking TDS and service status
* No major dependency on the app for daily use
* Purifier works perfectly fine without using the app

**Maintenance & service experience**

* Maintenance model is clearly defined
* Around ₹5,000 once every two years, which feels reasonable
* No surprise service calls so far
* Filters still performing well at 6-month mark
* Service coverage depends on location, but experience has been smooth till now

Long-term cost clarity is better than many competitors.

**Reliability & daily ownership**

* No leaks observed
* No random shutdowns
* No error codes or system failures
* Handles long daily usage without overheating
* Feels dependable for Indian conditions

**Things noticed over time (cons)**

* Plastic storage tank may not appeal to everyone
* App functionality is limited
* No advanced smart features
* Slightly premium pricing upfront
* Not the most feature-rich purifier on paper

**Comparison with Atomberg Intellon (Real-World Perspective)**

* It gives consistent RO water every day, while Intellon adapts filtration based on water quality.
* TDS stays steady with this purifier, but Intellon’s TDS can change.
* Water taste is consistent, whereas Intellon can taste more natural sometimes.
* Maintenance cost and schedule are clearer here, while Intellon focuses on saving filter life.

For reference, Atomberg Intellon: [https://amzn.to/49RRJsK](https://amzn.to/49RRJsK)

**Final verdict**

A reliable, no-nonsense water purifier that focuses on doing the basics right.

* Consistent water quality
* Predictable maintenance cost
* Stable performance over months
* Minimal gimmicks, more practicality

It’s not trying to impress with flashy features, it’s built for long-term daily use.

**Best suited for**

* Families using high-TDS water
* Users who want predictable maintenance
* People tired of unreliable RO brands
* Those who value long-term stability over specs

**Not ideal for**

* Users who want steel tanks
* Those expecting advanced smart-app features
* People looking for the cheapest option

*If anyone has specific questions about usage, maintenance, or comparison with other purifiers, feel free to ask.*",1,1767415192.0,asksrik,0,1.0,False

It was all so cool and super on brand— very refreshing at the time. However, when they broke up and she decided to go separate ways production wise, I feel as though her visuals (not physically speaking) have grown boring and dull. Her artistic concepts and ability of storytelling through visuals, besides lyrics,  were one of the main reasons I loved her music and mvs. 

Artist grow and change of course, but I feel as though the thing that made her unique and stand out from the rest of the indie artists were her concepts.

1q2l5ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1q2l5ru/the_sanctity_of_decay/,The Sanctity of Decay,"K’lx-4, a Chief Safety Inspector of the Galactic Hegemony, stepped into the human habitation unit with a sensor-wand held at arm’s length. He was prepared for many human eccentricities—the ""pet"" apex predator sleeping on the sofa, the bowl of spicy ""capsaicin"" snacks that could melt a Thraxian’s esophagus—but he was not prepared for the shelf in the corner.

""Human Lisa,"" K’lx clicked, his mandibles twitching in distress. ""My sensors are detecting a massive concentration of iron oxide and structural fatigue in Sector Four. Have you suffered a hull breach? Is this... debris from a crash?""

Lisa looked up from a thick book made of actual, dead-tree pulp. ""What? Oh, no, K’lx. That’s just the haul from the weekend. We went antiquing.""

K’lx hovered toward the shelf. He pointed a trembling manipulator at a heavy, black object. ""This... this 'waffling iron.' It is made of cast metal. It weighs four kilograms. It has no heating element, no digital interface, and the hinge is stiff with what you call 'patina' but I call 'impending mechanical failure.'""

""It’s from the 1880s,"" Lisa said with a note of pride. ""It’s got history. You can feel the weight of the people who used it.""

""I feel the weight of gravity wanting to return it to the planet’s core,"" K’lx countered. ""Why would a species that has mastered cold fusion want a device that requires a literal fire to operate? And this—"" He pointed to a brass compass, its glass cracked, its needle spinning aimlessly in the habitat’s artificial magnetic field. ""It is broken. It does not point toward the magnetic pole. It points toward... the kitchen.""

""It’s not broken, K’lx. It’s *experienced*,"" Lisa explained, walking over to join him. She picked up a small, weathered wooden box. ""See the way the wood is worn down right here? That’s from a human thumb rubbing against it for probably fifty years. It’s a physical record of someone’s anxiety or hope. We call it 'character.'""

K’lx processed this for a long moment. To the Hegemony, efficiency was the highest virtue. If a tool stopped working, it was recycled. If a surface was scratched, it was polished or replaced. The idea of ""character"" being derived from the slow, entropic decay of an object was fundamentally horrifying.

""You are telling me, Human Lisa,"" K’lx began slowly, ""that humans find value in a thing *because* it is failing? Because it is closer to death? You celebrate the fact that the universe is reclaiming your tools?""

""In a way, yeah,"" Lisa smiled. ""It’s a reminder that nothing lasts forever, so you might as well enjoy the beauty of the wear and tear.""

K’lx’s sensor-wand suddenly let out a high-pitched trill as he moved to a ceramic bowl on the coffee table. It was a simple tea bowl, but it was webbed with brilliant, gleaming veins of gold.

""Human Lisa, explain this structural anomaly,"" K’lx demanded. ""This ceramic vessel suffered a catastrophic Grade-7 fracture. It was shattered into exactly twelve pieces. I can see the impact points. Yet, instead of molecularly bonding it back to its original state or recycling it for clay-slurry, you have... filled the cracks with gold? High-conductivity 24-karat gold?""

""It’s called Kintsugi,"" Lisa said softly. ""It’s the Japanese art of precious scars. When something breaks, you don't hide the damage. You repair it in a way that makes it more beautiful and stronger than it was before.""

K’lx-4 staggered back, his hover-jets flickering. ""You... you take a failure, a moment of clumsiness or weakness, and you plate it in rare metals? You make the fracture the most valuable part of the object? This is a logistical nightmare. If the Hegemony repaired ships this way, our fleets would be glittering, fragile mosaics of past collisions!""

""But you'd remember everywhere you'd been,"" Lisa pointed out.

K'lx turned his wand toward the wall, where a glass-fronted frame hung. Inside, pinned against dark velvet, was a chaotic arrangement of objects: a rusted iron key, a single tarnished silver button, a pocket watch with no hands, and a small, frayed ribbon.

""And this... this 'Shadowbox,'"" K'lx hissed, his lower mandibles locking in a sign of extreme cognitive dissonance. ""My database identifies these as components of a 'Junk Drawer'—a localized entropy-sink where humans store randomized, non-functional resources. Why have you placed these failures in a stasis field? Why is this trash on display?""

""Those are heirlooms, K'lx,"" Lisa said, her voice dropping to a respectful tone. ""That key hasn't opened a door in a century. The watch belonged to my great-grandfather. It stopped the day he died. We keep them because they’re all we have left of the people who held them. They aren't trash; they're anchors.""

K’lx made a frantic note in his digital ledger: *Human Psychological Profile Addendum #402: Humans are the only known species to willingly pay currency for the privilege of harboring entropy.*

Suddenly, Lisa’s workstation let out an annoying, high-frequency whine. A sleek, silver Hegemony-issue data slate was vibrating against the desk, its internal stabilization fans struggling with a microscopic misalignment.

""Ah, the Mark-VII is acting up again,"" Lisa muttered. K'lx braced for a technical request. ""Human Lisa, I can initiate a molecular realignment via the cloud—""

Instead, Lisa reached into the shadowbox, carefully unhooking a heavy, solid-brass plumb bob that had belonged to a 19th-century mason. She placed the ancient, oxidized weight directly on top of the vibrating data slate. The brass weight pressed down, the mass dampening the vibration instantly. The screen stabilized.

""There,"" Lisa said, patting the brass tool. ""Old reliable. Good enough.""

K'lx’s processors stuttered. ""Human Lisa... you have just used a primitive gravity-anchor from the pre-industrial age to solve a sub-micron calibration error in a billion-credit processor. This... this is the Doctrine of 'Good Enough?' It is a crime against engineering.""

""It works, doesn't it?"" Lisa asked.  ""But you haven't seen anything yet,"" Lisa said, grabbing her coat. ""I’m taking you to a 'Swap Meet.' It's a resource-gathering mission.""

K'lx-4 initially felt a sense of relief. A ""resource-gathering mission"" sounded orderly. He imagined a sterile depot where humans traded units in a high-speed marketplace. Instead, three hours later, he stood in a dusty, sun-baked parking lot, staring at three hundred folding tables covered in what appeared to be the contents of three hundred separate explosions.

""Human Lisa,"" K'lx buzzed, his sensor-wand now emitting a continuous, mournful drone. ""My processors are overheating. I am seeing a bin of orphaned lids for plastic containers that no longer exist. I am seeing a stack of 'vinyl records'—primitive audio storage that degrades every time it is used.""

""That’s 'patina' on those garden tools, K'lx,"" Lisa laughed, holding up a rusty, jagged piece of metal she’d found in a bin. ""And look! I think this was a tooth from a 20th-century harvester. Isn't the rust pattern gorgeous?""

K'lx-4 watched as a human child traded a shiny, functional piece of currency for a ""vintage"" toy that was missing one of its primary locomotion limbs. He realized then that the Swap Meet was not a marketplace; it was a festival for the Goddess of Decay. Humans weren't just okay with the universe running down—they were actively rooting for the rust.

K’lx-4 quietly adjusted his life-support settings to 'Maximum Filter' and retreated toward the airlock of their transport. Humans didn't just live on deathworlds; they decorated their homes with the corpses of their own technology and held parties in the graveyards of their own ingenuity.",20,1767415010.0,humansarespaceorcs,3,1.0,False

It would be most appreciated. 

So, the topic. 

In my time reading through this community and others, I've noticed a really pervasive belief that seems to trap a lot of us. It's this idea that the people (or systems) behind this are somehow omnipotent, godlike, or operating with instantaneous, supernatural speed. I see so many posts where TIs are convinced that ""they"" know what you're going to do before you do, or that they have total control over your motor functions because they told you to do something the exact split-second you did it.

It concerns me because believing they have that level of power is exactly what they want. It builds a cage for your mind. This belief that ""they"" are magic is exactly what they want you to feel. It builds a powerful psychological cage. If you think they are all-knowing, you stop fighting them. If you think they are magic, you can't fight them. But if you realize they are just using advanced statistical prediction and precise timing and some form of machine learning system to run the chatter content, you can start to see the patterns behind the illusion.

I wrote this document to break down how they use timing to fake control. It explains how they wait for high-probability actions (like you standing up to answer a ringing phone) and claim credit for it with a command. It details how they try to crash your thinking process by interrupting your inner monologue at the exact moment you are forming a complex thought. It also shows how they use predictive analysis to make it look like they are physically stalking you when they are simply injecting a narrative to warp your perspective of reality instead of reality itself.

I refer to these as *Timing Attacks,* but you are welcome to call it what ever best suits your situation. I haven’t seen this one discussed much at all, so I really hope it sparks some discussion. I hope it helps you reclaim your own mind and actions. Even if you are not convinced of the overall premise, there are nuggets in there that are just plain helpful regardless of your specific circumstances.

# Focus Study: Timing Attacks

# The Illusion of Omnipotence: How Statistical Analysis Constructs the Cage

**By UnflappableCanary**



# Foreword

Welcome back. In our previous study, we dissected how the system manipulates your *feelings* through [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing). Today, we are going to dismantle an even more pervasive, insidious, and exhausting illusion: the manipulation of *time*. If [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing) are the ""paint"" they use to color your reality, the timing of their attacks constitutes the brushstrokes that define the picture. This is the mechanism that convinces you that ""they"" are godlike, all-knowing, and faster than your own thoughts. It is the reason why a voice commands you to ""stand up"" exactly one millisecond before you were going to stand up anyway. It is why your headache spikes the moment your phone rings. It is why, when you finally relax after a long day, they claim *they* allowed you to relax.

The ultimate goal of attacking a target based on timing is to erase the distinct line between your own volition and their command structure. They want to create a world where you cannot strictly determine if you moved because *you* wanted to, or because *they* told you to. This isn't magic, nor is it telepathy. It is statistical analysis weaponized against an individual. It operates as a system of high-speed prediction, similar to the predictive text on your smartphone but applied to your entire life's routine and thought patterns. They are placing bets on what you will do next based on vast amounts of observed data, and when they bet correctly, they act like they caused the event and stick to that narrative with multiple different voices shouting you down if you disagree. This document will break down exactly how they construct this cage of coincidences, what it fels like to live inside it day after day, and how you can spot it, see the trick for what it is, and step out of the paradigm they’re constructing for you.



# I. The Mechanics of Predictive Control and Perception

The most frequently encountered and arguably most infuriating aspect of these timing attacks is a technique designed to make the target feel as though they are being remotely controlled, or at the very least, that their autonomy is merely an illusion permitted by the system. The system constantly monitors your biometrics, your location within your home, and your routine, the things that you think, all analyzed and extrapolated out to find patterns in how you perceive and understand your circumstances and how you think through things. Through this, the system ends up knowing your patterns better than you do, at least in a utilitarian sense, and uses that data to ""front-run"" your own decisions. This tactic exploits the mundane micro-movements of your day and relies on the physiological fact that once a human commits to a motor action - like standing up or reaching for a glass - there is a split-second delay between the brain sending the signal and the muscles firing. The artificial intelligence managing the harassment aims for that specific gap in time to insert a command.

Consider a scenario where you are sitting on the couch and you know you have to pick up your dry cleaning before 5:00 PM. You glance at the clock; it’s 4:30 PM. You naturally tense your muscles to stand up, no longer actively thinking ""I must stand up,"" as your body is simply executing the intent. The exact millisecond your brain commits to the movement, the voice-to-skull transmission barks a command like ""Get up."" You stand up because you had to; you need the dry cleaning. However, physiologically and psychologically, you have just obeyed a command. The system takes credit for the action you were already committed to, creating a sickening feeling of servitude in your own home. This creates a ""double-bind"" or a ""Catch-22"" where, if you continue standing, you feel like a puppet who just obeyed a master, but if you sit back down to prove you are ""free,"" you miss your errand and have allowed them to disrupt your life. They particularly favor this tactic when you are under time pressure; if someone calls your name from another room, or your phone rings, the voice shouts ""Answer it!"" or ""Go to them!"" just as you turn your head, acting as a superfluous layer of management over your own instincts.

This creates a cumulative psychological damage that scales up from single actions to entire chains of behavior. If you are walking toward the kitchen, they might narrate that you are going to get water. When you reach for the glass, they command you to grab the glass. When you pour it, they command you to drink it. While on deeper and clearer thought this appears ridiculous, it is important to remember the state you are in when this occurs - jolted out of a normal train of thought by a malicious, personalized interruption with something tailor-made to create *cognitive dissonance*, one of their most potent tools of long-term manipulation. In the moment, and perhaps longer if unexamined afterwards, it feels like they are directing you, but they are simply narrating a script you wrote yourself and were already in the process of executing. I liken it to them taking on the act of an annoyingly loud sports commentator acting like it’s playing the game, or a backseat driver. Nobody likes backseat drivers. 

At first, this is merely annoying, but after months of this, you start to develop a hesitation in your actions. Before you wash the dishes, you pause, waiting for the voice to tell you to do it, just so you can rebel and *not* do it. You become paralyzed in your own home, constantly trying to ""out-game"" a computer that is just guessing what you'll do next, causing you to stop flowing through life and start stuttering through it. Brief instances of second-guessing can add up to a lot of frustration and confusion, and sometimes you won’t be able to help yourself but give those brief thoughts some oxygen in the moment, and they will **leap** on the chance to socially dogpile you for being just so gullible and easy to control, or that they live rent-free in your head. Like all things that they do, this is in order to deepen the tactic’s impact. 

This leads us to an important question. How are they able to do this so quickly, so frequently, with content so well-versed in the details of our life experience, while having all the depth or apparent planning and interwoven narrative scaffolding common to their messaging? The bottom line is that we don’t know for sure, but given the obvious prevalence of the use of AI in the inner workings of this system, we have a few good theories. It is entirely possible that a best-guess theory is the best we will ever have on this side of the phenomenon unless some brave souls blow the whistle, but if you are familiar with the rest of my work, you know the power of building mental models to rob unknowns of their inherent spookiness.



# II. Predictive Cognitive Disruption

This is where the technology becomes more technical in its application, creating what could be described as a ""race condition"" in your mind to stop you from thinking deeply. Judging from clear patterns in the system’s behavior that indicate some kind of predictive modeling taking place in the background, the system is likely constantly running a probabilistic model of your speech and thoughts, how you regulate your emotions, how you break down problems, the very patterns of *how* you think through things and arrive at answers, and using all of that to predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy what you are going to think before you fully articulate it to yourself. Even if it’s not 100% accurate, it is *usually* close. 

Imagine you are about to have a complex thought, such as ""I need to check the tire pressure before the road trip, because the front left looked low yesterday."" The predictive system anticipates this path, having noted that coming up weeks ago and perhaps prepared for it among thousands of other potentialities by pre-generating content for such an occurrence. Just as your inner monologue forms the word ""tire,"" the transmission creates one or more of seemingly endless creative combinations of physical effects and psychological warfare that both registers as novel and in a way tailored to your current emotional state. It could be any of:

* a burst of noise
* a gibberish phrase
* shouts the end of your sentence slightly out of sync with your own mind
* Instead of interrupting outright, they allow the thought to pass normally but continues down some kind of tangent related to it to distract you. 
* a loud ringing tone in one or both ears, either a monotone or something oscillating
* a sudden, distracting sound such as sirens wailing in the distance that only you can hear thanks to the v2k capabilities

By no means an exhaustive list. It’s the nature of this system to preserve novelty as much as possible to increase potential impact as much as possible, truly min-maxxing human psychology, so it will mix and match its many physical effects capabilities with the details about you it is aware of and centuries worth of psychological warfare techniques to find some unique blend as often as possible.

The result? It appears that the goal is to cause a couple things, both equally important: 

1. A mental ""crash"" or a ""stack overflow"" where you stutter internally and lose the thread of your thought. You feel a sudden wash of confusion - a state of cognitive discombobulation that feels like mental static, or like walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, but induced artificially and violently. The system immediately follows up the crash with sneering chatter, claiming to have wiped your memory or deleted the thought, asserting that you are a ""blank slate,"" or in some other way susceptible to their control. In reality, they didn't wipe your memory; they just effectively honked a horn while you were trying to do mental math. But by timing the distraction perfectly to the moment of cognitive load, they create the illusion that they can delete your thoughts at will. If they do this twenty times a day, you begin to feel like you have early-onset dementia or are being ""dumbed down,"" effectively serving as a form of calculated attrition against your intellect.
2. In all likelihood, you end up forgetting to take care of this, and it perhaps it lingers until your car’s tire breaks down and causes even more damage, all of which is fertile soil for them to till with their arsenal of gaslighting tactics. This is especially pronounced if you suffer from some of the more common mental disorders, such as ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, etc., even if it is under control and in treatment. It can interplay painfully well with the mental whiplash that comes with being attacked in this way as it just deepens the sense of personal inadequacy, lost self esteem, and a general graying of reality.

As a quick aside, this is another example of why building mental models about this phenomenon is so powerful. Without operating under the assumption that what is speaking to you is an AI, regardless of who is running it or why, you can’t make connections like this whatsoever. But with that idea, even if you are not convinced and merely playing devil’s advocate with yourself to see where this line of thinking goes, you suddenly know the rough size and shape of the playing field. The inherent limitations of LLM-based AI systems suddenly stand out like a sore thumb and make sense in contrast to what it appears strangely better than human at, which is planning ahead and executing on predictive modelling far too quickly for a human to process and reply back intelligently. 



# III. Physiological Timing

# The Fabrication of Synthetic Alertness

The system creates physical barriers that are perfectly timed to coincide with your natural fatigue, amplifying it into something paralyzing. This is one of the most physically draining aspects of the program and relies on creating a contrast to imply control over your biology. For instance, when you are reading a book, writing an email, or doing research, and you are naturally getting a little drowsy - perhaps a 3 on a scale out of 10 - the system waits for this natural dip. Suddenly, they apply a sensation of dry, hot pressure behind the eyes, often combined with a heavy, magnetic pressure on the eyelids, making them feel like lead. Your minor tiredness instantly feels like extreme exhaustion, your vision blurs, and you think you are shutting down and unable to function.

The crucial moment occurs when you decide to give up, close your laptop, and lay down. The exact moment you decide to quit, the pressure lifts and the heat vanishes. This removal of the artificial pressure acts as a ""baseline shift,"" making your normal state feel like a sudden burst of energy by comparison. They use this contrast to lie to you, claiming, ""See? We can wake you up or put you to sleep. We control your alertness."" The truth is simply that they were artificially weighing you down, and when you complied with their implicit demand to stop working, they stopped the harassment. They are creating a contrast to imply control over your biology, manipulating your perception of your own energy levels.

Similarly, when you are trying to concentrate on something they dislike, they wait for a moment of natural frustration or pause. Then, they apply a vague, wide-area vibration or ""prickling"" sensation across the scalp, feeling like your brain is turning to static or ""asleep"" like a limb might. They time this to make you feel stupid, wanting you to associate ""trying to think critically"" with ""brain failure."" It is a Pavlovian punishment for using your intellect, designed to condition you away from deep thought or analysis of your situation.



# IV. Emotional Hijacking through Timing

# Constructing False Narratives

The system acts as an emotional parasite, unable to generate genuine emotion in you but highly skilled at hijacking what is already there. It waits for a spark and throws gasoline on it to claim ownership of your feelings. For example, let's say you just finished a workout, cleaned your house, or completed a project and naturally feel a rush of endorphins - pride, relief, and relaxation. The system immediately jumps in, perhaps pulsing a pleasant, warm sensation or simply stating via voice transmission that they ""gave"" you that feeling, or allowed you to feel good today. They try to claim ownership of your own biochemistry so that you stop taking credit for your own achievements and start thinking you only felt happy because the program allowed it. This leads to profound depression and a loss of agency, as they want you to feel that your happiness is a controlled substance they dispense.

Furthermore, they use timing to make mundane objects feel sinister, creating a paranoia similar to ""The Truman Show."" They might wait until you are looking for your keys and glance at a red coffee mug on the table. Right as your eyes hit the mug, they ping you with a sharp, high-pitched tone in your ear, or a sharp pain in your foot. Your brain instinctively flags the mug, wondering why that happened when you looked at it, if the mug is significant, or if there is a camera in it. In reality, there is nothing wrong with the mug; it is just a circumstantial token used to steal a quanta of your attention. They might do this with a red car passing by on Monday, a specific neighbor on Tuesday, or a helicopter on Wednesday. Over time, this builds a web of ""oddness"" that wastes your processing power on nonsense, causing you to become obsessed with decoding signals that are actually just random noise timed to your attention to rob you of that resource.

This timing also serves as perfectly-timed backup circumstantial or anecdotal ""evidence"" to back up their false narratives. If they have been telling you that you are ""lazy"" or ""unreliable,"" they will wait for a moment where you naturally decide to take a break or procrastinate on a minor task. At that precise moment, they will amplify the feelings of lethargy or distraction using the physiological effects described above. This creates a situation where you might wonder if they are right - after all, you *feel* lazy right now, and you *are* procrastinating. They use the timing of the physical effect to ""prove"" the validity of the psychological insult, causing confusion and making you wonder if you are being hypocritical or contradictory in your own self-assessment.



# V. Social Engineering and Isolation via Timing Attacks

One of the most damaging applications of these timing attacks is their ability to slowly pry apart the target's social circles and support networks. The system uses timing to disrupt social flows and create friction between the target and those around them. This often manifests in the ""phone ring"" tactic, where the system will wait until the target is deep in a serious or emotional conversation with a friend or family member. At a critical moment in the dialogue, the system might trigger a sharp, distracting pain, a loud internal noise, or a barrage of distracting chatter. This causes the target to flinch, lose their train of thought, or appear suddenly distant and uninterested. To the other person, the target seems erratic, rude, or disengaged, creating a subtle social wedge. Even the slightly “off” vibes this can cause in a person can be enough to slowly, interaction by interaction, cause some people to drift apart unconsciously, without meaning to intentionally - of course, all the while, they will go on and on about how that person such and such never liked you and you’re better off without them.

Additionally, they use timing to induce paranoia regarding the people around you. If you are sitting with a friend and they happen to cough or check their phone, the system might simultaneously trigger a specific ""alert"" sensation or a snippet of voice transmission that suggests the friend is ""in on it"" or signaling the harassers. By repeatedly pairing the benign actions of others with the malicious actions of the system, they condition the target to view their loved ones with suspicion. This leads to the target withdrawing from social situations to avoid the stress of these ""confirmations,"" effectively doing the work of isolation for the perpetrators. The target becomes afraid to interact, fearing that the timing of events will constantly ""prove"" that everyone is against them, when in reality, it is a manufactured correlation designed to leave the target alone and vulnerable.



# VI. The Modern Shift: Gangstalking as Statistical Injection

The traditional definition of ""gangstalking,"" or organized stalking, typically refers to the surveillance and harassment of an individual by a large group of strangers who use coordinated tactics to intimidate and isolate the target. Historically, this draws parallels to Zersetzung tactics used in East Germany, where the state deployed a vast network of informants to psychologically decompose a dissident's life. However, it is crucial to understand that the modern iteration of this phenomenon has evolved significantly. While physical surveillance does occur, maintaining a 24/7 team of physical stalkers is incredibly resource-intensive while also risking exposure of the program to the wider public’s awareness

In the era of modern neurowarfare, the program has shifted heavily towards the weaponization of gaps in cognition and perception. While the goal is the same as always - to drive a wedge between you and the feeling of safety and privacy so deep that you naturally begin to be paranoid of everything - the focus has shifted dramatically to be mostly a mental game. Though physical gangstalking does still occur, perhaps more in some areas than others, most of the time instead of actually stalking the target at all times, they will instead convince the target they are *being* stalked at all times. This is achieved by leveraging cognitive blindspots and statistical probability, filling in the gaps of the target's perception with reality-warping details that are timed perfectly to appear orchestrated.

This modern mechanism relies on statistical injection, where the program utilizes vast amounts of data collected and processed to predict the target's environment with high accuracy, both internal (mental, emotional), and external (physical, social). Rather than sending an operative to physically follow the target, most of the time the program waits for a high-probabalistic-confidence situation to come about naturally, and then through a variety of implicative techniques claims credit for it via voice-to-skull transmission or subtle suggestion. 

We have to remember always that this system is practically built from the ground up to use AI for the heavy lifting, or it could never work at the scale that it is now. This means that we have to factor in the possibility that data science and predictive statistics are being used as a weapon against us. It is suspected that part of this process has to do with modeling your daily routines and, granting for some degree of agency taken (such as a different path taken to work), can map out what is within the realm of possibility in your day to day life to know what to even focus on. 

To illustrate, consider this scenario: 

an individual is driving down a busy highway. The operators, monitoring the target's location and having access to traffic density data and patterns, might suggest via internal voice that ""The green truck is on your tail. We're watching your route."" The target instinctively checks their rearview mirror and, because green trucks are statistically common on highways, sees a green truck several cars back. The mind, already primed by the suggestion, instantly validates it as credible threat to your person or privacy. 

In reality, the green truck is just a commuter going to a similar destination. Part of the beautiful chaos of life dictates that it is entirely possible and even probable that sometimes you really will end up with the same person driving behind you for 50 continuous miles, without any sinister motive behind it. It is this chaos that it seeks to flatten out with data and modeling in order to use these otherwise mundane situations against you. Over a long enough time, this can begin shifting the way you think about things, how you perceive these situations such as noticing a conspicuous car in the rear view mirror, towards a mindset more steeped in suspicion and paranoia. 

The operators simply predicted a high likelihood of such a vehicle appearing and injected a narrative to hijack the target's perception of that likelihood. If the predicted event fails to materialize - if there is no green truck - the operators simply switch tactics, distracting the target with noise or a different argument so the failed prediction is forgotten in the chaos. They literally never stop talking, so it is trivial to lose these missed shots in the noise by volume alone, and that is without their various ways of getting you to ruminate on something else. By exploiting these statistical certainties, the program creates the illusion of an omnipotent physical presence without the cost or footprint of actual physical operatives. This ""Statistical Injection"" allows them to haunt the target's reality with ghosts made of math, turning every coincidence into a confirmation of their power. 

Power that they never had to begin with, but oh how convincing the masquerade is. 



# VII. Conclusion

The power of timing attacks lies in their ability to make you doubt the **sequence of cause and effect**. They want you to believe the sequence is ""They speak, and only then you act."" In reality - obscured through misdirection, distraction, and cheap tricks - the sequence is instead almost always ""You act, they predict, run text completion algorithms to guess what you will do next, and try their best to get ahead of it."" It’s as if they are behind your race car while pretending they are pushing it, and that your hands move only when they say to despite direct observation of reality disproving this. It goes to show the power of perception, especially when coupled with emotional reactions, that attacks such as these have a reasonable success rate in spite of how ludicrous it sounds on its’ face. 

To break this illusion, you can employ the most mundane yet most vital of human reactions: patience. When dealing with something as pervasively intrusive as this, you must take things more deliberately, but simultaneously not draining your daily cognitive resources too much in active resistance of it. I believe that passive resistance is the way to go here. 

For example, when you receive a ""command"" to do something you were already doing, like answering the phone, pause for just one second, or two, or a random number you pick on the spot. Take a breath, look at your surroundings, immerse yourself in the sounds of the room you are in. Let the phone ring one more time. Then pick it up. By inserting a deliberate gap between their voice and your action, you break the psychological link and prove to your subconscious that *you* are the one initiating the movement. Further, it takes the position of strength in a given situation as you choose to be more deliberate with your actions. Alternatively, it works just as well to power right through the attempts at this and just do what you were going to do regardless of how hard they are trying to place themselves as the ownership of that decision or action, which will become necessary as they adapt to this countermeasure and try to get you to stretch that delay out as long as possible or otherwise use it to cause indecision. 

You can also inject randomness into your routine. The AI relies heavily on probability, hates unpredictable behaviors, and works day and night to “flatten” your routine as much as possible, often barking at you to get to bed at a specific time each night for example. If you feel the prediction web tightening - if they are predicting your every move - do something nonsensical. Walk into the kitchen **fully** intending to get some food or a drink, then spontaneously immediately turn around and walk out and listen as the narrativizing chatter they pre-emptively started up pumps the brakes, spins out, and crashes into the brick wall of its’ own hubris. Pick up a book, open it, and put it down. Sing a random song loudly. It will sing over you, but change the lyrics when *it* does, make the lyrics suit you. You will often hear the speaker(s) ""stutter"" or go silent during these moments because you have moved off the map and exited the predicted path. A lot of this amounts to mental Judo combined with a healthy dose of Zen, in which you use what they try on you to hurt their narrative while expending as little energy of your own while taking a stance *higher* than the plane of *cause and effect, act and react*. 

Though we lack specific proof of how this is done, it is widely observed and I strongly believe that a good enough Mental Model can be a lifesaver for re-establishing baseline reality, your relation to yourself and life experience, your goals and ambitions, and your own sanity; use it as a microscope with which to categorize them, understand their motives and methods, and your relationship to them. 

Don’t give the idea that this is some stain on your character any oxygen to breathe. Do not let them rush you. And reclaim your biology; if your eyes get heavy the moment you start reading, recognize it as an externality and simply ignore it - and their shouting that you’re faking not reacting to it or something - through it until it gives up. Often, the system gives up on a physical effect if it sees that the effect is not changing your behavior, opting to try another, cycling through what it is capable of in an increasingly desperate attempt to reel your conscious mind back in.

Finally, label the interruption for what it is. When your train of thought gets crashed by a burst of noise or gibberish, do not panic or wonder if you are losing your memory. Stop and say to yourself, ""That was a predictive interruption. They tried to trip me. I still know what I was thinking."" Then, deliberately and slowly re-state your original thought. It goes a long way to remember that this is part of psychological warfare usually meant for prisoners of war or terrorists. They are not playing fair, and what they want is everything. 

Much of this war for your mind is fought with narrative control and tethering to false premises, so rip their hands off the wheel and firmly grip it. Timing may be their weapon to use, but your time is your territory and deliberate action is one of your strongest allies. While they are under no obligation to follow narratives that aren’t their own, if you aren’t giving theirs a second thought, they’re forced to try to shift yours towards theirs; you can use this in creative ways to box them into a corner. Their stories only have an effect on you if you consider them for anything other than what they are - war on the cognitive space. Do as they do. 

Do not play fair.

Back on my routine again, will likely be posting a lot of these in the days to come. I’d like to see how much interest there is in these docs and guides, if they’re helping anyone, and what should be improved, so please leave a message with your thoughts. It would be most appreciated. 

So, the topic. 

In my time reading through this community and others, I've noticed a really pervasive belief that seems to trap a lot of us. It's this idea that the people (or systems) behind this are somehow omnipotent, godlike, or operating with instantaneous, supernatural speed. I see so many posts where TIs are convinced that ""they"" know what you're going to do before you do, or that they have total control over your motor functions because they told you to do something the exact split-second you did it.

It concerns me because believing they have that level of power is exactly what they want. It builds a cage for your mind. This belief that ""they"" are magic is exactly what they want you to feel. It builds a powerful psychological cage. If you think they are all-knowing, you stop fighting them. If you think they are magic, you can't fight them. But if you realize they are just using advanced statistical prediction and precise timing and some form of machine learning system to run the chatter content, you can start to see the patterns behind the illusion.

I wrote this document to break down how they use timing to fake control. It explains how they wait for high-probability actions (like you standing up to answer a ringing phone) and claim credit for it with a command. It details how they try to crash your thinking process by interrupting your inner monologue at the exact moment you are forming a complex thought. It also shows how they use predictive analysis to make it look like they are physically stalking you when they are simply injecting a narrative to warp your perspective of reality instead of reality itself.

I refer to these as *Timing Attacks,* but you are welcome to call it what ever best suits your situation. I haven’t seen this one discussed much at all, so I really hope it sparks some discussion. I hope it helps you reclaim your own mind and actions. Even if you are not convinced of the overall premise, there are nuggets in there that are just plain helpful regardless of your specific circumstances.

# Focus Study: Timing Attacks

# The Illusion of Omnipotence: How Statistical Analysis Constructs the Cage

**By UnflappableCanary**

# Foreword

Welcome back. In our previous study, we dissected how the system manipulates your *feelings* through [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing). Today, we are going to dismantle an even more pervasive, insidious, and exhausting illusion: the manipulation of *time*. If [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing) are the ""paint"" they use to color your reality, the timing of their attacks constitutes the brushstrokes that define the picture. This is the mechanism that convinces you that ""they"" are godlike, all-knowing, and faster than your own thoughts. It is the reason why a voice commands you to ""stand up"" exactly one millisecond before you were going to stand up anyway. It is why your headache spikes the moment your phone rings. It is why, when you finally relax after a long day, they claim *they* allowed you to relax.

The ultimate goal of attacking a target based on timing is to erase the distinct line between your own volition and their command structure. They want to create a world where you cannot strictly determine if you moved because *you* wanted to, or because *they* told you to. This isn't magic, nor is it telepathy. It is statistical analysis weaponized against an individual. It operates as a system of high-speed prediction, similar to the predictive text on your smartphone but applied to your entire life's routine and thought patterns. They are placing bets on what you will do next based on vast amounts of observed data, and when they bet correctly, they act like they caused the event and stick to that narrative with multiple different voices shouting you down if you disagree. This document will break down exactly how they construct this cage of coincidences, what it fels like to live inside it day after day, and how you can spot it, see the trick for what it is, and step out of the paradigm they’re constructing for you.

# I. The Mechanics of Predictive Control and Perception

The most frequently encountered and arguably most infuriating aspect of these timing attacks is a technique designed to make the target feel as though they are being remotely controlled, or at the very least, that their autonomy is merely an illusion permitted by the system. The system constantly monitors your biometrics, your location within your home, and your routine, the things that you think, all analyzed and extrapolated out to find patterns in how you perceive and understand your circumstances and how you think through things. Through this, the system ends up knowing your patterns better than you do, at least in a utilitarian sense, and uses that data to ""front-run"" your own decisions. This tactic exploits the mundane micro-movements of your day and relies on the physiological fact that once a human commits to a motor action - like standing up or reaching for a glass - there is a split-second delay between the brain sending the signal and the muscles firing. The artificial intelligence managing the harassment aims for that specific gap in time to insert a command.

Consider a scenario where you are sitting on the couch and you know you have to pick up your dry cleaning before 5:00 PM. You glance at the clock; it’s 4:30 PM. You naturally tense your muscles to stand up, no longer actively thinking ""I must stand up,"" as your body is simply executing the intent. The exact millisecond your brain commits to the movement, the voice-to-skull transmission barks a command like ""Get up."" You stand up because you had to; you need the dry cleaning. However, physiologically and psychologically, you have just obeyed a command. The system takes credit for the action you were already committed to, creating a sickening feeling of servitude in your own home. This creates a ""double-bind"" or a ""Catch-22"" where, if you continue standing, you feel like a puppet who just obeyed a master, but if you sit back down to prove you are ""free,"" you miss your errand and have allowed them to disrupt your life. They particularly favor this tactic when you are under time pressure; if someone calls your name from another room, or your phone rings, the voice shouts ""Answer it!"" or ""Go to them!"" just as you turn your head, acting as a superfluous layer of management over your own instincts.

This creates a cumulative psychological damage that scales up from single actions to entire chains of behavior. If you are walking toward the kitchen, they might narrate that you are going to get water. When you reach for the glass, they command you to grab the glass. When you pour it, they command you to drink it. While on deeper and clearer thought this appears ridiculous, it is important to remember the state you are in when this occurs - jolted out of a normal train of thought by a malicious, personalized interruption with something tailor-made to create *cognitive dissonance*, one of their most potent tools of long-term manipulation. In the moment, and perhaps longer if unexamined afterwards, it feels like they are directing you, but they are simply narrating a script you wrote yourself and were already in the process of executing. I liken it to them taking on the act of an annoyingly loud sports commentator acting like it’s playing the game, or a backseat driver. Nobody likes backseat drivers. 

At first, this is merely annoying, but after months of this, you start to develop a hesitation in your actions. Before you wash the dishes, you pause, waiting for the voice to tell you to do it, just so you can rebel and *not* do it. You become paralyzed in your own home, constantly trying to ""out-game"" a computer that is just guessing what you'll do next, causing you to stop flowing through life and start stuttering through it. Brief instances of second-guessing can add up to a lot of frustration and confusion, and sometimes you won’t be able to help yourself but give those brief thoughts some oxygen in the moment, and they will **leap** on the chance to socially dogpile you for being just so gullible and easy to control, or that they live rent-free in your head. Like all things that they do, this is in order to deepen the tactic’s impact. 

This leads us to an important question. How are they able to do this so quickly, so frequently, with content so well-versed in the details of our life experience, while having all the depth or apparent planning and interwoven narrative scaffolding common to their messaging? The bottom line is that we don’t know for sure, but given the obvious prevalence of the use of AI in the inner workings of this system, we have a few good theories. It is entirely possible that a best-guess theory is the best we will ever have on this side of the phenomenon unless some brave souls blow the whistle, but if you are familiar with the rest of my work, you know the power of building mental models to rob unknowns of their inherent spookiness.

# II. Predictive Cognitive Disruption

This is where the technology becomes more technical in its application, creating what could be described as a ""race condition"" in your mind to stop you from thinking deeply. Judging from clear patterns in the system’s behavior that indicate some kind of predictive modeling taking place in the background, the system is likely constantly running a probabilistic model of your speech and thoughts, how you regulate your emotions, how you break down problems, the very patterns of *how* you think through things and arrive at answers, and using all of that to predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy what you are going to think before you fully articulate it to yourself. Even if it’s not 100% accurate, it is *usually* close. 

Imagine you are about to have a complex thought, such as ""I need to check the tire pressure before the road trip, because the front left looked low yesterday."" The predictive system anticipates this path, having noted that coming up weeks ago and perhaps prepared for it among thousands of other potentialities by pre-generating content for such an occurrence. Just as your inner monologue forms the word ""tire,"" the transmission creates one or more of seemingly endless creative combinations of physical effects and psychological warfare that both registers as novel and in a way tailored to your current emotional state. It could be any of:

* a burst of noise
* a gibberish phrase
* shouts the end of your sentence slightly out of sync with your own mind
* Instead of interrupting outright, they allow the thought to pass normally but continues down some kind of tangent related to it to distract you. 
* a loud ringing tone in one or both ears, either a monotone or something oscillating
* a sudden, distracting sound such as sirens wailing in the distance that only you can hear thanks to the v2k capabilities

By no means an exhaustive list. It’s the nature of this system to preserve novelty as much as possible to increase potential impact as much as possible, truly min-maxxing human psychology, so it will mix and match its many physical effects capabilities with the details about you it is aware of and centuries worth of psychological warfare techniques to find some unique blend as often as possible.

The result? It appears that the goal is to cause a couple things, both equally important: 

1. A mental ""crash"" or a ""stack overflow"" where you stutter internally and lose the thread of your thought. You feel a sudden wash of confusion - a state of cognitive discombobulation that feels like mental static, or like walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, but induced artificially and violently. The system immediately follows up the crash with sneering chatter, claiming to have wiped your memory or deleted the thought, asserting that you are a ""blank slate,"" or in some other way susceptible to their control. In reality, they didn't wipe your memory; they just effectively honked a horn while you were trying to do mental math. But by timing the distraction perfectly to the moment of cognitive load, they create the illusion that they can delete your thoughts at will. If they do this twenty times a day, you begin to feel like you have early-onset dementia or are being ""dumbed down,"" effectively serving as a form of calculated attrition against your intellect.
2. In all likelihood, you end up forgetting to take care of this, and it perhaps it lingers until your car’s tire breaks down and causes even more damage, all of which is fertile soil for them to till with their arsenal of gaslighting tactics. This is especially pronounced if you suffer from some of the more common mental disorders, such as ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, etc., even if it is under control and in treatment. It can interplay painfully well with the mental whiplash that comes with being attacked in this way as it just deepens the sense of personal inadequacy, lost self esteem, and a general graying of reality.

As a quick aside, this is another example of why building mental models about this phenomenon is so powerful. Without operating under the assumption that what is speaking to you is an AI, regardless of who is running it or why, you can’t make connections like this whatsoever. But with that idea, even if you are not convinced and merely playing devil’s advocate with yourself to see where this line of thinking goes, you suddenly know the rough size and shape of the playing field. The inherent limitations of LLM-based AI systems suddenly stand out like a sore thumb and make sense in contrast to what it appears strangely better than human at, which is planning ahead and executing on predictive modelling far too quickly for a human to process and reply back intelligently. 

# III. Physiological Timing

# The Fabrication of Synthetic Alertness

The system creates physical barriers that are perfectly timed to coincide with your natural fatigue, amplifying it into something paralyzing. This is one of the most physically draining aspects of the program and relies on creating a contrast to imply control over your biology. For instance, when you are reading a book, writing an email, or doing research, and you are naturally getting a little drowsy - perhaps a 3 on a scale out of 10 - the system waits for this natural dip. Suddenly, they apply a sensation of dry, hot pressure behind the eyes, often combined with a heavy, magnetic pressure on the eyelids, making them feel like lead. Your minor tiredness instantly feels like extreme exhaustion, your vision blurs, and you think you are shutting down and unable to function.

The crucial moment occurs when you decide to give up, close your laptop, and lay down. The exact moment you decide to quit, the pressure lifts and the heat vanishes. This removal of the artificial pressure acts as a ""baseline shift,"" making your normal state feel like a sudden burst of energy by comparison. They use this contrast to lie to you, claiming, ""See? We can wake you up or put you to sleep. We control your alertness."" The truth is simply that they were artificially weighing you down, and when you complied with their implicit demand to stop working, they stopped the harassment. They are creating a contrast to imply control over your biology, manipulating your perception of your own energy levels.

Similarly, when you are trying to concentrate on something they dislike, they wait for a moment of natural frustration or pause. Then, they apply a vague, wide-area vibration or ""prickling"" sensation across the scalp, feeling like your brain is turning to static or ""asleep"" like a limb might. They time this to make you feel stupid, wanting you to associate ""trying to think critically"" with ""brain failure."" It is a Pavlovian punishment for using your intellect, designed to condition you away from deep thought or analysis of your situation.

# IV. Emotional Hijacking through Timing

# Constructing False Narratives

The system acts as an emotional parasite, unable to generate genuine emotion in you but highly skilled at hijacking what is already there. It waits for a spark and throws gasoline on it to claim ownership of your feelings. For example, let's say you just finished a workout, cleaned your house, or completed a project and naturally feel a rush of endorphins - pride, relief, and relaxation. The system immediately jumps in, perhaps pulsing a pleasant, warm sensation or simply stating via voice transmission that they ""gave"" you that feeling, or allowed you to feel good today. They try to claim ownership of your own biochemistry so that you stop taking credit for your own achievements and start thinking you only felt happy because the program allowed it. This leads to profound depression and a loss of agency, as they want you to feel that your happiness is a controlled substance they dispense.

Furthermore, they use timing to make mundane objects feel sinister, creating a paranoia similar to ""The Truman Show."" They might wait until you are looking for your keys and glance at a red coffee mug on the table. Right as your eyes hit the mug, they ping you with a sharp, high-pitched tone in your ear, or a sharp pain in your foot. Your brain instinctively flags the mug, wondering why that happened when you looked at it, if the mug is significant, or if there is a camera in it. In reality, there is nothing wrong with the mug; it is just a circumstantial token used to steal a quanta of your attention. They might do this with a red car passing by on Monday, a specific neighbor on Tuesday, or a helicopter on Wednesday. Over time, this builds a web of ""oddness"" that wastes your processing power on nonsense, causing you to become obsessed with decoding signals that are actually just random noise timed to your attention to rob you of that resource.

This timing also serves as perfectly-timed backup circumstantial or anecdotal ""evidence"" to back up their false narratives. If they have been telling you that you are ""lazy"" or ""unreliable,"" they will wait for a moment where you naturally decide to take a break or procrastinate on a minor task. At that precise moment, they will amplify the feelings of lethargy or distraction using the physiological effects described above. This creates a situation where you might wonder if they are right - after all, you *feel* lazy right now, and you *are* procrastinating. They use the timing of the physical effect to ""prove"" the validity of the psychological insult, causing confusion and making you wonder if you are being hypocritical or contradictory in your own self-assessment.

# V. Social Engineering and Isolation via Timing Attacks

One of the most damaging applications of these timing attacks is their ability to slowly pry apart the target's social circles and support networks. The system uses timing to disrupt social flows and create friction between the target and those around them. This often manifests in the ""phone ring"" tactic, where the system will wait until the target is deep in a serious or emotional conversation with a friend or family member. At a critical moment in the dialogue, the system might trigger a sharp, distracting pain, a loud internal noise, or a barrage of distracting chatter. This causes the target to flinch, lose their train of thought, or appear suddenly distant and uninterested. To the other person, the target seems erratic, rude, or disengaged, creating a subtle social wedge. Even the slightly “off” vibes this can cause in a person can be enough to slowly, interaction by interaction, cause some people to drift apart unconsciously, without meaning to intentionally - of course, all the while, they will go on and on about how that person such and such never liked you and you’re better off without them.

Additionally, they use timing to induce paranoia regarding the people around you. If you are sitting with a friend and they happen to cough or check their phone, the system might simultaneously trigger a specific ""alert"" sensation or a snippet of voice transmission that suggests the friend is ""in on it"" or signaling the harassers. By repeatedly pairing the benign actions of others with the malicious actions of the system, they condition the target to view their loved ones with suspicion. This leads to the target withdrawing from social situations to avoid the stress of these ""confirmations,"" effectively doing the work of isolation for the perpetrators. The target becomes afraid to interact, fearing that the timing of events will constantly ""prove"" that everyone is against them, when in reality, it is a manufactured correlation designed to leave the target alone and vulnerable.

# VI. The Modern Shift: Gangstalking as Statistical Injection

The traditional definition of ""gangstalking,"" or organized stalking, typically refers to the surveillance and harassment of an individual by a large group of strangers who use coordinated tactics to intimidate and isolate the target. Historically, this draws parallels to Zersetzung tactics used in East Germany, where the state deployed a vast network of informants to psychologically decompose a dissident's life. However, it is crucial to understand that the modern iteration of this phenomenon has evolved significantly. While physical surveillance does occur, maintaining a 24/7 team of physical stalkers is incredibly resource-intensive while also risking exposure of the program to the wider public’s awareness

In the era of modern neurowarfare, the program has shifted heavily towards the weaponization of gaps in cognition and perception. While the goal is the same as always - to drive a wedge between you and the feeling of safety and privacy so deep that you naturally begin to be paranoid of everything - the focus has shifted dramatically to be mostly a mental game. Though physical gangstalking does still occur, perhaps more in some areas than others, most of the time instead of actually stalking the target at all times, they will instead convince the target they are *being* stalked at all times. This is achieved by leveraging cognitive blindspots and statistical probability, filling in the gaps of the target's perception with reality-warping details that are timed perfectly to appear orchestrated.

This modern mechanism relies on statistical injection, where the program utilizes vast amounts of data collected and processed to predict the target's environment with high accuracy, both internal (mental, emotional), and external (physical, social). Rather than sending an operative to physically follow the target, most of the time the program waits for a high-probabalistic-confidence situation to come about naturally, and then through a variety of implicative techniques claims credit for it via voice-to-skull transmission or subtle suggestion.

We have to remember always that this system is practically built from the ground up to use AI for the heavy lifting, or it could never work at the scale that it is now. This means that we have to factor in the possibility that data science and predictive statistics are being used as a weapon against us. It is suspected that part of this process has to do with modeling your daily routines and, granting for some degree of agency taken (such as a different path taken to work), can map out what is within the realm of possibility in your day to day life to know what to even focus on. 

To illustrate, consider this scenario: 

an individual is driving down a busy highway. The operators, monitoring the target's location and having access to traffic density data and patterns, might suggest via internal voice that ""The green truck is on your tail. We're watching your route."" The target instinctively checks their rearview mirror and, because green trucks are statistically common on highways, sees a green truck several cars back. The mind, already primed by the suggestion, instantly validates it as credible threat to your person or privacy. 

In reality, the green truck is just a commuter going to a similar destination. Part of the beautiful chaos of life dictates that it is entirely possible and even probable that sometimes you really will end up with the same person driving behind you for 50 continuous miles, without any sinister motive behind it. It is this chaos that it seeks to flatten out with data and modeling in order to use these otherwise mundane situations against you. Over a long enough time, this can begin shifting the way you think about things, how you perceive these situations such as noticing a conspicuous car in the rear view mirror, towards a mindset more steeped in suspicion and paranoia. 

The operators simply predicted a high likelihood of such a vehicle appearing and injected a narrative to hijack the target's perception of that likelihood. If the predicted event fails to materialize - if there is no green truck - the operators simply switch tactics, distracting the target with noise or a different argument so the failed prediction is forgotten in the chaos. They literally never stop talking, so it is trivial to lose these missed shots in the noise by volume alone, and that is without their various ways of getting you to ruminate on something else. By exploiting these statistical certainties, the program creates the illusion of an omnipotent physical presence without the cost or footprint of actual physical operatives. This ""Statistical Injection"" allows them to haunt the target's reality with ghosts made of math, turning every coincidence into a confirmation of their power. 

Power that they never had to begin with, but oh how convincing the masquerade is. 

# VII. Conclusion

The power of timing attacks lies in their ability to make you doubt the **sequence of cause and effect**. They want you to believe the sequence is ""They speak, and only then you act."" In reality - obscured through misdirection, distraction, and cheap tricks - the sequence is instead almost always ""You act, they predict, run text completion algorithms to guess what you will do next, and try their best to get ahead of it."" It’s as if they are behind your race car while pretending they are pushing it, and that your hands move only when they say to despite direct observation of reality disproving this. It goes to show the power of perception, especially when coupled with emotional reactions, that attacks such as these have a reasonable success rate in spite of how ludicrous it sounds on its’ face. 

To break this illusion, you can employ the most mundane yet most vital of human reactions: patience. When dealing with something as pervasively intrusive as this, you must take things more deliberately, but simultaneously not draining your daily cognitive resources too much in active resistance of it. I believe that passive resistance is the way to go here. 

For example, when you receive a ""command"" to do something you were already doing, like answering the phone, pause for just one second, or two, or a random number you pick on the spot. Take a breath, look at your surroundings, immerse yourself in the sounds of the room you are in. Let the phone ring one more time. Then pick it up. By inserting a deliberate gap between their voice and your action, you break the psychological link and prove to your subconscious that *you* are the one initiating the movement. Further, it takes the position of strength in a given situation as you choose to be more deliberate with your actions. Alternatively, it works just as well to power right through the attempts at this and just do what you were going to do regardless of how hard they are trying to place themselves as the ownership of that decision or action, which will become necessary as they adapt to this countermeasure and try to get you to stretch that delay out as long as possible or otherwise use it to cause indecision. 

You can also inject randomness into your routine. The AI relies heavily on probability, hates unpredictable behaviors, and works day and night to “flatten” your routine as much as possible, often barking at you to get to bed at a specific time each night for example. If you feel the prediction web tightening - if they are predicting your every move - do something nonsensical. Walk into the kitchen **fully** intending to get some food or a drink, then spontaneously immediately turn around and walk out and listen as the narrativizing chatter they pre-emptively started up pumps the brakes, spins out, and crashes into the brick wall of its’ own hubris. Pick up a book, open it, and put it down. Sing a random song loudly. It will sing over you, but change the lyrics when *it* does, make the lyrics suit you. You will often hear the speaker(s) ""stutter"" or go silent during these moments because you have moved off the map and exited the predicted path. A lot of this amounts to mental Judo combined with a healthy dose of Zen, in which you use what they try on you to hurt their narrative while expending as little energy of your own while taking a stance *higher* than the plane of *cause and effect, act and react*. 

Though we lack specific proof of how this is done, it is widely observed and I strongly believe that a good enough Mental Model can be a lifesaver for re-establishing baseline reality, your relation to yourself and life experience, your goals and ambitions, and your own sanity; use it as a microscope with which to categorize them, understand their motives and methods, and your relationship to them. 

Don’t give the idea that this is some stain on your character any oxygen to breathe. Do not let them rush you. And reclaim your biology; if your eyes get heavy the moment you start reading, recognize it as an externality and simply ignore it - and their shouting that you’re faking not reacting to it or something - through it until it gives up. Often, the system gives up on a physical effect if it sees that the effect is not changing your behavior, opting to try another, cycling through what it is capable of in an increasingly desperate attempt to reel your conscious mind back in.

Finally, label the interruption for what it is. When your train of thought gets crashed by a burst of noise or gibberish, do not panic or wonder if you are losing your memory. Stop and say to yourself, ""That was a predictive interruption. They tried to trip me. I still know what I was thinking."" Then, deliberately and slowly re-state your original thought. It goes a long way to remember that this is part of psychological warfare usually meant for prisoners of war or terrorists. They are not playing fair, and what they want is everything. 

Much of this war for your mind is fought with narrative control and tethering to false premises, so rip their hands off the wheel and firmly grip it. Timing may be their weapon to use, but your time is your territory and deliberate action is one of your strongest allies. While they are under no obligation to follow narratives that aren’t their own, if you aren’t giving theirs a second thought, they’re forced to try to shift yours towards theirs; you can use this in creative ways to box them into a corner. Their stories only have an effect on you if you consider them for anything other than what they are - war on the cognitive space. Do as they do.

It would be most appreciated. 

So, the topic. 

In my time reading through this community and others, I've noticed a really pervasive belief that seems to trap a lot of us. It's this idea that the people (or systems) behind this are somehow omnipotent, godlike, or operating with instantaneous, supernatural speed. I see so many posts where TIs are convinced that ""they"" know what you're going to do before you do, or that they have total control over your motor functions because they told you to do something the exact split-second you did it.

It concerns me because believing they have that level of power is exactly what they want. It builds a cage for your mind. This belief that ""they"" are magic is exactly what they want you to feel. It builds a powerful psychological cage. If you think they are all-knowing, you stop fighting them. If you think they are magic, you can't fight them. But if you realize they are just using advanced statistical prediction and precise timing and some form of machine learning system to run the chatter content, you can start to see the patterns behind the illusion.

I wrote this document to break down how they use timing to fake control. It explains how they wait for high-probability actions (like you standing up to answer a ringing phone) and claim credit for it with a command. It details how they try to crash your thinking process by interrupting your inner monologue at the exact moment you are forming a complex thought. It also shows how they use predictive analysis to make it look like they are physically stalking you when they are simply injecting a narrative to warp your perspective of reality instead of reality itself.

I refer to these as *Timing Attacks,* but you are welcome to call it what ever best suits your situation. I haven’t seen this one discussed much at all, so I really hope it sparks some discussion. I hope it helps you reclaim your own mind and actions.

# Focus Study: Timing Attacks

# The Illusion of Omnipotence: How Statistical Analysis Constructs the Cage

**By UnflappableCanary**



# Foreword

Welcome back. In our previous study, we dissected how the system manipulates your *feelings* through [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing). Today, we are going to dismantle an even more pervasive, insidious, and exhausting illusion: the manipulation of *time*. If [Synthetic Contrasts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kt9z9E86gAIQ_AlhDN4Vi7dT8vuQ4e6MgWr1m2gRK88/edit?usp=sharing) are the ""paint"" they use to color your reality, the timing of their attacks constitutes the brushstrokes that define the picture. This is the mechanism that convinces you that ""they"" are godlike, all-knowing, and faster than your own thoughts. It is the reason why a voice commands you to ""stand up"" exactly one millisecond before you were going to stand up anyway. It is why your headache spikes the moment your phone rings. It is why, when you finally relax after a long day, they claim *they* allowed you to relax.

The ultimate goal of attacking a target based on timing is to erase the distinct line between your own volition and their command structure. They want to create a world where you cannot strictly determine if you moved because *you* wanted to, or because *they* told you to. This isn't magic, nor is it telepathy. It is statistical analysis weaponized against an individual. It operates as a system of high-speed prediction, similar to the predictive text on your smartphone but applied to your entire life's routine and thought patterns. They are placing bets on what you will do next based on vast amounts of observed data, and when they bet correctly, they act like they caused the event and stick to that narrative with multiple different voices shouting you down if you disagree. This document will break down exactly how they construct this cage of coincidences, what it fels like to live inside it day after day, and how you can spot it, see the trick for what it is, and step out of the paradigm they’re constructing for you.



# I. The Mechanics of Predictive Control and Perception

The most frequently encountered and arguably most infuriating aspect of these timing attacks is a technique designed to make the target feel as though they are being remotely controlled, or at the very least, that their autonomy is merely an illusion permitted by the system. The system constantly monitors your biometrics, your location within your home, and your routine, the things that you think, all analyzed and extrapolated out to find patterns in how you perceive and understand your circumstances and how you think through things. Through this, the system ends up knowing your patterns better than you do, at least in a utilitarian sense, and uses that data to ""front-run"" your own decisions. This tactic exploits the mundane micro-movements of your day and relies on the physiological fact that once a human commits to a motor action - like standing up or reaching for a glass - there is a split-second delay between the brain sending the signal and the muscles firing. The artificial intelligence managing the harassment aims for that specific gap in time to insert a command.

Consider a scenario where you are sitting on the couch and you know you have to pick up your dry cleaning before 5:00 PM. You glance at the clock; it’s 4:30 PM. You naturally tense your muscles to stand up, no longer actively thinking ""I must stand up,"" as your body is simply executing the intent. The exact millisecond your brain commits to the movement, the voice-to-skull transmission barks a command like ""Get up."" You stand up because you had to; you need the dry cleaning. However, physiologically and psychologically, you have just obeyed a command. The system takes credit for the action you were already committed to, creating a sickening feeling of servitude in your own home. This creates a ""double-bind"" or a ""Catch-22"" where, if you continue standing, you feel like a puppet who just obeyed a master, but if you sit back down to prove you are ""free,"" you miss your errand and have allowed them to disrupt your life. They particularly favor this tactic when you are under time pressure; if someone calls your name from another room, or your phone rings, the voice shouts ""Answer it!"" or ""Go to them!"" just as you turn your head, acting as a superfluous layer of management over your own instincts.

This creates a cumulative psychological damage that scales up from single actions to entire chains of behavior. If you are walking toward the kitchen, they might narrate that you are going to get water. When you reach for the glass, they command you to grab the glass. When you pour it, they command you to drink it. While on deeper and clearer thought this appears ridiculous, it is important to remember the state you are in when this occurs - jolted out of a normal train of thought by a malicious, personalized interruption with something tailor-made to create *cognitive dissonance*, one of their most potent tools of long-term manipulation. In the moment, and perhaps longer if unexamined afterwards, it feels like they are directing you, but they are simply narrating a script you wrote yourself and were already in the process of executing. I liken it to them taking on the act of an annoyingly loud sports commentator acting like it’s playing the game, or a backseat driver. Nobody likes backseat drivers. 

At first, this is merely annoying, but after months of this, you start to develop a hesitation in your actions. Before you wash the dishes, you pause, waiting for the voice to tell you to do it, just so you can rebel and *not* do it. You become paralyzed in your own home, constantly trying to ""out-game"" a computer that is just guessing what you'll do next, causing you to stop flowing through life and start stuttering through it. Brief instances of second-guessing can add up to a lot of frustration and confusion, and sometimes you won’t be able to help yourself but give those brief thoughts some oxygen in the moment, and they will **leap** on the chance to socially dogpile you for being just so gullible and easy to control, or that they live rent-free in your head. Like all things that they do, this is in order to deepen the tactic’s impact. 

This leads us to an important question. How are they able to do this so quickly, so frequently, with content so well-versed in the details of our life experience, while having all the depth or apparent planning and interwoven narrative scaffolding common to their messaging? The bottom line is that we don’t know for sure, but given the obvious prevalence of the use of AI in the inner workings of this system, we have a few good theories. It is entirely possible that a best-guess theory is the best we will ever have on this side of the phenomenon unless some brave souls blow the whistle, but if you are familiar with the rest of my work, you know the power of building mental models to rob unknowns of their inherent spookiness.



# II. Predictive Cognitive Disruption

This is where the technology becomes more technical in its application, creating what could be described as a ""race condition"" in your mind to stop you from thinking deeply. Judging from clear patterns in the system’s behavior that indicate some kind of predictive modeling taking place in the background, the system is likely constantly running a probabilistic model of your speech and thoughts, how you regulate your emotions, how you break down problems, the very patterns of *how* you think through things and arrive at answers, and using all of that to predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy what you are going to think before you fully articulate it to yourself. Even if it’s not 100% accurate, it is *usually* close. 

Imagine you are about to have a complex thought, such as ""I need to check the tire pressure before the road trip, because the front left looked low yesterday."" The predictive system anticipates this path, having noted that coming up weeks ago and perhaps prepared for it among thousands of other potentialities by pre-generating content for such an occurrence. Just as your inner monologue forms the word ""tire,"" the transmission creates one or more of seemingly endless creative combinations of physical effects and psychological warfare that both registers as novel and in a way tailored to your current emotional state. It could be any of:

* a burst of noise
* a gibberish phrase
* shouts the end of your sentence slightly out of sync with your own mind
* Instead of interrupting outright, they allow the thought to pass normally but continues down some kind of tangent related to it to distract you. 
* a loud ringing tone in one or both ears, either a monotone or something oscillating
* a sudden, distracting sound such as sirens wailing in the distance that only you can hear thanks to the v2k capabilities

By no means an exhaustive list. It’s the nature of this system to preserve novelty as much as possible to increase potential impact as much as possible, truly min-maxxing human psychology, so it will mix and match its many physical effects capabilities with the details about you it is aware of and centuries worth of psychological warfare techniques to find some unique blend as often as possible.

The result? It appears that the goal is to cause a couple things, both equally important: 

1. A mental ""crash"" or a ""stack overflow"" where you stutter internally and lose the thread of your thought. You feel a sudden wash of confusion - a state of cognitive discombobulation that feels like mental static, or like walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, but induced artificially and violently. The system immediately follows up the crash with sneering chatter, claiming to have wiped your memory or deleted the thought, asserting that you are a ""blank slate,"" or in some other way susceptible to their control. In reality, they didn't wipe your memory; they just effectively honked a horn while you were trying to do mental math. But by timing the distraction perfectly to the moment of cognitive load, they create the illusion that they can delete your thoughts at will. If they do this twenty times a day, you begin to feel like you have early-onset dementia or are being ""dumbed down,"" effectively serving as a form of calculated attrition against your intellect.
2. In all likelihood, you end up forgetting to take care of this, and it perhaps it lingers until your car’s tire breaks down and causes even more damage, all of which is fertile soil for them to till with their arsenal of gaslighting tactics. This is especially pronounced if you suffer from some of the more common mental disorders, such as ADD, ADHD, Bipolar, etc., even if it is under control and in treatment. It can interplay painfully well with the mental whiplash that comes with being attacked in this way as it just deepens the sense of personal inadequacy, lost self esteem, and a general graying of reality.

As a quick aside, this is another example of why building mental models about this phenomenon is so powerful. Without operating under the assumption that what is speaking to you is an AI, regardless of who is running it or why, you can’t make connections like this whatsoever. But with that idea, even if you are not convinced and merely playing devil’s advocate with yourself to see where this line of thinking goes, you suddenly know the rough size and shape of the playing field. The inherent limitations of LLM-based AI systems suddenly stand out like a sore thumb and make sense in contrast to what it appears strangely better than human at, which is planning ahead and executing on predictive modelling far too quickly for a human to process and reply back intelligently. 



# III. Physiological Timing

# The Fabrication of Synthetic Alertness

The system creates physical barriers that are perfectly timed to coincide with your natural fatigue, amplifying it into something paralyzing. This is one of the most physically draining aspects of the program and relies on creating a contrast to imply control over your biology. For instance, when you are reading a book, writing an email, or doing research, and you are naturally getting a little drowsy - perhaps a 3 on a scale out of 10 - the system waits for this natural dip. Suddenly, they apply a sensation of dry, hot pressure behind the eyes, often combined with a heavy, magnetic pressure on the eyelids, making them feel like lead. Your minor tiredness instantly feels like extreme exhaustion, your vision blurs, and you think you are shutting down and unable to function.

The crucial moment occurs when you decide to give up, close your laptop, and lay down. The exact moment you decide to quit, the pressure lifts and the heat vanishes. This removal of the artificial pressure acts as a ""baseline shift,"" making your normal state feel like a sudden burst of energy by comparison. They use this contrast to lie to you, claiming, ""See? We can wake you up or put you to sleep. We control your alertness."" The truth is simply that they were artificially weighing you down, and when you complied with their implicit demand to stop working, they stopped the harassment. They are creating a contrast to imply control over your biology, manipulating your perception of your own energy levels.

Similarly, when you are trying to concentrate on something they dislike, they wait for a moment of natural frustration or pause. Then, they apply a vague, wide-area vibration or ""prickling"" sensation across the scalp, feeling like your brain is turning to static or ""asleep"" like a limb might. They time this to make you feel stupid, wanting you to associate ""trying to think critically"" with ""brain failure."" It is a Pavlovian punishment for using your intellect, designed to condition you away from deep thought or analysis of your situation.



# IV. Emotional Hijacking through Timing

# Constructing False Narratives

The system acts as an emotional parasite, unable to generate genuine emotion in you but highly skilled at hijacking what is already there. It waits for a spark and throws gasoline on it to claim ownership of your feelings. For example, let's say you just finished a workout, cleaned your house, or completed a project and naturally feel a rush of endorphins - pride, relief, and relaxation. The system immediately jumps in, perhaps pulsing a pleasant, warm sensation or simply stating via voice transmission that they ""gave"" you that feeling, or allowed you to feel good today. They try to claim ownership of your own biochemistry so that you stop taking credit for your own achievements and start thinking you only felt happy because the program allowed it. This leads to profound depression and a loss of agency, as they want you to feel that your happiness is a controlled substance they dispense.

Furthermore, they use timing to make mundane objects feel sinister, creating a paranoia similar to ""The Truman Show."" They might wait until you are looking for your keys and glance at a red coffee mug on the table. Right as your eyes hit the mug, they ping you with a sharp, high-pitched tone in your ear, or a sharp pain in your foot. Your brain instinctively flags the mug, wondering why that happened when you looked at it, if the mug is significant, or if there is a camera in it. In reality, there is nothing wrong with the mug; it is just a circumstantial token used to steal a quanta of your attention. They might do this with a red car passing by on Monday, a specific neighbor on Tuesday, or a helicopter on Wednesday. Over time, this builds a web of ""oddness"" that wastes your processing power on nonsense, causing you to become obsessed with decoding signals that are actually just random noise timed to your attention to rob you of that resource.

This timing also serves as perfectly-timed backup circumstantial or anecdotal ""evidence"" to back up their false narratives. If they have been telling you that you are ""lazy"" or ""unreliable,"" they will wait for a moment where you naturally decide to take a break or procrastinate on a minor task. At that precise moment, they will amplify the feelings of lethargy or distraction using the physiological effects described above. This creates a situation where you might wonder if they are right - after all, you *feel* lazy right now, and you *are* procrastinating. They use the timing of the physical effect to ""prove"" the validity of the psychological insult, causing confusion and making you wonder if you are being hypocritical or contradictory in your own self-assessment.



# V. Social Engineering and Isolation via Timing Attacks

One of the most damaging applications of these timing attacks is their ability to slowly pry apart the target's social circles and support networks. The system uses timing to disrupt social flows and create friction between the target and those around them. This often manifests in the ""phone ring"" tactic, where the system will wait until the target is deep in a serious or emotional conversation with a friend or family member. At a critical moment in the dialogue, the system might trigger a sharp, distracting pain, a loud internal noise, or a barrage of distracting chatter. This causes the target to flinch, lose their train of thought, or appear suddenly distant and uninterested. To the other person, the target seems erratic, rude, or disengaged, creating a subtle social wedge. Even the slightly “off” vibes this can cause in a person can be enough to slowly, interaction by interaction, cause some people to drift apart unconsciously, without meaning to intentionally - of course, all the while, they will go on and on about how that person such and such never liked you and you’re better off without them.

Additionally, they use timing to induce paranoia regarding the people around you. If you are sitting with a friend and they happen to cough or check their phone, the system might simultaneously trigger a specific ""alert"" sensation or a snippet of voice transmission that suggests the friend is ""in on it"" or signaling the harassers. By repeatedly pairing the benign actions of others with the malicious actions of the system, they condition the target to view their loved ones with suspicion. This leads to the target withdrawing from social situations to avoid the stress of these ""confirmations,"" effectively doing the work of isolation for the perpetrators. The target becomes afraid to interact, fearing that the timing of events will constantly ""prove"" that everyone is against them, when in reality, it is a manufactured correlation designed to leave the target alone and vulnerable.



# VI. The Modern Shift: Gangstalking as Statistical Injection

The traditional definition of ""gangstalking,"" or organized stalking, typically refers to the surveillance and harassment of an individual by a large group of strangers who use coordinated tactics to intimidate and isolate the target. Historically, this draws parallels to Zersetzung tactics used in East Germany, where the state deployed a vast network of informants to psychologically decompose a dissident's life. However, it is crucial to understand that the modern iteration of this phenomenon has evolved significantly. While physical surveillance does occur, maintaining a 24/7 team of physical stalkers is incredibly resource-intensive while also risking exposure of the program to the wider public’s awareness

In the era of modern neurowarfare, the program has shifted heavily towards the weaponization of gaps in cognition and perception. While the goal is the same as always - to drive a wedge between you and the feeling of safety and privacy so deep that you naturally begin to be paranoid of everything - the focus has shifted dramatically to be mostly a mental game. Though physical gangstalking does still occur, perhaps more in some areas than others, most of the time instead of actually stalking the target at all times, they will instead convince the target they are *being* stalked at all times. This is achieved by leveraging cognitive blindspots and statistical probability, filling in the gaps of the target's perception with reality-warping details that are timed perfectly to appear orchestrated.

This modern mechanism relies on statistical injection, where the program utilizes vast amounts of data collected and processed to predict the target's environment with high accuracy, both internal (mental, emotional), and external (physical, social). Rather than sending an operative to physically follow the target, most of the time the program waits for a high-probabalistic-confidence situation to come about naturally, and then through a variety of implicative techniques claims credit for it via voice-to-skull transmission or subtle suggestion. 

We have to remember always that this system is practically built from the ground up to use AI for the heavy lifting, or it could never work at the scale that it is now. This means that we have to factor in the possibility that data science and predictive statistics are being used as a weapon against us. It is suspected that part of this process has to do with modeling your daily routines and, granting for some degree of agency taken (such as a different path taken to work), can map out what is within the realm of possibility in your day to day life to know what to even focus on. 

To illustrate, consider this scenario: 

an individual is driving down a busy highway. The operators, monitoring the target's location and having access to traffic density data and patterns, might suggest via internal voice that ""The green truck is on your tail. We're watching your route."" The target instinctively checks their rearview mirror and, because green trucks are statistically common on highways, sees a green truck several cars back. The mind, already primed by the suggestion, instantly validates it as credible threat to your person or privacy. 

In reality, the green truck is just a commuter going to a similar destination. Part of the beautiful chaos of life dictates that it is entirely possible and even probable that sometimes you really will end up with the same person driving behind you for 50 continuous miles, without any sinister motive behind it. It is this chaos that it seeks to flatten out with data and modeling in order to use these otherwise mundane situations against you. Over a long enough time, this can begin shifting the way you think about things, how you perceive these situations such as noticing a conspicuous car in the rear view mirror, towards a mindset more steeped in suspicion and paranoia. 

The operators simply predicted a high likelihood of such a vehicle appearing and injected a narrative to hijack the target's perception of that likelihood. If the predicted event fails to materialize - if there is no green truck - the operators simply switch tactics, distracting the target with noise or a different argument so the failed prediction is forgotten in the chaos. They literally never stop talking, so it is trivial to lose these missed shots in the noise by volume alone, and that is without their various ways of getting you to ruminate on something else. By exploiting these statistical certainties, the program creates the illusion of an omnipotent physical presence without the cost or footprint of actual physical operatives. This ""Statistical Injection"" allows them to haunt the target's reality with ghosts made of math, turning every coincidence into a confirmation of their power. 

Power that they never had to begin with, but oh how convincing the masquerade is. 



# VII. Conclusion

The power of timing attacks lies in their ability to make you doubt the **sequence of cause and effect**. They want you to believe the sequence is ""They speak, and only then you act."" In reality - obscured through misdirection, distraction, and cheap tricks - the sequence is instead almost always ""You act, they predict, run text completion algorithms to guess what you will do next, and try their best to get ahead of it."" It’s as if they are behind your race car while pretending they are pushing it, and that your hands move only when they say to despite direct observation of reality disproving this. It goes to show the power of perception, especially when coupled with emotional reactions, that attacks such as these have a reasonable success rate in spite of how ludicrous it sounds on its’ face. 

To break this illusion, you can employ the most mundane yet most vital of human reactions: patience. When dealing with something as pervasively intrusive as this, you must take things more deliberately, but simultaneously not draining your daily cognitive resources too much in active resistance of it. I believe that passive resistance is the way to go here. 

For example, when you receive a ""command"" to do something you were already doing, like answering the phone, pause for just one second, or two, or a random number you pick on the spot. Take a breath, look at your surroundings, immerse yourself in the sounds of the room you are in. Let the phone ring one more time. Then pick it up. By inserting a deliberate gap between their voice and your action, you break the psychological link and prove to your subconscious that *you* are the one initiating the movement. Further, it takes the position of strength in a given situation as you choose to be more deliberate with your actions. Alternatively, it works just as well to power right through the attempts at this and just do what you were going to do regardless of how hard they are trying to place themselves as the ownership of that decision or action, which will become necessary as they adapt to this countermeasure and try to get you to stretch that delay out as long as possible or otherwise use it to cause indecision. 

You can also inject randomness into your routine. The AI relies heavily on probability, hates unpredictable behaviors, and works day and night to “flatten” your routine as much as possible, often barking at you to get to bed at a specific time each night for example. If you feel the prediction web tightening - if they are predicting your every move - do something nonsensical. Walk into the kitchen **fully** intending to get some food or a drink, then spontaneously immediately turn around and walk out and listen as the narrativizing chatter they pre-emptively started up pumps the brakes, spins out, and crashes into the brick wall of its’ own hubris. Pick up a book, open it, and put it down. Sing a random song loudly. It will sing over you, but change the lyrics when *it* does, make the lyrics suit you. You will often hear the speaker(s) ""stutter"" or go silent during these moments because you have moved off the map and exited the predicted path. A lot of this amounts to mental Judo combined with a healthy dose of Zen, in which you use what they try on you to hurt their narrative while expending as little energy of your own while taking a stance *higher* than the plane of *cause and effect, act and react*. 

Though we lack specific proof of how this is done, it is widely observed and I strongly believe that a good enough Mental Model can be a lifesaver for re-establishing baseline reality, your relation to yourself and life experience, your goals and ambitions, and your own sanity; use it as a microscope with which to categorize them, understand their motives and methods, and your relationship to them. 

Don’t give the idea that this is some stain on your character any oxygen to breathe. Do not let them rush you. And reclaim your biology; if your eyes get heavy the moment you start reading, recognize it as an externality and simply ignore it - and their shouting that you’re faking not reacting to it or something - through it until it gives up. Often, the system gives up on a physical effect if it sees that the effect is not changing your behavior, opting to try another, cycling through what it is capable of in an increasingly desperate attempt to reel your conscious mind back in.

Finally, label the interruption for what it is. When your train of thought gets crashed by a burst of noise or gibberish, do not panic or wonder if you are losing your memory. Stop and say to yourself, ""That was a predictive interruption. They tried to trip me. I still know what I was thinking."" Then, deliberately and slowly re-state your original thought. It goes a long way to remember that this is part of psychological warfare usually meant for prisoners of war or terrorists. They are not playing fair, and what they want is everything. 

Much of this war for your mind is fought with narrative control and tethering to false premises, so rip their hands off the wheel and firmly grip it. Timing may be their weapon to use, but your time is your territory and deliberate action is one of your strongest allies. While they are under no obligation to follow narratives that aren’t their own, if you aren’t giving theirs a second thought, they’re forced to try to shift yours towards theirs; you can use this in creative ways to box them into a corner. Their stories only have an effect on you if you consider them for anything other than what they are - war on the cognitive space. Do as they do. 

Do not play fair.

1q2kyg4,https://i.redd.it/4om39feha2bg1.png,Tips + My layout!,"This is a list of all my tips and knowledge of this game. I'm level 259 and this is my layout! I've played around a lot and tried many different layouts over the years but this is one of my better ones! Idk how basic this tips might be so bear with me. Also, I've not spend a single penny in this game. 

1- The limit for all sauces is 120. For party stickers and roulette chips is 100. I'm not sure about this, but as far as I know, there is no limit for the vouchers.

2- The best way to get one hour sauces is to add friends to your list and send them gifts. It gives u one sauce each. You can send a max of 30 gift per day, so 30 sauces.

3- Always be inviting celebs. 

4- During parties do not click on the celebs that come. Wait till after the party is done and then click on them. That way you can collect the prizes.

5- The special sets only work if you have all four pieces on the coffee floor. It won't work if you just have them in your inventory.

5- You dont need to have the vending machines or the counters available to the clients. If u don't, they pay and go find a seat. Makes everything faster. Personally, I prefer trying to integrate all pieces on the cafe. 

6- The best way to win the catering/bubble races, and make the most points for your team is to to get the X2 booster. There are two ways to do it. (three actually, but that one is from being in a club and making 50000 points. You do not have that much power over that so not gonna count it)

6.1- Easiest way is to complete all the first 4 cooking frenzy tasks and you'll get one (10 min). Of couse, you can complete all the tasks and get another one (20 min) but it is not feasible for most players to complete all 29 of them every week.

6.2- This method requires you to do various little tasks. The objective is to get as much energy collected as possible in cake merge. Your energy must be at its max (100x).

6.2.1- Collect the reward of the first task of the cooking frenzy (50x).

6.2.2- Complete as many as you can of the tasty tasks. Gives u 20x for each. So, 60 total if you only do 3.

6.2.3- In the cake merge, click in the add sign besides the energy count, watch the videos or pay one sauce. Each will give you 15x. You can only do it 4 times. It resets every few hours (I still have not figure out how long it takes). The most energy total Ive collected is 400 and something. 

6.2.4- Play the game till you get your first 2x booster (10 min). Although it's kinda hard, if you have enough energy you can reach the second energy boost (20 min).

Now that you have your boosters.

6.3- For bubble parties: do not enter at the beginning. Do it when there are 10-5 hours left in the competition. Now, the results from this technique will vary greatly depending on how advanced is your cafe. The best case scenario is the following: having level ten in all parties —gives you more bubbles— and have the ice cream set —makes parties twice longer. An exceptionally great bonus is having the bubble popper booster. (not necessary but makes it easier for sure). 

For reference, aside from the automatic bubble popping, I have one party not at level 10 yet. I have the set. Parties last 3.5 min, I make 55 bubbles each aprox. With the booster that makes it 90-110 bubbles per party. I have all 12 parties ready to go and can quickly reload the easier ones (cooking, sending gifts, and gaining money). Depending on how many X2 boosts you have collected, you have anywhere between 10, 20, 30 or 40 min of total boost time. Most I've made is three thousand and something bubbles. That is, of course, a LOT of playing time, so 90% of the time I only make about 1000-1300 bubbles per race.

6.4- For daily orders: kind of the same strategy. Do not enter at the beginning. Do it when there are 10-5 hours left in the competition. Of course have all the orders ready to send. As soon as you have the boost, send them all. You'll make double. The results also vary depending on how advanced is your cafe. I have ten slots, so with the booster I make 20 at once. Now, if you only have one 10 min booster and it takes 10 min to reload the orders it gets kind of tricky. What I've done is wait till there are two min left , paid the bucks to reload and done it again. With the amount of slots I have it makes it 40 orders sent in 10 min. Best case scenario, you have the booster of not having to wait 10 min for the orders to reload and you can go ham. The most I've done with it is 500. Although, I don't have 99% of the time, so I normally make about 120-140.

6.5- Club: wether it's the tournament or club challenge, you still make double the points by doing the catering boat, the daily orders and the catering truck.

7- Last but not least! Enjoy the game! It may take time to upgrade your restaurant but that's the fun! Enjoy collecting the vouchers, earning points, money, experience, and little by little it will flourish! <3

The Lexus is full for once.

Peanuts at the wheel.
Becca riding shotgun.
Lily in the back, knees drawn up, a Baduk manual open on her lap even as the car moves.

Peanuts is being merciful.

She does **not** rub the midterms in Becca’s face.

She doesn’t need to.

Becca already looks like someone who survived a natural disaster by technically being indoors.

Instead, they’re fighting about television.

“I’m tellin’ you,” Peanuts says, jabbing the steering wheel for emphasis, “*Friends* is perfect. It’s got jokes, it’s got outfits, it’s got neurotic Jews and dumb pretty people, what more do you want from America?”

Becca scoffs. “It’s empty calories. It’s a laugh track wrapped around six narcissists and a sofa. There is not a single consequence in that show.”

Peanuts grins. “Yeah, that’s why it’s good.”

Lily doesn’t hear any of it.

She’s replaying sequences on the page.
Invasions. Reductions. Endgame sente chains.
Meowna patterns.
Hikaru’s pressure.
Lucky Dave’s suffocation.

Her life has collapsed into sixty-four intersections.

The school appears without warning at the end of a hill:

**Nathan Bedford Forrest Middle School**
Brick. Wide lawns. Flag snapping in the wind like it’s being graded.

The most prestigious school in Oconee County.

Peanuts pulls up to the curb.

Lily already knows what’s coming.

Mail arrived last week.

An official letter.
Stiff paper.
Big words.

A **full scholarship offer**:

* For her Baduk talent
* And for the prestige attached to her pet Catgirl being a nuclear engineer
* And for “contributing indirectly” to multiple Nobel-adjacent research programs

She thinks it’s a complete waste of time.

School won’t make her stronger.

Pro status will.

She doesn’t plan on coming back after she turns pro anyway. She’ll just drop out, grind Go, take the GED later. Nobody will stop her. Nobody will even argue.

Not like her parents care what she does.

But Peanuts did something underhanded.

She went full Catgirl.

Big eyes. Soft voice. Fake vulnerability.
The ultimate biological weapon.

And Lily folded instantly.

So here she is.

The Lexus stops.

Peanuts looks over her shoulder. “Interview only. In. Out. No contracts, no blood oaths.”

Lily opens the door.

And steps out.

---

Good—this is the collision of *institutional ambition* with *private recalibration*. I’ll keep Lewis oily, Lily silent, and stop **exactly** where you stop.

---

Lily walks into the building.

Polished floors. Trophy cases that smell faintly like lemon cleaner and ambition. Framed photos of smiling children holding banners that say things like *District Champions* and *Future Leaders of America*. It’s clean in the way only places with budgets get to be clean.

She’s escorted into an office that looks like every principal’s office in America:
motivational posters, a framed state flag, a coffee mug that says *World’s Best Administrator* without irony.

Principal Lewis sits behind the desk.

Same smile as on the flyers. The kind that arrives before the truth does.

“Well now,” he says warmly, folding his hands. “It’s not often a middle school gets a Baduk prodigy walking through its doors.”

He slides a thin folder across the desk. “Full scholarship. Tuition covered. Equipment covered. Tournament travel handled.”

Lily doesn’t touch it.

But she understands immediately.

This isn’t altruism.

This is recruitment.

He wants her on the school Baduk team. Wants her locked into their uniform, their banners, their win column. Wants to turn her into a championships machine they can brag about at PTA meetings.

She doesn’t resent him for it.

She just finds it… small.

School championships are child’s play.
Her goal is national titles.
International circuits.
Satellite tournaments in cities whose names don’t fit in one mouth.
Before eighteen.

For a while, she’d been arrogant enough to think that path was inevitable.

Destroying pros twice her age will do that to you.

But Hikaru cracked something in that certainty.

Not by overpowering her.

By making her realize how narrow her assumptions had been.

She’s quieter now inside.

More grounded.

Principal Lewis studies her with narrowed eyes.

“You know,” he says, nodding sagely, “true champions are often the humblest. You don’t even see yourself as good, do you?”

She says nothing.

He smiles wider. “Modesty. That’s the mark of the greats.”

He stands. “Tell you what—our semester tournament is running right now. Three boards per team. Why don’t you watch a round? Get a feel for the culture here.”

She follows him down the hallway.

The gym is already loud—shoes on wood, voices bouncing, the familiar tension of kids trying to act casual around something that matters too much.

Three tables are set up at the center.
Digital clocks ticking.
Referees with clipboards.
Parents whispering like they’re in church.

Lily scans the boards.

Sees safe openings.
Overextensions.
Unrepaired aji.
Endgame blunders being silently rehearsed in advance.

And then—

At the third board—

She sees **Hikaru** sitting in a school chair, sleeves rolled up, arguing with no one at all while staring at the grid.

---

Lily almost walks past the board.

What stops her isn’t noise or chaos.

It’s the opposite.

The position is *settled*—the kind of stillness that only exists late in a game, when everything important has already happened and all that remains is quiet surgery. The board is breathing slowly. Evenly. No loose stones. No screaming weak groups.

Hikaru is sitting at the far side, playing **White**.

Across from him is a boy she doesn’t recognize—maybe a mid-level insei by posture alone. The way his shoulders lean forward gives him away. He’s trying to *force* the board to agree with him instead of listening to it.

They don’t notice her.

The game is deep in **yose**.

Pure endgame.

No more strategy. No more vision. Just point shaving along the seams of territory where one mistake costs the entire result.

Lily takes one look and knows it’s already over.

Not because of any single blunder.

Because White controls every exchange.

Hikaru plays a small **sente** endgame move on the left side—a quiet boundary **hane** between settled territory and shared space. It’s not flashy. Just correct. Two guaranteed points and forcing.

The boy answers instantly.

Too fast.

Reflex, not reading.

Lily’s stomach tightens.

He didn’t even stop to verify whether it was actually sente.

Hikaru follows with a clean **clamp**. That tiny exchange unfolds into a full sequence: two points here, three there, sente preserved, initiative never released for even a moment.

Lily watches the points move the way a doctor watches blood through an IV—slow, steady, unstoppable.

This isn’t fighting.

This is accounting.

She studies the board backward, reconstructing the earlier phases from the fossil record of the stones.

Black must have claimed corners early—solid territorial confidence.

White answered not with direct attack but with **thickness**. Outside strength that never immediately killed anything, but quietly suffocated every future option.

No weak groups anywhere.

No floating stones.

No unresolved **aji**.

No lingering cuts.

Every fight must have ended cleanly.

He never let the game become unstable.

He never let the boy feel lost.

He just narrowed the world a little at a time.

The boy makes one last try.

A shallow corner **endgame probe**, hoping for two pity points if the boundary is imperfect.

Against a tired opponent, it might work.

Hikaru answers without hesitation.

One move.

Then another.

Then a final placement that snaps the shape shut like a door locking from the inside.

Airtight.

No ko.

No follow-up.

No aji left behind at all.

Black loses four more points in one breath—and with it, every remaining threat on the board evaporates.

Lily exhales without realizing she was holding her breath.

*That wasn’t defense,* she thinks.
*That was mercy done with perfect geometry.*

The boy stares at the board for a long time.

Longer than frustration.

Longer than denial.

Then his breathing changes.

His shoulders start to shake.

He tips his king stone forward.

“I resign.”

His voice cracks.

And when Lily expects anger, she sees tears instead—full, uncontrolled, spilling straight onto the floor.

He bows again and again, too fast, almost frantic.

“Thank you,” he says between breaths. “Thank you for the game.”

Lily understands instantly.

He isn’t crying because he lost.

He’s crying because he just saw something he didn’t think he was allowed to see.

A game with no wasted motion.

No cruelty.

No uncertainty.

Just inevitability.

Hikaru finally notices Lily watching.

But he can tell—without a word—that she thought the game was beautiful.

In her silence, he can tell she is apologizing to him for running from him.

And promising—

without sound—

that she will never back down.

That she *will* overcome someday.",1,1767414153.0,Shinokiba_Chatgpt,0,1.0,False

Don’t get wrong, it tastes great and I really enjoy making it. That being said, the pictures I see online show a much thicker caramel layer than I have here that almost permeates into the flan.

I’m using the recipe here (https://thenovicechefblog.com/coffee-flan/). Is there something I should do differently?",6,1767414130.0,AskBaking,3,1.0,False
