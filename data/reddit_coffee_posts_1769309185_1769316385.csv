( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1qm9fqc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qm9fqc,The “Help Me Fix My Laptop” Trap – Part 2: I Went to Uncle’s House and He Finally Broke 😈,"Two days after he left my place with stained trousers and a promise of silence, my phone buzzed at 8 PM. It was Raj Uncle again.

“Beta… agar laptop mein aur koi issue ho toh bata dena. Ya… agar tumhe help chahiye toh mere ghar aa jana. Main akela hoon aaj.”

My heart raced. He’d never invited me over before. I know his wife was away for a week, and he lived alone in that quiet bungalow three houses down. This wasn’t about the laptop anymore.

I replied: “Haan uncle… actually thoda sa doubt hai ek file mein. Main abhi aa jaati hoon?”

“Ji beta… darwaza khula hai. Seedha andar aa jana.”

I changed quickly—same pink crop top, but this time paired with an even shorter pleated skirt (the plaid one that flips up with every step). No panties, no bra. Flip-flops, hair loose, a little extra lip gloss. I slipped out quietly—mom and dad were watching TV in the living room, none the wiser.

His gate creaked when I pushed it open. The porch light was dim, house quiet except for the faint hum of the AC. I stepped inside, door clicking shut behind me.

“Uncle?” I called softly.

“In the living room, beta,” his voice came from the sofa—low, nervous.

He was sitting there in a loose kurta-pajama, TV on mute showing some news channel. The room smelled like his aftershave mixed with old books and faint incense from the puja corner. I kept my laptop on the coffee table. I can see my reddit was opened on his laptop.

I walked over slowly, skirt swaying, and sat right next to him—thigh pressed against his, closer than ever.

“Uncle… aapne laptop khola rakha hai? Aapne pics dekhi phir se?”

He swallowed hard, eyes flicking to my legs, then quickly away. Face already flushing. “Beta… main bas check kar raha tha ki… virus toh nahi hai.”

I leaned forward “to see the screen,” arching my back so the crop top rode up, exposing underboob and the fact I wasn’t wearing anything underneath. My nipple brushed his arm through the thin fabric.

“Uncle… yeh post kal daali thi. Dekho kitne comments aaye hain.”

I scrolled slowly—guys drooling: “That skirt needs to be flipped” “Bend over for uncle vibes” “Come sit on my lap baby”. His breathing turned heavy, chest rising fast. Bulge in his pajama pants grew obvious, tenting the thin cotton.

I bit my lip, voice innocent. “Uncle… aap phir se hard ho gaye ho. Kal wala secret yaad hai na? Aapne promise kiya tha kisi ko nahi bataoge.”

He nodded shakily. “Haan beta… promise… kisi ko nahi bataunga. Kabhi nahi.”

I shifted closer, hand resting on his thigh—fingers inching up slowly. “Uncle… aap akela ho na aaj? Koi nahi aayega?”

“Nahi beta… wife toh maike gayi hai. Ghar khali hai.”

My fingers brushed the hard outline through the pajama. He inhaled sharply. I palmed him gently—slow strokes up and down the shaft, feeling it throb and leak through the fabric.

“Uncle… yeh itna hard hai… mujhe dekh ke itna excite ho gaye ho?”

He groaned low. “Beta… yeh galat hai… par… main control nahi kar pa raha.”

I smiled sweetly. “Shhh uncle… relax karo. Main handle kar lungi. Promise, yeh bhi humara secret rahega.”

I kept stroking—firmer now, squeezing at the head, thumb circling the wet spot spreading on his pajama. His hips bucked slightly into my hand. Eyes half-closed, staring at the Reddit screen where a new comment popped: “That crop top is begging to come off.”

“Uncle… dekho kitne log mujhe chahte hain. Par aaj… sirf aapke liye.”

I sped up, hand moving faster. His breathing turned ragged, soft grunts escaping. Hand gripped the sofa cushion hard.

“Beta… bas… zyada mat karo… main… main jhad jaunga…”

I leaned in, lips near his ear. “Uncle… jhad jao na. Mujhe dekhna hai kitna maal aata hai aapka. Koi nahi jaanega. Promise.”

He groaned louder—hips jerking forward. Hot spurts soaked through the pajama, pulsing against my palm in thick waves. His whole body shook, head falling back, eyes squeezed shut. I kept stroking gently through the aftershocks until he was spent, pajama front drenched and sticky.

He panted, dazed, face wrecked. “Beta… yeh… maine yeh nahi socha tha…”

I pulled my hand away slowly, wiped it on his kurta playfully. “Uncle… ab aap relax karo. Laptop toh theek tha na?”

He nodded weakly. “Haan… theek hai.”

I stood up, fixed my skirt, gave him a quick hug—pressing my body against his wet front for a second.

“Uncle… kal phir aana mere ghar… ya main aa jaungi. Secret safe hai na?”

He looked up, voice barely audible. “Haan beta… promise… kisi ko nahi bataunga. Kabhi nahi.”

I walked out smiling, skirt flipping with every step, leaving him sitting there—pajama soaked, guilty, addicted, and completely mine.

1qm9fcy,https://i.redd.it/npa34x89cffg1.jpeg,I Tried chatGPT to make an Image for my last post..A WTF moment.,"I came back to AI creation expecting *some* rules — copyright, fair use, limits based on energy cost… sure, that all makes sense. What I didn’t expect was a system where failed attempts count against you, experimentation is punished, and curiosity runs out before creativity even starts.

Creation should feel like a canvas and paint — adventurous, messy, exploratory — not like a countdown timer where you’re afraid to try the wrong brushstroke. A “free tier” that doesn’t actually let you *learn* the tool isn’t a trial, it’s a tease.

What we really need is a **Linux-style revolution for AI**.

Not unlimited. Not reckless. Just **fair**.

A free and unencumbered AI ecosystem — image, video, and chat — with *reasonable* limits that respect energy costs but still allow people to explore, experiment, and fall in love with creation again. Something that treats curiosity as a feature, not a liability.

The internet doesn’t need another locked garden.  
It needs a **workshop**.

Open. Playable. Forgiving.

Because when creativity requires permission, subscriptions, and perfect behavior on the first try, something fundamental is lost. And once that sense of adventure is gone, the magic goes with it.",1,1769316026.0,WTFMAN,1,1.0,False

    I work 40 hours, want 3 gym sessions, and have family stuff on Sunday.  
    Help me build a schedule that’s actually realistic and includes downtime.

**“Clean up my rough notes”**

    Turn these notes into a clear to-do list with priorities:  
    [paste the mess]  
    Group them by project and add suggested deadlines.

**“Meal plan with whatever I have”**

    I’ve got eggs, rice, lentils, spinach, and cheese.  
    Give me 7 easy meals I can make without spending extra money.

**“Gift ideas with zero brainpower”**

    Need a birthday gift for my sister. She likes design, hiking, and coffee.  
    Budget is under $60. No clichés.

**“Explain adulting stuff simply”**

    Explain how [tax returns / mortgage rates / superannuation] work

Her lips were partly open as she breathed slowly, her eyes were closed, and she had a weak but confident smile. He could not believe she was sleeping next to him. She must have some nice dream. He snuck out of the bed, moved to the bathroom, and got the pills. He had to calm down, he had been wrecked with nightmares. He had been back in the camp, and when they came to grab their dinner, they didn’t take Tina, they took Kiko. And that had just been the beginning. He had dreamt he woke up next to her when four of those bugs crawled out of her, around him, he saw those cruel guards laughing as he could just look hopeless at her. He swallowed the pills and sat down at the toilet, waiting for the pills to take effect.  The door opened slowly, and Kiko peeked in.

“Are you okey?”

“Please don’t be a nightmare.” He whispered, and she looked at him, confused, but then she seemed to understand and reached for him, pulling him close.

“Hey, I’m real, I’m no dream. What happened? Jesus, you are sweating. You need a shower.”

He hugged her, then stepped back. Yeah, he was covered in sweat. “Sorry. I didn't mean to.”

She just smiled and pulled him into the shower. “Hey, I'm here, and it's okay. It's just bad dreams.”

He nodded and let her wash the nightmares away.

At the breakfast table, she looked at him. “That bad?”

“Yes, I was back in the camp. I could not protect you. They took you, and I had to watch as they did. And it kept repeating, I could not wake up. When it finished, a new nightmare started. I saw you die so many horrible ways. When I finally woke up, I had to get the pills.”

“Me? You had nightmares of me dying? That’s what scared you so much?” She just looked at him with an unreadable look on her face. He nodded as he nursed the coffee cup in his hand.

“Oh my goodness, I... my dream was... well, not a nightmare.” She said as she reached out and grabbed his hand, he smiled back at her.

“I know, you were smiling.”

“Mmmhmm, yeah…” She grinned slightly. “You made me very happy in my dream.”

He looked at her, confused, then he made the connection. “Oohh!” he chuckled. “That’s a much better dream.”

She nodded slowly, and they both smiled. He was about to pull her close when the AI alarm went off.

“*Peppermint is ready for flight, lightspeed, and long-range communication is still offline*.”

They looked at each other, then ignored it as they kissed.

Five hours later, they both strapped into the pilot seats. The nap in her arms had been exactly what he needed, and Kiko just leaned back in the seat and looked at him, smiling contentedly.

“Ready?”

“Yes, as ready as I can be.” She replied, and he blasted the ice wall, and it collapsed as Peppermint slowly rose from the ice ground. Everything had been packed and secured. The two droids, the mining equipment, and their makeshift shuttle were stored away.  Peter slowly flew the ship out of the ice cave, and when it had fully emerged, he aimed it upwards and pushed the throttle. The ship shot forward like a spear through the atmosphere.  And the blue sky turned black as the world was left behind.

“All systems are in the green. Wait. Air leak in section 25. Ship! Fix that and let me know how much air we're losing..."" he said as he sealed off the section.

Peter worked over the screens with a calm ease that only an experienced pilot would have. He smiled at Kiko, who was looking down at the planet. It was the first time they could actually admire it.

“It’s beautiful from up here.” She said, and he chuckled as he saw the leak would be closed up within fifteen minutes, and they would only lose a minimum of air.

He looked at the planet. It was a strange one, filled with large continents and islands. The more he looked at it, the less natural it looked. He looked back on the planet scans.

“Well, it’s clearly special. Look, no tectonic plates, with eighteen continents. From up here, it looks artificial.”

She looked at him. “its still beautiful.”

He looked down at it, then at her. “Yes, it is. And when we return, we can explore everything and be better prepared. Maybe find a nice tropical island to enjoy and build a vacation home.”

Her eyes widened for a second as she smiled. “I’m going to hold you for that.”

He chuckles, “I have made many promises, haven’t I?”

“Yes, and going to hold you to all of them. Especially the ring.” She replied, he chuckled.

“You will get your ring. I promise.”

“Yes!” she struck a pose, and he laughed.

“You're crazy!”

“And you love me for it,” she replied.

“Yes, I do. Now let’s head to the moon and check out that ship!” He turned the ship towards the moon and increased the speed.

Kiko looked at the screen and started scanning the moon as they approached for tech. The only tech she found was the ship, and it popped up on the screen.

“The name is SS Darkwood. The blackbox is active, downloading now.” She said then her screen was flooded with intel.

“Let's see. The ship is a colony ship en route to Furino 5.  Part of a three-ship convoy. It had three premade M-polo stations, a crew of seven, and 300 passengers. From what I can see. All researchers. They got sucked into a rogue wormhole and lost control.  They managed to launch the crew and the majority of the passengers to an island in the southern-temperate region. That was 127 years ago. Not all pods are left, and one is still active, stuck in the launch tube. The passengers there are in cryo, and bio signals are in green. The ship’s fuel cells are at 12%.”   She turned to him as he gave him the short version.

“If we take those fuel cells, then they would die, so we need to rescue them. Hell, they will die if we don’t rescue them. Hundred and twenty-seven years? They have no idea about the war or that the whole Furino system is colonized. That is crazy. Okay, so we rescue them, take the fuel cells.”

“What about the rest of the crew?”

“They have been down there for over a hundred years. We can drop by, but the crew is probably dead of old age. They might be the most advanced place on the planet, or they are all dead. Remember, the satellite didn't pick up any tech, like radio or that kind of thing.”

“yeah Lets check on them tomorrow and rescue these. Can we keep them in cryo, right? That’s less trouble for us.” Kiko said, looking at him.

“Why?” Then he looked over at her screen and saw the roster of only six people, all female, and he laughed.

“What?”

“Is it because they are all women?”

“Maybe, women are trouble.”

“You’re a woman, last I checked.”

She giggled. “Yeah, and look at how much trouble I got you into. You got swallowed by a snake because of me. Had to fight a whole city and packs of those Gymas. What do you think six more would lead too?”

“Okay, we can keep them in cryo as long as we have the power for that.” He moved the ship closer to the large wreck.  Kiko simply smiled like she had won a battle. He had not seen this side of her, and he found it amusing that she was jealous and protective of him. Maybe there was hope, and his worries were wrong.

 He flew the ship towards the launch side and scanned the damage. He would have to go out and cut away the hatch, but before that, he would have to stop the launch sequence.  When he told her, she immediately tried to hack the system.

“Hmm I can do it if you attach a nod to the launch panel. The system is too broken to be active remotely.”  He put the ship in hover mode and got up.

“Find me a nod, and while I get suited up. I need you to keep an eye out. See what else you can find. Location would be nice. As well as what cargo we can salvage. We have a lot of space, and we are going to need cash for that revenge plan of yours.”

It took them thirty minutes to get ready, and then he stepped out, floating to the ship and moving inside through a large tear. The hallways were dark, and he instantly grabbed his rifle, then turned on the lights on his helmet as he got used to the low gravity, and he jumped and fell down the hallway towards the escape pods. Much to Kiko’s amusement.

When he got there, most of them had already been launched, and five were still stuck. He checked them one by one, and it was clear that only one was active.  Kiko became serious when she realized the four others had crew that died in those pods. He opened the panel for the launch computer and connected the pod.

“Okay, I’m in. yeah if you had opened that door, then they would be tried launched, probably miss the destination. The navigation system is fried too. Okay, the launch is disabled. Keeping them in cryo. Check on them, no ogling.”

“ogling? They are probably old women, boring professors, and such.” He said as he entered the pod and looked at the six pods. Five young women in their early 30s lay sleeping peacefully in their tubes; their signals were all green, and apparently, they were all connected to some virtual reality. It was a way to keep the brain active while the body was in cryonic stasis.

“Old hags, you say? They are definitely staying in the cryo until we get safe.”

Peter laughed and looked over them, he had not looked at them as that and shook his head. “As you wish, my jealous girlfriend.”

“And don’t you forget it. I’m your girlfriend.”",1,1769315694.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1qm99wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qm99wn/nf_silent_death/,[NF] Silent Death,"The kitchen still smelled faintly of coffee, though no one brewed it anymore. Weeks had passed since her death, yet the room looked exactly the same, as if time itself had stalled out of respect—or avoidance. The clock above the sink ticked, each second pressing harder than the last.

“Why did you leave her when she needed you?”  
John’s voice broke the silence, sharp and sudden.

Jay’s eyes dropped to the table. The wood was scarred with old cuts and burns, memories of meals that no longer happened. “I… I didn’t know what to do,” she said. The words felt thin even to her.

“You didn’t know what to do?” John slammed his fist down. The dishes rattled. “She was dying, Jay. And you left.”

Jay flinched. “I thought Mika was there,” she said quickly, desperation creeping in. “I thought she wouldn’t be alone.”

“She wasn’t  there,” John shot back. “But she needed her girls.”

Mika stood by the counter, arms folded tight across her chest. She hadn’t planned to speak. She also left, but the weight of the words pressed against her ribs. “She’s gone, Dad,” she said quietly.

“I know she’s gone,” John snapped. “And it’s worse knowing her daughter left her..”

Jay looked up then. “I called,” she said. “I texted. I tried to help in other ways.”

“Other ways don’t matter,” John said. “You weren’t with her.”

Mika’s jaw tightened. “Neither were you,” she said before she could stop herself.

The room went still.

John turned to her slowly. “What did you say?”

Mika’s hands shook, but she didn’t uncross her arms. “You were always at work. You said there’d be time later.”

“I was providing for this family,” John said. His voice rose, defensive. “Someone had to keep things together.”

Jay swallowed. “I thought you’d be there,” she said softly. “You’re her husband.”

John’s mouth opened, then closed. He looked at the chair at the head of the table, the one she used to sit in. Dust had settled into the grooves of the seat.

“I couldn’t watch her fade,” he said finally. “I didn’t know how.”

Mika’s voice cracked. “None of us did.”

Silence settled over them, heavier now, no longer sharp with anger but thick with recognition. Jay stared at her hands. Mika watched the floor. John sank into the chair, his shoulders collapsing inward.

“She was our heart,” Mika whispered.

John pressed his palms into his eyes. His breath hitched once, then again. “And I wasn’t there,” he said. The words fell apart as he spoke them. “I should’ve been there.”

The clock kept ticking. Outside, a car passed, someone laughing as they walked by. Life, Unfairly, continued. Inside the kitchen the three of them sat in the wreckage of what they had done, each blaming the other refusing their own absence, the truth finally sat with them, not that one of them had failed, but that all of them had. That pain loomed over them.

And no one knew how to forgive that.

1qm99jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1qm99jn/i_milked_a_guy_like_a_cow/,I milked a guy like a cow,"Hello lovely people!

Okay so I’m 26M, gay, and masculine and dominant in every way, shape, and form.

To be fair, you would probably determine that I’m straight and masculine based on your first impressions of me.

So I’ve had a milking fetish for some time. Milking is actually quite popular in the BDSM community.

But I’m not referring to just jerking a guy off. I’m literally talking about having a guy on all fours and milking his cock like an udder. Basically treating him like a cum cow.

So after a while, I put up a post on a subreddit saying I’m looking to milk a straight cock. I literally got a bunch of DMs from straight, bi, and gay dudes. And I was quite straightforward with what I’m expecting to do with him.

I told him I have a desire to milk men like a cow. After I explained my desires, I met at his place. We briefly introduced ourselves to each other, and I asked him to undress for me. He is now is his boxers.

I asked him if he was ready to produce a lot of milk for me, and he replied with “yes sir”. So after I started playing with his bulge, I took his boxers off and asked him to get on the bed on all fours, referring to him being on his knees and elbows.

I started working on his cock and balls and started sensually stroking his udder. And I mentioned to him that while he ejaculates, he has to moo like a cow, and he agreed.

But I wanted to make this more interesting. I did bring a cup of coffee during this time, and I placed the cup of coffee directly under his udder and I told him I need milk for my coffee, and he agreed to help out. So as he is now ejaculating, he let out the biggest moo I’ve ever heard. As he was ejaculating, I massaged his balls and asked him to get every drop of milk out.

And before we left, I thanked him for allowing me to realize my dream of milking men like a cow. But to be fair, I would love a long term cum cow to provide me with a steady source of milk to be added to my daily diet. Just imagine all of the money I can save from buying milk at the grocery store.

Furthermore, what if men are attached to a milking machine in farms in the not too distant future? As there are issues with fertility around the world, I think it would be hot to see rows of men attached to milking machines and they let out a moo when they release their milk.

I would love to hear about your thoughts on this! And feel free to reach into my DMs for a milking session if you’re interested. Comment “moo” and let’s get to work milking men like a cow!🐮 😌",1,1769315548.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

1qm98r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1qm98r4/sorry_in_advance_this_one_long/,Sorry in advance this one long,"Hey subreddit,

My girlfriend and I recently broke up

One of the biggest issues was that I tend to forget things we talk about—even if it was just minutes earlier. It’s not intentional. When I’m under pressure or emotionally overwhelmed, I lose my train of thought and mentally shut down. From her perspective, this made her feel unheard, unimportant, and like she was being placed second, third, or fourth in my life—even when I told her otherwise.

Another issue was how I handled conflict. When problems came up, I often felt the need to solve them my way instead of listening and doing things the way she was asking. Looking back, I can see how this made her feel ignored and invalidated.

There were also trust issues. Before we started dating, I made an OnlyFans account just to view free content. I genuinely forgot about it. About a year into our relationship, she found out because an email came through while I was asleep. I explained that it was from when I was single, that I never hid anything, and that she had full access to my phone. I’ve never cheated and never planned to.

Later, she noticed I had clicked on OnlyFans links on Instagram. I told her I viewed it as porn, and when she said it made her uncomfortable, I stopped—for a while. Eventually, I started taking screenshots of models. I never deleted anything, and when she found them, I panicked and lied, saying they were accidental screenshots. I did this a few times before realizing it wasn’t worth risking my relationship or lying to someone I loved, so I stopped completely. I fully acknowledge that lying—especially out of fear—damaged her trust.

Another major issue involved my female best friend (let’s call her Ali). I met Ali about six months before I met my girlfriend. I never found her attractive and never wanted anything beyond friendship—I genuinely viewed her like family. From the beginning, my girlfriend was always included in plans with Ali.

However, my girlfriend repeatedly told me that Ali was being touchy with me and that it made her uncomfortable. Every time, I brushed it off and reassured her that there was nothing there. Looking back, I realize I ignored her feelings because I was afraid of losing my best friend. About seven months into the relationship, I stopped hanging out with Ali almost entirely and limited communication—not because I was asked to cut her off, but because I wanted to keep the peace. Still, I didn’t properly address my girlfriend’s feelings early on, and I now see how much damage that caused.

We broke up on December 17. When she broke up with me, I begged and lost all dignity because I finally realized how much I had messed up over the past three years. I told her I could become better, apologized for lying about OnlyFans, and even cut my best friend off. Before the breakup, she celebrated my birthday, and about five days later she broke up with me. On the day of the breakup, she gave me Christmas gifts she had already bought, which completely broke me because it made it feel like we were still okay.

Two days after Christmas, she asked me to come pick up my things. I went, pleaded again, and she still felt the breakup was necessary. She told me she never imagined she’d be the one to end the relationship, but that this needed to happen. I accepted it and left her alone.

A few days later, she called saying she found more of my things. I went back, we talked about the breakup, and I asked if we could cuddle for five minutes. She agreed, and we ended up cuddling for about an hour. If it weren’t for her doctor’s appointment, we probably would’ve stayed like that longer.

After that, I struggled to accept the breakup and reached out again. She told me she loved me but couldn’t be in a relationship right now. Somehow, the conversation turned into being friends with benefits, which lasted about a week. It never sat right with me—it felt like what we had didn’t matter—so I ended it.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Around midnight, she called saying she couldn’t sleep either, so I went over and we slept together. Communication continued after that. I told her I had booked an Airbnb during the time we were doing the friends-with-benefits situation and asked if she wanted to come. She agreed.

We spent two days together doing couple things—laughing, watching movies, going out, even going on a date. When it was time to check out, we talked again. She told me the break needed to happen so both of us could heal. I told her I didn’t know if our paths would ever cross again. She said she hoped they would and believed they would someday—just not now.

On the drive back, we were both crying. We got coffee one last time. When we got to her place, we couldn’t stop crying. We said our goodbyes, but neither of us wanted to let go. It felt like we were being ripped apart before we were ready. I finally let go, gave her one last kiss, and walked away. When I got in my car, I saw her crying and looking back at me.

It’s now been three days of zero contact, and I don’t know if I should reach out or if letting go is the right thing to do.

I recognize that I messed up—by not listening, by lying out of panic, and by prioritizing my comfort over her emotional safety. I’m not trying to justify my actions. I’m trying to understand whether these are fixable flaws and how to become better moving forward.",1,1769315480.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1qm97nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1qm97nr/coldbrew_coffee_for_ketogain_preworkout_is_great/,Coldbrew coffee for ketogain preworkout is great!,"Just grinding as usual, but I found that if you mix coffee with protein shake for the pre workout, coldbrew seems like the best choice.

What I do is a get a hario cold brew maker, 60g of course ground coffee, and 780ml of water to fill it to the brim. 16 hour in air conditioned room, then transfer to fridge without the coffee ground.

https://global.hario.com/product/coffee/coldbrew/FIC.html

You can always do use something else or just a mason jar, of course. The bottle above just makes it convenient and less messy.

The darn thing is caffeinated as fuck. I use 200ml of the result for my pre-workout along with mct oil and some potassium salt. Shattered my lifting records today and my muscles are crying (in a good way).

Compared to the usual nespresso machine coffee (not a high bar, I know), here are the pros:
1. It is already cold, means cold shake which is nicer. Usually I have to make the coffee the night before so I can chill it in the fridge.
2. Damn it taste good.
3. When scaled for the same price, I get about 3-4 times the caffeine per dollar. You can always dilute it, so it is cheaper when measured in term of caffeine. Your choice of coffee will influence the price, of course.

As for the cons:
1. Requires 16 hour brewing. Can be made in big batch so its not too bad.

I feel like if I were to make coffee the manual way (grind and tamper my own espresso, or drip it with filter) I will get more caffeine per gram of coffee... but cold brew method strikes a good balance between convenience and efficiency to me. Most of the prep is overnight. It is ready to mix. It goes very well with protein shake. 

Of course, this is just a small tip. Calories, macros, and consistency come first. Just thought that it'd be nice to share some of the little things to enjoy along the journey.",1,1769315386.0,ketogains,0,1.0,False

I know most people like to think this about their partners, but he is genuinely supermodel level attractive. We live in NYC so he has been stopped on multiple occasions by model scouts where I just hand to stand there awkwardly while being kind of jealous that I'm not that hot. I’m not exaggerating. Everywhere we go, even casual places like coffee shops or when we're having dinner together, women openly stare, flirt, interrupt our conversations, or find excuses to talk to him. It happens constantly and it annoys me a lot

He’s never cheated and I don’t think he wants to. But he’s also kind of oblivious. I don't want to outright say that he's dumb, because he got good grades all throughout college and is super good with numbers, but socially he isn't very aware at all. He doesn’t notice when women are flirting, or he brushes it off like it’s no big deal. I don’t think he’s being manipulative, I honestly think he’s just not very emotionally perceptive or reflective about how this stuff affects me.

Sometimes he’ll stand there chatting while a woman is clearly flirting right in front of me, and afterward I’ll say it made me uncomfortable. He usually responds with confusion, like he genuinely doesn’t understand why it bothered me. 

I’ve told him that the constant attention makes me feel replaceable and anxious. He reassures me verbally, but his behavior doesn’t really change and when women blatantly flirt with him in front of me, he'll respond by treating them the same way he treats his best friends and then sometimes has the audacity to turn to me and say ""wow, wasn't that a friendly lady?"" and I’m tired of feeling so insecure when I know I shouldn't be.

I don’t want to police him or control who talks to him. I also don’t want to slowly lose my self esteem in a relationship where I constantly feel like I have to competing with the entire straight female and gay male population.

Despite many employees stating their discomfort, he has began to threaten their employment. Perhaps he has forgotten that his workers are part of the community, too. Shame on Kenwick table.

Part of me thinks there were glimmers of true connection, our souls dancing around each other thru school….  I know the connection we shared was something substantial bc I’d telepathically sense you and your appearances in my dreams were quite special. But you hurt me … even if this was just a friendship … you withheld anything real … never wanted to see each other / hang or get coffee… just false promises. I should’ve believed you when you first said you couldn’t see us dating … but atleast I thought maybe we’ll actually be cool & good friends. But no.

It then became a power exchange of nudes & intermittently reinforced sexting. I know you like control. I wish we could’ve channeled it Into actual sex & playful encounters. You wanted me to just forget it all. I don’t know what it was about me that repulsed you. Part of me thought you saw me as out of your league or that I’m desired by too many for your liking; that the jealousy would kill you. Maybe I’m too free spirited or emotionally in tune for you. Maybe I dodged a major bullet by getting rejected by you time after time.

It was sad that you said I should just get on hinge & that I’d find what I’m looking for, no problem. It’s hard to find quirky / unique people and build connections w them overtime. I just wanted to see if this thing between us could be anything more. But you never gave the chance.

1qm8z4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/pastlives/comments/1qm8z4f/releasing_of_pastlife_guilt_and_shame_related_to/,Releasing of past-life guilt and shame related to perceived abandonment,"After my Psilocybin experience, documented here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1o3l1ly/a_psilocybin_initiation/] I went through a lot of emotional processing the weeks following. It was anything but straightforward however... mostly a lot of unconscious processing going on.

But last night, I made some sort of breakthrough. I had some chocolate I had been given for my birthday ~ which was on Wednesday ~ so I took that and then felt dizzy, as I usually do with chocolate, so I went for the solution that seems to help ~ coffee. Brewed some, drank, accepting that I might not get the best quality sleep, but hey, better than sugar making feel like crap, as coffee seems to balance me out. Didn't accomplish much at first ~ computer, social media, programming ~ then I decided I was tired, so I went to bed.

In bed, though, I began to think and think, about my feelings of guilt, shame, abandonment, confused and torn in the midst of it. Eventually, I realized something ~ there was a pattern throughout my entire life, of being abandoned... moving homes, schools, being made to live on a veranda outside of a house's walls because I had a wet dream coming into puberty, of moving in with my auntie, and her throwing me out, of going from youth house to youth house, feeling lost, thrown aside.

I wondered... why? Why? What did it all mean? What was even the purpose of this pattern? I couldn't understand. I asked again... why? Why? I had to understand, I wanted to, I needed to. I became almost desperate. My mind eventually responded to my desperation with the answers... I went into what was a series of flashbacks.

In my past life, I was a shaman in the Amazon, with a community, a village, a tribe, a people. I belonged. But then... my pet, my animal companion, a tiger, had killed one of the women, out of jealousy, that it felt I was getting too intimate with. It happened all so suddenly. I wasn't able to pick up on the signs before it happened. By the time it did, it was just too late. There was turmoil and uproar after that ~ anger from my tribe. I was asked to kill my tiger for its crime. But... something in me compelled me to defend them, to protect them, to take on the weight of the deed onto myself, to bear the burden. It wasn't the tiger's fault ~ they were protecting me, so they perceived, and they had never acted anything like this prior, so it was a major shock that could never have been foreseen.

The village simply didn't know how to respond to this ~ I was a respected shaman, so they couldn't kill me. So, the village elder, our leader, decided that, in compromise, I was to be exiled for 5 years. Before that, they called me in for questioning ~ why would I make such a massive sacrifice? What compelled me? I realized that I had been seeing flashbacks of myself through the elder's eyes, his compassion, empathy, understanding, as I was unable to offer any of it to myself, as I blamed myself for not seeing the signs. I saw myself... bowing before him, broken, limp, barely able to respond, yet willingly taking on such a heavy burden.

The elder was much wiser than me ~ he understood that something had compelled me to make a massively selfless sacrifice, to protect one who had killed another. Any blame he had for my tiger was never brought up ~ he focused purely on why I, a respected wise-man, would take on such a burden. Such a sacrifice, he recognized, required compassion, empathy and understanding, of the perspective of another. He had thought about this for a while, reasoning and considering, as he knew I was not one to blindly defend another without good reason. So, he decided ~ I was to be exiled, but I would not be entirely abandoned. I would be brought supplies at intervals, but I had to leave my tiger behind, to protect them ~ and just in-case, it was a man the elder trusted to secrecy.

But... that didn't stop me feeling guilty, abandoned, full of shame, confusion, pain. It pierced a hole in my heart, leaving me feeling broken and lost. Yet... the spirits didn't abandon me. They recognized the nature of my sacrifice, which was considered significant and worthy in their eyes. Only someone with empathy and compassion could make such a sacrifice. But they also knew that I had become unable to have empathy and compassion for myself. I eventually forgave my tiger companion, though, after time and consideration. But, what I didn't quite know is that they felt guilt and shame themself, as they had acted on impulse, had seen my reaction, perceived their actions as something I didn't like or agree with, so felt confusion and shame, which was consequentially buried, because they couldn't understand it ~ their mind couldn't deal with the emotions, so I was unable to help them, even with the aid of Ayahuasca.

Only when I came to full comprehension of this did something in me, now returned to noticing I was lying in bed in this life, snapping out of the flashbacks, rise and gently shatter. It felt like some broken part in my heart had been rejoined, repaired, made whole. I felt... different. I felt more complete, more like myself again. A wound was healed. My heart... didn't have blacked hole in it anymore. I could feel more wholesomely.

I realized that the patterns of abandonment in this life were to force me to look at the wound ~ they were a sort of very extended set of exposure therapy, to force me to look inwards. The wound was deep, so the cure needed to be just as strong ~ that is, I had to be forced, even brutally so, to look at the wound, so I could come to terms with it, at any cost.

I was able to actually perceive the memories of the elder again ~ I realized these memories came from a life review where I was shown his perspective, his wisdom. I realized I had met him during one Ayahuasca journey ~ he had reincarnate, as a shaman, a wise-man, himself, inspired by my compassion and empathy, my own wisdom to see the true intent of another, to take on a massive burden I could barely bear... I thought he was familiar, but I couldn't place it until I made some unconscious connection ~ the energy of the elder was the same as the energy of that shaman. They were the same.",1,1769314674.0,pastlives,0,1.0,False
1qm8yvx,https://i.redd.it/k7gx36cu4ffg1.jpeg,Quince discovery set review,"Ordered the Quince discovery set because someone mentioned that there was a Wood Sage & Sea Salt dupe within it. Here are my thoughts. (It's only $20 with free shipping!) 

**Note: I'm just listing the three notes that are listed for each scent on the box. There might be more notes:** 

1. **Côte D'azur** \- *Bergamot, ginger, cedarwood* \- smelled like very generic men's cologne to me. Not much that is special here. Apparently a dupe for Bleu de Chanel. A bit too masculine for me. 

2. **Néroli soleil** \- *Lavender, neroli, vanilla bean* \- Ab basic citrus-y floral with heavy lavender. Bit similar to YSL Libre. Lavender note felt too strong for me. 

3. **Oud rouge** \- *Jasmine, saffron, amberwood -* Somewhat of a dupe for Baccarat Rouge 540. It opens strong but the dry down is a lot lighter though and difficult to smell. The saffron is hard to place.

4. **Bois de Santal** \- *violet, cardamom, sandalwood* \- Was not a fan of this one at all. Apparently it's supposed to be a dupe of Santal 33 but I did not get that at all. I think I might just not like violet scents? This turned very sour on my skin. 

5. **Ambre Noir** \- *coffee, jasmine, vanilla bean* \- I think this was my #2 favorite. I actually don't like the OG Black Opium but I do enjoy this, for some reason. After the coffee opening it settles down into a warm floral with some vanilla which I quite enjoy. 

6. **Minérale** \- *Ambrette seeds, sea salt, sage* \- Ah, the obvious dupe for Wood Sage & Sea Salt. It does smell very similar but I feel like WS&SS lasts longer? This feels a bit lighter. Still, for $50 a bottle, I might just invest in this. Probably my favorite. 

7. **Les Cerises** \- *Cherry, almond, tonka bean* \- dear God, no. This is cherry cough syrup with an excessively artificial tasting almond cookie. I've never smelled Lost Cherry but apparently this is a dupe for it. Similar to strawberry, I've never been able to find a realistic cherry scent. I'd even settle for cherry lollipop over cherry cough syrup. 

8. **Jasmin Nuit** \- *Tuberrose, jasmine, tonka bean* \- I dig this one. Apparently a dupe for CH Good Girl. The website also says that there is a top note coffee bean in here but I don't think I get that. This is a very feminine scent, safe. I can see this one being a compliment getter. 

**Favorites from the set:** Minérale, Ambre Noir, Jasmin Nuit.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

1qm8hjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1qm8hjn/i_cannot_do_this_for_two_more_years/,I cannot do this for two more years,"I'm currently 29 (F) and had to move back home last year due to exiting an extremely abusive relationship. This was a decision I made very reluctantly, but was based on needing safety and because I was struggling financially. I've been working as a first responder since March of 2024, but due to scheduling conflicts with nursing school, I've had to let that position go, and now work part-time doing BLS instruction and am also doing part-time as a receptionist at a doggie daycare. 

A bit of background on my family. I love them deeply but I know they are extremely toxic and abusive. My mother 56 (F) was very emotionally neglectful growing up. I was blamed a lot for my ADHD symptoms and was constantly threatened with being ""embarrassed"" with an IEP. I spent a lot of time alone in my room as a kid, and even that wasn't a safe space. I was always a very extroverted child, and unfortunately, that exposed me to 3 separate instances of being SA'd by different kids throughout my childhood. I've never told anyone about this, but maybe it's important to share here anonymously, idk. 

My mother has called the police on me after hitting me and kicking me out as recently as 2019, and that was not the first time that had occurred. From 6th grade and forward, there were many times she threatened to leave me without housing. Prior to that, she had slammed my head into a car window on the way to school, gotten physically aggressive because I borrowed a sweater of hers in high school, mocked me for self-harm, blamed me for being SA'd by a partner, etc.. She has always been kind of quick to anger, and I have not and never would resort to violence in response to hers. I'm just not like her, and I never would want to be. However, my sister, who is 23 (F), has a seemingly similar temperament. My dad was also very physically abusive throughout my childhood, but I feel it's important to note that that stopped once my parents divorced in 2009, and my sister has seemingly had a much different parental experience than I have. 

That being said, I gave up much of my late teens and 20's to be present for my sibling while my mother has dated awful people that never took the time to get to know her, or myself. And, my father, while he's improved emotionally and anger-wise, is still not very present in my life unless I reach out to him. 

My sister has always had anger issues and is quick to lash out, not just at me, but with most people. She was always a very introverted child, I think due to growing up in the environment we both lived in, and struggled to make friends. She now has a boyfriend and some friends and is a bit more extroverted now, and I am happy for her. Growing up, she placed a lot of blame on me for not wanting to be home much/be around friends as a form of escape, because it left her in that environment. My mom contributed a lot to this mentality as she would verbatim say that it was my fault my sister felt so lonely, when she was not a present parent, and the only free time she did have, she gave to a boyfriend she had for about a decade that again, never took the time to even have as much as a conversation with us the entire time he lived with us. Not only would she pit my sister and I against each other, but she would eventually enlist a ""big sister"" from the BBBS club to spend time with my sister. In high school, I was very depressed and with ADHD was trying to juggle sports, friends, maintaining good grades, and my abusive home life all at once. I didn't often get to indulge in the escapism that was going to my friend's houses, but when I could, I took the opportunity. 

I have always had a ""peacekeeping"" role in the family, and the only reason I have positive moments, and at time okay relationships with any of them, is because I put my own feelings aside to remind myself I love them. It was always driven into me that it was family that mattered most, and I still carry that with me. I am not perfect, I am deeply flawed and many times I'm sure I've not only contributed to the toxic environment, but as a result of sharing feelings my family doesn't like, I know I have caused a few fights. I don't try to, and within the last several years since 2020, even when moved out, I have withheld from speaking openly about many feelings unless I know they'll be agreeable. Whenever I express emotion that isn't being happy or agreeable, it's met with yelling, being told I'm making everything about me, or being dismissed and ignored. I have never felt like I can advocate for myself with them.

That brief history brings us to now. I do not feel sorry for myself, as I know I have gotten myself into this situation. I worked full-time after high school as a steakhouse chef, coffee shop manager, and massage therapist after I dropped out of school for dental hygiene in 2015, largely due to severe depression from living at home. I had great grades in high school, many extracurriculars, etc., but was unable to afford to go away for college as I had hoped because my dad had messed up my mother's credit. As she worked as a speech therapist, she made too much money for me to receive loans, but not enough to send me to school, or even pay for community college. I paid out of pocket for my first two semesters, but eventually gave up. 

I've moved out in almost every serious relationship I've had since then, at times having to let my sister come stay with me, due to my mom. But, 2 of 3 of those relationships were with very physically and emotionally abusive men, and the living situations didn't last. I went back to college in 2021 doing prereqs for nursing and took a brief hiatus to pursue my EMT license, so I could get paid a bit more while I'm in school. But, once I moved back home because my mother insisted I did, I was right back to where I was before. 

I'm currently in college, and am set to graduate with my BSN next fall, but I'm starting to feel as if I'll never make it there. I'm strongly considering just doing the surgical technologist program my school offers because I could complete it by the end of this year, and at least be able to afford to move out. The situation at home has only gotten more stressful because while I'm maintaining the peace between my mom and sister, and staying silent, my mom has also gotten a dog (golden doodle, no I don't support dog eugenics), which is a nightmare to have to help out with when I'm already overwhelmed. I can empathize with my sister, as most of the responsibility of taking care of the dog falls on her because my mom works so often and has now had a hysterectomy and is in recovery. I sat at the hospital for 10 hours yesterday trying to get homework done during her procedure, and gave her a ride to and from, which I did happily. But, as much as I love him, this dog situation is driving me crazy as I took him out and fed him early this morning, and again around midday. I take him to the dog park and on walks a few times a week, and feed him/take him out when scheduled or asked, but I also have a little cat that I moved back home with that needs attention, and my mom and sister never spend time with her or acknowledge her. I'm just emotionally exhausted, and at this point, I feel like I'm just venting/trauma dumping, so I'm sorry to anyone who's taken the time to read this whole thing. 

I guess I'm wondering what I should do at this point. My school doesn't offer an ASN and I'm wanting to finish my BSN for me, you know? But, at this point, I feel maybe just taking the surgical technologist route is the best way out. I can't afford to live on my own, and I could attempt to find roommates, but I've just heard so many horror stories I'm not sure. I just want a safe and peaceful environment for my cat, where I can finish nursing school. I don't want to have to take any more alternate routes, and my mom makes me feel like sh\*t about that potential avenue as well because she feels I should have gotten my nursing degree by now. I don't want to make an impulsive decision, and I'm trying to thug it out, but if getting my BSN has to come after obtaining my surgical tech degree, so I can be on my own, then so be it. I'm open to advice and input. I know I should be much farther along in life already, I just feel stuck and like I can't take much more.",3,1769313250.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

At 35 years old, I feel like an impotent old man.

I had to quit drinking three years ago--alcohol was literally killing me. It was the best decision I ever made for my body and mind. But it destroyed my sex life completely. Apparently alcoholism was my sexiest trait. It's been utterly dry, a desert since then.

I spent the next 2.8 years smoking weed, which maybe was necessary to keep from drinking again, but made me antisocial, lazy, and anxious. It destroyed my appetite, and I got sickly-skinny. Finally quit that shit two months ago.

Today, I lift weights 4-6 days a week (depending on soreness). Been at it for over a year, but the weed killed all my gains. Finally starting to see some results.

I got a job in sales so my paycheck would be dependent on my efforts. There are people with my same job making six figures. Also, cold-calling is very similar to cold approach, so it seems like I'm developing a transferable skill. I intend to crush this job: I went to the office today (Saturday) to make extra calls. I was the only one there.

I am meal prepping healthy foods, though it's ridiculously hard to stay away from sugar when I'm still not used to total sobriety.

I used to be a great musician, and I've been practicing again after years of doing nothing. Hit an open mic a couple weeks ago, got another in two weeks.

Theoretically, I'm doing everything right. I dedicated this year to The Three M's: muscles, money, and music--because I am sick to death of being an incel. I am sick of making a girl laugh, then having her go ""wait what?"" and run away when I suggest we get coffee. I am sick of being scared of women. I have come to hate the feeling I get when I see an attractive female. I take off my glasses to work out, because I do not want to be able to see the girls at the gym. It only sort of works.

I don't use social media, and I don't watch the news. Replaced those toxic things with motivational speakers and motivational music. Started meditating (zazen) two weeks ago, based on advice I read in this forum.

I still watch a lot of porn. I don't think I have the willpower not to. Not when my mind is against me. Here's what I mean: despite all my efforts, I am constantly tormented by crushing depression and negative thinking:

""You're too old for hot girls; all that's left for you are obese single mothers looking for a beta cuck like you to raise the kids they had with real men.""
""You're short and geeky-looking and the bald spot is becoming more noticeable.""
""There's not enough time to get to where you need to be. You'll be 50 by the time you can even approach a woman, and by then there really will be no attractive ones left.""
""You can't pull girls; you can't even take a girl out for a drink. And wait til she finds out about your history--she'll sprint in the opposite direction.""

I have tried visualization, but it all feels fake. I just can't buy the idea that imagining things makes them happen. If it did, my fantasies and fears would've all come true by now.

I still live in a dump with drug addict roommates, but I can't afford to move yet. I can't bring a woman to this dive. Even I'm disgusted by this place.

I fantasize about FWBs and multiple girlfriends, about banging 22-year-olds... and I feel like garbage for it. ""You jackass, you creep: settle for what you can actually get.""

I have dedicated every minute of my life to solving this problem. I have tried talking to my people in AA, but they think sex is just another drug. They keep telling me to stop focusing on this. But I don't care. I can't think about anything else.

Right now, it feels like I'm fighting the Mongol hordes all by myself. Somebody tell me something positive. The ""aww it'll be okay"" responses I get from my current friends are garbage, with all the sincerity of a Hallmark card.

1qm8d9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qm8d9t/i_wont_forgive_my_sister_for_stealing_my_alarm/,I Won't Forgive My Sister For Stealing My Alarm Clock,"I am an incredibly deep sleeper to the point where I sleep through fire alarms. Phone alarms don’t work so I now use a system of five alarm clocks when I’m living by myself to wake myself up. My first physical alarm clock was this expensive alarm clock that lights up that my parents got me for my 16^(th) birthday. I used it consistently and took it with me for my first year of university. For my second year of university I went abroad for nine months straight. When I came back, I couldn’t see where my alarm clock was but my mum had moved a bunch of stuff around in my room and because I was living at home over the summer my parents could wake me up if I had something urgent I needed to wake up for. By the end of the summer I was preparing to go back and asked where the alarm clock was because I thought my mum had put it in a box somewhere and my sister said she had it.



I can’t stand my sister. We don’t have a good relationship. Around this time I had to go off my psychiatric medication because of complications restarting my prescription through the NHS and she kept on telling family friends about this through a joke where she pretended to show genuine concern but the punchline was that she was the one truly suffering from having to be around me when I’m off my meds. To out of nowhere tell people sensitive medical information about me and not asking if I’m comfortable sharing it is not okay. And for her to do that in service of such a cruel joke is double not okay.



All this is context for why this made me furious. We are not close. Definitely not borrowing my things without asking close. Stealing something that is so integral to me being able to live independently as an adult is so cruel and my parents wouldn’t let me be mad about it because she was giving it back. She is the opposite of a deep sleeper and there is no way she has any real need for that alarm so I have no idea why she thought to steal it in the first place. They then bought that same alarm for her for her birthday and when I said ‘oh that’s just like the one you stole from me’ they told me not to bring it up because it could ruin her birthday. Her defence was that I wasn’t using it anyway but she didn’t give it back straight away and I just know she was hoping I wouldn’t bring it up so she would get to keep it. She didn’t ask if it was okay to borrow it because she knew the answer would’ve been no. It’s been two years and no one has said sorry or admitted that what she did was fucked up so I haven’t let it go and now they act like I’m crazy for bringing it up.



I’ve moved back home after my masters and I’m stuck here until I start a doctoral program in autumn and just after I moved back home my parents informed me that my sister had failed at her journalism career after less than a year working in the field and is coming back home indefinitely. This feels like a cosmic joke I fucking hate her and now I’m stuck probably living with her for another nine months. Covid happened the year she left for university. It feels like I will never get rid of her and I hate being around her so much. I keep on thinking about the alarm clock and how selfish she is. I was having a conversation today and she stood in front of me blocking me off from the people I was speaking to. Who the fuck does that?



I also hate that my family forces me into holding grudges and then acts like I’m crazy for it. When I was 17 I could hear rats under the floorboards and kept telling my parents we had rats until they chewed through our wiring and they got someone in who told them it was rats. When I was 20 I again started hearing rats and for months and my mum told me I was going crazy and it was all in my head. I was finally vindicated when a rat scurried past me it freaked me out so I ran into the living room and yelled and my parents that I saw a rat and my mum yelled at me because we had neighbours over and it was embarassing. She didn’t let me be mad about it at the time and now I’m crazy for holding a grudge over this.



Living at home as an adult is taking a psychological toll on me that I will never recover from. I hope I only see my sister for a few days at Christmas once I get out of here. I fucking hate living at home and I wish the cost of living and job market was less insane. I wish it was 1995 and I could get a job in a coffee shop that covered the cost of a flat in Bristol with money left over for food and movie tickets so I could get through this period of my life without having to put up with all my family stuff.",4,1769312903.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

1qm83op,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qm83op/growing_up_there_was_one_room_we_werent_allowed/,Growing up there was one room we weren't allowed to enter. I never should have opened the door.,"As a child, my family, Dad, my little brother Jonathan, and I, were extraordinarily lucky. Not rich-lucky. No, our house was modest and square: three bedrooms, two baths, a living room with a small red couch and Dad’s brown recliner, and a kitchen with a laundry closet and glass-paned French doors leading to the backyard.

While Dad stressed how fortunate we were to have had the house for so long, and often emphasized that it was to be passed down to me or Jonathan so that we could raise our kids “the right way,” our luck did not come from a nice family home. Not from great friends or a supportive community, either.

We weren’t lucky in the ways you can be proud of. Our luck appeared exactly when we needed it, when we were behind on rent or swamped with medical bills, but it lived in the places we’d rather not go: the piss-stained bathroom floors of public restrooms, where Dad found lost wads of cash; in the wills of distant family members we’d never met; in the incompetent minds of utility employees who sent us large refunds for money we weren’t owed

The summer I turned 10, our house was broken into and robbed while we were visiting Grandma and Grandpa out of town. The thieves took nearly everything: the living room TV, my PlayStation, even the microwave. The police dusted for fingerprints and took an inventory of everything we were missing, but they didn’t seem very confident in solving the case, and we didn’t have much hope.

When the police left, Jonathan sat between Dad and me on the couch, crying as he stared at the open space in front of the fireplace. “All our stuff!” he said between sobs. “Why would they do this?”

“It’s gonna be okay,” Dad said. “Things will work out. You know that.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Jake, why don’t you and Jonathan get ready for bed?” He gave Jonathan a hug and walked down the hallway toward the bedrooms. I put my head in my hands, and for a moment, the only sound was Dad's shoes softly thumping against the hardwood floor.

I took a deep breath. “It’ll be okay, Jon. Let’s go to bed.”

We walked past the hallway bathroom, past Dad’s room, and past the guest bedroom. As I opened the door to my and Jonathan’s room, I heard what sounded like a groan of pain coming from the guest room. I stopped in the doorway. Jonathan either didn’t hear the sound or didn’t care; he turned sideways, slipped past me, and climbed up to the top bunk.

I turned and walked toward the room. I stood next to the door and listened, but heard nothing. For a moment I considered trying the knob, but Dad would’ve killed me if he found me snooping around. That room was best to be ignored. When we did acknowledge it, it was referred to only as “The Room.” No one but Dad was allowed in The Room. He kept the door locked and the key with him at all times.

This wasn’t the first time I’d heard sounds coming from The Room, but it was usually quick, rubbery squeaks, like someone moving around in a bed. It had never been a sound of pain before. 

I stayed up worried until late in the night when I heard the door open, close, and then lock.

Early the next morning, I woke up to Jonathan yelling from the kitchen. When I went out to see what was going on, he had opened the back doors and was standing in the yard, holding his hands out as if to present a brand new car.

All of our stuff, every single item we were missing, was there. The TV and microwave were sitting safely on top of some towels, and everything else was piled neatly in large cardboard boxes. Attached to one of those boxes was a yellow sticky note with words written in red, bleeding ink:

*We’re sorry. We’re so sorry.* 

We weren’t lucky all the time, but these little miracles happened often enough to make us certain that we weren’t like other families, and for us to have a sense of unwavering hope that was sometimes as foolish as it was uplifting.

When Mom died a few weeks after my 8th birthday, we kept thinking she might just… come back. Dad continued to make two cups of coffee every morning, and for months we kept an extra chair at the table. I’m not sure we ever stopped holding our breath. 

For most of my childhood, I never gave The Room much thought. I’d grown up with it, after all, and I knew that The Room was off limits before I knew how to speak. Dad was careful not to enter The Room when anyone was around, so to me, the door that never opened might as well have been a blank wall.

But about midway through my fifth grade school year, I finally had a reason to think hard about The Room.

Jonathan and I were doing our homework at the dining room table while Dad made dinner in the kitchen. I was struggling with a long-division worksheet. Jonathan, being in 3rd grade, was working on addition and subtraction.

A few minutes into homework time, I felt a sharp poke at my side.

I turned to my left and looked at Jonathan. He was squinting hard and held his face about an inch above his worksheet, one hand holding a pencil poised to mark an answer while the other rubbed his chin.

“Don’t poke me,” I said. “I’m trying to focus.”

He jerked his head back as if broken from a trance. “What? Stop distracting me. I’m trying to do my homework.”

I sighed and shook my head, then got back to work. I was counting how many times 7 went into 49 when I felt another poke.

“Stop!” I screamed as I turned to look back at Jonathan. He was in that same pose again, but this time he was struggling to hold in a smile.

“Stop what?” 

“Poking me. I’m trying to do my homework.”

“Me too,” he said. “Stop distracting me.”

“You’re not even doing anything.”

“Yes I am!”

I grabbed the paper away from him and held it up to his face. “Then how come all the questions are already answered?”

“Give that back!” he screamed. 

He reached for the paper, and I jumped up out of his reach. He went to chase me, but as he hurried to stand, he pushed the chair he was sitting in back. It fell to the floor with a bang.

“Jake! Jonathan! What the hell was that?” Dad yelled from the kitchen. A moment later, he entered the dining room as Jonathan was frantically pushing the chair back into place. “What the hell happened?”

Jonathan stumbled on his words. “I was trying to… he took my homew-”

“He kept poking me!” I said.

“Nuh-uh!”

“He did! And I asked him to stop but he wouldn’t!”

Dad put his hands over his eyes and sighed deeply. “Be quiet and go finish your homework in your room. I don’t want to hear another peep out of either of you.”

In our room, Jonathan did everything he could to annoy me. He poked me, made farting sounds with his armpits, and sang random, annoying songs. He knew I couldn’t retaliate without getting us both in trouble. By the time Dad called us for dinner, I had about lost my patience. I just wanted some damn peace and quiet.

Dinner was meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The same recipe Mom used to make, but it was a sad imitation, like a Gordon Ramsay microwave meal. The meatloaf was slanted to one side and the potatoes were chunky. I would’ve cried if I wasn’t so angry at Jonathan.

I looked at Dad, who was funneling mashed potatoes into his mouth with one hand and scrolling on his phone with the other. I tried to think of how I could broach the subject without pissing him off. 

I considered coming right out and asking if I could sleep in the extra bedroom, but I thought he might question how I knew what was behind the door (I didn’t, really, but a bedroom seemed like a sure enough guess). Then, I considered simply asking what was in The Room. But what if he thought I was being too nosy? Finally, I decided that my best bet was to feign innocence, present my problem, and hope that he offered a solution.

“I really wish we had an extra bedroom,” I said, then glanced up at him.

He was staring straight at me, eyes narrow and his mouth a flat line. “Sarcastic little shit,” he grumbled.

“No, I just… wish I had my own room… for homework.”

“You can’t have The Room,” he said. 

“What’s wrong with it?” Jonathan asked.

“Don’t question me,” Dad said. “No more questions.”

“What’s so bad about asking?” I asked.

He breathed hard out of his nose and gave me a look that said *enough.* “Someone lives in that room. We can’t disturb them.”

“No one lives in there!” Jonathan argued. “Where do they go to the bathroom? When do they eat?”

“Yeah,” I said. “We’ve never seen them. Dad, you're lying to us. You just don’t want me to have my own room.”

As soon as I said the words, I regretted them. Dad stood up and grabbed me by the arm, jerking me to my feet. “Come with me.”

I followed him down the hallway and into his bedroom.

“Lay down on the bed.”

I understood what that meant even before I heard him undoing his belt. He’d spanked me plenty of times before, but it never really hurt *that* bad. As long as I made sure to cry after the 3rd or 4th hit, he’d usually stop pretty quickly.

But the first hit was as loud as thunder and stung like a strike of lightning. It was harder than he’d ever hit me before. For a moment my vision went black. He hit me again and again until I was screaming over and over. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”

When he was done he wouldn’t even look at me. He just stared straight ahead at the wall. “Go to your room,” he said. “You can finish your dinner in the morning.”

A few minutes later, as I laid in bed and tried not to put too much weight on my butt, I heard more loud whacks of Dad’s belt. Then, Jonathan came in and climbed up to his bed. As I tried to sleep, I could hear him quietly crying.



In the weeks following that night, none of us mentioned The Room. However, it was on my mind almost constantly, and more than once I found Jonathan standing in the hallway, staring at the locked door. As much as Dad scared us that night, he only made us more interested in The Room. What could be so bad that simply asking about it made Dad act like that? I wanted so badly to know, but I couldn’t risk asking again.



Still, I couldn’t get it out of my head. I was distracted at school, and Jonathan and I were both less talkative at home. Dad began to act distant. He was less interested in our days, and oftentimes our dinner was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a home-cooked meal. I began to think that we crossed a line that we couldn’t uncross, and that things would never be the same again.



I started having this recurring dream about The Room. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, and there would be this red glow coming from under the door. I’d step into the hallway and see that The Room’s door was open. I’d walk inside and the door would close behind me, so hard that a gust of wind would knock me on my ass.



All of a sudden the walls would lower themselves into the ground, revealing a stadium full of spectators. That’s when I’d realize that the room had turned into a stage. Everyone was pointing at me and laughing. I’d get up and try to run but now the door was gone and I was hundreds of feet in the air. The laughter would get louder and louder until I had to cover my ears and scream.



I’d wake up sweaty and breathless. Sometimes, I’d go check to make sure that the door to The Room was still closed. In the faint glow of the hallway's blue nightlight, I could almost imagine that I was looking into the darkness of The Room. Other times, I’d lay awake in bed until morning.



The first few times it happened, Jonathan asked me if I was okay. But after a while, he stopped bothering. He wasn’t sleeping too well either. More than once, I’d woken up to him crying. Sometimes his eyes were bloodshot in the morning. He played hooky on a few of those days.



As scary as these dreams were, during the waking hours they only reassured me that whatever was in The Room was important. They only made me more curious, like The Room was calling to me. One day, in the middle of the night, I heard Jonathan gasp awake. 



“Are you okay?” I asked.



He was quiet for a moment, then he took a deep breath. “Nightmare.”



“Was it about The Room?”



“Yes,” he said. “There’s a monster in there. A dragon… it breathed fire and it… it was going to eat me.”



“Nothing’s going to eat you. Maybe we should go see what’s really in there. It can’t be that bad. Dad wouldn’t let it stay if it was… he’d do something about it. He’d protect us.”



“Dad would kill us!”



“We can get in without Dad knowing. We just need the right plan.”



So we stayed up for the rest of the night bouncing ideas off each other.



Our first idea was to sneak into Dad’s room while he was sleeping. We’d grab the key, then Jonathan and I would unlock the door to The Room, go in, take a look around, and put the key back before Dad realized it was missing.



The problem was the risk. We’d have to open the door without waking Dad up. Then, without any light, we’d have to sneak around searching for the key, which could be anywhere. We might trip over something, Dad might hear us opening a drawer… most likely, we’d end up getting spanked and grounded. Then Dad would be even more careful about keeping us out of The Room.



We had a few more stupid ideas like pick-pocketing the key and putting it back in Dad’s pocket before he noticed or picking the lock with toothpicks and Q-tips. Everything seemed either too risky or too ridiculous. 



I was half asleep and had about given up when I finally had a real eureka moment. “Jon,” I said. “I think I got it.”



One thing Dad always got on to Jonathan and I for was not playing outside enough. He said that we were missing out on “what childhood is supposed to be like.” In an effort to fix this, he’d bought us a trampoline one summer. We played on it every now and then, and sometimes Dad would join us. Whenever he did, he always emptied his pockets and put everything on the grass in front of the trampoline. All we had to do was get him on the trampoline, and one of us could grab the key while he was distracted. Then, we could go unlock the door, peek inside, and put the key back before he noticed.



The only problem was that, since one of us would have to stay on the trampoline with Dad, we wouldn’t both be able to see The Room.



Jonathan pitched in with the solution. He said that he’d seen the key to The Room before. According to him, the mail key and the key to The Room were almost identical. If we could switch them out, Dad would be none the wiser until he tried to use one of the keys.



So the final plan was simple. Jonathan would ask Dad to go play on the trampoline with us. While Dad and Jonathan were going outside, I’d say that I needed to use the bathroom. Then, I’d grab the mail key, go outside, and switch it out for the key to The Room. Because we’d make sure to ask him to the trampoline *after* he checked the mail, Dad wouldn’t notice the key had been switched until the next day. This would give us all night to look around The Room. After we were done exploring, we’d put the key back in the drawer where the mail key was kept. Whenever Dad noticed the keys were mixed up, he would assume that it was his mistake. 



After dinner the next day, Dad went to check the mail while Jonathan and I tag-teamed the dishes.



“What if we get caught?” Jonathan asked. “We’ll be in big trouble.”



He was squirming around and his face was turning red. I started to fear that he was going to get us busted.



“We’re gonna be fine,” I said. “Don’t worry. I’m the one taking all the risk. All you have to do is play on the trampoline. Even if we get caught, I’ll take all the blame.”



That calmed him down, and by the time Dad came back in with the usual bills and junk mail, Jonathan was fine. I watched as Dad put the mail key back in the drawer. 



A few minutes later, Jonathan asked Dad if he wanted to go play on the trampoline. Dad’s eyes lit up. I could tell that he was tired, but he also wanted to encourage us. He said he’d play for a few minutes.



I almost felt bad as I stood in the bathroom and waited to hear the sound of the back doors closing. But when they did, I put my game face on.



I walked to the kitchen, fished the mail key out of the drawer, and dropped it into the right zip-up pocket of my sweatpants. I peeked out the back doors to see that Dad and Jonathan were already jumping on the trampoline and throwing a football back and forth. Dad’s stuff was in a haphazard pile in the grass.



I stepped outside and walked to the trampoline. I’d strategically worn my tall lace-up vans to give myself an excuse for taking so long to untie my shoes. When I reached Dad’s pile, I bent down and began sorting through it.



From the angle of the trampoline, Dad wouldn’t be able to see me unless he walked right up to the edge and looked straight down. Even so, I was terrified as I looked through his things. I felt that he was going to look down at me any second. Every time a bounce was a little too close, I was sure he was about to bust me.



I went through everything: I checked underneath his wallet, to the left and right of his phone, but the key didn’t seem to be in the pile. I began to panic. I was reaching a hand into each of his shoes when I heard the rattle of the trampoline poles. Someone had crashed into the net above me. I looked up expecting to see Dad, but instead I caught sight of Jonathan as he stood up from making a diving catch. He jumped back toward the middle of the trampoline, and I breathed a sigh of relief.



I put my head in my hands and tried to control my breath. Where else could the key be? I only had another few seconds before Dad would get suspicious and I’d have to get up. I was shifting through everything one last time when an epiphany hit me so hard I almost slapped myself in the face. *His wallet! I haven’t checked his wallet!*



I opened the wallet and immediately felt the bulge of the key. I dug my fingers into the pockets until I felt the cool metal. I pulled it out with one hand and reached into my own pocket for the mail key with the other.

Looking at the keys next to each other, they weren’t as identical as Jonathan had led me to believe. They were both a yellowish grey and roughly the same size, but the key to The Room was darker, a little rusty, and much heavier. I was sure that Dad was going to notice the difference immediately. For a moment, I considered giving up on the plan, but I told myself that, even if Dad noticed right away, he’d probably blame himself. 



I put the key in my pocket, zipped it shut, and inserted the mail key into the wallet. I loosened my shoes as quickly as I could and climbed up on the trampoline.



When we were done playing, Dad watched a movie on the couch while Jonathan and I played War with a deck of cards in our room. We played in almost complete silence. When I won my third game in a row, I didn’t brag, and Jonathan didn’t even complain or accuse me of cheating. 



“I can go in alone if you want,” I said after a while.



“No! I want to see The Room.”



“Are you scared?”



“No,” he said, but he wouldn’t look me in the eyes.



“Are you scared of Dad finding out, or are you scared of what’s in there?”



“I don’t know.”



Around 9:00 PM, Dad told us to get ready for bed. As instructed, Jonathan did his usual complaints and asked for a few extra minutes. Dad shut him down, and Jonathan gave up without much of a fight. That was fine, Dad seemed exhausted anyway.



We took showers, brushed our teeth, and got into bed. Around 9:30 we heard Dad go into his room. Jonathan wouldn’t stop fidgeting above me. A few times he was so loud that I expected Dad to open the door and tell us to cut it out. 



Jonathan asked about a dozen times if we could go yet, but I was firm and insisted on waiting until midnight. By then, Jonathan was sitting on the floor next to my bed.



“Okay,” I said. “Let’s go.”



“Okay,” he said with a shaky breath.



I opened our door as quietly as I could and stepped into the hallway. When I stopped to take a peek at Dad’s room, Jonathan bumped into me and I gasped in surprise.



“Shh,” he said. “You’re gonna wake him up.”



“Shut up.”



I walked up to Dad’s room and put my ear against his door. He was snoring.



“He’s asleep,” I said. “Let’s go.”



I took the key out of my pocket and approached The Room. I was about to unlock the door when Jonathan put a hand on my arm.



“The door knob,” he whispered.



“What?”



“It might be hot, remember… the dragon…”



“Yeah,” I said. “Okay.”



I went to feel it with the back of my hand, but at the last second Jonathan pulled me away and softly touched the knob himself. 



“It’s okay,” he said.



“Why’d you have to feel it?” I asked.



He tilted his head at me. “So you wouldn’t get burned.”



“Okay,” I said, and smiled. “Let’s do this.”



I put the key into the knob and was surprised at how easily it unlocked. I’d expected something to happen at the last minute. That Dad would come storming out of his room and stop us, or that we had the wrong key, or that the room simply wouldn’t open, but no… there was the click of the lock, and then the door was open. The Room was ready to be entered.



I nodded at Jonathan and, finally, pushed the door open.



The nightlight revealed only the closest edge of The Room, but from the little I could see, it appeared as though The Room was much older than the rest of the house. The carpet was a yellower, uglier shade of grey. There was the same white-textured wall, but it was chipped at places, revealing light brown splotches of old plaster.

I could make out the shadow of the only object in the room. In the back right corner was the shape of a bed. On top of it was a person.

“Wh-what?” I said as my breath caught in my throat. 

Jonathan gasped like a breathless old man.

Without turning, I reached for the light switch and dragged my hand across the wall until I found it. The light was dim but bright enough for me to make out the rest of the room. All dirty carpet and old walls. There was nothing but the bed and the figure on top of it. The figure that appeared to be a rotting corpse.

Jonathan started crying. He bumped against the wall as he backpedaled out of the room. “Jake, please, let’s just leave!”

His voice sounded muffled, as if he were calling to me from a different world. In a slow process that seemed somehow to be against my will, I walked toward the bed until I was close enough to see that the body was, actually, a female doll about five-feet tall. She was lying on blue sheets atop a small bed with a wooden frame.

Her skin was a moldy off-white, wrinkled and cut at random. Her hair was gray, each strand of varying length. Some barely reached her ears, others stretched down to her chin. She wore a dusty green dress patterned with thin white flowers. As if ripped away by an assailant, the bottom of the dress was cut unevenly, showing about six inches of thin legs and rotten skin above her knees. Each of her unblinking, lifeless eyes were a pool of milky white, a black orb the size of a penny floating in the middle. Those eyes sat an inch outside of her skull, popping out like the eyes of a cheap stress toy. Her mouth was nothing but a thin line cut into the skin. Where her nose should have been was simply two deep holes, one an inch higher than the other, as if the dollmaker had simply stabbed his thumbs into her skin until it punctured. 

I stood studying the doll, heart thundering in my chest. *Why does Dad keep this in here? Why is this secret so important? What does he do with it?*

I reached out to touch it. Maybe some secret would be revealed by the rough texture of the skin… but when my hand was only an inch away from its arm, something miraculous and terrifying happened. Her face turned to me, so quickly that the bed squeaked in response. A voice came from her still-closed mouth.

“Young ones,” she said, “which one of you am I going to enjoy tonight?” Her voice was raspy as if from disuse, but she spoke quickly and hissed like a snake.

Jonathan ran to our room and slammed the door shut. 

“Must be you, sweetie,” her thin, decaying neck began to elongate, stretching toward me, uncoiling like a thick rope as her face got closer and closer. When she was almost to biting distance her lips parted until they became a hole that stretched from her chin to her nose. A hole which was filled not with teeth, but with soft pink gum.

When she reached me her mouth closed quickly down, wet lips wrapping around my hand. Her tongue wiggled against my skin, tickling me in a way that made it difficult not to vomit. I tried as hard as I could to pull away, but she was too strong. My shoulder felt like it might pop out of place. She went deeper and deeper until she had taken me up to the girthiest part of my forearm. She pulled me onto the bed so hard that I fell on her stomach and my entire arm slipped inside her. The sharp bone of my elbow made a bulge in her neck.

Her grip loosened, and I pulled my arm out of her mouth with a wet *pop*. I tried to stand, but her legs wrapped around my back and she pulled me hard until our bodies were pressed flat against each other.

“Almost there, honey,” she said, and began to moan in a hoarse, excited voice.

I pushed against the bed as hard as I could, but I couldn’t budge an inch. She arched her back and pushed her body against mine. I closed my eyes and cried.

Just when I was sure she was going to kill me, I heard the patter of footsteps on the floor. There was a grunt, and I opened my eyes to see Jonathan jumping knee first onto the doll’s head.

“Agh!” She cried. Her grip on my back loosened. I rolled off the bed and onto the floor with a heavy thump.

Jonathan and I ran out the door, and I slammed it shut. Even once the door was locked, I braced myself and pulled the knob as hard as I could with both hands. 

Dad spoke from behind us.

“Jonathan! Jake! Oh Jesus Christ, what have you done?”

I couldn’t answer; my breath hitched in my throat. I remembered the way the doll’s mouth had closed over me, the feeling that she might swallow me whole. I still felt her body pushing against mine; I could hear the way she moaned when we touched.

I began sobbing, and as if an alarm had gone off, Jonathan cried out. “She tried to eat him! She was going to eat him!”

I ran to Dad and hugged him as hard as I could. He wrapped his arms around me, Jonathan ran to join us and we all held tight against each other.

“I… I can fix this,” Dad said. “Just, please… don’t ever go in there again,” he pulled away and looked each of us in the eyes. “Promise me.”

“Why do you keep her in there?” I asked between sobs.

“We need to kill her!” Jonathan cried.

“No,” Dad said. “Promise me you won’t ever go in there again.”

“We promise,” I said.

“Uh-huh,” Jonathan said. “We promise.”

“There’s something you need to understand,” Dad said, and then told us everything.

The doll’s name is Janice. Dad isn’t sure exactly when she became a part of our family, but she’s lived in that room since even before his great grandparents were born. He said that Janice was a good thing. *Good* for our family. She helped us when we needed it. She was the reason for our good luck, the reason we were always okay. She only asked for a few things, and as long as we gave her what she wanted, we’d be happy. More than happy. But if we didn’t give her what she wanted… well, according to Dad, that explained what happened to Mom.

It was in the middle of summer and we were planning on moving soon. All of our stuff was getting packed up, and our house was full of boxes. Dad knew that Jonathan and I were bummed, so he took us to an Astros game to cheer us up. Mom didn’t like big events, so she stayed at home to keep packing. 

It was a great game. Constant lead changes, back and forth all the way. The score was tied at 4-4 going into the bottom of the 9th, and the Astros won in the most miraculous way: a walk-off walk.

The whole crowd cheered. Dad, Jonathan, and I hugged each other and couldn’t stop laughing. We stopped for ice cream on the way home, and I remember being so shocked that Dad wasn’t in a rush to get to bed. It was nearly 11:00 and he almost never stayed up past 9:00. He was so happy. I didn’t want the night to end. 

We got home and were already calling for Mom as we walked through the front door. We were so excited to tell her about the game. 

We were only a couple of steps into the house when I realized something was wrong. Dad and I went quiet, but Jonathan continued to laugh and call, “Mom! Mom!”

“Shut up!” I snapped at him as we walked toward the kitchen. His voice was suddenly anxiety-inducing, like the sound could set off an avalanche. 

The kitchen faucet was running, but as loud as we had been calling her name, Mom wasn’t coming.

“Something’s burning,” Dad said. I followed behind him as he ran into the kitchen and toward the stove. Something was on fire and exuding a thick black smoke. He turned off the burner and started whacking the pan with a hand towel. 

After a few repetitions, his hand caught the pan and he groaned in pain. I turned in a circle around the kitchen, trying to find something, anything, I could use to help. Finally, I spotted an oven mitt on the kitchen table. I was running toward it when Jonathan screamed.

“Mom!”

I turned to find him pointing at the open laundry closet. From my angle I could only see a pool of blood and a few strands of blonde hair. I ran into the room and dropped to my knees in front of Mom. I tried desperately to shake her awake, but her skin was pale and her body was still.

Dad was right behind me. He screamed Mom’s name, then pulled out his phone and called the police. The three of us held her and cried over her body until the ambulance arrived. Mom was pronounced dead on scene. They said it was a freak accident. She just slipped and hit her head.

We had a funeral and did all the usual things that come after a death, but we didn’t move away like we had planned to. Somehow, Dad must’ve gotten out of whatever deal he had for selling the house. Over time, we unpacked our stuff and put it all back where it belonged.

I never understood why we decided not to move. Not until the night I met Janice.

Dad said, sitting in the hallway outside of The Room, that Janice was not happy about the move. When she found out that we were leaving, bad things started to happen. It started off small, a few scraped knees here and there, but when nothing Janice did changed our minds, she decided to make an example.

“But how do you know it was her?” I asked.

“*It was*,” Dad said. “But listen. She is a *good* thing for us. As long as we do what she says, as long as we listen, she will keep us happy, healthy, and safe. Nothing bad has to happen ever again. What happened to Mom… it was my fault. It wasn’t Janice’s.”

“What?” I said. “What do you mean it wasn’t Janice’s fault? You just said she killed Mom!”

“I pushed her,” he said. “She's good for us. *Good!*”

“Then why did you try to move?” I asked. “If everything is good, then why did you try to escape?”

“I–” his eyes fell to the floor, and for the first time I thought that he looked like an old man. “It doesn’t matter,” he said, and forced a smile.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

[Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ZJwtSrxTc)

Meeting was also attended by SVCA GM.

**CONTINUING BUSINESS**

**PSE Solar Panels** \- GM reported that she has not heard of any action on this item. She sent an email to PSE regarding the solar panel proposal but has not heard back yet.

**Coffee Shop Proposal** \- GM reports that this is ""dead for the moment"". The vendor who was interested in putting a coffee shop in the old administrative space in the Clubhouse wanted SVCA to bear the brunt of $80-90K in renovation costs, but SVCA declined. Vendor may still consider a coffee shop in another facility in SVCA if a suitable one were to become available.

Out of order discussion a few minutes later - A committee member stated that he believed that committee members still see the concept as desirable for the community. Suggestions included contacting established local coffee vendors or considering a mobile trailer option to minimize infrastructure costs.

Action item - GM will solicit companies to see what opportunities exist. GM reminded committee that a coffee shop is unlikely to be any significant contributor to SVCA income.

**Parking Sticker Program** \- Very few stickers are now being distributed and less than 1000 have been distributed since the beginning of the program, out of over 3000 homes (many of which would be presumed to have more than one vehicle). GM discussed that, as it stands now, the program is ineffective in answering the question of whether parking areas are crowded in the summer from resident or non-resident vehicles.

**Area Y Lease** \- Former committee chair had contacted a local realtor but received no reply. GM recommended issuing a formal proposal or request to commercial realtors to outline a plan of action for the land. She also said that limiting requests to investors interested in putting in an assisted living facility was much too narrow.

Action Item - GM to contact former chair to see who he has contacted, and submit a formal proposal to a list of commercial developers

**NEW BUSINESS**

**Community Survey -**

Lengthy discussion took place regarding the community survey, which is a requirement for the LRPC. GM discussed her professional background in market research and recommended against a long, paper-based survey like the one in 2020.

Committee agreed on a digital approach using Survey Monkey or similar, to be supplemented by a paper version available at the admin office. Initial survey should be 3-5 minutes (15-20 questions) to establish a baseline of member satisfaction and what was most important to them. Surveys would be connected to the member's address so that analytics could be done to see how answers vary by location and other demographics. *\[Note from me - how do we then maintain respondent privacy?\]* Right now, the SVCA database only includes email addresses for about 30% of members, despite efforts to increase that. This is a verified database of members, vs the eblast database that anyone can sign up for.

Committee discussed the list of proposed survey questions from the two directors on the committee.

Questions will be kept that are regarding overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend SV as a place to live, and how connected members feel to the HOA and its projects.

Questions regarding specific topics like ""gate experience"" *\[what is that??\]* or road maintenance satisfaction will likely be converted to a scale of 1-10 to determine importance to members.

Additional question added by committee - gauging interest in an indoor community gathering space or Senior Center

Additional question added by committee - willingness to fund projects / take on debt. GM gave financial background on the current status of SVCA funds.

Action Plan - GM will use committee feedback to draft a professionally structured, high-level survey. Draft will be brought back to committee for review at the next meeting.

GM also mentioned that it's possible that up to 22% of the homes in SV are rentals. Those owners are less likely to participate in surveys or voting. GM is basing that percentage on homes where the owner has listed a different address or a PO Box as the mailing address for the owner. SVCA is reaching out to those owners now to confirm whether the SV home is actually their 2nd home, whether it is a long-term rental or whether it is a short-term rental.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

We’re the same age and position and went to the same college (didn’t know each other there though). When we first met, he said he remembers seeing me before at a bar because he was actually friends with one of my friends (I have no recollection of this). He’s naturally a friendly and outgoing person, but when he’s taking to me, it just seems different. We sit near each other and he is always asking me questions about my personal life. And when I answer his questions he seems genuinely interested and is like “wow I didn’t know that about you” stuff like that. When he talks to me, he usually makes eye contact for a second and then kinda looks down.

I joined a new team at work last week, and he did a coffee order with his team and messaged me and said “it wasn’t the same without you”. We had a holiday party with the company last month. He complimented the bracelet I was wearing, but he didn’t talk to me much at the party. After, a few of us went to a bar. At the bar, he wouldn’t stop talking to me despite us being in a group. He kept asking me more questions about my life and offered to buy me a drink. The day after this, he requested to follow me on Instagram.

1qm7tvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittylifehacks/comments/1qm7tvm/are_you_looking_for_meaning_of_the_life/,are you looking for meaning of the life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qm7s2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qm7s2z,"Mafia King Begged Me Back—Too Late, I'm Already Mrs. Delta Commander. Oops","Sixteen, hormones raging, my childhood sweetheart Caspian and I were home alone watching porn.


Next thing I knew, he was inside me—took my V-card right on the couch.


Both our parents walked in mid-thrust.


His dad beat him bloody, made him swear he'd marry me.


After that, we were Manhattan's golden couple.


But right before the wedding, he vanished on a cartel takedown in Colombia.


Two years I spent hunting him down.


Only to find him balls-deep in Jade, his rescue angel.


Caspian had lost all his memory.


But he married me anyway, kept that teenage promise.


Then came seven fucking years of hell.


He never touched me again. Separate rooms. Separate lives.


He even moved to Santa Fe and started rawing every girl in sight—his little revenge tour.


Until my dad got framed for fraud.


Caspian finally came back, cleared his name, took a poison blade meant for me.


Dying in my arms, he choked out:


""I never failed anyone in this life... except Jade. I owed her my life.""


""If there's a next life, don't look for me. Let me stay with Jade instead.""


I nodded through my tears. ""Okay.""


When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day I found him.


Fuck that. Not this time.


Let him rot with his brainwashing slut.


This time, I chose Grayson Archer—the Delta Commander Caspian hated most.


""Dad, I'm DONE with Caspian. I'll accept that contract marriage!""


...


San Francisco Bay at night. Neon lights reflecting off the water.


Mrs. Blackwood was crying happy tears beside me.


""Caspian's really here?""


""Yes, ma'am. That Jade girl pulled him out from the docks. They've been living in this walk-up ever since.""


""I'm going up.""


I snapped back to reality.


The building was falling apart—exposed wires crawling over the walls, a tacky wedding sign on the window, daring me to look away.


The same damn place Caspian kept mumbling about when he was dying.


I grabbed Mrs. Blackwood's arm.


""Wait.""


She turned. ""Scarlett, what's wrong?""


Last time around, by the time I tracked him here, Caspian was already in love with that coffee shop bitch, ready to marry her.


I tried talking to him multiple times, but he refused to leave.


So I brought Mrs. Blackwood and a top neurologist to force his hand.


That night—tonight, originally—seeing his mother finally made him agree to hypnotherapy.


Next day, his memory came back. He agreed to come home.


And the second we left, Jade overdosed, killed herself.


Her death became the wall between us.


Caspian died protecting me, but his dying wish was to rewind and stay with her instead.


I swallowed the pain.


""Mrs. Blackwood, they're about to get married.""


She patted my hand.


""Sweetheart, Caspian just lost his memory. Once he remembers, he'll know who really matters.""


""You two grew up together. Twenty years. We all saw it.""


I stepped back. ""There's something I never told you. Maybe this is a sign.""


""I... my uterus is damaged. I can't have kids anymore.""


Silence.


Just the distant sound of a ferry horn.


Mrs. Blackwood went pale. Her lips trembled.


""You're young. Medicine these days—""


""The best doctors already confirmed it.""


Two years hunting Caspian across war zones and cartel territory wrecked my body.


I ignored every warning sign.


By the time we wanted kids, it was too late.


Doctors said my chances were almost zero.


After a long silence, she sighed deeply.


""Even so, the Blackwoods won't abandon you. Caspian wouldn't care.""


I bowed slightly.


""My mom died young. You treated me like your own daughter.""


""I can't repay that kindness by ending your family line.""


In the original timeline, even after Caspian got his memory back, he blamed Mrs. Blackwood and me for Jade's death.


He shut us out completely, lived alone in Santa Fe.


I lost my husband. Mrs. Blackwood lost her son.


Mrs. Blackwood exhaled heavily.


""Fine. We won't disturb him tonight. We'll talk later.""


Back home, she brought in her private medical team. They confirmed everything I said.


The lead doctor hesitated.


""With years of careful treatment, maybe there's a slim chance. But... no guarantees.""


I returned the engagement token—a ring with an encrypted chip inside.


""My fate with the Blackwoods is over.""


""Since Caspian doesn't remember anyway, let's just... let it be. Everyone moves on.""


Chapter 2


Mrs. Blackwood's face was unreadable.


Next day, I kept pushing.


At first, she still refused to accept Caspian marrying that coffee girl.


Until she saw firsthand how protective he was of Jade.


Her son had cheated death—she couldn't stay hard.


We showed up at their door again.


The metal gate creaked open. Jade went white the second she saw me.


I'd been here enough times already. She was on guard.


She stood there in a cheap white dress, eyes sharp with fear.


""What... what do you want now?""


""I told you already—Caspian's brain injury hasn't healed. You drag him away, you'll make it worse.""


I kept my voice even.


""When did I say I was taking him anywhere?""


""Caspian's the Blackwood heir. Mrs. Blackwood accepts you two now. There's no rush to get married.""


Every time before, Jade used Caspian's condition as an excuse to block me.


This time, she clenched her teeth.


""You keep coming around my fiancé. How do I know you're not trying to break us up?""


Behind me, Mrs. Blackwood bristled.


""I gave my word. You think I'm lying?""


""Even if my son is injured, he has the best medical team in the world. Stop being dramatic.""


Mrs. Blackwood came from old money. Her presence alone was intimidating.


Jade's eyes welled up.


She stumbled backward and collapsed onto the floor.


""But his headaches—only my massage helps. It's a family technique.""


""What the hell are you doing here?""


A tall figure strode over, pulled Jade up, shielded her.


His eyes on us were ice cold.


""I told you—I don't care who you are.""


""Jade saved my life. She's my wife. You treat her like this again, don't blame me for what happens.""


Mrs. Blackwood swayed.


I stepped in immediately to steady her.


""This is your mother.""


I locked eyes with him.


Familiar face. Stranger's gaze.


Caspian froze. His eyes swept over Mrs. Blackwood's features—similar to his own.


After a beat: ""...Mom? Sorry.""


Behind him, Jade was crying softly.


""Caspian, so it's true. Do you still want to marry me?""


Originally, we were supposed to take them both back today.


But Jade insisted on having a ceremony here first.


Mrs. Blackwood had no choice but to agree.


Inside the cramped apartment.


Two figures stood side by side, every movement intimate and tender.


I stood off to the side, my mind drifting.


Malibu. The deck of his beach house.


Teenage Caspian grinning, tossing me a custom flash drive.


""Scarlett Monroe, I'm gonna marry you someday. This is my promise.""


I looked up. He stood against the light, his face blurred—


Only his voice clear and steady.


I blinked. They'd already exchanged cheap rings.


It was done.


Next day, we headed back to the mansion.


The whole drive, Mrs. Blackwood kept bringing up my childhood with Caspian.


""When you were one, at your first birthday party, you didn't grab the toy gun or the keyboard. You grabbed Scarlett's hand.""


""When you were seven, you stole your father's original Bitcoin wallet from the safe. He beat you for it. Turns out, you gave it to Scarlett.""


Mrs. Blackwood was getting into it.


But I noticed Caspian's face darkening, and cut in.


""There's a coffee shop up ahead. Let's take a break.""


Mrs. Blackwood nodded.


After we got out, Jade looked at me with wounded eyes.


""Mrs. Blackwood doesn't like me, does she?""


I kept my tone flat. ""You're overthinking.""


Jade murmured ""Oh"" and got back in the car.


From inside, Caspian's voice drifted out. ""Head's killing me again.""


""I'll massage it."" Jade, all caring.


I frowned.


Last time around, I didn't remember him having headaches like this.


Before we left again, Caspian came up to me alone.


Before I could react, he pulled me into a dark alley.


""Did you tell my mom to say all that?""


His eyes narrowed, sharp and cold.


I froze. ""I didn't—""


He cut me off.


""I don't care if it was you or not. Don't let my mom upset Jade again.""


""As for you and me—whatever happened before, it's over.""


""I only care about Jade now. Please... forget it all.""


He gave a brief nod, distant and polite.


I answered seriously. ""Okay.""


I turned and walked out first.


Jade saw Caspian following behind me. Her eyes immediately went red.


Caspian lost his composure, rushed past me toward her.


I got back in the car.


The rest of the drive, I could faintly hear him comforting her.


""There's nothing between me and her.""


""If you're worried I'll get my memory back, I'd rather NEVER remember.""


Chapter 3


By the time we arrived, the sky had cleared.


Outside the Blackwood estate, I helped Mrs. Blackwood out of the car.


We were about to head inside when Jade's voice came from behind.


""By the way, who is this woman? Anyone can just walk in and out of the Blackwood house now?""


I stopped and turned around.


Jade clutched Caspian's sleeve, staring at me, unwilling to back down.


Caspian's face was blank. He looked at Mrs. Blackwood.


""Mom, Jade's right. I'm married now. I shouldn't be letting random women come and go.""


Mrs. Blackwood's face hardened. She shot Jade a sharp look.


""Since when do you decide who's allowed in MY house?""


Jade's face went red.


""That's not what I meant... it's just that Miss Monroe clearly has feelings for Caspian.""


""And he promised to only love me I don't want to waste her time.""


Caspian nodded.


""She's right. I have a wife now. I shouldn't stay entangled with people from the past.""


Twenty years of history. One case of amnesia.


Now I was a ""complication.""


I almost laughed. It was pathetic.


Caspian really hadn't changed.


He was obsessive about loyalty.


Back then, he swore to me.


""After we're married, I'll only have eyes for you. No other women. Ever. I won't let you down.""


Except now I was the ""other woman"" he was trying to cut off.


Mrs. Blackwood looked ready to explode.


I gently pressed her hand.


I turned to Caspian, voice cool.


""You're overthinking, Mr. Blackwood. Our families go way back.""


""Mrs. Blackwood treats me like her own daughter. I see you as a brother. That's it.""


Mrs. Blackwood's eyes welled up. She gripped my hand.


""Then it's official. From today on, Scarlett is my goddaughter. Anyone who messes with her messes with the Blackwoods!""


Jade's face twisted.


Caspian looked dazed for a second after hearing his mother's words.


I didn't stick around.


I went inside with Mrs. Blackwood, then made an excuse and left for my dad's place.


One problem handled. Another one waiting.


Seven years from now, my dad would be framed for stock manipulation by his right-hand man.


That same man was currently a top executive at Monroe Corp.


From the moment I woke up, I'd been monitoring him through back channels.


Recently, he finally slipped.


After gathering all the evidence, I walked into my dad's study with an encrypted hard drive.


We talked until past midnight.


I laid out everything—names, dates, proof.


Dad had survived decades in cutthroat business.


This time he wouldn't be blindsided.


As for my engagement, he sighed, pain flickering in his eyes.


""I never thought one mission overseas would cause all this.""


""But since we're here, there's something you should know.""


""Before you were born, your mother made a contract marriage with her best friend.""


""When you grew up and fell for Caspian, I turned them down.""


""We owe them an apology. The boy's family is in New York. Good man.""


""Maybe... you could take some time. Go clear your head?""


I'd already learned my lesson about marriage.


I shook my head. ""I'm not leaving. And I don't want another relationship.""


Dad frowned. ""Are you staying because you still can't let him go?""


""You're loyal, I know. But if you want, I won't let Caspian walk away from this engagement.""


I shook my head again. ""I'm the one who broke it off.""


""I'm over Caspian.""


Dad sighed.


""There are plenty of good men out there. I just want you to move on.""


I smiled faintly, then changed the subject.


""I heard you worked with a hypnosis investigation team years ago. I need them to look into Jade.""


Dad's eyes widened.


""What?! Is there more to Caspian's amnesia?""

The jist of the job is commercial due diligence (essentially site inspections). Over the past year this company has given me a majority of my work, sending me all over my region, as well as North Carolina, Texas, USVI and Florida. Having relatively limited credit usage (I don’t have student loans from academic scholarships), I have been using my Dad’s AA Citi card to pay for my travel and paying him directly after the company pays me.

Obviously this is not only inconvenient for the both of us at best, but I can’t help I’m feeling leaving money on the table without the benefits of my own CC. As you’ll see below, I do have a Venture One card, but I realized quickly that the benefits of the card aren’t great. Additionally, it’s a card I share with my SO, something we did together to initially build my credit. We hardly use it, but I feel that it would be inappropriate to put business expenses on, as well as probably a waste of potential points.

Here is my information:

Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date)

⁠•	Venture One | $8,000 limit February 2022

•	⁠FICO Score: 727

•	⁠Oldest account age: 4 years

•	⁠Income: e.g. $90-95,000

•	⁠Open to Business Cards: Preferably not

•	⁠What's the purpose of your next card? Travel for work/ compensated by the company.

•	⁠Do you have any cards you've been looking at? Amex Plat/Delta Amex Reserve

•	⁠Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? Typically I would prefer a card specific to travel expenses.

Basically, I am looking for a card for my business travel. I anticipate traveling up to 6 times a months, paying for everything (food, rentals, hotels, flights, etc) out of pocket, before expensing it. My position has a fixed rate, and then a compensation after completion of each project. Part of the compensation element is based on project cost, which is partially influenced on my travel costs. I have relatively limited credit usage “experiences” and have got “pre-approvals” through Amex. I don’t mind the AF as long as the value is worth it (which I find in the Amex cards). Lounge access would also be important to me - While not guaranteed to be “free” I have found that access to virtually unlimited coffee and the bare minimums for food helps both the budget and the work efficiency.

My problem ultimately lies in the fact that I’m non-committal. I fly Delta primarily. Over the last year they have made up 40% of my travel. I’m not adverse to a good deal either though. I’ve managed to rack up flights with 6 different airlines this past year, and the flexibility matters to the bottom line. I’ve been researching CCs since the position was initially offered to me a month ago, and I don’t feel any closer to the answer than I was. I’m honestly open to any suggestions. For instance, I see suggestions for Robinhood Gold Card sometimes, and I already pay for the Robinhood Gold subscription. I use it as a savings account as well as  brokerage because of the APY. Ultimately the only thing I realize is that the CC companies clearly are trying to confuse those of us not in the financial industry.

TD:LR - 26 year old with limited credit experience needs a travel card that can help bring additional value to business-centric travel. I’m anticipating 72 trips for work a year, typically throughout the country.

I ask her what she wants, and she tells me ""that's no way to speak to a paying customer. I need you to stop standing around in line and go back to the bakery and get me my cake with-""

I cut her off and told her that I didn't work there anymore and haven't for 2 years. She than accused me of lying. I rolled my eyes at that statement, turned around and grabbed my coffee. 

As I qas leaving the lady decided to trip me and make me spill my coffee all over my self. I asked her what the fuck her problem was. 

She told me that's what you get for not serving me and lying. I told her ""Lady I told you I don't work here i work at Walmart. 

Just as she was about to say something the manager came out from behind the Caribou desk to ask if I was OK, I said yes. She than told the lady to leave or she'd call the police. After hearing the word police the lady turned white as a ghost and left. 

The manager told me that they'd remake my coffee free if charge. I got my new coffee and left. Safe to say I won't be getting Caribou Coffee for a while. ",5,1769310827.0,IDontWorkHere,0,0.78,False

What I mainly swore off was OLD. I met this guy around 8 months ago on a group walk; I  mentioned I was going on a trip to Italy and he said he'd like to find out about it. Then he said he was going through a ""horrible divorce."" So I thought, never mind about him. So time passed. Due to a recent injury, I can't go on the walks so started attending the groups' dinners. I saw him a few weeks ago and asked if he was still interested in Italy (he is) and that I'd had an injury and couldn't do the walks. He offered to go on a slow walk with me and I gave him my number. So we've been texting, emailing and talking like crazy. I sat with him at two more him group dinners and this week went for the slow walk and coffee, then parted with a nice hug. We have plans next week and would have this weekend as well but weather here is bad. I have to say that I don't exactly have ""butterflies,"" but am  impressed that he's intelligent , interesting, seems to be into me, and... highly unusual for most men around here... impeccably groomed.

**TLDR: I** want to see a specialist so badly but tldr I may not be able to until I get a new job that has premium insurance (2 months from now?).  In that case, I am trying to self-diagnose (lol) but with higher caution. I am actually spiraling/becoming extremely depressed and I just want to heal properly. I'm thinking maybe at the 8 week point (mid Feb) I'll re-admit myself to the first ER that had an on-call orthopedic surgeon and see if they see any progress.

Image is from Dec 30 initial fracture. Doc's Description: acute minimally displaced intra-articular fifth metatarsal base fracture. Joint spaces are otherwise normal. No focal bone lesions. No ankle effusion. There is mild foot soft tissue swelling.

\-------

(mid/later 20s F) I fell at end of dec.  I tripped walking on a curb in platform shoes and landed I think on my side and then rolled onto my toes. saw urgent care next day at the time and they recommended NWB 6 weeks after a X-ray. ($800 lol.)  I was out of the state so when I returned (1.5 week post injury) I fell again lol and went to ER the next day. They did new x-ray and the nurse said something like oh she can see some healing!!! but no new-fracture or no surgery needed. also I'd say im relatively healthy. I like working out now, I used to dance a lot as a teen, I have high arched feet.

Today is Jan 24 so it has been 26 days since injury and I've been completely NWB. Long story short I'm unemployed atm and medi-cal is really difficult to use/get help with. My follow-up appointment was denied authorization (this made me crash out, I was so excited for this appointment) and its been a nightmare trying to get an appointment to see an orthopedic/podiatrist specialist. My appointment was supposed to be this monday as my 4 week follow-up but if I pay out of pocket it is likely to be $1000 for them to x-ray me and say ok keep wearing the boot. LIKE.... 😭

Yesterday when they cancelled my appointment, I re-admitted myself into a different ER in hopes that they had an on-call ortho surgeon like the other ER that could see an x-ray and let me know if there is some healing. (ER admits are covered by medi-cal) and they did a new x-ray, but also long story short the doctor was so unhelpful and so unkind I didn't get any help besides a new x-ray. He was so unhelpful and useless that I had a full blown panic attack and started sobbing uncontrollably because he wouldn't give me any information and refused to refer me to an ortho specialist lol. ANYWAYS thats a different rant about the US healthcare system, I'm going to take this x-ray to all of the doctors/students/healthcare ppl I know on this planet to get any sort of review. I just want to know if there are any sort of signal of healing. I'm not asking for it to be like perfectly union-ed to walk on; I just need positive indicators that it is progressively healing like even 10% after 4 weeks. Because I know there is still a long road ahead. If there is non-union AT ALL; then thats a diff story and I will need to figure out how to get surgery on medi-cal. but I'm feeling positive with my routine that its healing properly. On the surface level, I think I'm doing all the right things and ChatGPT + ScienceDirect Journals + Youtube + Reddit as my bible to stay informed.

Right now:

Daily Diet: I'm daily NWB (26 days), drinking lots of water, trying to get 8/9 hours of sleep, calcium, mag, zinc, vitamin d (I think I'm going to add some other supplements too), drinking collagen-rich proteins/soups/meat, increasing milk (not a crazy amount but im being heavy handed with my milk in my coffee hehe), on crutches or knee scooter.

Exercise: Every morning I try to do full body stretches/yoga to keep the rest of my body ok. The first few weeks I wore the boot nonstop but it was so uncomfortable. I switch on and off with the ace wrap at home. If I leave the house, I for sure put the boot on. I'm mostly sitting at the table or in my bed most of the day anyways. This week I've been wiggling my toes and like gently massaging other parts of my feet. My toes have definitely lost mobility and that freaks me out. My ankle has always felt fine.

This week: the swelling at my toes have gone down significantly. My top of foot is still like bruised but the color is much better and the swelling is going down. It is least swollen in the morning and obviously most swollen at night after sitting all day or etc. That area feels sensitive but not as painful as it used to be a few weeks ago.

In general, theres no active sharp pain really ever, but it's because I don't try to step with it or twist it or anything. At night, my foot has begun to feel a bit weird (chatgpt says it's all positive). It is tingly when I elevate (fluid moving downwards), was kinda itchy for the first time yesterday (apparently that means healing)? and my toes are kind of stiff and full like the skin isn't as squishy but feels like its full of something? (fluid I presume). I actually never really feel or see anything at the fracture side of my foot, its my toes/top of foot (my secondary area of impact when I fell) bothers me the most. but that would def change if I started to walk on it.

**My plan so far:** Continue NWB for another 2 weeks just to be safe (I've seen averages range 4-6 but I'm going to be conservative since I'm self-diagnosing). For the next 2 weeks, I'm going to begin to practice planting both feet face down when I'm sitting on a chair at a resting position. I searched up what does it even mean to PWB and its not even walking, but more so being able to have your foot like rest on the flor or kiss the floor. Right now Ive developed a subconscious fear of things touching my foot so I'm always sitting cross-legged so that my injured foot is always not touching the floor. (I know it's bad for the hips Its really hard to sit comfortably otherwise). Maybe at the end of the first week, I might try like increasing slight pressure when I'm sitting and hopefully convert that to a standing version. I'm also going to continue rotating and massaging my feet. If I feel any sort of sharp pain, I will be stopping. if it's dull ache, I will proceed with caution.

Side note: I'm a little afraid of the twisting motion of my foot. That is the one part that occasionally happens on accident and I feel more stronger ""pain"". I haven't tried to twist my foot. (I normally crack my toes and turn my ankles a lot in everyday stretching and for fun so I haven't at all with my left foot). **Is there a safe way to go about testing this as I'm learning mobility again?**

Side Side note: I know chatgpt may hallucinate, but after crying and sobbing to doctors in-person and being denied service anyways, you get a little desperate for anything lol.

I'm waiting for my newest x-ray from yesterday to upload but I'm hoping to see progress or callus formation or like slightly dulled thinner fracture line. I'll update it when I get it.

1qm7m3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qm7m3d/in_the_void_of_war/,In The Void of War,"*This is a complete rewrite of a previous series I posted here, that was called Into the Void.*

The Earth is dead.

Humanity thrives in the vastness of the deep void of space. With the advent of the Focused Observable Light Displacement faster than light travel system, homo-sapiens left their home world to rot, and spread themselves across the Milky-Way galaxy like cockroaches fleeing a burning building. Except it was a planet that was ravaged by nuclear and biological warfare.

Like cockroaches, Humanity was hard to kill. The humans of the past survived many hardships and setbacks along their path of colonizing the void of space. 

Taylor Lee Holt knew all of this, yet his dream did not care.

As he lay sleeping comfortably in his bed, he walked down an old dirt road on a planet he had never set foot on. He could feel the wind rustling his hair, the sunlight warming his pale skin. In the dream, he hopped the wood fence that lined the road he walked, and ran his fingers over the top of the flowing grass that grew wild. 

As he walked through the overgrown hayfield, a flurry of wings and squawks of birds startled him awake. One flew right into his face.

Sitting up with a start, Taylor looked about himself in worry. The low light of his illuminator brightened with his awakening, as he turned in his bed and went to stand. As he hung his legs over its edge and placed his feet on the cold plasteel floor of his living quarters, a chime played and a message began to play through the myriad of speakers built into his quarters walls. 

“General Republic wishes you a good morning, Mr. Holt! This wake up message comes with a 5% discount on your next purchase of any General Republics subsidiary breakfast products! General Republic, Here For You!”  

Rubbing his eyes, Taylor shook his head and stood, stretching with an exclamation.

“Fuuuuckkk Offfff…..ugh.” he mumbled as he felt a catch in his lower back.

“Thank you for your acceptance of the discount provided to you, Mr. Holt! It has been added to your coupon bank. General Republic, Here for You!”

Shaking his head again, Taylor picked his glasses up off the shelf mounted by his bed, rubbed his eyes and put them on. Walking over to a spot of his quarters wall, he waved a hand and with a whir and hum a sink slid out and locked in place. Shortly after a panel slid to the side above the sink and a mirror appeared.

Taylor stared at the reflection that appeared in it. His 5 o’ clock shadow darkened his cheeks, dark sacks under his eyes noting he hadn’t slept well.  He frowned at his reflection.

“Ain’t getting any younger, Holt. Got a long day ahead of yourself.”

Reaching out, Taylor pushed a button beside the mirror and a container slid out. He opened the lid and pulled an old fashioned razor blade and shaving cream out. Washing his face and shaving, he placed the items back and brushed his teeth with the subsonic dental tool that sat in a charger mounted on the sink. 

As he finished brushing his teeth, a screen appeared out of the wall beside the sink. It winked to life, as the morning news began to play.

*“The United Republic of Jorungand has placed sanctions on the Sovereign Socialist Stations of Sirius, in retaliation to the Sovereignty's unjustified blockade of a Jorungand licensed voidstation orbiting a mining planet…”*

“Because of course! Fucking Sovies.” Taylor grumbled to himself as he washed his face off after shaving. He looked at his reflection again, this time he smiled.

“At least you don’t look half-dead anymore, Holt.”

He laughed at himself, a fake, hollow sound that died in the small room he had been calling home the last few months.

With his morning routine complete, Taylor stepped away from the sink and waved again, turning away as the sink and mirror and shelf disappeared back into their holes. The screen disappeared also, cutting off a commercial for the latest Zarg’s Revenge holo-epic.

As he started his walk across his living quarters, a table slid from the wall opposite of the sink, and a stool slowly raised itself from the floor. A ding echoed through his quarters as a small door opened and a cup deposited itself onto the table from the wall, steam rising from the dark liquid it contained.

Taylor sat on the stool, and grabbed the cup of coffee, regarding the dark liquid and the greasy film that sat on top of it. He blew on it with a grimace. 

“It is 5:45 AM, Mr. Holt. You are scheduled to arrive at the Philema Naval yard by 7:10 AM, and board the Fitzgerald and man your post by 8:00 AM sharp. Your discount of 5% has been deducted from this morning's caffeine libation, and the difference has been paid from your CredWal. Thank you for using the General Republics Quarters Assistant. General Republic, Here for You!.”

“Yeah, yeah, I know. Don’t rush me.” he replied to the announcement as he swirled the coffee around in the cup and stared at the wall of his quarters. He had packed up and shipped off what personal knick knacks and belongings he had used to decorate his quarters the day before, sending the three boxes off to a voidstation storage facility near his posting. 

“Never realized how depressing this place was, until now.” he said aloud. Taylor had found that, even though talking to yourself wasn’t considered sane, it damned sure helped keep the crazy away.

“So does that mean I am crazy?” he said to the cup of coffee in his hands, and genuinely laughed at himself.

“I suppose so. Gotta be a little bit crazy these days.” he frowned again. 

Taylor sipped at his coffee silently, the acrid taste of the vat grown flash frozen product shocking his body awake. He downed it after a few more sips, almost gagging at the horrid taste as he felt the warm liquid travel down his throat and into his stomach. 

Realizing that his 48 hour leave was finally coming to an end, he sighed heavily and prepared himself for the next part of his life as a Republic Navy Voidsmen.

“Two days just isn’t enough time, but it is what it is.” Taylor muttered to himself as he donned his Republic Void Navy uniform. It was an unassuming white and gray two-piece affair that looked like casual attire to the uninformed. His rank, Petty Officer 3rd Class was embossed on his chest, which was a star with three trails following it, its thread a faint gold in color. Taylor tapped it a few times and felt a bit of pride in himself for having finally attained the rank, and assuming the responsibilities that came with it.

After checking himself in the mirror again(the dark sacks were still under his eyes, typical) he slapped his cover on his head and out his quarters door he walked. As he stepped out, a message began to play as he strode down the featureless white hallway toward his private docking area. He opted to mute half of it, even though it cost him some credits. By the time he made it to the end of his hallway, the message continued playing through his Ocular Infotainment Auditory Implant, or “Wee-ayes” as they were called in short.

“...General Republic, Here for You.” finished playing in his inner ear, and a flash of the General Republics logo appeared in the lower left part of his vision. Taylor blinked, as he entered the tubular elevator that would take him down the space stations inner spine, where he would exit on the Docking level, so he could board his personal voidcraft and make his way across the galaxy to his new posting.

He was excited about his destination, of course. Taylor smiled to himself as he made his way through the twisting corridors of the space station he had called home the last few months.

As Taylor entered the airlock that separated the station itself to the docking area, he looked out of the singular viewport that allowed an external view, and watched as several makes and models of various personal voidcraft silently glided through the inky void of space. Far off in the distance, a flash of light caught his attention as several large crafts sliced through space and time and began their approach to the station. 

“Ah, a supply Collier flotilla? Guess its time for beans and coffee again. About time.” Taylor muttered to himself as he turned the hand crank of the hatch that exited the airlock, making sure to have confirmed that his voidcrafts dock was properly pressurized. He walked through the door and closed it behind him, securing it with a spin of the crank.

He walked around his Hawk Corsair, doing preflight checks like they were second nature. His voidcraft was sleek, the front of it tapered down to point, like a needle, that got larger in diameter until it reached the cockpit, the crystal clear canopy reflecting the dull light of the docking bay. It had stubby, angular wings where the AG-Drives hung, and behind the cockpit two Pratt and Dynamics G1100 electro-fusion thrusters sat, one above the other. 

His craft hung in a carefully controlled anti-gravity field, its fuel and power hook ups gently floating the closer they were to the craft, but taut as they got closer to the attachment points inside the dock.

Taylor activated the magnets on his voidboots, and unhooked his craft from the docks umbilical cords. They instantly retracted up and out of the way, and he disengaged his boots as his canopy slid back and up in a whoosh. The lush leather interior came to life, consoles lighting up as he floated himself inside. 

He grabbed the straps of his seat and pulled himself down into it, buckling himself in and engaging his boots again, locking him in place. The canopy closed with a shushed whirr around him, and he could feel the air equalize as his ears popped.

Running through his preflight checks again inside the cockpit, he flipped a toggle switch on his left and the flight stick slid out of its recess in front of him, and the flight controls flipped up out of the faux wood dash of his craft.

“Hawk Corsair D19-6G-HOLT requesting clearance to depart BU-67-G.” he said aloud.

A moment later, over his Wee-Aye, a voice spoke inside his head.

“Hawk Corsair HOLT, you are cleared to depart BU-67-G. Good luck at your new posting!”

The metallic, sing-song voice that replied was an AISU that everyone aboard the Barracks Unit called Mama. Holt smiled and nodded. 

“Thanks, Mama. I’ll say hi to the AISU on the Fitzgerald for you.”

“Oh, would you darlin?! Tell them to whoop them Sovie asses for me!” came the AISUs reply, the metallic voice sounding almost truly excited for Taylor.

Taylor grabbed the flight stick and engaged the AG-Drives and gently guided his craft out as his docking unit depressurized and the outer hatch opened into the void of space.  As he glided through the inky black void, bright flashes of light caught his attention. A frigate group had appeared far away, the ugly, blocky ships festooned with Close In Weapon Systems and pockmarked with missile bay made a hard burn to make their way to another FOLD lane.  

“Time to go to work.” 

Taylor said to himself, as he got in line to the exit FOLD lane that led him to his destination. He had gotten behind a few other personal voidcraft, and farther ahead of himself and the others were a patrol group and the supply collier flotilla that had came in earlier. The frigates that had came in joined it, settling in around the two massive, open gantry vessels. 

“Oh, guess they’ve already unloaded and are heading out. That sure is a lot of escort ships for those two colliers. Wonder where they are going?” Taylor mused to himself, as the ships seemed to compress in on themselves, then disappeared. 

“Please approach the exit lane. FOLD will commence in exactly 4 minutes. General Republic, Here for You!” played through his crafts speakers, as Taylor let the AISU guide his ship into the range of the FOLD arrays sphere of control.

As he waited, Taylor browsed the Enter-net and found that the latest Zargs Revenge had been released.

“Hot damn! Yes!” he exclaimed, as he rented the holo-epic, and began to play it. At least he would have something to watch as he made his way across the galaxy. It very well could be the last time he would have the time to enjoy anything like watching a holo-epic.

“Bet, Warg!” Taylor exclaimed, as his ship was flung toward its destination, and his destiny.",7,1769310740.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Day 0 | Arrival + North Hutongs Linear Loop

From: airport → central base → Yonghe area → Gulou area → Shichahai/Qianhai.

Morning: arrival, hotel check-in or luggage drop, recovery buffer.

Afternoon: Yonghe Temple (Lama Temple) (Tibetan Buddhist temple complex) → Confucius Temple & Imperial College Museum (historic state academy site) → Wudaoying Hutong (hutong (traditional Beijing alleyway network) with cafes/shops).

Evening: Drum and Bell Towers (historic timekeeping towers) → Nanluoguxiang Hutong (popular hutong shopping lane) → Shichahai/Qianhai hutong evening walk (matches your “evening tour near Lake Qianhai”).

Daily transport (choose one; all work without backtracking):

	1.	Recommended: subway/metro (rapid urban rail). Best for predictability and avoiding traffic.

	2.	Alternative: Didi (Chinese ride-hailing app). Best when jet-lagged; slower in peak traffic.

	

Day 0 notes :

	1.	Many Beijing attractions require passport-linked booking; keep your passport on you, not in the hotel.

Day 1 | Mutianyu Great Wall + Easy Night Market Street

From: central base → Mutianyu → central/east dinner street.

Morning: depart early to Mutianyu Great Wall (Great Wall section in Huairou).

Midday: your preferred route is feasible but physically demanding: cable car up near Tower 14 → hike toward Tower 20 → return to Tower 14 → continue toward Tower 6 → toboggan down (toboggan (gravity-powered slide ride)). Expect unavoidable partial backtrack between Towers 14 and 20 because it is a dead-end segment.

Evening: Wangfujing Street (major pedestrian shopping street) for low-effort food and people-watching. ( haha, no locals go there, but it’s ok going there to take a look)

Daily transport (key decision day):

	1.	Recommended: Mutianyu official tourist line / shuttle products listed by the Mutianyu official site (official transport options curated for tourists).  

	2.	Alternative: private car (Didi or hired driver). Fastest door-to-door, but you must secure a guaranteed return plan. ( Didi black car will cost you 400 rmb each way.  Other type of cars will be cheaper)

3.	Alternative: public transit via Dongzhimen + 916 bus to Huairou + local buses (lowest cost, highest complexity). The Mutianyu official site describes the 916-bus-based public route.  ( it’s super easy!)

Day 1 notes :

	1.	Weather on the Wall can shift quickly; bring wind layer and sun protection even if the city feels warm.

	2.	Confirm last cable car/chairlift/toboggan time at the base on arrival; missing last down-ride can force a long walk.

	3.	Carry water; services on-wall are limited and crowded.

Day 2 | Panjiayuan + Temple of Heaven + Qianmen/Liulichang

From: Panjiayuan → Temple of Heaven → Qianmen/Dashilar → Liulichang → (optional) back to Qianmen for night lights.

Morning: Panjiayuan Flea Market (collectibles market) (shops open daily; stalls strongest on weekends).  

Afternoon: Temple of Heaven (imperial ritual park complex) core sights; then continue north to Qianmen Street (historic commercial street) and Dashilar (old Beijing shopping lanes), and then go to this street called “杨梅斜竹街” and “西兴隆街”.  You can search this coffee shop called “voyage coffee”.

Evening: Liulichang Old Street (antique books/calligraphy street) then finish at Qianmen (linear west→east finish).

Daily transport:

	1.	Recommended: subway/metro. Best for moving SE↔S↔central with low variance.

	2.	Alternative: Didi. Best if carrying purchases from Panjiayuan.

	3.	Alternative: bus. Works but slower; only use if you enjoy surface-city views.

Day 2 notes:

	1.	Panjiayuan “night market” operations exist on specific weekdays/weekends; the Beijing municipal portal reports night market schedules and hours—verify for your exact date.  

	2.Market rule: assume most “antiques” are decorative. Buy what you like, not what you think will appraise.

Day 3 | Summer Palace Full Day (Avoid Monday Closures)

From: central base → Summer Palace → (optional) nearby north-side evening.

Morning: Summer Palace (imperial garden/lake complex) highlights: Tower of Buddhist Incense, Longevity Hill viewpoints, Long Corridor.

Afternoon: 17-Arch Bridge → Kunming Lake shoreline → Marble Boat; optional rowboat/ferry (confirm day-of operations on site).

Evening: optional low-transfer add-on near the northwest/north corridor (e.g., Olympic Park exterior stroll) if you still have energy; otherwise return and rest.

Daily transport:

	1.	Recommended: subway/metro + short last-mile walk.

	2.	Alternative: Didi (convenient return when tired).

	

Day 3 notes:

	1.	Key Summer Palace sites can be closed on Mondays (partial closure pattern), so scheduling it on Sunday is the correct move for full coverage.  

	2.	Foreigners can book municipal park tickets using passports via “Visiting Beijing Parks”; have it set up the night before.  

	

Day 4 | “Neighborhood Day”: 798 + Liangma River + Sanlitun

From: 798 → Liangma River → Sanlitun.

Morning: 798 Art District (converted factory art zone) galleries and design stores.

Afternoon: move south-west toward Liangma River International Style Bank (riverside leisure corridor) for coffee and sunset.

Evening: Liangma River Cruise (public sightseeing boat route) if operating, then Sanlitun (nightlife/shopping district). Liangma River cruise ticket purchase and operating guidance are published by VisitBeijing/Chaoyang sources; verify same-day.  

If you love Korean food, you can find the best Korean restaurants in Wangjing area.

Daily transport:

	1.	Recommended: subway/metro between 798 and Liangma/Sanlitun.

	2.	Alternative: Didi for point-to-point convenience.

	3.	Alternative: walking segments along the river once you arrive (best experience).

Day 4 notes:

	1.	Monday is when multiple historic sites reduce access; using Monday for 798 + neighborhoods is structurally optimal.

	2.	Individual galleries inside 798 may close on Mondays even if the district is accessible (unable to verify gallery-by-gallery schedules).

	3.	If you take the Liangma River cruise, buy only through the channel described in the official tourism guidance (typically their WeChat public account).  

Day 5 | Tiananmen + Forbidden City + Jingshan + Beihai + Shichahai

From: Temple of political core → imperial core → north viewpoint → west lake → hutong night.

Morning: Tiananmen Square (major civic square) → Forbidden City / Palace Museum (Palace Museum (museum housed in the former imperial palace)).

Afternoon: Jingshan Park (hilltop viewpoint park) → Beihai Park (imperial lake garden).

Evening: walk or short ride into Shichahai/Houhai for the final hutong night.

Daily transport:

	1.	Recommended: walk the south→north sequence (Tiananmen → Palace Museum → Jingshan is naturally linear).

	2.	Alternative: subway/metro for the Beihai→Shichahai hop if legs are tired.

	3.	Alternative: Didi late-night return.

Day 5 notes :

	1.	Tiananmen Square requires advance reservation via official platforms, but if you already have a valid reservation for certain nearby institutions (including the Palace Museum), you can enter the square without a separate square reservation; the official policy explains both the channels and this exception.  

	2.	Tiananmen Square reservations are only via the official mini program/app/web channels; no phone/email reservations, and major state events can trigger temporary access controls.  

	3.	The Palace Museum is closed on Mondays and requires advance reservation via official channels; do not rely on third-party sellers.  

	

Small gems:

Niche but high-reputation sights:

	1.	Fahai Temple (Ming mural temple) in Shijingshan; known for historic murals; verify visiting method before going.  

	2.	Prince Kung’s Palace Museum (Qing-era princely mansion museum) near Shichahai; closed Mondays and uses reservation-style visiting.  

	3.	Fire God Temple (small temple linked to Beijing’s hutong history) near Shichahai (unable to verify current opening policy).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qm7cv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1qm7cv2/decantified_order_review_very_happy/,Decantified Order Review - Very Happy,"I recently placed an order with Decantified and it ended up being one of the most useful fragrance purchases I have made in years. I am just getting back into fragrances after being out of the hobby for a while, and I wanted a way to explore different scent DNA styles without committing to a bunch of blind buys. This order helped me do exactly that.

First, shipping deserves to be mentioned. My Decantified order arrived in 4 days. That stood out immediately because I had another order from a different vendor located in my own state that took 13 days to arrive. The speed alone already put Decantified ahead.

Packaging was also excellent. Everything arrived neatly packed inside a proper box, not a thin mailer. That may sound minor, but it mattered to me because I now use that box to store all my samples in one place. The decants were secure, cleanly labeled, and nothing leaked or arrived damaged.

They also included a free sample of Al Dirgham, which I appreciated. It turned out to be one of the full bottles I ended up purchasing, so the free sample actually reinforced a buying decision rather than being something random.

What really made this order valuable, though, was how easy it made it to compare scent DNA types side by side. I kept notes as I tested and quickly learned what styles I gravitate toward and which ones I do not. This saved me a lot of money and frustration compared to blind buying full bottles.

  
**Top standouts and purchases**

These are the fragrances that stood out the most and that I either purchased or strongly considered buying after testing.

Khamrah Qahwa  
This was my favorite from the entire order. Compared to the original Khamrah, Qahwa felt more interesting and layered. The coffee note adds depth and keeps the sweetness from becoming too heavy. It smells warm, cozy, and rich without being cloying. This is the one I kept coming back to and the easiest yes for me.

Asad Bourbon  
Very mass appealing to my nose. It has a warm, slightly sweet, spicy profile with a clean freshness underneath. It feels versatile and easy to wear while still having character. This one strikes a nice balance between crowd pleasing and interesting.

Supremacy Collectors Edition  
This smells like a clean, confident, put together person. It comes across polished and professional with a refined freshness and depth. It has that successful business man vibe without being loud or harsh. Easy to see why it is popular.

Al Dirgham  
Fresh, clean, and slightly sweet in a very easygoing way. This was the free sample they included and I am glad they did. It ended up being a full bottle purchase for me. It feels like an effortless daily reach, especially in warmer weather.

Vulcan Feu  
Bright mango with a clean, slightly sweet and lightly spicy feel. This one stood out as unique and modern. My wife especially liked this one. 

  
**Other fragrances tested with quick thoughts**

Game of Spades Win  
Pleasant but felt like it was missing something. It never fully developed into what I wanted it to be as a clone to Greenwich Village.

Game of Spades Boston  
Clean citrus opening with a smooth, easy summer vibe. Very nice, but not something I felt I needed to own.

Asad  
Very heavy and intense. I can see how this could be overpowering or irritating to some people. Not my preference.

Hawas Ice  
Compared to regular Hawas, this felt fresher and less sweet up top with a more icy citrus feel. Pleasant but did not stand out enough for me.

Khamrah  
Good, but after smelling Qahwa it felt less interesting. Qahwa just adds more depth and character for my taste.

Marwa  
Very clean and refreshing with a minty tea like opening. Nice freshness, but did not have the longevity, even after several attempts on skin with moisturizer.

Jean Lowe Vibe  
Fresh, slightly sweet, floral leaning. Longevity was not great for me, which ultimately held it back.

Club de Nuit Untold  
This one was a miss for me. Harsh and unpleasant to my nose.

Hawas Fire  
Interesting at first with a fruity spicy citrus opening, but I liked it a less as it dried down.

Asad Elixir  
A better blend than regular Asad in my opinion. Sweeter, spicier, and more balanced, but still not something I felt I needed at this time. Seems that I smell others wearing a similar scent often.

Hawas  
Fresh citrus with a slight sweetness. Clean and wearable, just not unique enough for me.

Liquid Brun  
Warm, spicy, sweet, and boozy feeling. I would need more time wearing it on skin to fully decide.

9AM Dive  
Bright citrus opening with a clean, familiar dry down. Very safe and standard.

  
**Overall experience**

Decantified made it extremely easy to explore a wide range of fragrances and figure out what actually fits my taste as I rebuild an updated collection. Fast shipping, thoughtful packaging, and a great selection of decants made this a very positive experience. I will absolutely be ordering again.

1qm7c95,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qm7c95/dream_sequence/,Dream Sequence,"	Sheila woke abruptly to her alarm clock’s rhythmic beeping. Her head felt heavy. She knew she had been dreaming, but it faded so quickly that she couldn’t quite remember what it was about. Dragging her legs out from under the covers, she shook away the brain fog and headed into the bathroom.
	The mirror greeted her with a familiar face — though her eyes seemed slightly off, as if they belonged to someone else for a moment before adjusting. She turned on the faucet. The water ran too cold for a little too long before warming. In the distance, the coffee maker clicked on. A soft hum filled the quiet house — refrigerator, pipes, something beneath the floor. She couldn’t tell which.
	She brushed her teeth in silence, staring at her reflection. The taste of mint felt sharp, real, anchoring. The longer she looked into the mirror, the more she sensed that something had shifted overnight — like her body had been set back into place after being moved. A faint sound came from the bedroom—a voice, muffled, half-sleep: “You’re up early again.” The way he said again stuck in her mind.
	A few minutes after she started making breakfast her husband came into the kitchen—shirtless, rubbing his hair with a towel. He kissed her cheek then sat down at the table. As Sheila served him eggs and toast, a faint cry came from an upstairs bedroom. She smiled and said, “I’ll be right back.”
	Her husband said, “Don’t forget to give my princess a kiss from me.”
	Sheila giggled. “Of course.”
	Sheila entered the room, illuminated by the morning sun. She walked to the crib and felt her stomach lurch—it was empty. Her heart dropped. Panic rose in her chest as she scanned the room, breath quickening. Then, from behind her, she heard a soft coo. She turned back to the crib. Her daughter lay inside, smiling up at her.
	She shook her head. Get a grip, she thought, as she reached down to scoop the baby up. After changing and dressing her, Sheila carried her downstairs to see her daddy before he left for work.
	As Sheila entered the kitchen, her husband Jayce was finishing his breakfast. He pulled on his shirt, then leaned down to kiss their daughter on the forehead. When he straightened, he looked Sheila in the eyes and said, “I love you.”
	His eyes flashed crimson.
	Sheila’s pulse quickened. Had she really seen that—his eyes turning red? Or was it just her imagination? Regardless, she smiled and said, “I love you, too. We’ll see you when you get home.”
	She went about her tasks, starting with cleaning up breakfast. Jayce had finished most of his coffee; Sheila had watched him tilt the mug before setting it on the table. Yet when she reached for the cup, it was full. She glanced at the pot on the counter. 
	It was still half full. 
	He couldn’t have refilled it — there would be less in the pot. 
	A cold prickle crept up her spine. Sheila felt like she was going crazy.
	After the surreal events of the morning, things settled into familiar routine. Sheila did chores and kept an eye on her daughter while the baby cooed and played. Toys surrounded her as Sheila picked up items the child had lost interest in. As she bent to gather a stuffed bear, one of the child’s dolls seemed to watch her — its head and eyes following her every move. Sheila froze. Then she slowed her movements, making each one precise and deliberate. The doll’s gaze never wavered. A happy wail broke the tension. The baby snatched the doll into her arms, giggling.
	Lunch was the usual baby food and a bottle, and afterward Sheila put her daughter down for a nap. She was relieved to finally sit down for a while. The steady breathing coming through the baby monitor helped her unwind — soft, rhythmic, comforting.
	Then the breathing shifted. Deeper. Raspy.
	Concern tightening in her chest, Sheila hurried to the nursery. But the baby was fine, sleeping peacefully. When she returned to the living room, the raspy sound was still coming from the monitor. She told herself it must be broken. Then a deep, monotone voice crackled through the speaker — speaking in a language she couldn’t understand. A chill ran through her. She was deeply unsettled, but forced herself to believe the monitor was picking up some stray radio signal.
	She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. The monitor clicked, and the soft, slow breathing resumed. Heart hammering, Sheila carefully lowered herself into the armchair. She rubbed her temples and let out a soft sob. She felt like she was losing her mind. Nothing felt right today. And she couldn’t tell anyone what was happening — she’d sound like a lunatic. While she sat thinking about her circumstances, faint fussing drifted from the monitor. Sheila dried her eyes and headed back into the nursery.
	As Sheila walked down the hallway, she noticed the closet door was ajar. She reached out to close it — but her fingers fell short. That’s odd, she thought. The closet was right next to the nursery. She’d closed it from the nursery doorway hundreds of times. She took a small step forward, closed the door, and then entered the room to get her daughter up from her nap.
	Once cleaned and changed, the baby went back to playing while Sheila resumed her daily routine. She began preparing dinner: preheating the oven, seasoning the chicken and potatoes, arranging them in the baking pan. Finally, she opened the oven. She gasped. There was nothing there. Not an empty oven — an inky, lightless void. Sheila slammed the door shut and grabbed the phone. As she stood there holding it, she froze. Who could she call? What could she even say? Nothing made sense anymore. Carefully — cautiously — she opened the oven door again. The oven rack sat right there, perfectly normal. Now I know I’m going crazy, she thought, sliding the pan into place.
	Sheila gathered herself and went into the bathroom. After relieving herself, she washed her hands, then splashed cool water onto her face. She watched the droplets trickle down her reflection. Then parts of her reflection began to follow the droplets. Her cheeks, her mouth — sliding downward, as if her face were melting. Sheila gasped and grabbed the hand towel, wiping furiously. The towel came away clean, but her reflection didn’t. She wiped her face—off. A blank slate of skin stared back at her. She tried to scream, hands flying to her face, but no sound came out. When she lowered her hands, her own familiar features were staring back at her again.
	She nearly jumped out of her skin when the front door swung open and Jayce called out, “Honey, I’m home.”
	She straightened her clothes and called back, “I’m in the bathroom. I’ll be right there.” As she pulled herself together, she heard him playing with the baby. “Dinner is nearly ready,” she said as she entered the room.
	“Great,” he smiled, pulling her into his arms. “Is everything okay?” he asked, a look of concern crossing his face. “You seem tense.”
	Sheila hesitated. She was afraid to tell him the truth. What if he thought she was having a mental breakdown? Or worse — what if she was having one, and she could lose everything by saying something? But in the end, she decided: if she couldn’t trust her partner in life, who could she trust? “I think I’m going crazy,” she whispered. “I’ve been seeing weird things all day.” She went on to explain what she had seen.
	Jayce listened, then smiled gently. “You’ve just been under a lot of stress. You do all the work around the house, take care of the baby, and get very little rest. She’s not even a year old yet — you’re not fully recovered from having her. Give yourself a break. Tell you what: I’ll serve dinner and clean up tonight.” Sheila broke into tears while holding onto him as if her life depended on it.
	After dinner, Sheila showered and got ready for bed. When she reached to replace the towel she’d used, the closet door wasn’t there. Confused, she looked around — and saw the door on the opposite wall. Frowning, she opened it, grabbed a fresh towel, and hung it on the rack. Then she crawled into bed. She pulled the covers over her head, wanting nothing more than to forget the day altogether.
	The next morning began with the haunting memories of the previous day. The first thing Sheila did was head into the nursery to check on her daughter. The room was eerily quiet. Boxes sat stacked in the corner—boxes she hadn’t noticed before. She inched closer to the crib and found it empty. Panic rose in her chest. She turned toward the door, ready to run, but Jayce was already standing there. Watching her. “She—she’s gone…” Sheila stammered.
	“Who’s gone?” he asked.
	“The baby!”
	His eyes softened. “I know, sweetheart. We’ll try again… when you’re ready.”
	Confused and frustrated, Sheila shook her head. “She was here—yesterday.”
	Jayce offered a small, pitying smile. “That was a dream. We lost the baby before we even found out the sex. You were so set on having a little girl.”
	Sheila ran from the room, heart hammering, breath jagged. She didn’t know where she was going—she just needed to get away. Then she stopped. The closet door was at the end of the hall. That door kept moving. A cold shiver ran up her spine. She walked to the end of the hallway, each step slow and deliberate, and opened the door. A burst of bright white light flooded the hallway. Sheila shielded her eyes, blinking against the radiance. And then, for reasons she couldn’t understand—reasons that felt older than fear—she stepped through.



	Sheila jolted awake. Her makeshift shelter had buckled under the weight of the rain, letting the torrent spill into her small sleeping space. With all the new anti-homeless architecture around the city, there was nowhere left to go that was truly safe from the elements. She did her best to patch the gap with cardboard and plastic, but she knew she wouldn’t get any more sleep tonight.
	Lying in her damp semi-enclosure, Sheila noticed one of the city’s many sewer rats staring at her from the far end of the alley. Something was wrong. The rat was far larger than it should have been. And it wasn’t moving the way a rat moves. It sat back on its haunches in an oddly human posture — almost like a child watching her. The alley was perpetually dark, and dawn was still hours away. Sheila strained her eyes, trying to make sense of the creature’s shape. Then headlights swept across the mouth of the alley, flooding it with light. There was nothing there. Sheila shook it off as a product of exhaustion and pushed herself upright. If she was going to be awake anyway, she might as well be first in line at the soup kitchen. She began gathering her things, trying to ignore the lingering chill crawling up her spine.
	As much as Sheila relied on—and appreciated—the generosity of shelters and soup kitchens, she hated going to them. She felt out of place there. People were loud, unpredictable, sometimes violent. Sheila was quiet. Reserved. If she had anything of value, she had to hide it and pretend it didn’t exist so no one would try to take it from her or hurt her for it. She didn’t like being dishonest, but out here, it was the only way to survive.
	By seven in the morning, a substantial line had already formed at the downtown soup kitchen. Sheila wasn’t first—a few people had camped out near the entrance—but she was close. She kept her head down as fights broke out along the line while everyone waited for the doors to open. When staff finally unlocked the doors, she shuffled inside, accepted her tray with quiet gratitude, and headed to a back table away from the noise and scuffling. Only then did she finally focus on her meal.
	Looking down, she saw that her rice was moving. Her brow furrowed. She prodded it with her fork. Horrified, she realized the rice was actually maggots. The noodles were worms, slick and slithering in the bowl. And before her eyes, her fruit began to rot, collapsing in on itself, decomposing at an impossible speed. She stood abruptly, searching for help—but no one seemed to notice. The staff kept serving, and everyone else remained absorbed in their arguments and infighting. She sat again, shaky, and pushed the tray away. It was perfectly fine. Sheila stared at it, bewildered. Maybe the stress was getting to her more than she realized.
	After breakfast, Sheila found a somewhat busy street corner to set up for panhandling. She wasn’t good at talking to people, so she just tried her best to smile and not freak anyone out. She’d been there for a couple of hours when a pigeon decided it wanted the corner for itself. At first it simply pranced back and forth in front of her. When she didn’t move, it grew more aggressive—pecking at her hands and feet. She kicked at it a couple of times to shoo it away. Then it told her to leave. The pigeon’s caw actually sounded like the word. Leave. Sheila didn’t know whether she’d really heard it or not, but she decided that leaving was the best option.
	Living on the streets had familiarized her with the layout of the city. Being one of the most vulnerable people here, she knew all the alleys and shortcuts the city had to offer. So when she came to a dead end in one of the most commonly used alleyways, she froze. She didn’t remember any construction in this area. And the building blocking her path didn’t look new. It looked ancient—like it had been there for decades. She stepped back, confused. Had she turned down the wrong alley? Sheila hurried out to the street and checked the signs. No—she was exactly where she thought she was. She went back down the alley. And it was clear. Nothing blocking it. Nothing out of place. A cold unease crept up her spine. The things she was seeing were more than just exhaustion or fatigue. She needed to be careful.
	Sheila headed for the city park. Technically speaking, homeless people weren’t allowed in the park, but there was a large sewer pipe in the back, and if she could sneak in unseen, no one would know she was there. Fortunately, she was small and didn’t have a lot of stuff to announce her presence. She entered the park close to where the pipe was, and hurried into it before anyone noticed her. She could hear that others were in there, too—further down the pipe. She decided to stay closer to the entrance so she wouldn’t have to interact with anyone.
	While gnawing on some dried meat she’d purchased with panhandling money a few days before, Sheila realized the noises from further down the pipeline had stopped. She paused. Strained to listen. No sound. It dawned on her that she couldn’t hear anything. No birds. No insects. No kids in the park. Nothing. The world was completely silent. She tried to clear her ears with her fingers, but it made no difference. The silence felt heavy, pressing down on her from all sides—crushing, absolute. Then two men appeared at the far end of the pipe. One of them asked, “Are you alright?” Sound rushed back all at once, like someone flipping a switch. Sheila nodded, not trusting herself to speak. The man shrugged, and they continued on their way, leaving Sheila alone again.
	The echo inside the pipe felt strange and unsettling. Water trickled, and distant voices from the park reverberated off the concrete. Sheila tried to ignore it—just another weird moment in a long day—but then an oddly familiar voice drifted through the tunnel: “I know, sweetheart. We’ll try again… when you’re ready.” Her heart dropped. A faint baby’s cry followed, echoing softly in the dark. Sheila snatched up her things and ran.
	She found an unoccupied alley and set up for the night. Wanting desperately to forget everything that had happened, she curled into a ball and tried to will herself to sleep. The ground began to shake. Without warning, a massive fissure split open beneath her. Fear surged through her as the concrete crumbled away. Sheila clawed at the ground, but there was nothing to hold on to. Panic swallowed her whole as she was swept down into the darkness. Into the void.



	Sheila woke to her father’s voice saying, “Up and at ’em. Time to train.” She sighed, pulled herself up, and got dressed. She loved being a runner — she just didn’t love the work it took to stay on top. Her dad was a great coach, even if he did push her a bit too hard sometimes. Once she was dressed, the two of them hopped in the car and headed to the school so she could use the gym and run the track before showering and going to class.
	Sheila started her workout. As she lifted the weights, curling them with her biceps, they felt unusually heavy. Frowning, she stopped and checked the plates to make sure she had the right weight. She did. She resumed her workout. With each rep, the weight grew more unbearable, until she was using every ounce of strength just to lift them. Then, without warning, the weights became too light — so light that she accidentally smacked herself in the face with them. Her father rushed over. “Are you alright?”
	“I’m fine,” she said, embarrassed. “I guess I got a little overzealous.”
	“Okay…” He gave her a skeptical look. “Just be careful.”
	After weight training, it was time for track running. This was what Sheila lived for. When she ran, no one could catch her. Her dad had the stopwatch ready. As soon as he blew his whistle, she was gone. The track was a mile long, and for that mile Sheila felt completely free. She came around the final bend and saw the finish line. She picked up her pace. But the finish line wasn’t getting any closer. She ran faster. The finish line seemed to pull away from her, stretching farther down the track. The harder she pushed, the worse it got — like she was running in place while the world slid backward. Then she stopped. The finish line was right in front of her. “Why did you stop?” her dad asked.
	“I… don’t think I’m feeling very well today,” she said.
	“Let’s wrap it up. I want to get your head looked at after that incident earlier.” |Sheila wanted to protest, but she knew he was right.
	Later, they sat in the doctor’s office. He shined a light into Sheila’s eyes. At first the beam was merely bright — then it felt like staring down a tunnel. Shapes flickered inside it. A rat? No… a child. No — a baby. No… a doll. A doll that was watching her back. Sheila flinched. The doctor lowered the light. “I don’t see any signs of concussion, but keep an eye on her,” he said to her father. “Let me know if any other symptoms arise.” 
	Sheila swallowed and asked tentatively, “Is… seeing weird shapes in the light a symptom?”
	“Not really,” the doctor replied with a shrug. “Bright light can trick your brain into thinking there’s something there when there isn’t.” Sheila exhaled, relieved that she wasn’t going crazy.
	The following day, Sheila was ready to forget her setbacks and start over. She got dressed and was about to head out when her dad said, “Maybe you should take it easy today.”
	Anger welled up inside her. “Take it easy? Why? Because I had a couple of setbacks? That’s how you lose your edge. No—not me. I’m going to push through and be my best.”
	Her dad shook his head, but said, “Okay. You’re the boss.”
	Weight training went fine, and he seemed to relax. Then they went to the track. Sheila was ready—excited, even. The whistle blew and… she couldn’t move. Her legs felt like jelly. When she forced them to respond, she toppled forward and fell flat on her face. Her dad was at her side in an instant. “That’s it,” he said firmly. “I’m taking you for testing. This isn’t normal.” Sheila didn’t argue. She didn’t say anything at all. She just broke down into tears.
	The following days were a blur. Doctors, nurses, needles—everyone surrounded Sheila, yet no one had answers. No one knew what was happening to her or why she couldn’t run anymore. Her life was falling apart, and the only thing anyone could say was, “I don’t know.”
	Sheila felt a crushing mix of anger, self-pity, and determination. She would find out what was going on. There was no way she was going to spend the rest of her life in a hospital.
	While she lay there pondering her situation, an orderly stepped into the room. “Time for your MRI,” he said with a little wink. She managed a weak smile as he unlocked the wheels of her bed. He began pushing her down the hallway, and the fluorescent ceiling lights slid past overhead. Little by little, the lights grew dimmer. Then they flickered. Sheila looked around—and her stomach dropped. The walls were covered in filth and muck, streaked with grime. The floor was cracked. This… this wasn’t the same hospital she had been in a moment ago. She tried to sit up, panic rising, but the orderly pressed a hand gently to her shoulder and said, “Careful. You’ll fall.”
	Sheila squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath. When she opened them again, the lights were bright. The walls were clean. The hospital was safe.
	When they reached the MRI room, the orderly and the technician worked together to maneuver Sheila onto the testing table. She was given earplugs to protect against the loud noises of the machine and was told she had to keep completely still throughout the procedure. She sighed and inserted the earplugs.
	The technician stepped behind the glass and spoke through the intercom. “Alright, I’m going to move you into the machine.” Sheila nodded. She wasn’t exactly claustrophobic, but tight spaces had never been her favorite. As the table slid into the machine, it felt like the world itself was shrinking—closing in around her.
	She closed her eyes and tried to keep still as the rhythmic thumping began. The thumps grew into clicks, then whirs. Then she realized she couldn’t see the opening of the machine anymore. Panic tightened her chest. “Hey,” she called out, “can you get me out of here?” No response. “I’m serious—I’m really freaking out. Get me out of here!” Still nothing. The sounds stopped. Light bloomed from deep within the machine—white, growing, swallowing everything. It enveloped her, pulling her inward, carrying her into the void.



	Sheila woke up. Her neck hurt and her arm was numb. Damn. She’d fallen asleep at her desk again. She rubbed her eyes and dragged herself toward the coffee pot. “Yuck,” she muttered. The coffee had been sitting there since yesterday, thickened into a sticky sludge. She switched the pot off, dumped it out, and decided she’d just go to the diner for breakfast instead.
	The diner was a short walk from the lab, and Sheila could use a little fresh air. She swapped her lab coat for a sweater and headed out. As she approached her usual corner, she spotted a homeless woman sitting there with a cup out for donations. Sheila didn’t have much, but the thought of someone going hungry always bothered her. She reached into her pocket for some spare change and bent down to drop it into the cup—and her breath caught.The woman looking back at her was her. Sheila stared into her own face.
	Shock jolted through her, and she fumbled the coins, dropping them onto the sidewalk. “I’m so sorry…” she stammered.
	“That’s alright, sweetheart. I’ll get it,” the woman said.
	Sheila blinked—and saw a strange old woman instead. Heart still pounding, she straightened up. She made a mental note to add the experience to her research.
	She walked past the “seat yourself” sign and took a booth toward the back of the diner. Only a few scattered tables were occupied, so the waitress appeared almost immediately. Her gray-streaked hair was pulled back into a loose bun, and her face showed the early signs of aging. Even without makeup, she was pretty. “What can I get for you?” she asked.
	“Coffee and a blueberry muffin,” Sheila replied.
	“Coming right up,” the waitress said with a wink and a smile. Sheila smiled back—and froze. The waitress had too many teeth. Far too many. Then the teeth shifted, changing shape, becoming sharp and jagged. Her mouth widened—far wider than a mouth should. Sheila must have been staring, because the waitress tilted her head and asked, “Is everything okay?” Her face snapped back to its original, pretty features.
	“Yes,” Sheila said quickly. “I’ve been working late nights. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.”
	“Don’t worry about it, sweetie,” the waitress said warmly. “Let’s get you that coffee.”
	As the waitress retreated to fill the order, Sheila pulled out her small notebook and began recording the events of the morning. She wasn’t sure how any of it connected to her research yet, but she knew it was important. Was this some kind of quantum breakdown? Or was it tied to her dream theory? Everything felt complicated — and nearly impossible to prove.
	Sheila finished breakfast and headed back to the lab. The first thing she did was check on her rats. The most significant finding so far was that the longer they remained in an R.E.M. state, the higher their cortisol levels climbed. That was frustrating. These poor things were trapped in perpetual nightmares… and still weren’t telling her anything useful. She hated causing them stress, but she needed answers. She needed to know.
	Sheila sighed and settled in at the electron microscope station. One of the rats had recently passed, and she wanted to examine its brain tissue. She activated the recorder first — she didn’t trust her own perceptions anymore. Resting her forehead on the cushion above the eyepiece, she peered through the scope. Typical brain matter. Nothing unusual. Then the cells began moving. Reshaping. Interacting. Sheila frowned. That’s not possible. She thought. The cells were dead. But they didn’t behave like dead cells. In fact, they didn’t behave like living ones either. Her focus drifted toward a single cell that kept growing. Larger… and larger… until it filled her entire view. And then it gave her a sinister grin. Sheila jerked back from the microscope just as a voice came from the doorway. “Is everything okay?”
	Her heart nearly leapt out of her chest. “Jayce! I didn’t see you there. Yeah, I’m… trying to examine some tissue.”
	“How’s it going?”
	“I’m not sure.” She swallowed. “Could you check the recording and tell me what you think?”
	“Sure.”
	She pulled up the recording on the monitor. Jayce stood beside her, watching quietly. After a few moments he said, “I see what you mean. Despite our preservation methods, the cells are breaking down far more rapidly than they should.”
	Sheila kept her eyes on the screen and nodded. “I had another episode while observing them… and a few others this morning. They’re all documented in my notes.”
	Jayce slipped an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close. “Don’t worry,” he murmured. “We’ll get to the bottom of this.”
	“I’m not so sure,” Sheila said quietly.
	Jayce didn’t seem to know how to respond, so he hugged her, then shifted the topic. “How about some lunch?”
	“That sounds great.”
	They went to a small pho restaurant nearby. They both loved noodles and soup. Since they were regulars, the staff recognized them and seated them in a nice booth, served by one of their favorite waiters. Before long, the morning’s frustration seemed to melt away.
	The couple laughed and joked with the waiter and with each other until their meal arrived. Still immersed in conversation and infatuation, Sheila dipped her spoon into her soup—and paused. Something wasn’t right. She looked down, and her smile faded. The boiled egg didn’t look quite right. Wait a second, she thought. That’s not an egg—that’s an eyeball. Her gaze darted through the broth. Insects. A finger. Worms. Pieces that had no business being anywhere near her food. The spoon clattered from her hand.
	“What is it?” Jayce asked.
	Sheila pinched the bridge of her nose. “Another episode.”
	His face tightened with worry. “Maybe you should go lie down.”
	She gave him a sardonic look. “I think that’s the last thing I should do.”
	After lunch, Jayce went back to work and Sheila returned to the lab. She went over her notes again and again. What was she missing? Hours passed without answers. Finally, she decided to call it a night. She gathered her things and headed to her car.
	She turned the radio on for the drive home. Ironically enough, the DJs were discussing dreams in music. Sheila listened—most of it was light, playful chatter—until one of them added, in a joking tone:
	“Life is but a dream, isn’t that right, Sheila?”
	Her breath caught. Heart hammering, she pulled the car over and cranked the volume, but the hosts had already moved on to a different topic. Sheila took a few steadying breaths, got herself under control, and finished the drive home.
	Sheila was ready to relax and spend time with the love of her life. But when she got home, the door was locked. That’s odd, she thought. I guess Jayce had to stay late at work. She pulled out her keys and let herself in.
	The house felt wrong the moment she stepped inside. Dark. Dreary. She flipped the light switch, but only a single lamp in the far corner flickered on, casting a thin, weak glow that barely illuminated the chair beside it. An uneasy feeling crept up Sheila’s spine.
	She took a slow step forward. The house seemed… bare. As if no one really lived here. She went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. Aside from a few condiments, it was practically empty. Her pulse quickened. This wasn’t the house she’d left this morning.
	She made her way to the bedroom. The bed was unmade—extremely unusual—and clothes were scattered across the floor. Sheila hadn’t left a mess like this since she was a teenager. She knelt down to pick them up and froze. They were all hers. Every piece. She hurried to the closet—and her stomach dropped. Nothing of Jayce’s hung there. Not a shirt. Not a shoe. Not a trace. Panic welled up inside her. She tore through the entire house—every room, every corner, every drawer. There was no sign of Jayce. Anywhere.
	Sheila cried herself to sleep. But the following morning brought renewed purpose. She had to find answers — not just for herself, but for Jayce. She couldn’t live with the thought of him simply being erased from existence.
	She stepped into her lab and began studying her notes again. None of it made any sense. None of it fit. She went to check on the rats. She watched them closely, mesmerized by their subtle movements. Then one of them twitched — almost like it was waking up. She checked the monitors. No. Its readings matched the others perfectly. She kept watching. The rat grew. Slowly at first, so slowly she thought her eyes were playing tricks on her. Then the growth sped up. The creature swelled, stretching against the enclosure—until the glass shattered. It kept growing. Sheila stumbled backward, heart pounding. The rat turned toward her, its red eyes gleaming with menace. Before she could turn. Before she could scream. Before she could run—The rat opened its enormous mouth and swallowed her whole. She plunged into the void.



	Sheila woke up excited. It was her first day of preschool. Her mother was waiting for her in the kitchen. They finished breakfast and got ready to go. As they were walking out the door her mother said, “Remember, Sweetheart, you can do and be anything you want, ok?”
	“I know, Momma,” she smiled brightly. “Life is but a dream.”

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qm76vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qm76vf/willpower_is_a_terrible_way_to_build_habits_heres/,Willpower Is a Terrible Way to Build Habits. Here’s What Actually Works,"Everyone talks about habit building like it's just about discipline. Get up at 5am. Cold showers. Meditate daily. But here's what nobody tells you: willpower is a terrible strategy. It's limited, it drains fast, and relying on it basically guarantees you'll fail within a week.

I spent months researching this stuff (books, neuroscience papers, podcasts with actual researchers) because I was tired of the cycle. Start strong on Monday, crash by Thursday, guilt spiral all weekend. Turns out, the issue isn't you lacking discipline. It's that you're fighting against how your brain actually works.

So here's what actually helps, based on science that holds up.

**Make it stupidly easy to start.** The biggest barrier to any habit isn't motivation or time, it's friction. Your brain defaults to whatever requires less energy. Stanford researcher BJ Fogg calls this the  tiny habits  method, and it's backed by behavioral psychology. Want to exercise? Don't commit to an hour at the gym. Commit to putting on your workout clothes. That's it. Once you're dressed, you'll probably do something. But even if you don't, you've built the neural pathway. Your brain starts associating the cue (time of day, location) with the action. Over time, this becomes automatic. The key is making the initial action so small that your brain can't come up with excuses. Can't meditate for 20 minutes? Try two breaths. Seriously. The behavior matters more than the duration early on.

**Stack habits onto existing routines.** This is called habit stacking, and it's ridiculously effective because you're hijacking neural pathways that already exist. After I pour my morning coffee, I take my vitamins. After I brush my teeth at night, I floss (yeah, I'm 24 and finally flossing consistently). The existing habit acts as a trigger for the new one. Your brain loves patterns and predictions. When you attach a new behavior to something you already do automatically, you're essentially piggybacking on established neural infrastructure. Atomic Habits by James Clear breaks this down perfectly. Clear's a habits researcher who synthesized decades of behavioral science into actually usable frameworks. The book sold millions of copies for a reason, it's not fluffy self help BS, it's practical neuroscience. One insight that stuck with me: every habit follows a cue, craving, response, reward loop. When you understand this, you can engineer habits instead of just hoping they stick.

**Track your progress visually.** There's solid research showing that seeing your streak builds momentum. It's why apps like Finch work so well for habit building. You get a little virtual pet that grows as you complete daily check ins and self care tasks. Sounds silly, but the gamification taps into your brain's reward system. 

If you want something more structured and adaptive, there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that generates personalized audio content and learning plans based on your specific goals. Say you want to build better habits as someone who struggles with consistency, it pulls from behavioral psychology research, books like Atomic Habits and The Power of Habit, and expert insights to create a tailored plan just for you. You can adjust the depth too, start with a quick 10-minute overview during your commute, then switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples when you have more time. The voice options are genuinely addictive, think smoky narrator or sarcastic coach depending on your mood. It's been useful for making habit-building feel less like discipline work and more like something that actually fits into daily life.

Dopamine doesn't just spike when you achieve something big, it responds to small wins too. Checking off a box, watching a streak grow, these create positive feedback loops. The visual reminder also serves as accountability. Breaking a 30 day streak feels way worse than skipping day 3. That psychological weight works in your favor. Don't overcomplicate the tracking either. A simple calendar with X's works. Jerry Seinfeld famously used this method for writing jokes daily.  Don't break the chain  became his only rule.

**Design your environment, not just your willpower.** If you want to eat healthier, don't keep junk food in your house. Seems obvious, but most people ignore how much environment shapes behavior. Research from Cornell's Food and Brand Lab shows that visibility and convenience are the strongest predictors of consumption. The study found that people who had fruit visible on their counter weighed less than those who didn't, independent of other factors. Your environment is constantly nudging you toward certain behaviors. If your phone is next to your bed, you'll scroll before sleep. If your running shoes are by the door, you're more likely to go for a run. James Clear talks about this as  environment design  in Atomic Habits. Make good habits obvious and easy. Make bad habits invisible and difficult. One trick I use: I keep my guitar on a stand in my living room instead of in its case. I play it way more often now just because it's there, staring at me.

**Focus on identity, not outcomes.** This one's a bit more abstract but it's actually the most powerful shift. Instead of saying  I want to lose 20 pounds,  say  I'm becoming someone who takes care of their body.  Instead of  I want to write a book,  say  I'm a writer.  The difference is subtle but it changes everything. When your habits are tied to your identity, they become self reinforcing. Writers write. Healthy people make healthy choices. You're not forcing yourself to do something foreign, you're acting in alignment with who you believe you are. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg explores this beautifully. Duhigg's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years investigating habit science. The book shares case studies from companies, athletes, and neuroscience labs showing how habits shape everything from business success to personal transformation. One chapter covers how Alcoholics Anonymous works because it helps people adopt a new identity (someone in recovery) rather than just trying to stop drinking through willpower alone.

The annoying truth is that building lasting habits takes time. Your brain needs roughly 60 to 90 days to form new neural pathways strong enough that behaviors become automatic. But once they do, you're not relying on motivation or discipline anymore. You're just acting in alignment with the systems you've built. And that's when change actually sticks.",1,1769309564.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

coffee steaming beside unpaid fears.
Sunlight counts the years they gave away
to clocks, to bosses, to borrowed breath.

Retirement sits heavy at the table,
a word too big for rising prices,
too fragile for hands worn thin by decades
of being useful, obedient, replaceable.

We cannot rewind their long service,
cannot unchain the past from their bones.
So we fold hope like fresh laundry,
whispering: we will be fine
not because it’s easy,
but because love still clocks in.

Im from the east coast of the USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1769309408.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I don't know if you guys remember but I made a post here about an uncomfortable situation I had with a NT, I'm not sure if I have posted it here but in summary a friend of mine introduced me to a guy who wanted to date me, I rejected him and he said some obscene things about my body.

My friend apologized after that and recently the guy she tried to hook me with also did, yesterday he talked with me in a coffee shop and we made up :), the problem is that he asked if we could be friends and I said yes.

I know that asking about social cues in an autism sub might not be ideal lol, but when someone asks you to be ""friends"" after a confrontation, that means that they want to be LITERALLY friends or just reconciliate? Because I'm not trying to be rude but I'd rather not be friends with him.

I always tried to not bond with NT's because based on what I know it never ends well, I read a lot of stories in these subs and every time an autistic person tries to be friends with a NT they ghost them, or end the friendship abruptly.

Based on my experience, I was almost SA'ed by a NT classmate and that caused me a lot of trust issues for a while.

I can't stop thinking about it, I'd rather just make peace with him and nothing else, my friend said that he tends to have outbursts similar to when he called me ""flat"" or ""not that cute"", so I would rather not associate myself with him.",2,1769309361.0,AutisticPeeps,0,1.0,False
