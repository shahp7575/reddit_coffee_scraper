1jmkuxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsconsumer/comments/1jmkuxe/asus_chromebook_cm14_review_after_one_year_of_use/,ASUS Chromebook CM14 Review: After One Year of Use,"Finding an affordable laptop that balances performance, durability, and everyday usability is no easy task. When I got my hands on the ASUS Chromebook CM14, I was curious to see if it could handle my daily workflow without feeling sluggish. After spending some time with it, here’s my take on whether it’s worth your money.

**My Experience**

Right out of the box, the ASUS Chromebook CM14 feels lightweight yet sturdy. The Gravity Grey finish gives it a clean, modern look, and the 14-inch NanoEdge display provides a decent screen size for multitasking. It’s built for ChromeOS, which means it’s optimized for web-based tasks, and with its MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, I expected smooth performance for browsing, streaming, and basic productivity.

# Here’s what stood out during my time using it:

**What I Liked**

* **Surprisingly Smooth Performance –** With an 8-core MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, this Chromebook handled everyday tasks well. I could browse with multiple tabs open, stream YouTube, and work on Google Docs without noticeable lag. However, it’s not built for heavy multitasking or demanding apps.
* **Solid Build with Military-Grade Durability –** ASUS really put effort into making this Chromebook durable. It meets US MIL-STD 810H standards, meaning it can withstand some serious wear and tear. Plus, the spill-resistant keyboard adds an extra layer of protection—perfect for those accidental coffee spills.
* **Great Connectivity & Expandability –** With Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, the wireless performance is strong and reliable. I also appreciated the USB-C ports with power delivery and display support, making it easy to connect to peripherals. The microSD slot is a bonus for expanding storage beyond the built-in 64GB eMMC.
* **Privacy and Hygiene Features –** The physical webcam shield is a nice touch for privacy-conscious users, and ASUS even added Antimicrobial Guard technology to inhibit bacteria growth on the keyboard. It’s not something you think about often, but it's a cool feature in today’s world.

**Where It Falls Short**

Display is Just Okay – The 1366x768 HD resolution gets the job done, but it’s far from sharp. If you’re used to a 1080p display, you’ll notice the difference, especially when streaming content. The anti-glare finish is helpful in bright environments, though.

Limited Power for Demanding Tasks – The 4GB RAM is fine for light use, but if you tend to have 20+ Chrome tabs open or use Linux apps, you’ll hit performance limits quickly. This is strictly an entry-level machine.

**Final Thoughts**

The ASUS Chromebook CM14 is a solid budget option for students, casual users, or anyone who needs a reliable, no-frills laptop for web-based tasks. It’s durable, well-connected, and privacy-focused, making it a great choice for on-the-go users. However, the lower-resolution display and modest RAM mean it’s not ideal for power users or those who need serious multitasking ability. If you need an affordable Chromebook that covers the basics with a few thoughtful extras, this one is worth considering.",1,1743250099.0,techsconsumer,0,1.0,False

A green velvet sofa is a stunning and luxurious addition to any living space, offering both elegance and comfort. With its rich texture and deep, inviting color, this piece of furniture effortlessly transforms a room, creating a sophisticated and stylish atmosphere. Whether incorporated into a modern, vintage, or eclectic interior, a green velvet sofa acts as a bold focal point while remaining versatile enough to complement various décor styles. Its plush fabric and striking shade make it a must-have for homeowners looking to elevate their space with a touch of luxury and personality.

# Why Choose a Green Velvet Sofa?

One of the biggest advantages of a green velvet sofa is its ability to add warmth and character to a room. The deep green color, often associated with nature and tranquility, brings a sense of calm and balance to interiors. It pairs beautifully with a variety of tones, including gold, navy blue, blush pink, and neutral shades like beige and gray, making it an adaptable piece for different design aesthetics.

Velvet upholstery, known for its soft and plush texture, enhances the overall comfort of the sofa, making it an inviting place to relax. Additionally, the fabric's slight sheen adds a touch of opulence, making the sofa appear more expensive and refined. Whether placed in a cozy living room, a chic lounge, or a stylish office space, a [**green velvet sofa**](https://furnt.co.uk/collections/velvet-sofas) creates an atmosphere of sophistication and comfort.

# Styling and Décor Ideas

A green velvet sofa offers endless styling possibilities, allowing homeowners to experiment with various textures, patterns, and color schemes. Here are some ideas to enhance its beauty:

* **Classic Elegance:** Pair the sofa with gold accents, such as brass coffee tables, statement lighting, and decorative mirrors, to create a timeless and luxurious look.
* **Modern Minimalism:** Keep the space sleek by complementing the sofa with neutral-colored walls, monochrome art, and simple geometric furniture.
* **Bohemian Charm:** Add textured pillows, woven rugs, and natural wood furniture for a cozy and inviting feel.
* **Vintage Glamour:** Incorporate antique furniture, bold wallpaper, and velvet drapes for a retro-inspired aesthetic.

Accessories such as throw pillows in contrasting colors, patterned rugs, and stylish side tables further enhance the overall look of the space. Green velvet also pairs well with natural elements like wooden floors, indoor plants, and marble surfaces, creating a balanced and visually appealing environment.

# Comfort and Durability

Apart from its stunning appearance, a green velvet sofa is also designed for superior comfort and durability. Velvet fabric is soft to the touch, providing a cozy and luxurious seating experience. High-quality velvet upholstery is often resistant to wear and tear, ensuring longevity even with regular use. Additionally, many modern velvet sofas come with stain-resistant treatments, making them easier to clean and maintain.

The durability of a green velvet sofa depends on the quality of the fabric and construction. Sofas with solid hardwood frames, high-density foam cushions, and reinforced stitching offer long-lasting support and resilience. Regular maintenance, such as gentle vacuuming and spot cleaning, helps preserve the fabric’s luster and keep the sofa looking as good as new for years to come.

# Conclusion

A green velvet sofa is more than just a piece of furniture; it is a statement of elegance, comfort, and sophistication. Its rich color, plush texture, and versatility make it a timeless investment for any home. Whether styled with contemporary accents or vintage-inspired décor, this luxurious sofa has the power to transform a living space into a chic and inviting retreat. With its combination of aesthetic appeal and practicality, a green velvet sofa remains a top choice for those looking to bring both comfort and opulence into their interiors.",1,1743250021.0,u_Choice-Unit1277,0,1.0,False

My family doesn’t get it. My mom says she does and to just let her know when I need time or whatever, but then she just gets mad at me when I do tell her. 

My brother has kids, and my other brother couldn’t come but we brought my niece, so my mom is ALL about her. I don’t have kids, I’m single, so I feel like i have no one here. I’m constantly being forgotten, ignored… literally. We went to dinner and a food court kinda diner, and everyone got their food, met up, and went to sit. I watched them from my line up, and they didn’t even try to look for me. I said to mom when I went to table, “weren’t going to wait for me?” And she got mad because she has too much to manage. 

I hate it here. I hate amusement parks and rides, but I came because I was told i would be taken care of. I’m not being taken care of and I cried to myself in the bathroom and to sleep last night and no one even noticed or cared. 

I’m currently sitting in the lobby after going to get coffee and got a text if I know where my dad is because he was going to meet my brother but must have got lost. No one is wondering where I am. 

I hate everything. My mom has always been emotionally neglectful and borderline abusive. Or maybe not borderline.. 

Any KIND advice for how to get through this?

1jmkrr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jmkrr0/nyc_tap_water/,NYC Tap Water,"Hi All,

Just wanted to share a recent experience — if you don't live in NYC, feel free to ignore. 

You may be aware that due to the ongoing Delaware tunnel repair project, more of the Croton reservoir is being mixed in with the water supply. When this was first announced, I paid close attention to my water TDS to see if there was any change, but there wasn't. (The Croton reservoir is much harder than the Catskills reservoir). Recently, my coffee started tasting very dull. I'm embarrassed how long it took me to put two and two together, but I finally retested my water and saw that the TDS went up from around 20 to 120. (I know TDS is an imperfect measure of water, but I do believe it's useful for observing broad changes to the water when combined with tasting). 

Long story short: I mixed my filtered tap water 50/50 with distilled water and now everything is bright and fruity again. So, if you live in NYC and your coffee has been a little dull lately, try mixing your filtered tap water with distilled! 

(The mix of croton and Catskills water changes neighborhood by neighborhood, so if you haven't noticed a difference with your own water, don't assume something has to be wrong).

When she first moved in (6 months ago) I wouldn't even notice her presence, except for the fact that she would leave coffee stains on the kitchen sink and I would find from 1 week to another about 20 bottles of wine and other alcoholic beverages in a pile but she would throw it out and that's it. Despite only a thin wall separating her room from mine, I wouldn't hear her. Wouldn't smell her.
Then, 3 months in, I went on vacation, came back and later that same week she moved her bf with us. Obviously illegally since the only ones allowed were the 2 of us and our 3rd flatmate who was an exchange student. Not only did the bf look creepy but he was a very stereotypical crackhead.

When he first arrived on a Thursday I thought he was just staying the night only so despite the noise they made screaming at each other from 2am to 4am I didn't say anything. Then Friday, Saturday came, and quickly Monday came in and she went to work and he stayed.
Not only did it become a nuisance but also they would also smoke weed on a regular basis (I have asthma and there's no ventilation system in here), he would be sometimes chill, she would get paranoid and start yelling at him, he would yell back, I would be trying to study for my finals or asleep since this whole cycle would happen in the middle of the night. Or she would start screamkng insulting me from her room. Then the following day I would microwave something and she would start yelling since apparently that was too loud for her despite being 5pm. And she obviously made me pay for it later that day.
Also the guy would refuse to have sex w her while I was in the apartment right next to them since you can literally hear everything, and again she would yell at him. Again while I was asleep.
My other flatmate was always visiting back home, but when he was around, despite him living in the opposite side of the apartment, the 2 of them tried to ""behave"" - not really but they would try to keep quiet AT FIRST. And even he ended up leaving early bc of them.
Once it reached a month and this had taken a toll on my health and my feelings I contacted the agency that managed our apartment. They asked me to explain the situation and when I did I explicitly asked them to not interfere communicating with her since she was very reactive and passive aggressive in that sense and would probably make things worse. The reason why I wrote to them was to see if there was a chance for me to move somewhere else since they had other apartments even in the same building within the same price range if not cheaper that had rooms available. (My contract states that if I move early I'd have to pay a month and a half of rent and then on top of that the deposit for the new room so I was trying to see if this would justify it). In the website these rooms had been available for MONTHS.
They didn't reply to me until 2 weeks later with the message: ""We wanted to let you know we have issued a formal letter to your flatmate with improper behaviour"".
OBVIOUSLY this made thing worse. 
I have tried to contact them ever since but they either don't answer or try to gaslight me into thinking this never happened. But then the rent of the 3rd room in the apartment got discounted by 300€.
The bf moved out but she started making noise not only at night but also early in the morning. Leaving her trash there and not cleaning after herself except for when her bf comes to visit in the middle of the night on random weekdays. And now instead of screaming at the bf irl on a daily basis she'd scream at her phone.
The worst is that this week she has moved the guy back in so the behaviour is worse since she feels more entitled when the guy is around.

Idk what to do, please give me non-diplomatic ways to deal with this.

Myself and my fiance have just moved to Sheffield (or I suppose, are in the process of shuffling our things over). I know a total of one person in this city, he knows nobody, so have very few local sources for advice :) 

I'm into crochet/ knitting/ sewing/  started dabbling in spinning and weaving and I would love to join a local weekly meetup group, and get any shop recommendations for the above as well. 

I have also taken an introduction to green woodworking course this winter, and I would LOVE to continue learning. Do you know of any people or groups that offer green woodwork courses, or any co-op groups that have shared workspaces? This sort of stuff tends to be a lot harder to find than yarn shops hah. 

Would also love recommendations for life drawing groups if there are any around, as I recently started getting back into it.

My fiance is very into DnD and Warhammer. We know of The Treehouse and The Outpost as places to check out for him (albeit not been yet), but any further suggestions for meet up groups or clubs would be very welcome. He would probably be very keen to DM a new campaign.

Lastly, we want to make friends! We are both almost 30 and we work in kids tv/ 3d animation. We have a dog and two cats. We love camping and hiking (we like to go on a big multiday wildcamp once a year or so, plus more regular campsite stays), we like gardening and growing veggies for fun. I used to be part of a community garden and that was great fun too. We used to boulder a bit years ago, and might want to pick it up again. We're both pretty chill people who spend a lot of time quietly tinkering with our hobbies, but we are very social and friendly, and are looking to put down roots.


Would appreciate any suggestions! If you think we sounds like someone you might get along with, let me know and we could meet up for a coffee or a pint!

A navy blue corner sofa is an elegant and contemporary furniture piece that adds both style and functionality to any living space. With its deep and rich color, a navy blue sofa creates a striking focal point while maintaining a timeless and versatile appeal. Perfect for modern, classic, or eclectic interiors, this corner sofa provides ample seating, making it an ideal choice for families, entertainers, and homeowners looking to elevate their décor. Whether placed in a cozy apartment or a spacious living room, a navy blue corner sofa brings a sense of sophistication, warmth, and comfort to your home.

# Why Choose a Navy Blue Corner Sofa?

One of the key reasons for choosing a [**navy blue corner sofa**](https://furnt.co.uk/collections/navy-corner-sofas) is its bold yet versatile nature. Unlike neutral shades like grey or beige, navy blue adds a pop of color while remaining classic and refined. This deep hue is easy to match with various interior styles and pairs beautifully with a range of colors, including white, gold, mustard yellow, emerald green, and blush pink. Whether you prefer a minimalist setting or a vibrant, eclectic look, a navy blue sofa serves as an excellent base for creative decorating.

Apart from aesthetics, a navy blue corner sofa is also highly practical. Dark-colored upholstery tends to conceal stains, spills, and signs of wear better than lighter shades, making it an excellent option for busy households, pet owners, or those who prefer low-maintenance furniture. Its L-shaped or U-shaped design optimizes seating space, providing a comfortable and stylish solution for social gatherings, relaxation, and everyday living.

# Customization and Styling Options

A navy blue corner sofa is available in various styles, fabrics, and configurations, allowing homeowners to select the perfect option for their space and lifestyle. Some of the most popular choices include:

* **Velvet Upholstery:** A luxurious and plush option that adds texture and sophistication to your living space.
* **Linen or Cotton Blend:** A breathable and comfortable fabric that offers a relaxed, casual look.
* **Leather or Faux Leather:** A sleek and durable choice that provides a modern and polished aesthetic.

To enhance the beauty of a navy blue corner sofa, consider styling it with decorative cushions, throws, and rugs in contrasting or complementary colors. White and gold accents can create a sophisticated and glamorous effect, while earthy tones like beige, taupe, and wooden furniture can add warmth and coziness to the space. Additionally, incorporating metallic elements such as brass or chrome in lighting fixtures, coffee tables, or side tables can further elevate the look of the room.

# Comfort and Durability

Comfort is a major factor when investing in a navy blue corner sofa. With its spacious seating arrangement, it allows for lounging, entertaining guests, and relaxing with family. Many modern sofas come with high-density foam cushions, pocket springs, or memory foam padding, ensuring maximum support and long-term comfort. Some models even feature reclining seats, adjustable headrests, or built-in storage options for added convenience.

Durability is another essential aspect of a quality navy blue corner sofa. High-quality upholstery materials ensure that the fabric remains vibrant and resistant to fading over time. Stain-resistant coatings and easy-to-clean fabrics make maintenance simple, requiring only regular vacuuming and occasional spot cleaning to keep the sofa looking fresh and stylish. Whether used for daily lounging or as a statement piece for special occasions, a well-constructed navy blue corner sofa can last for years while maintaining its elegance and charm.

# Conclusion

A navy blue corner sofa is a perfect blend of sophistication, comfort, and functionality, making it a valuable addition to any home. Its rich color provides a timeless yet bold aesthetic, allowing homeowners to experiment with different décor styles while maintaining an elegant and inviting atmosphere. With its spacious design, durable construction, and stylish appeal, a navy blue sofa remains a top choice for those looking to create a cozy and fashionable living space. Whether you prefer a modern, classic, or eclectic interior, this stunning piece of furniture is sure to elevate the overall ambiance of your home.",1,1743249228.0,freeposts,0,1.0,False

1jmkh99,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1jmkh99/narc_mil/,Narc MIL,"It took me a long time to realise that my MIL is a covert narcissist. I’m struggling at the moment as I feel that she is trying to create a wedge between my husband and I indirectly. It isn’t the first time she has done this. The first time was when I first married my husband. She injected herself into every aspect of our lives including our finances and would only speak to my husband on the phone and never made the effort to call or message me despite my numerous attempts. 
It was an extremely rough period in our relationship & we almost became divorced. Being young, I know I could have handled the situation better. Flash forward and we had many discussions over the situation and I thought we had moved on. 
In the last year, we moved closer to where she lives (not for that reason but it was a contributing factor). Initially, it was fantastic. She was very supportive and treated me with respect. 
I always made an effort to make her feel welcome in our new home & would often try and see her for coffee or go to the markets so she could get to know me for me.
I am an extremely fair and kind person. I am pretty laid back when it comes to conflict and will apologise when I know I’ve stuffed up. However, over time I have educated myself on narcissistic abuse and have become quite familiar with being gaslighted. 
A few months ago, my MIL out of the blue and due to no reasons on my behalf started ignoring my messages and became really distant, falling into the pattern of only calling my husband and only seeing us if he was present. I couldn’t for the life of me think what I had done wrong so I asked if everything was okay and she said ‘Yes. Everything’s fine’. Yet, it would remain the same. 
I kept continuing on to message her with updates about our life and asking how she is but she would only respond if it was a picture of our son (her grandson). 
She never asks how I am, just says hello and walks past me to either spend time with our son or my husband. 
Sometimes I catch FaceTime conversations between her and my husband and I can hear her passively aggressively making remarks about my parenting or taking stabs indirectly. 
My husband can be manipulated by her sometimes and I can see the mistreatment that she does but he can’t and although he has come a long way with identifying her tactics, he is still quite anxious around her and wants to please her/seek her love. 
I can’t help but feel like she is in the process of trying to cause me to think certain things through her actions and then turn it all around on me and say that I am the one causing the issue. 
I have spoken to my husband about this and he believes that we should discuss this with her. 
In the past I would start to re-evaluate my actions but I know I’m not just trying overthinking it. 
Is she in the process of gaslighting me? So that she can use my reaction as fuel? 
If anyone has any knowledge about the patterns of covert narcissism and could recommend ways to navigate this it would be awesome. I don’t want to get in the way of my husband and MIL relationship but I have also worked bloody hard at building my own self respect up. 
Do I discuss things with her in the presence of my husband? Or do I let things unfold and allow him to come to realisations? 
Thanks, kindly. 
From someone just trying to live a respectful, equal and drama free life.

Just a coffee, that's all I want. Just like everyone else. But the barista's smile tightens when I approach. Her fingers hover a fraction longer than necessary before taking my money. ""Name?"" she asks, though the shop is nearly empty and I'm the only one waiting.

""James,"" I say, the same as yesterday and the day before.

She writes ""Jams"" on the cup. It's always something slightly off.

My coat, I think. It must be my coat. Mom and Dad always said people would stare at it, would judge it. ""Never take it off in public,"" they warned when I was young. ""People won't understand.""

In school, they called me ""coat boy."" The teachers pretended not to hear. In the hallways, someone would occasionally tug at it from behind, a quick yank before running away laughing. I learned to walk close to walls.

""You should just take that thing off,"" my roommate said once in college. ""It's weird, man. No wonder people look at you funny.""

I almost did it once. Fingers on the edges, ready to pull. But Mom's voice in my head: ""It's for your protection. Promise us.""

The coat isn't even unusual, I tell myself. Brown, textured, fits my form perfectly. Why does everyone stare? Why do security guards follow me in stores? Why do taxi drivers keep driving when I wave?

Last week, a police officer stopped me. ""Routine check,"" he said, eyes fixed on my coat. ""We've had reports of someone suspicious in the area."" His hand rested on his holster the entire time.

""Your coffee,"" the barista calls out, placing it at the far end of the counter, avoiding my eyes.

I take it and find my usual corner table. A woman pulls her purse closer when I pass. A man checks his watch and suddenly needs to leave.

If only I could take it off. Just for a day. Just to see if it's really the coat or if it's—

No. It can't be that. It's definitely the coat.

I was peeling it away, relieved at finally being free. But as the coat came off, pain shot through me, sharp and burning. I looked down and saw blood, raw flesh.

There is no coat.

There never was.

I sip my coffee, keeping my eyes down, trying to make myself smaller in the corner. Tomorrow I'll try a different shop. Maybe there, things will be different.

But I know they won't be.",1,1743248211.0,shortscarystories,0,0.6,False

I've been there, folks. *Cue dramatic music.* For months, I lived by color-coded calendars, promising myself that each block of time was a little productivity treasure chest waiting to be opened. Spoiler alert: I ended up feeling more like a broke pirate than a successful adventurer.

**My big ""aha!"" moment?** Turns out, it wasn’t how I was organizing my time, but what I was trying to cram into it. I mean, really, how many of us spend half of that beautifully scheduled “deep work” block checking Instagram or doodling on the nearest scrap of paper? 🖊️

Enter: **Habit Stacking**. 🧗‍♀️ Instead of turning my life into a Tetris game of blocks, I started stacking smaller habits in a way that flowed naturally. And let me tell you, it was a game changer!

Here's how I turned **time-blocking struggles** into standout productivity wins:

- **Morning routines aren't just for influencers.** 🥑☕ Instead of telling myself that 6-7 AM was “Exercise & Meditation Time” (*ugh, too much pressure*), I decided to stack making coffee with a few squats. Got my caffeine fix while getting the blood flowing—win-win!

- **Lunch Break Bursts:** I started stacking a quick walk with enjoying my lunch. A little movement plus munching meant I came back to the grind refreshed, not slumping into the dreaded post-lunch coma.

- **Evening Wind Downs:** Instead of stretching from 7-8 PM while staring into space, I added it to my TV time. Picture me channeling my inner yogi while catching up on ""The Office."" Comedy plus flexibility training? Why not!

And here's the kicker: unlike fiddling with a system that failed me over and over, this felt like building on something that effortlessly *fit* my life.

**TL;DR — The solution isn’t a Pinterest-perfect schedule! It’s finding a way to blend the important stuff with the stuff you’re *already* doing.** You might not save 10 hours a week—heck, it might be 2 or 3—but it adds up.

What about you guys? **What’s that one small tweak that surprisingly supercharged your productivity?** Maybe there's a hidden stack lying in wait for your newfound attention. 😉",1,1743248122.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

3) Don't even get me started on the Vietnamese coffee ! I don't know how many of that I have had in the past week.
4) The party scene was quite good.
5) The weather was pleasant and amazing.

I couldn't try out the local cuisine as much as I wanted to because of some dietary preferences. I also couldn't visit a few places because of the trip during being short.

I had heard of some scams before visiting but my experience was completely positive.

I feel like these past two weeks have been the most challenging but also the most rewarding time of my life. 

The beginning was extremely hard. I was still learning how to be a mom, and trying to deal with all of babies needs. Mix that with the lack of sleep and I felt lost. 

Recently, I have started realizing that motherhood isn’t linear, we have good days, and we have days where she is extremely fussy and will FIGHT sleep until she is so overtired she just passes out on me. 

I’ve been soaking up newborn cuddles whenever I’m awake, because they’re only this little once, so I might as well get all the cuddles I can. Mind you, at night she sleeps in her bassinet as co-sleeping terrifies me. 

I will say, the lack of sleep gets easier. I guess my body is just getting used to waking up every three hours overnight to feed her (she wakes up herself to feed as she is over her birthweight now).

And I look forward everyday to just going to the coffee shop with her, or going for a little drive. Getting out of the house did wonders for making me feel more myself. 

We are currently snuggling on the couch as she has her first nap of the day. Yes, she can be fussy in the evenings, and I know it won’t always be this easy, but I’m soaking everything up while I can. 

And I’m just here to say, that if you feel like you’re struggling, one day, you will just look at your LO, and all the struggling will be worth it. Because we are their world right now, and I think that’s beautiful ❤️",2,1743247739.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

I can’t even call him an ex, can’t say, he broke my heart—because how do you mourn something that was never really yours?

But he felt like mine. At least for a while.

We met in college, in a too-small coffee shop where the tables wobbled and the barista always spelled my name wrong. He sat across from me during a group study session, tapping his pen against his notebook, laughing at my bad jokes like they were the funniest thing he’d ever heard.

I liked him immediately.

He made it easy. Texts that stretched until 2 a.m., inside jokes that felt like our own little world, moments where his hand would brush against mine and I’d hold my breath, waiting for him to realize it felt like something more.

I thought he did. I was so sure.

Then one night, at a party, I saw him with her.

She wasn’t someone new. I’d known her name. Heard him say it before. But I hadn’t realized what it meant. Not until I watched him pull her close, whisper something in her ear, the same way he used to lean in toward me. Not until she kissed him, and he kissed her back.

I walked home alone that night. Didn’t cry. Didn’t text him. Just curled up in my bed and stared at the ceiling, trying to understand how I had misread everything so badly.

The next day, he called me. Acted like nothing had changed.

And maybe, to him, nothing had. Maybe I was just the friend he texted late at night, the person who made him laugh, the girl he liked but not like that.

I never asked. Never told him what he meant to me. It didn’t matter. Because if he wanted me the way I wanted him, I would have never had to wonder.

So I let him go. Deleted the texts. Ignored the calls.

But sometimes, late at night, I still wonder if he ever knew. If he ever felt even a fraction of what I did. If maybe, just maybe, I was almost the love of his life too.",1,1743247597.0,u_Sam_wilson0009,0,1.0,False

first thing i'm going to do is check the weather to see if i want to jam at the bridge (which i wrote on whiteboard yesterday when my dad told me it was going to be in the 70s today). wow it's already 68 degrees with a light breeze. perfect. check tomorrow... tomorrow's going to be warm but rainy. so jamming at the bridge is a serious contender for today. let's see if we can work that out:

let's start by immediate relegating housework (towels, backup drives, vacuuming) to tomorrow, which will be a perfect day to get things done inside since it will be raining.

*side note: towels, backup drives and vacuuming are all periodic tasks that i copied from my paper monthly planner which i check every morning after getting the coffee pot going.*

wow it this possible? do i have a full free day? it helped that i don't have cooking (other than rice, which we'll talk about next) to do this weekend as i got that done last night.

so we can now talk about meals/food. breakfast is oatmeal every morning so that's covered. 

and dinner is pasta every night so that's covered and part of my seven-days-per-week evening routine so i never have to ef that.

i consider cooking rice and carving chicken just part of lunchtime. so that's taken care of depending on timing of jamming at the bridge, which i think could fit perfectly between breakfast and lunch or between lunch and dinner. i'm thinking heading that way right after breakfast will give me ample time to get 'r done with plenty of time to make it home in time for lunch and an afternoon nap!

Known for its versatility, durability, and timeless appeal, a dark grey sofa serves as a focal point in contemporary homes. Whether placed in a cozy apartment or a spacious living room, this piece of furniture enhances the ambiance with its deep, neutral shade while complementing a wide range of interior styles. Beyond its elegant appearance, a [**dark grey corner sofa**](https://furnt.co.uk/collections/grey-corner-sofas) also provides ample seating and functionality, making it a preferred choice for homeowners who value both form and function.

# Why Choose a Dark Grey Corner Sofa?

One of the primary reasons why dark grey corner sofas are a popular choice is their ability to blend seamlessly with different color schemes and design aesthetics. Unlike lighter shades that may require frequent cleaning, dark grey offers a practical advantage by concealing stains and wear, making it ideal for families, pet owners, and individuals who prioritize low-maintenance furniture.

Additionally, grey is a neutral yet sophisticated color that pairs well with various accent shades. Whether you prefer a minimalist, industrial, or Scandinavian-style interior, a dark grey sofa provides the perfect base for adding vibrant cushions, cozy throws, and statement decor pieces. Its ability to complement both warm and cool tones ensures that your living room remains stylish and inviting, regardless of seasonal trends.

# Customization and Styling Options

Dark grey corner sofas come in a variety of materials, textures, and configurations, allowing homeowners to select the best fit for their space and lifestyle. Some popular options include:

* **Fabric Upholstery:** Linen, microfiber, and cotton offer a soft and inviting feel, ideal for casual lounging.
* **Velvet Finish:** A luxurious and elegant option that adds depth and sophistication to a room.
* **Leather or Faux Leather:** A sleek and durable choice that is easy to clean and perfect for a contemporary setting.

To enhance the look of a dark grey corner sofa, consider incorporating decorative elements such as patterned cushions, plush rugs, and wooden or metallic coffee tables. Light-colored walls and flooring can help balance the darker shade of the sofa, while warm lighting fixtures create a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. If you want a bold and dramatic look, pair your dark grey sofa with deep jewel tones like emerald green, navy blue, or mustard yellow for a striking contrast.

# Comfort and Durability

A dark grey corner sofa is not only visually appealing but also designed for maximum comfort. The spacious seating arrangement allows for relaxation, whether you are hosting guests, watching movies, or simply unwinding after a long day. Many models feature high-density foam cushions, memory foam padding, or pocket springs, ensuring long-lasting support and comfort.

Durability is another key factor that makes dark grey corner sofas an excellent choice. High-quality upholstery materials ensure resistance to fading, wear, and tear. Many fabric sofas are designed with stain-resistant coatings, making them easy to clean and maintain. Regular vacuuming, occasional spot cleaning, and using fabric protectors can help keep your sofa looking fresh and new for years. Additionally, modular or reclining corner sofas offer added functionality, allowing homeowners to customize their seating experience based on their needs.

# Conclusion

A dark grey corner sofa is a timeless investment that brings style, comfort, and practicality to any home. Its rich, neutral tone makes it a versatile piece that pairs well with various décor styles, from modern and industrial to classic and contemporary. With its ample seating space, durable construction, and low-maintenance features, a dark grey sofa is perfect for those looking to create an inviting yet sophisticated living space. Whether accessorized with bold accents or kept minimalistic for a sleek look, this furniture piece remains a favorite choice for homeowners who value both aesthetics and functionality.",1,1743247330.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

1jmk3m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jmk3m2/theres_something_wrong_with_my_reflection/,There's something wrong with my reflection,"It started small. A tiny flicker of doubt.

The first time I noticed, I was brushing my teeth before bed, half-asleep and running on autopilot. I turned my head to spit into the sink, and for the briefest moment, I thought—no, felt—that my reflection moved a fraction of a second too late.

It was so minor that I brushed it off. Maybe I was tired, maybe I had zoned out. But the next morning, it happened again. This time, I was shaving. I swiped the razor along my cheek, and out of the corner of my eye, I swore my reflection was just slightly behind. It wasn’t an obvious lag, just the faintest delay, like a poorly synced video. I tested it, waving a hand, shifting my head side to side. Everything seemed fine. Still, something felt wrong.

By the third day, I started paying closer attention. That’s when the little details started piling up.

My reflection blinked, but I was certain I hadn’t. I leaned in, studying my face, my pulse quickening. I tried to trick it—moving fast, then slow, making sudden gestures. Nothing. It was perfect. Too perfect. But every now and then, I’d catch it—an extra blink, a hesitation, a moment where its expression wasn’t quite mine.

Then, one morning, I caught it smiling.

Not a full grin. Just the ghost of one.

And I wasn’t smiling.

My stomach turned to ice. I stepped back, heart hammering in my chest. I stared at the reflection, willing myself to believe I had imagined it. I forced a grin, testing myself against the mirror. It copied me exactly. No delay. No smile of its own.

But I knew.

From that moment on, I avoided mirrors. I turned my bathroom mirror to face the wall. I kept my phone screen dimmed, barely glancing at it when I texted. Shop windows, darkened TV screens, even the gloss of my coffee table—I avoided them all.

But the more I avoided them, the more I felt it watching. Waiting.

On the fifth night, I woke up gasping, heart pounding in my throat. The room was dark, silent, but something felt wrong. A heaviness in the air. A pressure, like a pair of unseen eyes drilling into me.

Then I saw it.

My bedroom mirror had moved.

It was no longer bolted to my closet door. It stood, impossibly upright, at the foot of my bed. Angled just right so I could see myself lying there.

No. Not myself.

The thing in the mirror was already sitting up.

It wasn’t mimicking me. It wasn’t frozen. It was awake. Watching me. Smiling.

The terror that gripped me was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. My body locked up, every nerve screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. I was paralyzed, staring at it, as it stared at me. Then, in the dimness, I saw it lift a hand.

I felt the cold rush of adrenaline, but before I could react—

The light flicked on.

I gasped, my body jerking as if I had been yanked from a nightmare. The mirror was back in its normal place. My reflection looked normal. My pulse thundered in my ears as I scrambled out of bed, chest heaving. But I know what I saw.

That was two days ago. I haven’t slept since.

And now? Now I think it’s getting stronger.

This morning, I forced myself to check the bathroom mirror. Just a quick glance. Just to make sure.

My reflection didn’t move at all.

It just stood there. Watching me. Smiling.

I don’t think I have much time left.

thoughts:

\- orangerie > orsay > louvre, for me. All 3 are fantastic (not only just the art but the spaces themselves), but Monet's water lillies left a very big, very nice impression on me, I really enjoyed how their large format makes you visually feel like you are right there by the pond, and the technique and choice of color displayed in them is wonderful. very ponderous, very meditative. in general I found the styles and depicted subject matters of the Orsay and Orangerie more appealing - classical/renaissance art is brilliant in technique of course and I love it so very much but of course later styles of painting are a bit more inventive in terms of color and portrayal and a bit more relatable and diverse in terms of subject matter. also, to me, the classical collections of the louvre (greek, egypt, etc.) are not that interesting other than the venus de milo and winged victory - there is nothing i have never seen before, though of course the historical value is very cool. winged victory was really awesome though, as well as the sculpture part of the louvre. 

also if you can i would strongly recommend getting the night tickets for the louvre (they are open till 9 on wednesdays and fridays i think?) obviously the louvre is very popular, so seeing it at night where there were less people just felt a bit more intimate and personal. i think other museums have similar things like this too, which result in probably a similar sort of feeling. 

\- food: french food, to me, is as good as advertised. very delightful, technical, refined. however do not expect dishes to blow your socks off with flavor or be very spice centric, but something else which combines a bunch of subtle, harmonious flavors and textures into one dish. also bread is free with unlimited refills so if you want to order something with a nice sauce and mop the rest of it up with bread, go ahead (i did this a lot, and the bread is usually pretty good too). I was also surprised by how easy it was to get a table for dinner without reservation on weekdays, but for fridays + weekends, I would strongly recommend having a reservation - i visited like 5 restaurants on friday before I found one which had free seats. 

food recommendations: mokonuts (11ième arrondissement, one of, if not the best meal I've had in recent memory - would 100% recommend a reservation), clamato (great seafood restaurant, in the michelin guide, loved their scallops), Le Petit Lutetia (great classic french food in the 6ième). Maison d'Isabelle does great croissants, was a big fan of NOIR (I think there are multiple locations?) and Simple Coffee in Montmartre for coffee/cafe recs. 

\- walking around the city is an absolute treat. i took like 25k steps each day.  doesn't matter if the street is narrow or wide, just walking around and seeing all the haussman-style buildings and checking out any intersting store (even if you didn't buy anything) was something I found immensely immensely enjoyable - as it allows you to see the true character of the city. special shoutouts to st-germain de pres (beaux arts district is here i think? there were a lot of cool galleries, and I especially liked the streets), montmartre (classic, also a lot of galleries and a lot of very cool concept stores - barks and brothers, nothing as paris, as well as your classic souvenir shops), and le marais (very sort of chic, trendy shopping area with lots of streetwear brands and thrift stores. i thought the thrift stores were very cool, got myself some nice leather jackets for cheap because apparently everyone here wears leather jackets - kilo shop was probably my favorite. also a lot of cool boutiques and bakeries - merci paris was a very cool shop, although very expensive). walking by the seine is also always especially wonderful. 

\- i maybe understimated (or didnt think about thoroughly enough) Paris' size. it's big. can take more than 40 minutes by subway or the equivalent of a 2 hour walk to get from place to place (for example, it took \~40 minutes for me to get to montmartre in the morning). fortunately the subway system is pretty intuitive (at least for me, but I have a good amount of subway experience from being near nyc) and covers the city well. i think location, when planning out where you stay, should be at the forefront of your mind. if you can somehow be in the 1st or 2nd arrondissements that would be a godsend in terms of travel time

  
\- i think the best view of the city is from the eiffel tower, especially at night. people call paris the city of lights for a reason, and being at the top of the eiffel (which towers over most of the city effortlessly) as the sun set and all the lights slowly started to turn on was absolutely magical and something which will stay in my memory for a long time. i also recommend the arc de triomphe at night, getting such a personal and close view of the champs elysees was also very awesome, and it's a great place to watch the eiffel tower sparkle. centre pompidou was also cool as that shows a view of eastern paris, rather than western paris like the eiffel or arc de troimphe. 

\- people were generally very nice to me. i wanted to practice my french so i tried to speak it as much as possible and people were generally accomodating. definitely think my conversational skills have improved, as parisians do speak very fast especially compared to a university classroom setting. i think even if you don't speak french if you start off everything you say with ""bonjour"" or ""bonsoir"" and maybe learn some basic phrases like ""parlez-vous anglais?"" ou ""ou est-ce que les toillettes"" you'll be fine. 

\- i carried a tote everywhere i went, which is something i'd recommend everyone do. didn't feel in danger of getting pickpocketed or stolen from even in very crowded subways and subway stations, and it's a really good way of just keeping everything you need and everything you buy

\- i was initially sort of skeptical about visiting versailles but i firmly now think it is a must do. the palace itself is an incredibly representation of french history and just a great encapsulation of french culture during the reign of Louis XIV and afterwards, and it is unbelievably opulent and adorned, really representative of one of the pinnacle epochs of the history of france. the gallery of battles was also very very cool imo, a very nice representation of france's extensive military history, with a lot of battles i've personally never learned about. it's easy to see why a lot of french people are thus proud of their history and heritage. the gardens are also wonderful on a sunny day and extremely pleasant to stroll around it, and i also enjoyed the trianon palaces as well, both the grand and petit. they are less adorned but feel like more real, lived in spaces.

A beige corner sofa is a timeless and versatile furniture piece that enhances any living space with its elegance and functionality. This neutral-toned sofa not only provides ample seating but also blends seamlessly with various interior styles, from modern minimalist to classic and traditional. Whether you are designing a cozy family room or a sophisticated lounge, a beige corner sofa serves as the perfect foundation for creating a warm and inviting ambiance. Its ability to complement different color palettes and décor styles makes it a top choice for homeowners looking to achieve both style and comfort in their living spaces.

# Why Choose a Beige Corner Sofa?

One of the primary reasons why beige corner sofas are so popular is their incredible versatility. Beige, as a neutral color, acts as a perfect backdrop for various decorative elements, allowing homeowners to experiment with different accent colors and textures. Whether you prefer vibrant cushions, patterned rugs, or wooden furniture, a beige sofa provides a balanced and harmonious look that adapts to evolving interior trends.

Beyond aesthetics, beige corner sofas offer practical benefits as well. Their L-shaped or U-shaped designs maximize seating space, making them ideal for both small apartments and large homes. They provide a cozy atmosphere, ensuring that families and guests have a comfortable place to gather, relax, and socialize. Additionally, beige upholstery is less likely to show signs of wear and tear compared to darker fabrics, helping maintain a fresh and inviting look over time.

# Customization and Styling Options

A [**beige corner sofa**](https://furnt.co.uk/collections/beige-corner-sofas) comes in a variety of designs, materials, and configurations, making it easy to find the perfect match for your home. Whether you prefer a sleek modern look with clean lines or a plush and overstuffed design for extra comfort, there are numerous options to explore. Popular upholstery choices include soft linen, luxurious velvet, durable cotton, and easy-to-clean microfiber. Each material offers unique benefits in terms of texture, durability, and maintenance.

To elevate the look of a beige corner sofa, homeowners can accessorize with stylish throw pillows, cozy blankets, and decorative cushions in contrasting colors such as navy blue, emerald, green, or mustard yellow. A textured area rug underneath the sofa can add depth and warmth to the space. Additionally, incorporating metallic or wooden coffee tables and side tables can enhance the overall aesthetic, creating a balanced and visually appealing living area.

# Comfort and Durability

Beige corner sofas are designed with comfort in mind, offering spacious seating and plush cushioning for ultimate relaxation. High-density foam or memory foam cushions provide excellent support, while deep seats allow users to lounge comfortably for hours. Some models even come with reclining features, adjustable headrests, or built-in storage compartments, enhancing both convenience and functionality.

Durability is another key advantage of beige corner sofas. High-quality fabric upholstery ensures that the sofa remains in good condition for years, even with daily use. Many modern beige sofas are designed with stain-resistant and easy-to-clean materials, making them ideal for households with children and pets. Regular maintenance, such as vacuuming and spot cleaning, helps preserve the sofa’s pristine appearance and prolong its lifespan.

# Conclusion

A beige corner sofa is more than just a piece of furniture; it is a statement of style, comfort, and practicality. Its neutral color makes it a timeless addition to any home, effortlessly blending with various décor styles while allowing for creative customization. Whether you’re looking to create a cozy retreat for family gatherings or a stylish focal point for entertaining guests, a beige corner sofa offers the perfect combination of elegance, durability, and versatility.

Have you ever spent hours at your desk, only to wonder at the end of the day, “What the heck did I actually get done?” *Yeah, me too.* A couple months back, my life felt like a never-ending loop of constant busy-ness with little productivity to show for it. That was, until I stumbled upon the magic of **time blocking** combined with **energy peaks**. Seriously, it's like finding the cheat code for adulting. 💡

**Time Blocking vs. Energy Peaks: The Real MVPs**

Okay, so here's what I figured out. Time blocking is when you set specific blocks of your schedule for specific activities. Kind of like Tetris, but with less frustration and more productivity. But here’s the twist: mix it with your personal energy peaks. You know, those times of day when you feel like a superhuman and could probably outrun a cheetah? Yeah, those are your energy peaks. Here’s how I combined them to save 10 hours a week:

1. **Figure Out Your Peak Hours:** We’re all a bit different here. Some of us soar in the morning (*looking at you, early birds*), others find their stride post-lunch (*everyone else*). Observe yourself for a week. When do you crush it at work or in your personal projects? 

2. **Block Your Time Wisely:**
   - Morning Peak? **Tackle the Tough Stuff:** If you're a morning person, schedule tasks that require the most brainpower during this time.
   - Afternoon Energy Boost? **Do the Creative Tasks:** Set aside these hours for brainstorming or that passion project burning a hole in your to-do list.
   - Evening Go-Getter? **Wrap Up Loose Ends:** Finish any small, straightforward tasks that don’t need your full focus.

3. **Realistic Buffer Zones – Because Life Happens:** Add buffers between tasks because let’s be honest, things don't always go as planned. It *feels* weirdly good to have that wiggle room.

4. **Review and Adjust:** Every Friday, glance over the week. Notice any patterns? Maybe Tuesday’s meetings drained you. Shift that brainstorming session to tomorrow.

**Why This Works (and Saves Time):**
- **Less Mental Ping-Pong:** You’re not constantly switching between tasks because you’ve already chosen your focus for each block.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Working with your natural energy peaks means less *forcing* yourself to work when you’re drained.
- **More Free Time:** More focus = faster completion, leaving room for Netflix guilt-free or whatever else you're into.

**A Little Humor to Leave You With:**
I used to believe endless coffee was the answer to productivity. Spoiler: It just makes you really good at pretending you’re on a rollercoaster at your desk. 🎢🤣

So, my friends, think about your own energy peaks and how you might shift your time blocks to fit them. It might just transform your schedule—and your life. What are some of the peak hours you’ve noticed? I’ll probably be around mid-afternoon if you want to chat about this! 🕒✨

I had smoked delta 8 shortly after having Covid and had the worst week of my life. Night before Christmas I had my first panic attack. It was the worst night of my life. Shaking uncontrollably, heart pounding out of my chest, feeling like I was about to die for what felt like hours. 

The next few days were awful. Smaller panic attacks and extreme exhaustion where I didn’t leave the bed for 3 days. The rest of the year I was always on edge. If my body felt slightly different it began to freak out. Coffee, panic, alcohol, panic, cardio, panic. I was lucky only a few major occurrences happened during the year. 

A year after that I still had the body on edge feeling but never had a full attack. Here I am a full 3 years later and I finally kicked the feeling. Through this experience I’ve changed how I live my life a lot. It felt so hopeless back when it started and I feel lucky to be back to “normal”.

“Dan, I have 3-4 coffee dates per week but none turn into clients…”

“They simply ghost, even though on the call they appear to need AI”.

This was the message I got this morning, from a guy called El.

First off, hats off to him for filling his calendar with that many coffee dates using [what I share in the book](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency), free group and the free challenge.

But, that’s a LOT of coffee dates for none to turn into clients.

When I hear things like this, I know something BIG is being missed.

So, I got my shovel out and started digging.

After a few back-and-forth messages, to find out more about the clients he’s had coffee dates with…

The general picture was:

* They all have between 1-3 sales guys
* A couple of hundred thousand leads in their ‘database’ 
* Most get around 2k new leads per month

With that amount of leads, it does ‘appear’ like they would benefit from a ‘Sleeping Beauty Android’.

But do you see the disconnect?

2000 new leads per month split between 3 sales peeps…

That’s 667 leads per month each.

There are, on average, 20 working days in a month. That means each salesperson would get 33 NEW leads per day.

That seems a lot.

Especially, as this looks like a relatively small biz and they’d have to be spending some serious coin to get that many leads per advisor, per day, from paid ads.

I dug a bit deeper. The convo went like this:

Dan: “Where do these clients get their leads from”

El: “They buy from different sources”

Dan: “As in they buy data lists?”

El: “Yes”

Dan: “And there’s your problem”.

El: “Ooh the lead sources are the reason why they don't close? When we ask if they have contacted these leads before most say they have mostly via cold calls”.

Now, it’s not as black and white as the ‘lead source’ determines whether a client will close or not.

I needed to paint a clearer picture.

Have you seen how a cash-strapped student eats?

They eat rubbish!

Think packet noodles, baked beans, microwave pizzas, bread, pasta.

They choose quantity over quality.

Most students want food that's bulky so it will fill them up

…and they want it cheap.

They don't care if the food has ZERO nutritional value.

All they wanna do is fill a hole and stop the hunger pangs.

So, lemme ask you this…

If this person doesn’t value the food they buy and the impact it has on their body…

Do you think they would value someone coming along and saying:

""I can help you eat better food, that will nourish you and keep you fuller for longer?""

No.

They'll just think “Why bother when I can keep filling up on cheap, crappy food”.

BUT…

Ask the same question to a gym bunny, who’s paying $600 per month for a meal prep company to cook her 1 high-protein meal a day

…and they’d jump at the offer.

All we need to do is swap food out for leads, and you’ll see a scenario that plays out daily in our industry.

Clients who buy ‘premium’ leads from paid ads feel enough ‘pain’ from paying their lead invoice to value the leads they get.

If a client’s spent $10,000 for 100 leads but they’ve only been able to contact half of them…

…using AI to reactivate the other 50 leads to recoup some cash, is something they’d make a top priority as they know there are sales still there to be had.

Clients who buy ‘junk’ leads from data lists haven’t felt that same pain.

‘Buying cheap’ means that sales are few and far between but, it works ‘just enough’ for it to be worth their while.

These guys know they can throw mud at the wall once and hope that something sticks…

…but working those same crappy leads again?

Even using AI, they know that’s a pointless exercise.

The lightbulb has gone off for El after our convo this morning.

He’s going to make sure his next few coffee dates are with clients who’ve felt enough pain getting their leads, to value them.

To save yourself from ghosting's and wasted coffee dates, remember to ask early on…

I just want to start off this by saying I love my daughter and I will spend my life trying to make it up to her,

My daughter Anna (17) has always been a problem child she’d rather make tiktoks than study and is extremely vain since she hit puberty, she is very judgmental about others especially boys her age to the point she’s gotten in trouble for bullying

Imagine mine and my husbands shock when she brought home Tom (18) whom had a great reputation for not only his academic achievements but his charity work (small town) now Tom wasn’t my daughters usually choice of boyfriend, her past boyfriend’s were pretty boy jocks who were living in their glory days before the ultimate peak in high school which concerned my husband and I because my daughter was going into that direction too.

Tom fooled everyone into thinking he was this amazing kind boy that wanted to make a change in our town, he was of the few people in our town who was openly liberal and pushed to educate on world issues which my husband and I admired. Looking back now there was signs of toms isolation of Anna like when he came to our house to privately speak to my husband about two of Anna’s friends, he told us they were being openly transphobic against another girl in their school and he tried to warn Anna about them but she brushed him off by calling it “jokes”

We were shocked thanked him than punished Anna and banned her from said friends when she asked us were we got the information from we lied and told her a teacher which looking back was an idiot move, he happened twice more with Anna’s other friend’s

At the time we thought he was trying to help Anna and put her on a better path in life as we witnessed Tom educate Anna on issues and Anna herself seems more interested in things going on around her rather than the blush launch or TikTok trend, Ann seems like a whole new person we honestly believed Tom was a good influence on her as he fooled not just us but everyone around him

In late September Anna broke up with Tom out of the blue and told us we needed to cut contact when we pressed why she wouldn’t give us any details so we reached out to Tom who asked to meet for coffee Tom lied to us and said Anna had been cheating on him with one of her best friends (Sarah) brother and Sarah had been covering it up, my husband first wife cheated on him so Tom knew he could manipulate us with this. I’m ashamed to say we were very hard on Anna my husband even called her a slut who would end up up in the local trailer park with multiple kids on food stamps and I made her cut contact with Sarah.

Anna stopped speaking to us outside of one word responses and barely left her room even refused to speak to our family therapist on Halloween Tom called me to tell me Anna was at a party drunk and hanging off any guy that would look her way, Anna was meant to be grounded and as she didn’t have a phone we had no way of connecting her so we asked Tom bring her home, 40 minutes later cops showed up at our door Anna had assaulted Tom apparently Tom had dragged her to the car and while he was driving she kept pulling the wheel so he pulled in to claim her down than she began assaulting him (we know now that not the real story)

Tom didnt press charges and for the next few weeks he kept coming over to check up on Anna pretending to be concerned, unfortunately we didn’t notice what was really going on

In November we got a call from the school that Anna was rushed to the hospital, what happened was Tom cornered Anna at an abandoned part of the school were kids go to vape/smoke and tried to force Anna to kiss him  Ann rejected him so Tom to strangle Anna

Thankfully some kids vaping saw this and saved Anna, doctors told us there was signs of long term abuse. I was shocked Tim really had everyone fooled into thinking Anna was the bad guy in the relationship when he was the one abusing her

Anna wouldn’t speak to me or my husband we only found out the details when my sister repeated them to us. Anna has been staying at my sisters two states over because she doesn’t feel safe with us

We have tried reaching out but all we are met with is abuse from my family I don’t know how I can fix this my daughter won’t even let me near enough to apologise to her, she doesn’t even want us at the first hearing in late April nor her 18th birthday on Monday

I know I was failed her and I’m a fool but Tom had everyone fooled

We begged Sarah to talk to her but she told us we were just as bad as Tom so leave Anna alone I want to go to the court against everyone wishes to show my daughter I still support her even if she hates me 

TLDR: my daughter dated what we thought was the perfect boy and we unintentionally help him isolate my daughter now our daughter won’t even look at us",2,1743245903.0,AITAH,22,0.63,False

I wasn’t looking for love that evening—just a quiet escape among the shelves of my favorite bookstore. The smell of old pages and fresh ink wrapped around me like a warm hug. I ran my fingers along the spines of well-loved novels, searching for something that would fill the emptiness in my chest.

Then I heard a voice. Soft, amused. “You’re staring at that book like it holds all the answers.”

I turned and met the warmest brown eyes I’d ever seen. He held a copy of the same book in his hands—The Night Circus. My favorite.

“I was hoping it did,” I admitted with a shy smile.

He grinned. “Tell you what, if you let me buy you coffee, we can debate whether it does.”

I hesitated for just a moment before nodding. That night, over coffee and endless conversation, I realized something: sometimes, the best stories aren’t found in books—they start in bookstores.

And maybe, just maybe, he was the plot twist I never saw coming.

It started with a security camera glitch. That’s what they called it, anyway.

James was on the night shift at Pinehill Diner, a rundown 24-hour joint on the outskirts of town. His only company was the flickering fluorescent lights, the hum of the coffee machine, and the grainy security monitors mounted in the back office. Usually, the cameras just showed the empty booths, the parking lot, and the kitchen. But that night… something was off.

At exactly 3:12 AM, Camera 3 pointed at the counter started fuzzing out. The screen warped, colors distorting into a sickly swirl of blues and greens. Then the static cleared.

And someone was there.

It wasn’t a customer. It wasn’t a coworker. It wasn’t anything James could explain.

A face stared up into the lens, pale and distorted. Wide, glassy eyes locked onto his, unblinking. The mouth was slightly open, teeth barely visible, like it had just been caught whispering something. The worst part? The thing wasn’t standing where Camera 3 should’ve been facing. It was inside the monitor.

James lurched back from the desk, heart pounding. The live feed wasn’t showing the diner. It was showing him, watching the screen. And the face on the monitor wasn’t just staring.

It was moving.

The figure tilted its head, just slightly, as if it was studying him. James watched in horror as its mouth stretched into a grin, slow and unnatural, lips cracking open wider than they should.

Then it spoke.

A garbled, static-filled whisper hissed through the speakers, layered and distorted, like a hundred voices speaking at once. He couldn’t understand the words, but they slithered into his ears, writhing like worms in his skull.

The lights in the diner flickered.

James shot up, grabbing his phone to snap a picture, proof that he wasn’t just losing his mind. But the second he raised the camera, the power cut out. The monitors went black.

Silence.

His phone screen glowed in the dark. He had taken the picture before the power died. With shaking fingers, he opened the gallery.

The image loaded.

It was the security feed, just as he had seen it his own face staring at the monitor, and the thing watching back. But this time, it wasn’t grinning.

It was behind him.

James felt breath on his neck.

The phone slipped from his fingers.

The last thing Pinehill Diner’s morning crew found was the security footage.

At 3:12 AM, Camera 3 glitched.

At 3:13 AM, James was gone.

And at 3:14 AM… the thing in the monitor smiled.",1,1743245206.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

However, I do feel like I have a little less energy overall. While I prefer this steady state over the constant peaks and crashes, I also feel a bit calmer—almost to the point of feeling a little boring. Reducing my dosage makes me more zoned out, and increasing it would probably make me feel even more dull. I just don’t quite feel like myself, though I do appreciate the increased focus.

I plan to continue avoiding caffeine, but I’m looking for an alternative that provides a bit of extra energy without causing crashes or raising blood pressure. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I'm absolutely confused,"Hello everyone. This may be quite long, sorry in advance, but the whole situation is making me confused and stupid. (Considering my last experience, I was denied a couple of times by the ones I liked. I do consider myself beautiful and interesting to an adequate degree, I have friends and a good family, socially alright).

So, for context, we're in Europe, both foreigners living in a student dormitory. We firstly met at the beginning of the winter semester last year when I was moving in, and my parents were helping me. He opened the door for me. I didn't even recall this anymore, just thought in the moment that he looked interesting. Then we met at the beginning of this semester on an event. He was in the distance and I was attracted like a magnet to him. I couldn't even see his face properly, and didn't recognise him as that person who opened the door. We met at another event later and he was the one who recalled it. I was feeling that he may be kinda uncomfortable with our age gap, but this is still only my assumption. I followed him on Instagram, he followed back. Then I was wandering if I should text first, while I was with a friend in university having this exact thought, I saw him running late for a class. I decided to try, we talked a little and then he invited me for a coffee. I really enjoyed our time together, we share a lot of interests and I just genuinely enjoyed his presence. Maybe my mind was too foggy to mention that he perhaps wasn't on the same note, but I felt like he at least liked the time spend together. Then we parted, we casually hugged and he said ""see you soon"". Maybe it was just politeness from him, but I did get it as ""see you next week"". He is busy with finishing studies and working, I know. Anyways, he didn't text me back in a couple of days and I again decited to text first. He was responding quite randomly, but not short or cold. Like either in a couple of hours, in 10 minutes, a day, and now he didn't respond back, however didn't read(open) the messages.

During the week, my stupid mind remembered that he mentioned liking cookies. Did I ever bake something in my life? No. Did I bake cookies for him? Freaking yes, a friend tasted and said they're amazing. One problem, he didn't text me back or invited to a second date. Now I'm wandering if I should text him first again.

I don't know if this makes sense to add, but he is Latino and has a large community of friends, including lots of girls. However, he doesn't seem hot and macho by temper, I'd say even vice versa. I also have a lot of male friends, so this doesn't bother me.

I was thinking just to text him and ask to meet for 5 minutes, give him the cookies (I don't even eat them), and try to ask subtly or directly if he is interested in meeting again.

I'm sorry for the long novel, but I'm afraid I don't have a properly working brain now, and at the same time don't want to lose him. ",1,1743245067.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

he left after paying towards the coffee machine area to get the coffee, he started shouting that “we have manners here bring better manners from your country Pakistan” (i’m not Pakistani) and i was in disbelief and shock as i didn’t want to assume anything so i asked what and he repeated “your country is awful, if you want to live here bring better manners” and he kept saying that until he left.

a lady came to the shop when he was there and she had a bad hearing so she couldn’t make out what he was saying but she did point out he was saying something to me.

I already work an early morning job so waking up at that time is just normal now. My boyfriend also wakes up earlier, but at like 7:30am. He is anxious about his sleep, and often worries that he’s not going to be able to fall asleep/get 7-8hrs. The other day he basically just started spiralling and questioning how he is going to survive the year living together if I do this…

I’ve already been feeling like he parents me way too much, and I’ve had to talk to him several times about not making comments and questioning me on my food as it’s really stressful and triggering for me (I’ve had anorexia in the past). He tends to get fixated and stressed about a “problem”, like how many veggies I’ve eaten/ not eaten, when I’m eating, if I’m taking a supplement, why I’m not taking a supplement, that I should be taking naps, when I choose to drink a coffee, and now it’s a problem that I woke up at 5 the last two days and woke him up too. I get that he cares about my wellbeing, but at what point do you stress out way too much about other people to the point where you are ding a disservice to yourself and your own wellbeing? I told him that what I choose to do doesn’t need to affect him so much. It’s a weekend and you have all the time to sleep in, just go back to sleep, it doesn’t have to be an ordeal. Then he goes on to say that it’s inconsiderate bc we sleep in the same bed and it wakes him up, and that I’m negatively impacting myself by getting 6hrs of sleep. I feel like him brining up my sleep was just a way to deflect that he’s getting worked up bc he’s upset about waking up. It’s never about the other person, it’s about ourselves bc humans are self-serving. He brought up a compromise in weekend wake up. I just don’t like the sound of that bc I feel like I’m being controlled… I’m not going to be waking up like this every weekend. I’m getting to the point when it’s starting to give ME anxiety if I do anything that could possibly disrupt his sleep, or put him into problem spiral mode where he’s going to question me for 20 mins. When I woke up at 5am recently, he comes out of the room a few mins later, and stood there for 30 mins taking time out of his own sleep to question me and go on about what he got himself into living with me, making it seem like he woke up to me doing drugs and screaming. 

Am i being the asshole by wanting to wake up? I do struggle with feeling like I’m being told what to do and controlled because I struggle alot with people pleasing. But I understand if I could be in the wrong. ",2,1743244575.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False
1jmjgvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TouringMusicians/comments/1jmjgvq/forgotten_touring_etiquette/,Forgotten touring etiquette,"After a decade on the road, I’ve noticed that some touring mates seem to have left their common sense back at the venue. So here’s a straightforward, no‐bullshit guide on how to be a decent touring buddy. Follow these tips and you won’t just be tolerated—you might actually be liked. And if you screw up, at least you’ll have a funny story to tell over a pint later.

Personal Hygiene (Yeah, Seriously):
	•	Shoes: Pack two pairs—one for daytime stomping around and one for nighttime debauchery. Let your shoes breathe, or you’ll end up with a stench potent enough to clear a room faster than a fart in church. If you’re short on space, invest in breathable kicks like leather or cotton.
	•	Socks: For the love of all that is holy, never wear the same socks twice. Once they’ve soaked up your daily sweat, chuck ‘em out. A bit of talcum powder or foot spray will help keep any fungal freeloaders at bay.

Show Prep & Post-Show Rituals:
	•	Clothes & Towels: If you’re prone to melting into a puddle of sweat mid-show, pack a towel and a fresh set of clothes. You’ll thank yourself later when you’re not reeking by the time you hit the afterparty.
	•	Dry Off: Seriously, dry yourself off in the shower before you saunter out—nobody wants to slip on a soggy mess that you left behind in the bathroom.

Consideration for Roommates:
	•	Alarm Etiquette: Set one or two alarms max. Multiple alarms, with you hitting snooze like a damn teenager, will annoy everyone trying to sleep.
	•	Shit in the lobby toilets: When nature calls, do it where it won’t create a kebab-scented biohazard in a share room . Obviously if you have to go you have to go but sometimes it nice in a seperate toilet from the room. 

Communication & Team Spirit:
	•	Keep Us Informed: Let people know where you’re headed—this isn’t rocket science. It’s a basic courtesy and a safety measure.
	•	Lend a Hand: If you’re not the headliner, don’t just stand around like a useless extra. Offer your help, and if you need it, ask for it. A bit of initiative goes a long way.
	•	Seek Feedback: Don’t leave a gig wondering why you’re never called back. Ask for feedback; it might sting a bit, but it’ll help you not be that guy who ruins every tour with his incompetence.
	•	Respect Personal Space: Not everyone is as chatty as you first thing in the morning.

Responsibility & Role Clarity:
	•	Know Your Job: If you’re in charge of something—say, merchandise—don’t slack off and expect the band to cover for your arse. If you’re unsure, ask.
	•	Reciprocate Kindness: When someone gets you coffee, return the favor. It’s not rocket science: if you’re only in it for yourself, you’re going to be remembered as the selfish prick of the tour.

General Courtesy:
	•	Check In: Some folks are quiet because they’re fine, while others are silently suffering. A quick “How are you holding up?” can work wonders.
	•	Over-Communicate: Better to say too much than not enough. One guy’s failure to mention baggage allowance details cost us a grand in fines—don’t be that guy.
	•	Be Valuable, Not a Burden: Constantly ask yourself, “Am I adding value or just being dead weight?” No one wants a negative presence dragging the tour down.

Remember, being a good touring buddy isn’t about being a saint—it’s about not being a complete arsehole. Keep these in mind, and you might just survive the road with your dignity intact.

I was fine with all of it, except the quadratic formula killed me. Totally could not get my head around it.

Next unit is described as follows: “Topics covered in this course include: linear algebra concepts, vectors and matrices operations, eigenvalues & eigenvectors, dynamical systems, optimisation techniques (e.g. Gradient descent), linear regression, probability concepts (probability laws, Bayes' rule and independence), selected probability distributions, statistical inference and applications to data analytics”.

This is the only other (pure) Math unit in my degree (Business Analytics). I have no idea what I’m getting myself into here, and if this is building on the foundation of Quadratics - because if it is I’d like to spend the next year with a tutor to get myself ready for it; Or if it’s not really building on that knowledge I’m happy to just tackle it.

Just trying to get a gauge of what it’s likely going to be. I don’t have the best math skill, but I do trying to work through a problem … I do get a bit frustrated with myself if I can’t understand the concepts behind it (ie. Quadratics - Assignment was on calculating the time it would take a coffee to cool from 80 degrees to 31 degree’s based of some defined factors … I literally couldn’t figure it out so I just put down something … ended up getting good marks elsewhere which gave me a Pass).

1jmjata,https://i.redd.it/bqe2oj3tulre1.jpeg,Newbie questions,I love iced tea and want to start brewing my own. Over a decade ago I was briefly into brewing loose leaf tea that I would get from Teavana. I mostly drink plain black tea but during that time I also remember liking some white teas and fruity mixes. So to get back into it I ordered some teas (list pictured) from The Steeping Room and a cold brew coffee maker from Kitchen Aid that I am hoping I can use to brew tea and keep it in my fridge. My questions are: 1) can I actually use a cold brew coffee maker to brew tea? 2) if so can I use it for any tea or will only certain teas work for cold brewing? Will all the ones in the list I ordered work? 3) any recommendations for the best tea for iced tea? I’m excited to try new things so open to all suggestions! ,1,1743243793.0,tea,5,1.0,False
