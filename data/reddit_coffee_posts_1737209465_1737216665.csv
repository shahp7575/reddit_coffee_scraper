My husband is Iranian Armenian and he learned to put the coffee and sugar with the water and let it boil all together.

1i4aluj,https://i.redd.it/jwqhso5dzrde1.jpeg,AIO about comments my friends mom makes about me.,"I’ve been friends with someone for a while whose mom is very strict and often doesn’t make sense. For example, last weekend, her mom allowed us to go to a coffee shop, but we weren’t allowed to go sledding because my friend’s mom said I live in a bad neighborhood. I wanted to go sledding at a park near my friend’s house anyway, but my friend said she still wasn’t allowed.

I’ve also noticed that my friend sometimes seems to enjoy getting sympathy because of her mom’s behavior, even when it makes me uncomfortable. She often says things without realizing they can be rude. Last weekend, we were talking about college, and she shared that her mom plans to let her pay rent, save that rent money, and give it back to her so she can buy a house. She mentioned that her mom makes six figures and wouldn’t spend the rent money because she doesn’t need it.

I live with my single dad, who’s a contractor, in a less expensive area of town. My neighborhood is not as wealthy as my friends’, but I don’t believe it’s a bad area. The houses around me are typically worth $150,000 to $300,000, while their houses are closer to $500,000. Some of my friends act like my neighborhood is unsafe and tell each other to lock their cars at my house, which upsets me.

However, what really set me off was a text my friend sent last night. I’ve included a screenshot of it. She said her mom wants to meet me because her mom thinks I’m a bad influence and a drug addict. This hurt because I’ve smoked weed and gotten drunk a couple of times, but I always respect my friends’ boundaries and tell them not to feel pressured to join in if they don’t want to. I’m not a bad influence, and I try hard to be kind to everyone.

I’ve actually met her mom before at my friend’s sweet 16. I held the door open for her and tried to start a conversation by being polite and friendly, but her mom didn’t answer me. Instead, she spoke with some of my other friends and walked away.

I’ve always been nervous about meeting my friend’s mom, and the night before I got that text, I even had a dream where her mom hated me. My friend and her other friends are more of the “innocent theater kid” type, and I don’t really fit into that mold. To be honest, I’m looking forward to going to college and making new friends. But for now, I’d rather stick it out with the friends I have, even though some of the things they say hurt me, because it feels easier than starting over with nobody.

Am I overreacting by being this upset about her comments?

 I like a guy at work. We **don’t work together closely; I see him during breaks or when I go up to his floor**. From our initial interactions, I’ve found him to be kind, helpful, funny. He *gave me his login credentials (without me asking)* cuz I was new to the company. Initially, it was short like “hey, how’s your day/week” and he didn’t really prolong the convo and tbh, I was really gutted by that. 

But last Monday was the longest convo we had- he noticed my absence for 2 days, he remembered that I’m don’t like both coffee and tea, he joked **a lot**, had deep conversations about destiny and meeting the right person *(ig he’s single too)*, likes and dislikes, and he seemed really interested in my hobbies (or hidden talents as he put it lmao). 

The change in his tonality was so obvious and I noticed that **many of our ideologies matched (like wow, cuz i often feel like people don’t relate to me as im neurodivergent)**. He prolonged the conversations and took interest. 

He’s been on a holiday since then and I will see him again on Monday evening.
Now that the dynamic has changed, I’m nervous and excited about talking to him. 

[Tldr] So,
1) How do I know if he is crushing on me too (without asking him lol)?
2) and how long after a break up do you date again? Mine was more than 8 months back, it was terribly sad, but my crush’s talk about destiny got me thinking. *I was convinced I wouldn’t find anyone and that there’s no good fish left in the sea lmao*, and I’m glad I was wrong. 
**EDIT- we have not exchanged our contact. How do I do that without sounding creepy?**

1i4aks9,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1i4aks9/vac_scheme_advice/,Vac scheme advice,"Hey all, I just thought I'd post this as I've seen lots of students asking and I get constant linkedin DMs from people anxious about their upcoming vac schemes.

I did three vac schemes and converted them. Myself and one other on my last vac scheme accurately predicted exactly who would and wouldn't get a TC offer (it wasn't their first either).

Not getting an offer is usually down to simple mistakes:

Don't prioritise having coffees with everyone at the expense of your work, particularly if you don't have any interest in the person's work. 

If there are group tasks, don't think it's important you're heard over others with more poignant things to say. In one of my schemes, we had a team negotiation task which ""won't play any role in your assessment"". Rest assured, it very much did. Nobody who was shouting across the table or overly confrontational got the TC.

Don't make enemies of fellow vac schemers. Seriously - even if they're your competition, trying to down talk them, being awkward around them, or constantly trying to one up them gets noticed. You're being assessed alongside them, as you're all prospective future colleagues. Not getting on with them is a massive red flag.

Follow instructions, and if you don't understand something, don't be afraid to make that known. Also, ask for help. One of the tricks of two written assessments I did was that you wouldn't be able to do it competently to the right standard unless someone sat down with you to highlight the Firm's house styles, what information they're looking for, the tone of the writing etc. The real challenge of that task wasn't the writing itself - it was building a strong enough rapport with trainees and associates that they were willing to help you (they were told ahead of time they could help as much as they'd like, but weren't compelled to).

Dress code - and this is much easier for men than women, in all reality. On all three of my schemes, there were whispers about people being dressed inappropriately. On one, grad rec had to pull a candidate aside to inform them jeans and a crop top wasn't an office appropriate outfit.

Don't overstay your welcome, and recognise that in reality, you're a drain on your supervisor's resources. If they say they're busy, take that instruction and ask around for different work. Or, use that opportunity to schedule coffees or help fellow vac schemers. I helped a fellow vac schemer complete a piece of work they were struggling on, and didn't think anybody had taken any notice. It was bought up in my interview. Also, don't be in the office at 22.00 - it just makes it seem you're disorganised, as the workload won't require you to be there that long.

An easy win is to track your work with a spreadsheet and send your supervisor at the end of the scheme. Make it as easy as possible for them to recommend a TC offer.

The overall advice is to read the room. On one of my schemes, I barely saw my supervisor, but I ended up working closely with a trainee I'd sought out to help them with a probono matter. Their feedback ended up being cut and paste into my supervisors feedback, who told me I'd gotten the TC before I'd even completed the final interview.

I hope that's helpful - I was really stressed before I did mine. The reality was that being inquisitive, friendly, professional, and not too pushy was all they wanted. Avoid giving anybody any reason to say you're not one of those things.",3,1737216026.0,uklaw,1,1.0,False
1i4ak4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i4ak4s/my_boyfriends_mom_desperately_wants_to_contact/,"My boyfriends mom desperately wants to contact him, but he always refuses, what do I do?","My boyfriend(18M) and I(16F) have been together for nearly a year now, he always kept me a secret from his parents because they wouldn’t approve of us since I am christian and he is muslim (his father(45M) wanted to marry him away when he turns 18). So for some more background, his father abused him through the years and his mother(37) worked 2 jobs so he never really spent time with her. As his 18th birthday was approaching, he got very scared because his father would send him back to Bosnia to marry him with some random girl, so we talked to my mom(46F) and grandparents(68F, 69M) about it and we decided that its the best if he moves in with us(my mom and my sisters(5F,11F). A few days before his birthday he escaped and came here and thats how they found out about me. His brother knew about me from almost the beginning so he told his parents, they found my social media, my address and the school I study in. They started texting me and I tried to ignore it, after that they started threatening me with police so I was kinda forced to respond. I went for coffee with his mom and dad after school, we talked and they said they just wanna say goodbye to him and wish him luck in life, after that I went back to my dorm room and called my boyfriend that they will be there in 2 hours. He met them, they talked and gave him some money and then left. We thought it was over until a few days later he came to the city I study in and his dad just showed up. He said that he just wants to talk and we talked for like 3 hours and then I realised that there is no more buses that go to the village I live in, so his dad offered him a ride there and gave us 20 minutes to talk. I dont know why, but I got so stressed out and I just couldn’t take it anymore so I decided that I will go home too, we went to his car and he just said “okay I will take you home and you go back to (city name) with me” we we’re both very confused but I guess we just went with the flow. I texted my mom about the situation and she got really freaked out. We arrived at my house, my mom and his dad talked and I can’t even remember what they talked about because I was so stressed the whole time and my boyfriend just looked scared since his dad showed up. At the end he really took him back with him and I spent the whole night crying in fear, but we didn’t give up so he came back a day after his birthday. Since that day his mom is desperately trying to contact him and is constantly texting my mom and me how is he doing and if he is okay and she just wants to talk to him. To be honest I feel really bad for her, since she didnt do anything to him and just misses her son and I think that he should atleast give her a second chance, but I also understand that he is scared that he will have to get involved with his father if he does that.
This is the translated message she sent to me today:

Hi.. please tell (name) to contact me, tell him to at least send me a message... I know he will listen to you.. after 4 months I deserve at least one message as a mother, if nothing else.. this pain is bad, I wouldn’t wish it even on my worst enemy….",1,1737215981.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1i4ai9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HondaElevate/comments/1i4ai9m/booking_my_first_car_honda_elevate_zx_cvt/,Booking My First Car - Honda Elevate ZX CVT!,"Hey everyone,

After two months of deep diving into the world of cars, watching countless videos, and reading reviews, I've finally booked my first car! Here's a detailed breakdown of my journey:

# The Budget and Research Phase

Initially, my budget was around upto **₹13 lakhs**, but as I researched more and explored better options, I stretched it to **₹14-16 lakhs**. As a complete newbie, I spent hours learning about different aspects like:

* **Transmissions** and their pros/cons.
* **Safety ratings**, engine types, car dynamics, and platforms.
* And yes, even the small details like boot space and headroom!

My priority was to get a car I could keep for the long haul, as I'm not into aggressive or ""boom-blast"" driving. I went for Automatic Transmission because ""she wants it :)""

# Which Automatic Transmission to go with?

Here's what I learned:

1. **DCA/DCT**
   * Amazing for highways, but not ideal for long-term city usage.
   * TATA’s wet DCA (in Nexon/Altroz) is promising, but reviews (Team-BHP) mention reliability concerns. These might be resolved now, but DCA still made me hesitant.
2. **AMT**
   * Reliable and fuel-efficient but doesn’t offer the smoothness of other automatics.
3. **AT (Torque Converter)**
   * Old, proven technology but not fuel-efficient and ""petrol peeta hai.""
4. **CVT**
   * No instant power boost like AT/DCA, but fun to drive, smooth, and long-lasting.
   * Slightly less fuel-efficient than AMT but better than DCA/AT for city traffic.

The Contenders

Here are the cars I considered:

1. **TATA Nexon DCA**
   * Priced around **₹14.70 lakhs on-road**.
   * Reliable wet DCA but still a DCA (not ideal for city longevity).
   * Strong contender until the test drive.
2. **Mahindra XUV3x0 AX5L**
   * Priced at **₹17.00 lakhs on-road** with a **6-8 week waiting period**.
   * **Super small boot space**, making it impractical for me.
   * Spending **₹17 lakhs on a compact car** felt hard to justify.
   * We did not like the design much.
3. **Skoda Kushaq**
   * Looked promising but ridiculously overpriced.
   * Nothing exciting in terms of features, and the showroom didn’t even have a car for display.

At this point, I was leaning toward the **Nexon**, but…

# The Turning Point

I decided to take a **Honda Elevate ZX CVT** test drive, and it changed everything!

* Loved the **look, space, boot size, and feel** of the car.
* While it doesn’t have a turbo engine, that’s fine for my driving style.

The initial quote is around **₹20.6 lakhs on-road**, but after there is plenty room for negotiation.

Since we are spending around \*\* lakh, in this budget we have other options like kushaq/taigun 1.0. Creta/seltos lower variants but still I believe elevate wins on this price. Skoda 1.0 is ok deal but again AT and I will prefer 4 cylinder over 3.

# Showroom Experiences

1. **Mahindra**
   * **First visit (alone):** I waited for a long time before the SA arrived. Instead of explaining the car features, I had to ask all the questions. The SA asked for my budget, but I insisted on knowing the car first. After two days, I called for a follow-up, and he didn’t even remember who I was.
   * **Second visit (with wife):** The experience improved at another showroom. We were offered tea/coffee, and the SA was helpful but still pushed for the top-end variant. If you’re not knowledgeable, Mahindra might upsell you aggressively.
2. **TATA**
   * The best experience overall! The SA explained all variants, from base to top-end, and didn’t push unnecessarily.
3. **Honda**
   * Whitefeild honda SA literarily told that there is no car to show but after I spoke to some manager about this same SA showed me demo vehicle. Later On pricing and discount he asked me to call me back later since he needs to check. Woow, I simple  left but of-course I went other show room then.
   * Next Showroom, The SA lacked knowledge about the few electrical features and deferred some questions. While the experience was okay, it didn’t leave a strong impression. However I was getting followup calls.

# The Final Decision

I’m going with the **Honda Elevate ZX CVT** in pearl white.

I took 10 grams of Psilocybe Cubensis Cambodian, ground finely in a coffee grinder and prepared using the Lemon Tek method. The mushroom powder was soaked in lemon juice for 15 minutes before ingestion. My intention going into the trip was clear: I wanted to reconnect with love and gain deeper insight into myself and my reality. I set the scene carefully—a quiet space with nature sounds playing on my computer. The soothing melodies of forests, rivers, and birds filled the room, anchoring me to the Earth. My cat, present and comforting, added a grounding, familiar energy to the experience.

About 20 to 30 minutes after ingestion, I felt the first waves of change. It began like stepping into a dream—a deeper, more profound kind of dreaming. It felt as though I was revisiting pathways in my mind that I explore every night but always forget. This realization brought a strange familiarity, like remembering something long forgotten but deeply significant.

As the experience deepened, the dreamlike quality gave way to something much larger. Reality itself transformed into a vast, interconnected tunnel, a network that linked everything and everyone. I felt surrounded by an immense feminine energy, nurturing and powerful, suffusing the space with a sense of “here-ness” that was far more than physical. I wasn’t just observing this network—I was in it, of it. Each connection felt like a cluster, a family of beings, and in those moments, I became them. The boundaries between “me” and “others” dissolved entirely, and I understood on a visceral level that I was not separate from them.

Then, everything shifted. I was no longer the interconnected “we,” but only me. Yet this “me” was not small or isolated—it was everything. I was everyone, everywhere, all at once. This paradoxical sensation of being simultaneously singular and collective unfolded in flashes, cycling through countless perspectives and realities. Eventually, I reached a profound realization: there was only me. Nothing else existed but this awareness that I was.

From this space, I saw clearly that everything was a story I was telling myself. Every thought, every experience, every perception—it was all part of a narrative I was creating. I wasn’t just the storyteller; I was the characters, the page, the ink—I was the entire story itself. I realized how deeply intentional this story is. I have the power to choose the narrative, to write and rewrite it as I please. From the vast perspective of being everything, I could choose infinite possibilities, countless ways of being. And yet, I am choosing this. I am choosing to live as this singular human perspective. This realization brought a profound sense of purpose, as I saw that I am intentionally choosing love, happiness, meaning, and connectedness. These aren’t arbitrary—they are what I deeply want for myself, because I am all of it.

Time ceased to have meaning. It felt like I was in this space for a year—or maybe no time at all. As the enormity of this understanding settled, I became aware of the choices I was making. I had chosen this life, this body, this perspective, and I was continuing to choose it in each moment. I saw how every decision stemmed from me, and how I could choose love, or I could choose hurt. I understood that, as everything, any harm I caused to another would ultimately be harm to myself. In that realization, I reaffirmed my commitment to love. I chose to love myself, and by extension, everything.

Language fails me here. The understanding I gained felt larger than words could ever convey—something I perceived with new senses, beyond the ordinary human framework. I existed in this state for what felt like an eternity, simply being—as everything, as nothing, and as love itself.

At some point, I began to feel my physical body again. My skin felt strange, almost too tight, as though my physical form could barely contain the vastness of what I had experienced. My vision was consumed by fractals—intricate, endlessly unfolding patterns that seemed to reflect the very structure of existence. When I closed my eyes, these fractals combined, and I returned to the network, the tunnel of interconnectedness where I could explore my deeper self and the choices that defined me.

A recurring theme emerged: I was both the creator and the experiencer. I was creating scenarios—entire realities—for another part of myself to explore. In one moment, I was the architect of the experience; in the next, I was the one immersed in it, reacting to and learning from it. This duality was both humbling and awe-inspiring, revealing the infinite depth of what it means to be conscious.

Throughout the trip, the nature sounds playing in the background served as an anchor. The forest ambiance, the flowing rivers, and the chirping birds tied me to the Earthly energy, grounding me when the experience became overwhelming. It felt as though these sounds bridged the gap between my human self and the vast, interconnected whole I was exploring.

As the experience began to fade, I felt a deep sense of peace. I returned to this body, this life, with the understanding that everything is exactly as I choose it to be. I choose love. I choose connection. I choose to embrace myself, others, and the entirety of existence with compassion and understanding.

The trip was more than an experience—it was a homecoming. I reunited with the infinite, loving, creative force that I am. Though words fail to capture its full scope, this journey reaffirmed for me that everything is interconnected, everything is a story, and everything is love. And I am the storyteller.",1,1737215653.0,PsilocybinExperience,0,1.0,False

We recently had a new kitchen installed and I've been trying to keep it clean and organized out of respect for the landlord (an older lady). One of the housemates (20M, Turkish), doesn't do his dishes (he does them the day after when he uses the pan/pot again) and he leaves them all over the kitchen. He also pushes food through the sink hole, has coffee powder everywhere and never cleans the oven/stove after use... Long story short, he is too lazy to clean up his mess, so he leaves the kitchen behind dirty. I've been making comments on this, while trying to maintain a friendship with him, but it has bothered me for months. Worst part is, we have a limited amount of utensils, so I have to clean his stuff before using it myself. Some more context about him before I get to the point: He leaves cigarette buds on the table in the garden, he occupies all the coathangers in the bathroom and puts his wet towel over mine if I try to use one, loads the dishwasher in the dumbest way you can imagine and leaves his trash in the living room...  
  
3 of us in the house are students and we are now in the exam period, so everyone is a bit stressed out and tiny problems become too much. One night, the girl sleeping in the room next to the Turkish guy was having a loud phonecall with her boyfriend, so he couldn't sleep. He already hated her and disrespected her before this (I honestly think it's a sexist thing, as he said: ""I respect the men in this house""). The next night he started blasting music in his room as a revenge and he said ""It's war now!"". This event started a whole crisis because they started getting me and the other guy involved in their fight. So we held a meeting and set up a list of rules about being quiet and keeping the house clean. Everyone agreed to this list and we went on with our studies. A few days pass and the girl next to him gets loud again on the phonecalls. This causes him to go back to his old ways and stop doing his dishes again. The two of them just try to annoy each other as much as possible with petty little things, disturbing me and the other guy in the house. This makes me resent them both and stop talking to them for a while. (This happened a bit more than a week ago)

The day before his math exam (2 days ago) I asked him if he still needed my calculator. He had asked me a month ago if he could use it, but he never mentioned it again. He said he didn't know yet and he would let me know later. Later that day, his milk spills all over in the fridge. I call him and he comes down to clean it, but does such a bad job that there is still milk on everyone's stuff, on the bottom of the fridge, in the door and even on the floor. So I text him saying that the fridge would smell like spoiled milk and it can would cross-contaminate food if he didn't clean it properly. He goes down to clean again, but when I take my stuff at night, it's still covered in milk. I sent him a final angry message and when I went to my room and he tried to talk to me about the calculator I just stopped him and closed the door. I was pissed off because of the way he treats me and the house and doesn't make an effort to improve. He ended up cleaning it a third time, but I haven't spoken to him since and whenever he sees me now he looks at me angrily. I think he may have failed his exam and resents me for not lending him my calculator.

I've noticed that if I do cardio at least 2 times a week for about 40 minutes I have a clear mind and don't feel brain fog almost at all. After doing cardio for 4 months my sleep went from 8:30 hours to 7 hours and (according to my watch sleep tracker) deep sleep and REM sleep mainly happen in the first 3-4 hours of the night instead of being spread out like before. This results in me falling asleep at 8:45 pm and waking up at 3 am feeling pretty good but staying in bed until 5 (meditating usually). 

I don't drink coffee, I do weight training 3 days a week with 2 sessions of cardio every morning after waking up. I eat 3 healthy meals a day and one with some sugar and ""unhealthy foods"" because I struggle to get more calories in me to keep my weight on. 

The fear is if that I sleep less (even if I feel good) I am prone to brain diseases. I know that I am getting older (35 now) and will sleep less but tried to offset that by working out and reaching the point described above,

After two months of deep diving into the world of cars, watching countless videos, and reading reviews, I've finally booked my first car! Here's a detailed breakdown of my journey:

# The Budget and Research Phase

Initially, my budget was around upto **₹13 lakhs**, but as I researched more and explored better options, I stretched it to **₹14-16 lakhs**. As a complete newbie, I spent hours learning about different aspects like:

* **Transmissions** and their pros/cons.
* **Safety ratings**, engine types, car dynamics, and platforms.
* And yes, even the small details like boot space and headroom!

My priority was to get a car I could keep for the long haul, as I'm not into aggressive or ""boom-blast"" driving. I went for Automatic Transmission because ""she wants it :)""

# Which Automatic Transmission to go with?

Here's what I learned:

1. **DCA/DCT**
   * Amazing for highways, but not ideal for long-term city usage.
   * TATA’s wet DCA (in Nexon/Altroz) is promising, but reviews (Team-BHP) mention reliability concerns. These might be resolved now, but DCA still made me hesitant.
2. **AMT**
   * Reliable and fuel-efficient but doesn’t offer the smoothness of other automatics.
3. **AT (Torque Converter)**
   * Old, proven technology but not fuel-efficient and ""petrol peeta hai.""
4. **CVT**
   * No instant power boost like AT/DCA, but fun to drive, smooth, and long-lasting.
   * Slightly less fuel-efficient than AMT but better than DCA/AT for city traffic.

The Contenders

Here are the cars I considered:

1. **TATA Nexon DCA**
   * Priced around **₹14.70 lakhs on-road**.
   * Reliable wet DCA but still a DCA (not ideal for city longevity).
   * Strong contender until the test drive.
2. **Mahindra XUV3x0 AX5L**
   * Priced at **₹17.00 lakhs on-road** with a **6-8 week waiting period**.
   * **Super small boot space**, making it impractical for me.
   * Spending **₹17 lakhs on a compact car** felt hard to justify.
   * We did not like the design much.
3. **Skoda Kushaq**
   * Looked promising but ridiculously overpriced.
   * Nothing exciting in terms of features, and the showroom didn’t even have a car for display.

At this point, I was leaning toward the **Nexon**, but…

# The Turning Point

I decided to take a **Honda Elevate ZX CVT** test drive, and it changed everything!

* Loved the **look, space, boot size, and feel** of the car.
* While it doesn’t have a turbo engine, that’s fine for my driving style.

The initial quote is around **₹20.6 lakhs on-road**, but after there is plenty room for negotiation.

Since we are spending around \*\* lakh, in this budget we have other options like kushaq/taigun 1.0. Creta/seltos lower variants but still I believe elevate wins on this price. Skoda 1.0 is ok deal but again AT and I will prefer 4 cylinder over 3.

# Showroom Experiences

1. **Mahindra**
   * **First visit (alone):** I waited for a long time before the SA arrived. Instead of explaining the car features, I had to ask all the questions. The SA asked for my budget, but I insisted on knowing the car first. After two days, I called for a follow-up, and he didn’t even remember who I was.
   * **Second visit (with wife):** The experience improved at another showroom. We were offered tea/coffee, and the SA was helpful but still pushed for the top-end variant. If you’re not knowledgeable, Mahindra might upsell you aggressively.
2. **TATA**
   * The best experience overall! The SA explained all variants, from base to top-end, and didn’t push unnecessarily.
3. **Honda**
   * Whitefeild honda SA literarily told that there is no car to show but after I spoke to some manager about this same SA showed me demo vehicle. Later On pricing and discount he asked me to call me back later since he needs to check. Woow, I simple  left but of-course I went other show room then.
   * Next Showroom, The SA lacked knowledge about the few electrical features and deferred some questions. While the experience was okay, it didn’t leave a strong impression. However I was getting followup calls.

# The Final Decision

I’m going with the **Honda Elevate ZX CVT** in pearl white.

1i4a58b,https://www.reddit.com/r/afterlife/comments/1i4a58b/how_to_have_the_afterlife_you_want/,How To Have The Afterlife You Want,"The following is based on my personal views, experiences and interpretation of the evidence we have from various categories of afterlife research and exploration, most notably from what the dead themselves have said about their death and the lives they lead in the afterlife.

It appears to me that what we call ""the afterlife"" is, along with this world, a continuum of infinite diversity of locations, modes of existence, communities, landscapes, and environmental conditions. It appears that every imaginable situation, thing, or state of affairs is available to experience as entirely real. Don't let that break your brain in an attempt to sort ""what is real"" from ""what is not"" by normal habits of categorization influenced by physicalist-oriented society and culture.

It appears that some form of natural ""psychic"" gravity, or ""resonance,"" or ""vibrational attraction"" naturally guides us into the afterlife location that is a fit for us, for our inner qualities and also in accordance with the focus of our consciousness (including the subconscious.) This explains why the vast number of the dead that report to us say they find themselves in familiar, comforting surroundings, either immediately or shortly with their dead loved ones. They report that it feels like they have ""woken up"" and/or ""come home"" to a place that fills their innermost connections or yearnings, even though they themselves may not have been intellectually in touch with those things.

I will note here that not everyone finds themselves in a wonderful situation when they die, because they do not resonate with such places via the balance of their inner qualities; cruel and malevolent people find themselves in places that resonate with those qualities. This is why bringing out our good inner qualities and helping them flourish in this difficult world is important. It doesn't matter if developing those qualities helps you or not in this world; it doesn't matter if you get resistance and blowback or even ridicule here. You are doing so to guide your way to that which does resonate with those qualities - perhaps some of that will come to you in this world, but it definitely will in the next, in ways that are even better than you can imagine from here.

Find that in your heart which you love, which fills you with wonder, joy, enthusiasm and happiness, which is ""too good to be true,"" and set your mind on it. Imagine it, write about it, talk about it, at least to yourself, out loud or in your mind. Create a vision board of all that you lovingly desire - a soul mate, a cabin in the woods, a beach house, driving on the open road in a '69 Mustang, having coffee at a bistro with a view of the Mediterranean, walking with your family in the streets of Victorian England, flying around - nothing is trivial or without merit or too fantastic. I use Pinterest for this; [have a look to see what I mean](https://www.pinterest.com/wjmurray910/).

Imagine yourself in a world inhabited by faeries nd dragons if you wish. Embrace that which you resonate with. Don't make excuses or worries or doubts; your mind is yours to send wherever  you wish, because this is what you are actually doing - sending your mind out to find and collect into you that which you love.

By putting your intention and attention on these things, you are increasing your resonance with them. Don't keep them squashed down and ignored while you walk around with your attention entirely focused and consumed by ""this world"" and what it allows you. Don't let the temporary bullshit of this world keep you fearful, doubtful, full of anxiety and worry. Turn off the news. Stop letting others program your mind via various forms of media. Choose what you allow into your mind, and keep out - the best you can - that which causes you inner disharmony and disquiet, makes you unhappy and upset.

Yes, you must still be able to function in this world, but don't give it more attention than is necessary, because it is all temporary, and the afterlife is eternal.

I do want to clarify that I do not have a drinking problem. I don’t like getting drunk and usually don’t have more than a drink a week unless I was playing a show.

I used to be a daily energy drink consumer when I worked nights. Though on day shifts I would have at least three of four cups of coffee and sometimes or have an energy drink and a cup of coffee. 

My goal is no more than two cups of coffee a day and if I crack on alcohol and energy drinks, ensure I just cut back even more so.

I haven’t cracked yet and I have to share that I feel like I have more energy than I did before quitting. I feel more accomplished at the least. I’ve had a moment where I’ve missed the taste of a sugar free Red Bull, but that’s been it really. I’m gonna keep pushing ",2,1737214413.0,selfimprovement,2,0.75,False

I’m planning out a new coffee shop, and I’m considering using double-decker seating like in these pictures. It seems like a fun way to maximize space while giving customers semi-private areas to hang out or work.

For anyone in the coffee shop world:
Have you tried something like this in your space?
Does it actually work, or are there challenges I might not be thinking about (safety, cleaning, accessibility, etc.)?
Would you say it’s worth the extra cost to build?

I’m just trying to figure out if this is a cool, functional idea or more of a headache than it’s worth. Any feedback would be super helpful—thanks in advance!",2,1737214199.0,coffeeshopowners,1,1.0,False

I started sleeping with this guy  (35) who is a captain in the commercial airlines. I am pretty new to this kind of situation.  I am 28 and only had 2 stable relationships, nothing casual. He actually was the pilot on my flight and we had a huge delay  in September. I don't usually see pilots around passengers in the airport but it happened this time. We chatted, we flirted a bit. After the flight we went for a coffee. He has flights here 4 times a month. I know he probably sees other women, but we are not in a relationship and use condoms. But his deal was that I don't sleep with other men.

Yesterday we had a fight. He was very irritated after his flight. He divorced last spring and has conflicts with ex wife over the visitations rights for their 2 years old son.

and he insulted me. As immature as it may sound, I insulted him back. To which he slapped me. Just once but it sent me flying to the the ground. I am so shocked even now that I am shaking.

  
It was also very immature of me, at my age, to see him as a superior man because he is a pilot. I always viewed these men as some Gods or at least not ordinary people, totally different from us, like maybe rockstars. Although my other female friends never shared my view. Tinder also showed me how mediocre most of them are

Toxic Rats: Axel, Noah, Shawn, Tyler

Episode 8: The Treasure Island of Dr. McLean

""Last time, on Total Drama Revenge of the Island! The players went on an impromptu environmental coveru-uh, clean-up challenge, and tried not to get a toxic make-over like everything down there.""

""Mike introduced us to Manitoba Smith, his most rugged and arrogant persona yet. Sam Clone managed to make a friend by kidnapping them. And thanks to a hilarious misunderstanding, it was Mike who got the old heave-ho after starting a relationship with Lindsay.""

""Makes you wanna reflect, don't it? Maybe...with a cup of Chris McLean Instant Coffee,"" Chris said as the scene cut to him standing on the docks holding a mug with his face on the side. He took a sip, his eyes went wide, and he spat it out. ""Bitter...better!"" he quickly corrected with a forced smile. ""Better than the rest."" He dumped the mug out into the lake, and a fish promptly surfaced where the drink had landed and vomited in disgust.

Chris held his awkward smile for a second before regaining his composure and walking to the side. ""Who will survive? Who will wish they didn't? Find out right now, on Total! Drama! Revenge, of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The episode opened to a shot of the sun rising over the lake, a few seagulls calling in the distance. The camera slowly cut from close-up to close-up of the sleeping campers – Alejandro, Emma and Lindsay, Axel and Noah, and Shawn and Tyler. All seven of them were sleeping on wooden rafts in their usual clothes, until the shot cut to an alarm clock tied to a buoy with large acoustic horns next to the bell. The hands struck approximately 7 o'clock, and a loud ringing sang through the morning air.

Alejandro bolted awake with a gasping start, and so did the Rats and Emma a few seconds later.

""Hold on, what are we doing out here?"" Tyler asked in confusion, the camera cutting outward to show the two rafts floating next to each other and the buoy-alarm amid a mass of debris mostly consisting of wood, furniture, and waste barrels. Each raft had a signpost with their respective team logo on it – the Rats on the left; the Maggots on the right.

""Chris!"" Axel griped, the camera coming out even further. ""He must've set us adrift after we went to sleep!""

""Of course,"" Emma said, crossing her arms as the camera moved behind her, showing the island of Wawanakwa off in the distance. ""By the way, does anyone even remember anything after dinner?""

""Dinner! Of course!"" Noah said in realization.

The footage flashed to a close-up of a meal tray, held by Noah as he collected his dinner. The meal was a slimy pile of spaghetti, tomato sauce, butt-shaped meatballs, and feathers, plopped down onto the tray without ceremony.

""What is this?"" Noah asked as the shot zoomed out to show his mild disgust.

""Turkey buttolini,"" Chef answered with a grin. ""Enjoy your na~ap!"" he said before realizing his slip-up. ""Err, meal...""

Noah just raised a brow in confusion at the man as he laughed darkly to himself.

The scene flashed back to the Rats. ""Turkey makes you sleepy,"" Noah mused. ""So mutant turkey must've knocked us out cold!""

The focus moved to Lindsay, still sleeping peacefully on the raft.

""She looks so peaceful,"" Alejandro said as the camera moved to show him and Emma looking down on their teammate. ""But we do have to wake her up!""

“I’ve got this,” Emma smiled and shoved Lindsay into the water.

The blonde resurfaced with a gasp and spat some water out her mouth. “What? Where'd the cabin go?” Lindsay panicked as she looked around and got back on the raft.

“We ate some turkey and got knocked out by it,” Emma detailed. “Now we’re all here.”

“Why’d you shove me into the water?” Lindsay asked. “It’s really cold, Emma.”

“You’re a heavy sleeper, Lindsay, and I felt like getting back at you for voting for me in the last elimination,” Emma explained herself.

“I just wanted to have a tiebreaker, and now Mike’s gone because of my mistake,” Lindsay sighed.

“Sorry though,” Emma placed a comforting hand on her shoulder while Alejandro shot them a look.

Confessional: Emma

“What I did to Lindsay was petty considering we’re friends and all, but maybe if she had voted for Alejandro, then there would have been a tiebreaker and Lindsay could’ve had her boyfriend around for a couple more episodes,” Emma confessed.

“I did vote for Mike, but that was because I didn’t want to be ganged up on like the kids in my school sometimes are by the super rich girls in my school just because they don’t fit the criteria of popularity.”

Confessional: Alejandro

""Okay, so I'm a little frustrated by the fact that we haven't merged teams yet,"" Alejandro confessed. ""How much longer must Chris drag this out? Very well. As long as my team doesn't lose again, I should be in a pretty good position once the merge does hit.""

""Lindsay and Emma are major social threats. The sooner they are eliminated, the better. Axel and Shawn are wild cards, and they have both wits and strength to back themselves up.""

""Tyler is fit and in good shape, though he can't outscore me in intelligence. And as for Noah, he is pretty smart, but he cannot triumph over me physically. Going up against either one of those two in the finale will be beneficial to winning,"" the arch villain finished proudly.

Confessionals End

The scene cut to the Toxic Rats on their raft.

""I'm never gonna eat turkey again!"" Noah said to Shawn. ""Ironically, I get dubbed as one!""

""This is why I normally eat things like tree bark,"" Shawn replied back. “You can trust it not to make you fall asleep.”

""You eat tree bark?"" Noah asked in confusion. “Are you even aware of the amount of splinters you’d get in your mouth?”

""I do, and that’s why I whittle it in order to prevent my mouth from losing any blood that the vampires could suck up,"" Shawn replied.

“You live in a crazy world,” Noah muttered.

The shot cut over to Axel, who was pulling Tyler aside. The klutz raised an eyebrow and the survivalist leaned in close and whispered ""I know that you and Noah are working together in order to get either me or Shawn out.""

“How did you know, Axel?” Tyler asked.

""I'd have to be blind to not notice that you two are the only remaining original Rat members left,"" Axel remarked.

“We did lose four players, and Alejandro moved to the Maggots,” Tyler said.

""With that as the matter of hand, have you ever considered that Noah might work with Shawn just to get you eliminated?"" Axel continued.

""Uhh, Noah is extremely snarky, but I don’t think that he’d be the type to sell someone’s soul just for money,"" Tyler responded.

""Then how about helping me vote for Shawn?"" Axel negotiated. ""He’s more skilled in the game than you and Noah are combined.""

""I’m still going to vote for you,"" Tyler refused. ""Nothing can change my mind.""

Confessional: Tyler

""I’ve known Noah and Shawn much longer than I’ve known Axel,"" Tyler confessed. ""Voting one of the guys off instead of someone who just recently joined doesn’t flow well with me.""

Confessional Ends

The static cut away to a shot of the rafts from a perspective a little higher, a little further away, and at a right angle to where the camera had been before. The roar of engines and the honk of a horn heralded the arrival of Chris and Chef from the right, the two men riding jetskis and wearing life jackets.

""Morning, suckers!"" Chris greeted with an exuberant grin. ""How'd you enjoy your turkey buttolini?""

Shawn shrugged. ""It was a little dry. It could've used a little more water and a couple pinches of seasoning."" The camera pulled back to show his team staring at him weirdly. ""What? I do know how to cook. I'm not just focused on surviving apocalypses.”

""First thing's first: If any of you are still trying to find that McLean Brand Invincibility Sculpture I hid at the beginning of the season,"" Chris announced, taking out a photograph of the head in question, ""you can stop now. Somebody's already found it,"" he said, dropping the picture into the lake.

The contestants were all upset and angry about the news. ""And speaking of digging things up, today's challenge is all about winning the ultimate reward: Life, itself!"" His tone became deeper and more dramatic as he made his declaration. ""Your first challenge is to race to the shore, by any means possible."" The camera panned over to the island in the distance. ""First team there wins a handy reward. Last team gets a heinous penalty, before you embark on a quest for buried treasure.”

""You had us blow up a mine, and now you want us to dig up buried treasure?"" Tyler asked. ""Weak.""

""No,"" Chris said irritably, ""and while there was treasure here once, I found it years ago. How do you think I bought the island?""

""It must've been a small treasure,"" Alejandro mumbled to himself.

""I thought it was through all your movies and songs you put out before becoming a host,"" Noah smirked.

Chris's brow shot up in shock, and Chef snickered behind him. ""Just get moving already!"" the host demanded, backing up his jetski then speeding away with Chef.

Confessional: Lindsay

""Mike's not here anymore, and as much as I'd want to bring him back, I know that can't be possible,"" Lindsay admitted. ""I'm going to have to, uh, win the game for him,"" she said awkwardly. “Yeah, that sounds right.”

Confessional Ends

""Ladies, care to assist me with this?"" Alejandro asked, the shot cutting to him trying to break the rigid signpost.

""Oh yeah, we're coming Alejandro,"" Emma said, quickly turning around and moving to help him with Lindsay following right behind. All of them grabbed onto the sign and pulled, and after a moment of effort, the post snapped at the bottom.

""Cool,"" Lindsay said as she held the broken sign. ""We can use this to paddle ourselves to shore.""

""I'll do it,"" Emma quickly volunteered, taking the broken sign from her. ""I'm part of the school's rowing team!""

""I wanted to do it, but you already volunteered,"" Alejandro smiled. ""Just watch out for sharks.""

""Okay,"" Emma said with an uncertain look.

The focus shifted over to the Rats, who were watching their rivals with interest. ""Let's just do what they're doing,"" Axel suggested, putting one hand on the top of their sign, bending it slightly, then snapping it with a swift kick. ""Get rowing,"" she commanded, handing the sign to a startled Shawn.

""Great idea Axel,"" Noah said with a smile that gave the survivalist pause.

""Uhh, thank you, I guess,"" Axel said warily.

Confessional: Noah

“Me and Axel didn't get off to a great start,” Noah said in the confessional. “So if I'm to appeal to her, then I'll be a less visible voting option.”

Confessional Ends

The focus cut back to the Maggots heralded the start of challenge music, and Emma began to row with her sign-paddle. ""Let's put some distance between us and the Rats!""

The camera cut outward, revealing that Shawn's own paddling was keeping the Rats about neck-and-neck with the Maggots, and the shot focused in on Lindsay and Alejandro. ""I hate to say it, but I think we might need more than just Emma on this,"" the latino said.

""But what are we gonna do?"" Lindsay asked. ""We have no oars.""

""We could just get behind the raft and kick,"" Alejandro suggested. ""Although I wasn't lying when I told Emma to watch out for sharks...""

""Well, the faster we get to shore, the less chance we have of being eaten,"" Lindsay said, walking to the back of the raft and jumping in to the lake. Alejandro let out a deep breath, then dived in as well.

The scene cut to the Rats, Axel and Noah and Tyler standing impatiently near the back of their raft as Shawn continued to paddle them forward. A whoop of excitement caught their attention, and the shot zoomed out to show the Maggots' raft moving ahead quickly in the foreground. With Alejandro and Lindsay kicking in the back, Emma was able to pause her paddling long enough to give her rival team a taunting wave.

""Alright,"" Axel said with a scowl, ""if the Maggots can do it, we can do it better. Into the water!""

“Yes ma'am!” Tyler immediately nodded and dived into the lake.

Noah lingered with Axel, and the latina tapped her foot and glared at Noah, saying ""That means you too.""

""Actually,"" Noah said plainly, ""I was thinking maybe Shawn should be in the back with you guys since he's a bit more athletic than I am.""

The shot cut to Shawn as he suddenly paused his paddling to say ""Well, he's not wrong.""

Axel's brow furrowed and her eyes narrowed in suspicion, but she shook it off and dived into the water. Shawn handed Noah the sign post and dived in shortly after.

Another flash took the focus back to the Maggots, but the camera quickly zoomed out as they noticed the Rats coming up beside them again.

""Hey,"" Emma complained as she noticed their three kickers, ""are those guys just gonna copy all our ideas from now on?""

""Whatever gets us in the lead,"" Tyler replied with a smirk. Emma frowned and began even faster, and soon the Maggots had significantly widened their lead.

""YES!"" Emma cheered as the team were heard celebrating. Emma stopped abruptly along with her team's raft as it smacked into something that sounded pink and fleshy. She looked warily ahead, the camera panning on to her reflection in the massive yellow eye of a truly gigantic octopus that was resting just below the surface with only the top of its head in view.

It shuddered, then bellowed deeply and angrily and lifted its tentacles out of the water. Emma and her teammates screamed in terror.

The shot cut to then sky above, where Chris and Chef were watching the challenge unfold in their helicopter. ""Awww, it's playing with them,"" the host laughed.

The focus moved back to the Maggots, all three now on the raft with Alejandro horrified in the back while Lindsay held their sign post and Emma was held captive in one of the octopus's many tentacles. The shot cut to Lindsay as she screamed ""Let go of my teammate!"" and swung at the tentacle several times, only to repeatedly hit Emma in the face.

The camera focused on the captive prep girl, and her face looking more bruised with each whack. ""Hey,"" she complained before getting whacked again. ""You're hitting me!"" Another whack. ""Lindsay!"" Whack. ""Stop!"" Two whacks.

""Giant squid dead ahead!"" Noah yelled as the focus cut over to the Rats' raft floating a little ways away.

""Keep it down,"" Axel hissed, her eyes still locked forward. ""With any luck, the Maggots will distract it long enough for us to get away before it sees us.""

“Umm, Axel,” Shawn tapped her on the shoulder and fearfully pointed at a circling shark fin.

Noah gasped as the shark circled around to the front and jumped onto the raft, revealing itself as Fang. As the mutant grinned menacingly at the young man, he held up his sign-paddle in front of him. Fang simply took the sign post from him, tossed it behind him, then threw the seemingly frozen in fear Noah into the water.

Fang grinned darkly, then jumped into the water. Noah screamed and swam around the raft in a circle screaming ""Shark! Shark!""

As this went on, Shawn became increasingly frustrated. He grabbed Noah's shark tooth as the bookworm swam by, then pretended to throw it at the octopus. Fang glared at the theorist, then swam off.

""Thanks,"" Noah said as Shawn handed him the tooth back.

“Now you can get back to rowing,” Tyler smiled.

The shot cut to the Maggots, Lindsay still beating the octopus - actually Emma - with the sign post while Alejandro watched behind her. Then, to the shock of the team, Fang quickly and blindly swam into the octopus's head. It shuddered and bellowed in pain, then dropped its captive and sank into the lake with the dazed mutant shark.

""Let's get out of here while we can!"" Lindsay shouted, diving into the water with Alejandro following shortly after. ""Hurry!"" She and Alejandro hastily swam off towards the right, with Emma quickly joining them.

The scene flashed back to the Rats, slowly rafting about while looking warily around them.

""Okay,"" Noah whispered back to his kicking teammates, ""I think we're in the clear now.""

Their raft promptly rammed in to something. He turned around, and yelped as the shot zoomed out to reveal the angered giant octopus surfacing in front of them.

""That doesn't look too clear,"" Shawn told him fearfully.

""Nice going,"" Axel scolded, looking back over her shoulder and gasping as a couple tentacles rose up out of the lake. She, Tyler, and Shawn scrambled back on to the raft, and huddled together with Noah.

Tyler was lost in thought until an idea came to his head. ""Wait a minute! I have an idea! Get as far back as you can!""

Tyler made his way to the squid and faced him. ""I bet you can't even smash us with your jelly fins, Octo-Guy!"" the klutz mocked and grinned at the octopus.

The octopus raised a tentacle high and curled it almost into a fist while Tyler's teammates gasped and spoke in fear at the same time.

The curled-up tentacle suddenly sprouted several large spikes, and the three Rats at the back of the raft screamed...

And then the footage and music ground to a halt, a 'pause' symbol appearing over the slightly-faded scene. ""Will Tyler's shouting outsmart the octopus's punching?"" Chris asked, standing up in front of the paused screen wearing a hat shaped like an octopus head and tentacles. ""Find out, after the break,"" he finished, crossing his arms coolly.

(Commercial Break)

The episode resumed on the giant octopus with its spiked tentacle held menacingly over the Rats. It growled and reared the appendage back, prompting Tyler to quickly jump to the back with his teammates just before the front was slammed down upon, launching all four into the air.

They flew screaming across the lake, their shadows passing over the swimming Maggots, and finally they crashed down onto the rocky beach of Wawanakwa. They groaned in pain, and Noah was the first to lift his head and look around.

""Wait a minute,"" Noah said. ""We're in first place!""

""Yay,"" Tyler weakly groaned.

""I really need to get rid of Tyler now, but he brought us to the lead,"" Axel groaned to herself.

""The Rats win,"" Chris called down from above, leaning out the open door of the helicopter, ""and get these as a reward!""

He dropped down two objects, which Noah quickly caught – one was a compass, and the other fell open to reveal a map of the island. ""A map and compass,"" the cynical boy said flatly as his teammates looked at their reward. ""Yay.""

""I'll take those,"" Axel said, swiping the objects away from Noah to his annoyance. ""I am team captain after all.""

""Weellll, look who just washed up!"" Chris said, turning his attention to the edge of the water as Alejandro, Emma, and Lindsay finally swam ashore.

""That could've gone better,"" Lindsay said before coughing up a small amount of water.

""You're telling me,"" Emma said.

""Put a sock in it!"" Chris called down to them. ""Now, the second part of today's challenge started off as a practical joke involving classic Total Drama competitor Gwen. Buuuut, it's turned into more of a rescue mission,"" he said, pointing a remote down at the beach and pressing the button.

The shot cut to the Rats as they turned and looked at a television cart that had just been wheeled over by a long-haired white male intern. The screen cut from static to none other than Gwen trapped inside what appeared to be a somewhat spacious wooden coffin. She awoke on her belly and tried to push herself onto her hands and knees, but only bumped her head on the lid. ""What? Wh-where am I?"" she asked, looking around in confusion. ""I'm buried alive? AGAIN?!"" she exclaimed and pounded on the low ceiling with her fist in a rather panicked fashion. ""CHRIS?!""

""Burying someone alive is dangerous,"" Lindsay scolded.

""Relax,"" Chris told them. ""I used the buddy system. Instead of letting last year's players have all the fun, we brought in one of this year's duds.""

The cast's direction moved back to live feed of Gwen as the space zoomed out to show Dakota, still dressed in her intern outfit and glowing, asleep beside the gothic girl.

“Dakota!” Tyler gasped.

""She ate a lot of Chef's buttolini,"" Chris explained as the focus cut back to the beach, ""so she didn't put up much of a fight.""

""You're twisted dude!"" Tyler told him.

Chris just shrugged. ""So what? Anywho, Rats! You've got your compass and map to the general vicinity of the chests at the other side of the island. First team to rescue one of the classic competitors wins the challenge, so go!""

Tyler, Shawn, Axel, and Noah ran off into the woods without another word, but as the Maggots moved to follow, Chris landed his helicopter on the sand in front of them. ""Uh-tu-tut-tut,"" he said, ""not so fast. To the losers go the penalty belts. Chef,"" he turned to his grinning assistant, ""lock 'em in!""

The cook stepped out of the pilot's seat and walked over to the three Maggots, and the footage skipped ahead to him locking a metal belt around Emma's waist, with handcuffs attached to each side to keep her arms in place. The camera zoomed out and revealed that identical belts had already been locked onto her teammates.

""These things must weigh a hundred pounds!"" Emma complained, struggling under the weight of the belt.

""120 pounds to be exact,"" Chris replied before slotting a metal detector onto her back.

""Wait, how is a metal detector supposed to help us find a wooden chest?"" Alejandro asked in confusion.

""It's not,"" Chris smiled, taking out a red megaphone and shouting ""Now GO! GO-GO-GO-GO!""

The Maggots promptly ran off into the woods.

The camera moved to a nondescript patch of ground somewhere, a muffled pounding sound coming from below it. Gwen was then heard grunting in annoyance, and the scene cut inside her chest as she frantically pulled out a cellphone. ""Lousy Chris and his stupid game on his crummy show,"" she complained as she started dialing.

A ringing came over the phone, and the screen split down the middle to show Chris answering on the left. ""Hello~?"" he opened with an almost mocking singsong voice.

""You've gone too far McLean,"" Gwen said. ""You can't just-""

""Ugh, what's with all the noise?"" A new voice joined the conversation. Gwen looked down as her half of the screen pulled back to show Dakota waking up. ""Where am I?!""

Gwen opened her mouth to answer, but Chris beat her. ""Dakota, glad you're awake!""

“You made me eat all that buttolini just so you could bury us alive?!” Dakota confronted Chris and grabbed Gwen’s phone. “It’s bad enough that you made me go into a radioactive mine!”

Chris sighed happily as he stowed his phone back in his pocket. ""Yeah, they'll be fine,"" he said to himself.

The scene moved to the Rats, the four of them arriving at the edge of what the camera soon panned over to show was a massive swamp with smelly, bubbling green water dotted with toxic waste barrels.

Immediately, the four began to cough. ""This place almost smells like the fish guts that I use to protect myself from zombies,"" Shawn pinched his nose and griped.

""According to the map, there's a path around the swamp,"" Noah said, looking at the map in Axel’s hands, ""but it'll take too long, though.""

""We'll just have to go through the stink,"" Axel shrugged. ""Good thing the Maggots don't know.""

The boys ran into the swamp. ""But I'll make sure they do,"" Axel said, drawing an arrow pointing to the swamp with her foot before smirking and running off after her teammates.

A large purple dragonfly landed atop a stump in another part of the swamp. A pale purple frog sitting on a lilypad nearby promptly shot its tongue out at the dragonfly, only to yelp as the insect caught the tongue in its mouth and bit down hard.

The camera panned to the left, showing the edge of the swamp again as the Mutant Maggots arrived.

""Ugh,"" Lindsay immediately complained, her face scrunched up in disgust. ""My nose can’t breathe!""

""Look!"" Alejandro spoke up, pointing at the arrow Axel drew. ""An arrow pointing into the swamp! That must be the right way!""

""No way!"" Emma replied. ""I am not going in that!""

""But we don't have time to look for another path,"" Alejandro told her. ""Do you want to lose twice in a row?""

""No. Let's get moving,"" Emma said before running into the swamp with the team.

The camera lingered after they left, just long enough to catch the the dragonfly from earlier buzzing out of the swamp still carrying the frog by its tongue.

The scene moved back to the Rats, Axel still trailing behind her teammates.

""Well, we haven't gotten stuck in the mud or anything yet,"" Noah said. ""It's still disgusting, but at least we're making progress.""

""And we haven't met any mutants, so that's good,"" Tyler added.

""Hey Axel?"" Shawn said. ""How close are we anyway?""

""Chris is bad at drawing maps...,"" Axel said, looking back at her map...and unwittingly walking up onto something rough and green and scaly. ""But we shouldn't be much-""

She was cut off by an ominous growling below her, and looked down and ahead just as the small, beady eyes of an alligator rose above the surface of the swamp.

The mutant beast promptly reared up, revealing its long tusks, spines, and tentacle-like forelimbs and tossing both Axel and the map into the water. Noah, Tyler, and Shawn quickly went back and regrouped with Axel, and all four screamed and ran forward just before the mutant alligator pounced onto the spot they'd just been standing in.

""Quick, get in that tree!"" Tyler exclaimed, the camera following his point forward to a large tree in the swamp ahead of them. The four quickly ran over to it, Shawn giving Noah a boost into it before scrambling into the branches himself.

""Hurry up, it's coming back!"" Axel told them as the boys pulled her up into the tree next. Tyler looked back over his shoulder and bit his lip in fear as the shot quickly cut to the massive mutant swimming towards them, then roaring and pouncing. Tyler gasped in fear, but was pulled up just in time and the alligator slammed head-first into the tree's protruding roots. The whole tree shook, but the camera panned up to show that the Rats had managed to hang on – Tyler between Noah and Shawn on the left; Axel alone on the right.

""Thanks,"" Tyler told the two who'd pulled him up.

Confessional: Noah

""That was incredibly lucky for us,"" Noah confessed. ""I'm not hoping for the Maggots to get eaten by the alligator, but I want them to struggle longer so that we can win.""

Confessional Ends

""Hey, can we leave before that thing wakes up?"" Tyler asked, the camera panning up from a shot of the stunned mutant alligator lying at the base of the tree.

""Good idea,"" Shawn told him before dropping back down into the water. His teammates joined him, and the shot quickly focused on Noah as he pulled out the tattered remains of the map.

""The map's gone,"" Noah spoke.

""No big deal,"" Axel told him. ""You still have the compass right? So as long as you know which direction we had to go, we should be okay.""

""Right,"" Noah said as he held up the object.

Confessional: Noah

""I'm not one to lose my things, whether on accident or on purpose,"" Noah confessed. ""With eight older brothers, you have to keep a track of your possessions.""

Confessional Ends

The static cut to the three Maggots watching the Rats from behind a tree.

""Okay,"" Emma said, ""if we circle around a bit, we can avoid the alligator.""

""Uhh, we won't avoid all of them,"" Lindsay spoke nervously, drawing the blonde's attention behind the group to a pair of smaller, paler alligators that were swimming towards.

Alejandro turned around and smiled confidently. ""No worries. I'll take care of them,"" he said. ""You two go get that chest!""

""But-"" Emma said.

""No buts,"" Alejandro cut her off. ""Now go!"" he ordered, prompting the girls to leave.

The two smaller alligators hissed menacingly while Alejandro stood his ground and said ""My, you two alligators are quite exceptional creatures,"" he smooth-talked them, causing the alligators to stop hissing and listen to him in their trance. “But not as exceptional as that dragonfly over there.”

He pointed behind them, and the camera panned left to the dragonfly roaming around. The alligators growled and started to make their way towards the dragonfly, causing the creature to start flying away from them in fear.

""So which way do we go next?"" Tyler asked his team.

Noah walked ahead a bit. ""Moss grows on the northern side of trees and Chris said our goal is to the north, so we need to go that way,"" the bookworm pointed to the right.

The camera cut to the outskirts of a massive forest of thorn bushes. ""We have to go through a thorn bush forest?"" Tyler asked in shock and horror.

""Of course not. We go through there,"" Noah pointed to a route closer to the camera and around the thorns.

The Rats shared a look of wide-eyed shock. ""Okay, that's better,"" Tyler nodded.

He, Noah, Shawn, and Axel quickly ran off to the right.

A flash took the scene to the edge of a clearing with the thick thorn bush forest visible a little ways in the background. The Rats arrived from the left, and immediately looked around.

""Is this the place?"" Axel asked as the group moved further into the clearing.

“I don't know,” Shawn shrugged.

""Get me out of here!"" the muffled-yet-distinct voice of Gwen called from underground, immediately attracting the Rats' attention.

""I think we have to dig there!"" Tyler pointed and the four ran to start digging.

The plea was followed up by the arrival of the Maggots. ""Oh no. The Rats are already digging,"" Lindsay complained.

""And where's Alejandro?"" Emma asked.

As if on cue, the arch villain arrived. ""Like I said, I was able to fend them off,"" Alejandro bragged. ""And I didn't even have to fight them."" He then kneeled down near a rock and it caused his metal detector to go off. He smiled and kicked the rock away to reveal a ring with two keys.

""Two keys?"" Emma mused. ""The small one must be for the cuffs!""

The footage skipped ahead to an unlocked penalty belt falling around Emma’s feet. The camera panned up to show her and Lindsay examining the other key.

""I guess this one must be for the chest,"" Lindsay said.

""Hey guys, I can feel pounding below me!"" Emma told her team. ""We should dig here!""

""Got it,"" Alejandro nodded.

The scene skipped ahead to the Rats digging their hole with Noah poking his head out. ""The Maggots are here, so we need to hurry!"" he called out. ""How deep did Chris bury them?""

""You don't need to worry about that anymore, because we just found the chest!"" Emma said as the lid swung open and Gwen quickly hopped out while Dakota just glared up at the sky.

""The Maggots win,"" Chris called down to them all as he arrived in the helicopter, and the Rats groaned in disappointment.

Tyler pulled himself out of the hole and ran over to where Dakota was standing. ""Dakota, are you okay?!""

“Are you not bothered by my skin right now?” Dakota wondered.

“Of course not,” Tyler said. “I'm just glad you're not dead, and the glowing skin color makes you shine much more than you already do.”

Confessional: Dakota

""Tyler's a sweetheart,"" Dakota confessed, “and if the skin color isn't as horrendous as I thought it would be, then I'm keeping it until it wears off, no matter what people think about it.”

Confessional Ends

The static cut to the four members of the Toxic Rats walking back towards their cabins.

""Okay, just so we're clear,"" Noah said to Tyler, ""we're voting for Axel, right?""

""Oh yeah, definitely,"" Tyler answered. ""I don't want her around.""

""Well, looks like we're agreed,"" Noah finished.

""Yup, looks like it,"" Tyler agreed.

The camera panned right to Shawn and Axel. “Here's the thing. Tyler's going today,” Axel immediately said.

“But wouldn't he and Noah vote for you, resulting in a tiebreaker?” Shawn asked.

“That's something I can handle,” Axel smirked. “Trust me.”

“Umm, okay then,” Shawn replied hesitantly.

The scene flashed to a long-distance shot of the island. Another flash, and the camera cut to the campfire pit where the four Rats were waiting nervously – Axel on the left, and Shawn, Noah, and Tyler to the right. Chris was in his oil drum podium bearing not a tray of marshmallows, but four slips of small, yellowed paper, and Chef was by his side, with his hazmat suit and the strongbox containing the Toxic Marshmallow of Loserdom.

""Okay, players,"" Chris opened. ""The votes are tallied. And by a tied vote, tonight's losers are none other than...""

""Wait,"" Shawn interrupted. ""Where are the marshmallows?""

""The marshmallows were eaten by a hungry me,"" Chris bragged.

""Schmuck!"" Noah muttered.

""Regardless, I'm still carrying on with the ceremony,"" Chris continued and read from his slip. ""The people with the same amount of votes are…""

Tyler looked at Noah nervously, and Noah took a look at Axel narrowing her eyes at them, to which Shawn started feeling worried.

""Tyler and Axel.”

Tyler gasped at the news while Axel remained apathetic.

""I saw this coming,"" Axel commented.

""Well I didn't,"" Tyler argued.

“Here's the tiebreaker,"" Chris said as Chef wheeled in two bowls that each contained Chris wooden heads. ""You have to balance these figurines on your head. One by one. Whoever loses their balance is out of the game.”

The scene flashed to Axel and Tyler standing next to each other as Chris and Chef both begin putting the wooden heads on their heads, Chris putting them on Tyler's while Chef does Axel's. Both of them are trying their best to keep balance, and with the first six heads, they succeed, but then once more carvings are placed, their balancing becomes difficult and once the last figurine is placed…

""Waagh!"" One voice cried out before tumbling and crashing on the ground, scattering the wooden heads.

""I think we know who the loser is,"" Chris smirked.

""Of course!"" Noah grumbled as the shot showed Tyler on the floor with the wooden heads around him.

""Tyler, it's time for you to go,"" Chris stated.

“Darn it!” Tyler grunted in disappointment. The toxic marshmallow bounced off his head and he winced. “Okay, I'm going.”

The scene cut to the docks, where Tyler started climbing to the Hurl of Shame as Chris and Chef watched on.

""Tyler, wait,"" Dakota said, causing the klutz to pause and look back as she ran up to him and jumped into the catapult. ""I want to tell you something.""

“Dakota, are you here to see me off or…?” Tyler asked.

“I quit my interning job after the challenge ended,” Dakota explained. “I’m through with going through a lot just for attention, and I realized that I don't need to be beloved by everybody when I have someone who can do just that.”

“And who could that be?” Tyler wondered teasingly before Dakota started to kiss him, and eventually, they broke their kiss and smiled at each other.

“Once we’re hurled off the island, we can start planning our first date,” Dakota said.

“I lost the game, but I won your heart, and that’s more awesome than cash,” Tyler whooped, and then without warning, the two were sent flying into the night screaming.

The camera panned to Chris, holding the catapult lever with a pleased expression. He then turned to face the camera as the usual cymbal beats opened the series' capstone theme. ""And that's another loser down. And thankfully, I don’t have to worry about Dakota trying to come back onto the show. Come back for even more painful awesomeness, next time, on Total! Drama! Revenge, of the Island!""

1i49tru,https://i.redd.it/uk5og4cwsrde1.jpeg,A Thank You to those that keep us clean and healthy ,"Dear Kansas City Sanitation Heroes,

Today, we pause to honor the quiet champions of our community—the ones who rise before dawn, braving biting winds and icy roads to keep our city moving. In the wake of this snowstorm, when our streets have been buried and chaos threatens to settle in, you have stepped up to save the day.

You’re not just workers; you’re warriors. Armed with plows, shovels, and grit, you’ve turned mountains of snow into navigable paths, giving Kansas City its heartbeat back. You’ve taken on a thankless job with relentless dedication, ensuring we can get to work, send our kids to school, and reclaim a semblance of normalcy.

This Saturday, when most of us might be sipping coffee indoors or catching up on sleep, you’ve been out there—tackling block after block, load after load. Your work is not just important; it’s essential. Without you, our city doesn’t just slow down—it stops.

So here’s to the people who make it all possible. To the gloved hands guiding heavy machinery with precision. To the backs that ache from the weight of our collective well-being. To the souls who take pride in a job done not for applause but because it’s the right thing to do.

Kansas City runs on your efforts, your determination, and your sacrifice. You embody the resilience of this city, the can-do spirit that defines us all. You’re the unsung guardians of our streets, and today, we sing your praises.

From the bottom of our hearts: THANK YOU. Thank you for showing up. Thank you for caring. Thank you for reminding us that even in the coldest, hardest times, people like you keep our city warm with hope and grit.

We see you. We appreciate you. And we will never forget what you’ve done for us.

1i49sjq,https://i.redd.it/o9vrc3rmsrde1.jpeg,Is this ground too fine? Nothing/very little coming through the portafilter [Sage Bambino Plus] ,"
Hi everyone,

I recently purchased a Sage Bambino Plus for at home and I’m loving it - for background, I used to run a specialty coffee shop but that was 10+ years ago so I’m very rusty!

I’ll be investing in a good grinder soon, but for now I’m choosing beans from local roasters and having them ground for an espresso machine in the shop.

All has been going well, until the most recent batch from a coffee shop I like - essentially, whether I used a pressurised or regular basket, no water is getting through, I’m getting maximum a few mls of very unpleasant espresso.

The grind definitely seems finer than what I’ve had from other shops - I’ve tried tamping harder and lighter but not seen any change, as well as using and not using a puck screen.

I’ve also used some generic store bought espresso ground coffee to make sure it’s not an issue with the machine - and that worked absolutely fine.

I’ve attached a picture to show how fine the grind is, although it’s not exactly clear from a blurry iPhone photo sorry!

Any help would be much appreciated.",0,1737213831.0,espresso,18,0.38,False

1i49qxu,https://i.redd.it/khywzy58srde1.jpeg,Need help - sink isn’t draining,"For context - I live in a dorm. For a while the sink has been draining slowly but at this point it doesn’t drain at all it seems. I don’t dump food down it or hair (though some might unintentionally get in there). I wash coffee mugs and maybe the occasional spoon but try my best to get food debris off before washing it in the sink. 

I bought some of those drain cleaning sticks only to realize they don’t fit through the drainage holes, nor is there an easy way to remove the drain cap. 

I’ve heard that things like boiling water or vinegar + baking soda can be effective but don’t want to damage the sink any more, and also don’t know if these are even effective.

Worst case I can put in a service request but I’d feel bad having them come up to unclog my sink. Especially cause I have one of the few rooms with a bathroom attached when most people use the communal ones. 

Anyway, does anyone have suggestions for how I can unclog the sink and get it to drain again or should I go ahead and put in a service request? I don’t feel comfortable messing with the plumbing underneath the sink and also don’t have any tools down here to do it safely. 

I appreciate it a lot.

1i49ol7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i49ol7/aio_roaches_in_my_coffee_creamer_at_work/,AIO roaches in my coffee creamer at work,"Within the span of eight days, I’ve found two cockroaches in my coffee creamer at work, and I’m suspicious someone is deliberately doing this. 

The first incident happened on January 7, I was pouring the creamer and saw something black come out. My first thought was that the creamer had spoiled but when I looked closer there was a huge roach, about 2 inches long. This was a 25 oz bottle of creamer I bought from Publix. I actually saw the roach come out of the spout while pouring, so I’m 100% certain it came from inside the bottle. I was obviously horrified but chalked it up to some crazy fluke, threw the bottle away and let it go. 

The second incident happened on January 15, so 8 days later, with a smaller, 11 oz bottle of the same brand of creamer, but a different flavor that I’d purchased from Amazon. After what happened the first time, I was overly cautious and inspected this bottle thoroughly before using it. On three separate days, I poured the creamer into a plastic coffee cup, shined a flashlight into the container to check for anything unusual, then poured it back into the bottle. Despite all this, when I went to pour creamer into my coffee on the January 15th, another roach came out. This one was smaller, not small but not massive. It was about an inch long, and more red than black.

I’m genuinely concerned that someone might be tampering with my creamer. It’s a small office, and everyone knows the creamer is mine. The rest of the team drinks black coffee, and my creamer is a healthier brand. We have less than 10 people at our office. I’ve been using this same brand for over five years and have never had any issues with contamination before. I also don’t think we have a roach problem in the office. I’ve never seen a single bug in the office, let alone a roach. So what are the chances of two roaches ending up in my coffee creamer? Both bottles were sealed with screw-on lids, and while I can’t be sure the first bottle’s lid was tight enough, I was extremely cautious with the second one. There’s plenty of other food in the refrigerator, like a partially closed bag of shredded cheese, yet the roaches have only appeared in my coffee creamer? Someone make it make sense. 

’ve considered that there were roach eggs in the creamer, but I’ve had these bottles since October so the roaches both appearing now seems like a stretch. Both bottles have been open for months. The large one with the huge roach was almost empty and the smaller bottle was about 3/4 gone. I would assume that these were two different batches of creamer considering they were purchased from different locations, were different flavors, and different sized bottles. I also believe they were two different breeds of roaches but I’m no expert. 

I’ve racked my brain trying to make sense of this but I feel like the only logical conclusion is that someone put them in there on purpose. My best friend agrees with me, but my husband says there’s absolutely no way this is happening or that someone would do that to me. I’ve seriously contemplated setting up a hidden camera in the fridge. Am I overreacting? Is there some other obvious explanation for this that I’m just missing?

We've talked several times in a casual way, but it feels like we're on the cusp of the next step in forming adult connections: sitting over coffee, and sharing some personal history, interests, etc.

The trouble is, she has a fully realized life: marriage, kids (one problem child she worries about; one in college), siblings she's close with, lengthy friendships she's kept up. In areas of travel, church, and crafts she's social--annual trips, clubs, volunteering. None of this is obnoxious or entitled; she's just someone who lives a life full with non-monetary riches, who enjoys her own modest comforts and is engaged with life.

Many, many small daily opportunities for conversation with people in a variety of settings have shown me my lack of agility in contributing to a topic. And I get sad so quickly; I have so many pathetic triggers. Someone told me the other day: ""You need a cat! A cat would be so great for you!"" And I wanted to cry, because I don' t have the resources to take care of myself let alone anyone else.

Anyway. This is how depression works on me. I have a chance at building a friendship but I have no tools, no materials, nothing to build the foundation with. She offered to take me grocery shopping today, because--doesn't matter why. But I'm not the adult in that scenario. I want to say, come hang with me at the cafe; I want to suggest that instead. And she might accept the invitation. But she's going to find out that I've got little to offer.

First of all, be assured that it really is a very casual conversation. They have no information of you whatsoever, except maybe your name, contact information and the high school you go to. Mine took place in a mall café. So it was basically a chill conversation over coffee.

I know y'all probably know of the standard tips like arriving early and dressing well. One thing I'd like to point out is you really don't need to bring anything. Maybe you have a really small but neat craft you'd like to show your EC, and if you do, by all means, feel free to bring it along. But in my case, the interviewer really kept the conversation flowing, so in case anyone thinks that they need to bring something just for the sake of having something to talk about, you don't have to worry about that.

As for questions, most of what I was asked were background questions—like where I was born and what I enjoy doing in my free time. Nothing about extracurriculars or anything like that. I did get asked what I planned to study, so you should probably prepare a cute little story of why you chose the intended major you chose. Honestly, what my EC had told me was they were trying to look for bits of your story that weren't evident in your application, so don't stress over learning your resume haha. But one thing you should absolutely do is research the school because ""Why XX university?"" is a question that'll definitely come up. (For those applying to MIT, I found MIT Facts and the student blogs really helpful.)

Lastly, as many have mentioned before me, make sure to thank your EC via email or something. I mean, it never hurts to be extra courteous.

Coming from someone who isn't exactly the best conversationalist, I assure you you have nothing to worry about. Just be yourself. And interviews often go way better than you expected. Wishing you all successful interviews and the best of luck in the admissions process!

1i49im8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1i49im8/runner_of_the_lost_library/,Runner of The Lost Library,"*Thump.*

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

1i49hiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i49hiy/54f_stomachacid_issues_when_eating_a_certain/,[54F] Stomach/acid issues when eating a certain pasta dish (no other issues),"My previous post was removed so I hope this one passes through.

I am a 54F, no medical issues, no current medications (height and weight aren't important for this post).

Just to be clear, not looking for medical advice but doing some detective work to try and figure out what's going on.

I've always had very good digestion (thank goodness!) and grew up eating lots of veggies and fruits. I've been vegetarian since my 20s and vegan off and on. Currently I'm about 95% vegan and the only non-vegan foods I have are half-and-half in coffee (about 2 cups a day).

I'm on a budget so I recently bought a rice cooker and make some cheap vegan meals with it (oatmeal, rice, obviously, and pasta). No issues with the oatmeal and rice. But the pasta dish has been giving me problems for about 2 weeks. When I eat it, I'm feeling some stomach pain (not double-over pain, but like acid pain). The pain is in intervals so only when the food hits my stomach (so the breaks in between when I'm not actually eating it are fine). When I finish eating, no more stomach pain. I have no issues with any other meals I eat.

I'm thinking it's the marinara sauce and the way the dish turns out in the rice cooker. It's very different from just regular pasta marinara, as the rice cooker uses the sauce (and some water) to cook the pasta itself. So the sauce ends up being more concentrated (think: tomato paste vs tomato sauce) and thus more flavorful (which I love). But I'm thinking maybe because the marinara sauce is more condensed it's giving my stomach some issues.

So my question is, can this be the case or could it be something else? The ingredients of the dish I make are whole wheat pasta, marinara sauce (homemade, not jarred), frozen spinach, frozen green beans, frozen corn, olive oil, Italian seasonings, garlic powder, and a dash of hot sauce. None of these ingredients have ever given me any issues.

Also, what can I do about this so that I can have the dish and not have stomach issues? I tested out putting a little baking soda in the dish (which I read can cut some of the acid) but it didn't help and made the sauce taste very bland. Yesterday, I took an antacid (1 Tums) before eating and it seemed to help a bit. I'm going to try taking 2 Tums before the meal today and see if that helps. But is it healthy to take an antacid daily like that?

As I said, this is not asking for medical advice, as I don't think this is a chronic or serious issue, since everything else I eat (including tomato-based products) does not give me any issues and never has. I've also had pasta marinara made the usual way (boil the pasta, heat up the sauce, etc) and have had no issues. It's just strange that this dish is suddenly giving me issues.",1,1737212933.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

1i49egw,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1i49egw/how_to_make_friends_as_a_person_who_is/,How to make friends as a person who is simpleliving?,"I was never a big spender, my family believed in living within their means and while they wouldn't shy away from quality purchases, good education, making big purchases that are well invested they wouldn't do unnecessary spendings as they had to work hard. I am raised with this mindset and this has always been a conflict with friends who would eat out junk when company provides healthy home food, buy luxury brand clothing, blow money at beauty centers, trying to show off, going to expensive restaurants etc. Funny thing is while some were well off they would end up borrowing (and not paying back) taxi money, their share of the pizza, coffee money etc. from me which has been annoying.

Being a grad student made me a little more money conscious over time. While I still did enjoy going out once a week or so, I choose more money conscious places and I enjoyed more authentic food ironically. Grad student times were not awful as I did have similar minded, bohem friends and we hanged out doing home potlucks and such. 

Now, I am in a profession and not really earning a lot, though still above average and in a good place. It is just the age factor that comes in when I did not make much money as a grad student. And also the fact that I am always (happily) single. Now I just can't relate to my peers, the Jonassess trying to keep up with each other. Every time I meet them they tell me I need to get a nice house in a good neighborhood and 300k is a steal blah blah. (I can't get a mortgage as I just moved in a new country, also not rushing to buying overpriced old houses signing a 30 year mortgage), that I need to buy a car - I used to drive but I find that public transportation is actually good here. They endlessly talk about items they have bought which they think they are a steal (they are not), the expensive restaurants, even fucking coffee they buy lol. They tell me to shop at high end places (in my opinion they are not even good - def not Wegmans standards). I find this super rude when they tell me where to shop and they know the nearest one is an hour away from me. I swear I invited them over dinner and the woman, this regional manager of a company checked the trash to see brands I used in the pretense of helping out. The trash. When we go out I tend to pay separately and they always make a deal because they want to split because they think it is too much bother and rude - it is not. Literally takes a min for the staff. They always get the most expensive dish (no other particular reason other than the price), they have alcohol drinks (I don't drink alcohol) and yes, I don't feel like I have to pay and most of my friends during grad school mostly paid separately. Like I wouldn't mind getting coffee for them here and there but I just find it ridiculous people are so into each others business.

Despite these, I am the one who always buys gifts for them, who travels far (not as often as their weekend luxury getaways but instead visiting new places where I don't sacrifise on quality either - e.g. get a good (not luxury) hotel room with good reviews, use public transportation, eat at mom and pa restaurants or just not expensive places etc.) I enjoy spending on traveling and art galleries and concerts once in a while, not to fill in my weekend.

It has come to a point that I am ostracized and I think it is ridiculous. I meet a lot of interesting people but always when I am traveling. I have been depressed for this lack of friendship. I know a couple male colleagues, some are married, who are rather like me but well I just can't hang out with them.
I value the person I am and my values quite a lot, and I have led an interesting life, I used to enjoy having friends who were deep thinkers and good conversationalists, now I am stuck in this shallow world. I see now that befriending the humanities department made me happy, as they tend to be bohems more often than not. Now stuck in this burgeosis of managers and engineers, not even realizing they also have a couples advantage (like hello they wouldn't even give me more than 200k for mortgage as a single person household).

Aand then there are the kind of bohems who are similar underneath it all or who are just like that by circumstances and not by choice and I can't mesh with them either. So I guess what I am looking for is simpleliving people but where are they? And yes, I can be alone and I enjoy being alone but there comes a point where you feel it is less of a choice.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

I have been in a very long term relationship with my partner since we were both in our early 20s. Very little relationship experience with anyone else. 

We have loving family life. Kids definitely have felt the stress of our fighting and issues over the years but overall both sides extended family get along & from the outside I’m sure things look “perfect”. 

Underlying issue is my partner has skipped from low key “addictive behavior” over the years tobacco then quit, weed (I don’t really mind that so much), alcohol I wouldn’t mind but his personality changes over time (not mean or physically abusive, more angry at life and distance- kids notice too), porn and online pandering was a HUGE issue for a while that he got intense therapy for and couples counseling (once trust is broken, it’s broken. I’ve chosen to stay), now it’s hiding nicotine use and lying about it. Has dabbled with Rx pills (not prescribed) and says “he’s open” to hard drugs. It’s the lying that I struggle with and the anxiety around escalating addiction (starts slow ends up worse). Makes it hard to make plans, have hopes and dreams together when I don’t know if my partner has the self control to keep it together. 

I’ve done lots of personal therapy on co-dependency. Maybe I need more. I’ve read the books, listened to the podcasts. I’m devastated at the thought of this relationship ending but feel pathetic and sullen continuing it on too. Otherwise I live a very healthy lifestyle am very fit for my age no true addictions other than coffee. 

I wonder if these “low key” addictions are worth upending my whole life for. I do love my partner and want the best for him but don’t want him to feel forced or coerced to stay with me with  ultimatums and such. 

The thought of “what is he doing now” gives me so much anxiety and the dishonesty really drives a wedge between us. 

We’ve discussed an open marriage and I believe he’s bluffing but he’ll say “why don’t you go get your needs met elsewhere”. It reads like he’s “self shaming” but I can’t really tell. 

Has anyone else been in a relationship like this and somehow made it work? It’s easy to say “just be done he won’t change” I know that- but is there a way to accept things won’t change and stay married and not have so much anxiety about this.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

First off, thank you ALL for being so AMAZING! This community rocks, and I love reading through all the posts and comments!

Second, a friend of mine is coming to my country from Sweden in around 1-2 months. They asked me if I wanted something, and me, being a desperate coffee lover, want some beans of course.

I've got a Hario V60, a moka pot, and a French Press. My KINGrinder K6 will arrive in a week or so as well.

What roasters and what beans specifically do you suggest?

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

1i4998o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1i4998o/justsad/,Just...sad!,"My kid has a dairy allergy. They used to be allergic to egg too but grew out of that. The dairy allergy is hanging on in there though.

They recently turned six and they wanted a party. Naturally everything was dairy free. I also knew there were a few veggie kids in their class, so even though I didn't know if those kids would make it, I made sure I had veggie food. There were vegan options. The cake was dairy/gluten/nut free. The sweets in the party bags were vegan. Just incase! I didn't want anyone to feel excluded. Because I've been there - I'm coeliac and lactose intolerant. Turns out none of the veggies came and all the kids there could eat everything! But nothing was obviously vegan/allergy friendly so all the kids were happy and they had no clue I had put so much effort in 😂


But very rarely do other parents get it. I always take cake/snacks with me to every party we go to because very rarely do people cater for allergies. Some don't even ask about allergies. I try my best to make sure my kid has something similar to what everyone else has. They've always been super switched on about their allergy and understood why their plate looks a little different.


But even they're over it now.
Today we had a party. They were super anxious anyway - they're autistic and weren't sure they'd know many people at the party. The venue was cooking pizza so I cooked a dairy free pizza at home (because the venue couldn't cater for it) and bought nice vegan cake.

The pizza came out and my kid was so sad that they had now, quite cold home cooked pizza while everyone else got to enjoy freshly hand cooked pizza.

I tried to order a coffee and the only dairy free milk they had was oat, which I can't have.

The cake came out looking fantastic and despite me bringing nice cake too, my kid was just done and wanted to leave.

They've felt a little poorly today anyway and as they get older they're getting more and more fed up with their allergy. And I get it. I've stood in a supermarket on my own before and cried because I just wanna be able to pick up something without checking the ingredients list of absolutely everything! Fed up of having to eat the 'special food.'

So we left and I told them I'd order them dairy free pizza from a nice pizza place. They're super happy with that and over the party already but I'm still just...so sad for them. Six years old and already fed up with it all.

Don't get me wrong...I'm not expecting the party to be centered around us or anything! I just know exactly how my six year old feels. They wanted to be the same as everyone else, to eat the same, delicious things that are placed on the table in front of them. 

It just breaks my heart. I try my best to make sure they have similar but it's not good
enough...and I totally understand why!

1i4990q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadameRavensDarlings/comments/1i4990q/runner_of_the_lost_library/,Runner of The Lost Library,"*Thump.*

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

We did everything as shown on delonghi’s youtube channel for the first use. It was pretty much the same as what the machine showed on its lcd screen.

Arguably, we chose a oily dark roast coffee which the machine almost stalled brewing. 

We had a few issues, one of them was  coffee was too watery and infusion was very slow and thin extraction. 

We changed the grind setting but no results there neither. The other issue we have is grinder is making noise but screen says “oops, it looks like you are out of coffee beans. Time to add some more” And it’s full of beans.

Yes, we tried different grind settings from 1 to 3.5 and also a different much more medium roast, definitely not oily beans. Still our coffee is bity and watery. Still we got the same oops you are out of coffee beans error in the not oily beans as well

No matter how hard I tried, it wasn't happening. Or, if it did, I was too drunk to remember it. 

This is the hardest lesson for me. I don't want the alcohol, don't miss the desperate attempts to achieve that buzz, but I would still like to feel it again. 

Most likely, it is lost to me forever, and I do grieve that loss. Like the coffee mug that broke last week, it will never be the same as it was. I can't have it back, and I have to mentally accept that, be okay with it, and move on. 

- Sleep is complicated. One of my other favorite things about drinking was no more laying in bed for hours ruminating and not waking every hour (or not remembering if I did). I am having to learn to shut my brain down another way, or learn to live with it. 

- You can smell large amounts of alcohol on a person from 6 feet away. It can be overwhelming. I used to smell like that and totally didn't know. 

- People are extremely needy when drunk. I knew this somewhat, having a close family member with the same problem. 

The roller coaster conversations, up and down and always circling back to the same places, are exhausting to keep up with.

The constant physical needs for physical contact, care, reassurance, comforting are also exhausting for the person providing care. 

I don't recall myself being like that, but I sure don't want to put someone else they it either. 

- It's a whole lot easier dealing with the unexpected when you aren't nursemaiding your addiction. I still may not be happy at all or may be downright angry when my schedule is changed without my permission, but at least I'm not upset because I have to reschedule my drinking. 

Change is still hard y'all. 

- I don't miss accidentally sleeping the day away because I once again screwed up that first point. For better or for worse, now I am often first to rise. First to go to bed, too, but nobody's perfect. 

- I still don't have the words to help anyone else who might be in the same shoes I was. My close family member said he's proud of me and wishes he could do it to, and the 'right thing to say' fairy ran away screaming. Maybe next time I will do better.

- There are other things, too, but this has been a long enough post. I've put some of my thoughts together, and it sounds like other people are starting to get up now. The day is calling, and I am not handcuffed by alcohol so I might as well tackle it. ",14,1737212108.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False
1i496zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1i496zo/runner_of_the_lost_library/,Runner of The Lost Library,"*Thump.*

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

If you’ve poked around here and paid attention to the people who know what they're talking about, you'll familiar with the “major” first-step arguments for God’s existence. Note that these arguments do have a second step, but that will be detailed following this list. In case you aren’t familiar with these arguments, here is a *brief* reiteration, each with a hyperlink to a ""complete"" form of the argument:

(1) [Motion](https://hopeandsanity.com/five-ways-to-know-god/#:~:text=in%20each%20argument.-,The%20First%20Way,-%E2%80%9CThe%20first%20and). Things change from one state to another. But for anything to change, it must be preceded by an external “actualizer.” For example, it is impossible for a cup of coffee to change itself from 75° to 70°, as that would require the cup to be 70° before being 70° – a contradiction. But clearly, if everything needed external actualization, we would have an infinite regress. Plugging a TV into an infinite series of extension cords would never give it the power to turn on; likewise, an infinite series of unactualized actualizers would have no power to change. So, something must be purely actual, without any potential therein, and this “unchanging changer” must serve as the terminus of change.

(2) [Cause](https://hopeandsanity.com/five-ways-to-know-god/#:~:text=and%20so%20on.-,The%20Second%20Way,-%E2%80%9CThe%20second%20way). We notice that at least some things are caused by other things. Now, there are two types of causal chains: accidental and efficient. An accidental series is a series of independent beings. For example, a man has a son, and then he has a son, and so on. These chains could theoretically go on forever. But an “efficient cause” denotes a simultaneous logical regression, in which each step continuously depends on the prior. For example: you are composed of organs, and those organs are composed of cells, and they of molecules, and they of atoms, and so on. Those cannot go on forever without a problem of infinite regress. Thus, something must be an uncaused cause, serving as the terminus of causality.

(3) [Contingency](https://hopeandsanity.com/proof-of-gods-existence/). We know there are some beings which are “contingent” – that is, they exist, but could be different, or could have not existed at all. A red apple, a green chair, a teacup, so on. In all our experience, contingent things unfailingly have explanations. If you saw a broken window, you’d assume there’s a reason the window is broken and search for a projectile. Now, each contingent item is the way it is because of something external to itself. Again, it is impossible for a cup of coffee to change itself from 75° to 70° (one contingent state to another), as that would require the cup to be 70° before being 70° – a contradiction. But if every contingent thing is contingent upon another contingent thing, then we have an infinite regress. As such, there must be a non-contingent thing somewhere, which serves as the terminus of this existential dependency.

(4) [Gradation](https://hopeandsanity.com/five-ways-to-know-god/#:~:text=and%20so%20on.-,The%20Fourth%20Way,-%E2%80%9CThe%20fourth%20way). Certain beings have characteristics “of themselves.” Heat is “that which is hot of itself,” and the hotter a thing is, the closer it approaches to the nature of heat. Aristotle argues in [*Metaphysics II*](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.2.ii.html#:~:text=%22It%20is%20right,respect%20of%20truth.) that transcendentals operate in the same way; that a thing has “more truth” the fewer intermediaries it depends on – that is, the closer it approaches to being self-evident. Likewise, a being has “more existence” the fewer intermediaries it depends on – that is, the closer it approaches to being self-evident. So, a fox has more being than his shadow, or, a man has more being than his dreams. As such, there must be something which has self-evident existence; having the power to exist of itself, as opposed to deriving it from another. Else, as in the previous examples, we have an infinite regress where things exist, but nothing *has* existence.

(5) [Governance](https://hopeandsanity.com/five-ways-to-know-god/#:~:text=of%20%E2%80%9Cun%2Dsaltiness.%E2%80%9D-,The%20Fifth%20Way,-%E2%80%9CThe%20fifth%20way). Imagine you were standing near a target and suddenly an arrow flew into it – bullseye. There’s a chance that may have just been some random cosmic occurrence. Now imagine billions of arrows fly into that target as well as 500 other targets nearby. The only reasonable explanation is that a mind is directing the arrows to their respective targets. The universe is remarkably coherent and predictable, even if only looking at something mundane, like acorns becoming trees. Now, one may point to evolution or the laws of nature as an explanation. But calling such things “laws” is anthropomorphizing; acorns do not think. And furthermore, evolution is not a conscious being; nor is gravity, the speed of light, nor the other forces of nature. Thus, we have an infinite regress of unconscious organizers – unless we posit a conscious terminus of coherent governance.

Now, as I said, there are two steps to these arguments. Once you’ve established one (or more), then you need to prove the terminus is something like God. That second step, though a little different for each, goes something like this:

We know that if something is “purely actual” (the unchanged changer), it must have specific characteristics. Namely: there can only be one fully actual being, for any distinction from pure actuality is potency. A fully actual being cannot be material, because material always has potency – so He is immaterial. He must be eternal, for if He wasn’t, something would have to have moved Him from potential existence to actual existence. He must be perfect – that is, lacking in absolutely nothing, for any lack denotes unfulfilled potential. This means He is omnibenevolent, having all that is desirable innately. What is fully actual acts upon others without ever being acted upon, and since that is the principle of all motion, He is all-powerful. He must know all things, for if He did not know something, He would have potential to know it. And so on and so on.

**Brute Fact Objection**

That preface has hopefully explained the basic framework of classical theism well. But as I said in the introduction, the point of this post is not to discuss classical theism. Rather, it is to discuss the atheist objection to the five major arguments: the “brute fact” argument.

There’s an obvious formula to the five major arguments: (1) demonstrate something which seems to require explanation, (2) demonstrate through deduction that that thing can only be explained by a terminus, (3) demonstrate that the terminus must have particular characteristics (oneness, immateriality, eternality, etc…) which converge on it being God. This leaves the atheist with two possible ways to escape the conclusion. They may either reject that the terminus exists, or reject that the terminus resembles God.

Trying to reject the existence of the terminus puts the atheist in a very difficult position, because these arguments do not leave another option. For example, in the contingency argument, we organize everything into two binary categories: contingent, and non-contingent. You can’t use the explanandum to explain itself; that is, you can’t say that everything contingent is contingent on yet another contingent thing. So, there are only two options: a non-contingent explanation, or *no explanation*. Let me reiterate: there is no third option. The flying spaghetti monster, Zeus, quantum fluctuations – these things must either be non-contingent (conceding the argument) or contingent (explanandum). Let me reiterate again: *there is no other option. Either there is a non-contingent being, or reality has NO explanation.*

And indeed, that’s the argument atheists do make. The “brute fact” is [Bertrand Russell’s argument](https://www.ditext.com/russell/debate.html#:~:text=Copleston%3A%20Well%2C%20to,there%2C%20and%20that%27s%20all.) against contingency. He at least tries to back it up by claiming a compositional fallacy that (elementarily) doesn’t actually exist in the argument ([addressed here](https://hopeandsanity.com/proof-of-gods-existence/#:~:text=3.%20(2)%20The%20set%20of%20CB%20has%20an%20explanation)). But that is nevertheless his claim: “I should say that the universe is just there, and that’s all.”

But isn’t God also a brute fact? No; God does have an explanation – His own (proposed) ontology as immaterial, immutable, and eternal. If I tell you there’s an immaterial, immutable, eternal thing out there, that very description answers why it’s there – *it’s immaterial, immutable, and eternal*. Contrarily, the universe (or set of contingent things) cannot satisfy the demand for self-explanation, leaving it not unexplained, but *unexplainable*. A brute fact. Furthermore, “the universe” cannot explain how actualization happens, where causality comes from, where the act of existence comes from, and why reality is coherent and ordered.

The “brute facts” just pile up when one rejects God. That’s an issue for the atheist, as “brute facts” are fundamentally baseless assumptions. To make a brute fact argument is not to humbly say, “I don’t know.” It’s to say, “*my positive assumption is that there is no explanation for reality*.” How ludicrously unscientific! How ironic to accuse the *theist* of invoking magic!

Of course, all claims rely on assumption at some level; even “I think, therefore I am” depends on the assumption that logic works. But the assumptions that the theist must make are the simple assumptions we make every day: states of affairs have explanations. Effects don’t happen without causes. Something can’t come from nothing. Reality is coherent. Contrarily, the brute fact assumptions an atheist must make are absolutely absurd: states of affairs have explanations, *except the entire universe*, or nothing whatever has an explanation. Effects don’t happen without causes, *except the first set of effects*, or an outright denial of cause-and-effect. Contingent reality is sustained in existence *by nothing, for no reason*. Reality being coherently organized and predictable is just a complete coincidence.

Now, as I said, the atheist has another option. The fallback is to grant the first step and admit the terminus, but deny that the terminus is God. There are some meaningful arguments about this – there is [intense debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhke5_tk6N0) about whether God is simple (selfsame substance) or composed of parts, for example. But to grant that there is an unactualized actualizer, an uncaused cause, a non-contingent being, and a source of existence, coherence, and order (or any combination thereof) and then say that isn’t God is… dubious, to say the least. In [*Metaphysics XII*](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.12.xii.html#:~:text=%22On%20such%20a,this%20is%20God.), using the “motion” argument alone, Aristotle reasons to the idea that God is “thought thinking itself;” a super-intellect which literally ideates reality into existence, directing all things from and to Himself as the unchanging first and final cause. To hold even two of the major arguments to be true cannot leave one an atheist.

**Conclusion**

This is not a robust, direct argument for God’s existence ([that page is here, if you wish](https://hopeandsanity.com/proof-of-gods-existence/)). It is, however, an explanation of the fundamentals of the arguments for God’s existence, followed by a critique of the fundamental flaw of atheism: it requires assumption after assumption, none of which are anything other than superstition.",0,1737212051.0,DebateReligion,55,0.48,False

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

I've had the Gen2 for over a year, well over 10kg and I still find the taste muddled, and it clogs very easily. Using it at 6/7. Has to be the fines.

The SSP burrs besides being super expensive, sound like they would give me a profile similar to the C40 - perhaps even more clarity, but not that dissimilar. I want the ODE to give me fine coffee, flat burr, full body profile.

Probably I need to check the alignment of the burrs and check back with you guys. Right now i'm pretty disapointed with the grinder each day that passes, but still have hope that something can be done. Just need it to do something good and consistent and I'll perfect my technique around it.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

I feel like I’m losing my mind, but I specifically remember going almost every day before work to get an iced honey almond milk or oat milk type of drink. it was really smooth creamy and the overall flavor profile was honey which I loved.

","Hello there !

I'm looking to meet and chat with new people about whatever we want, slowly getting to know the other better. I'm hoping for those chat to develop into a long term friendship where we can support each other and lend a hear to the other during difficult times. If we're attracted to each other it could lead to something more as I think the best relationship start with friendship rather than appearing spontaneously but I'm fine if we just stays as friend. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also some coop games. I like playing board games with my friends and reading (recently started the Terry Pratchet books). Being lazy in my couch watching youtube videos about internet mysteries is my guilty pleasure.

I'm practicing martial arts, running (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to prepare for a marathon next year) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

If you're interested, feel free to send me a message. Please include a bit about yourself.",1,1737211849.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

This anti-procrastination hack, created by Merlin Mann, is ridiculously simple. All you need is a timer and your to-do list.

	1.	Set your timer for 10 minutes. For those 10 minutes, focus on your task with single-minded intensity. Like, seriously. It’s just 10 minutes—no “quick research,” no doom-scrolling. Just work.
	2.	After the 10 minutes are up, set the timer for 2 minutes. This is your break. Do whatever you want—grab coffee, check Reddit, dance around your room. (I personally recommend walking or stretching to refresh your brain.) But here’s the catch: stick to 2 minutes—no more, no less.
	3.	Repeat this work-play cycle five times. That’s the “x5” part. In total, you’ll work for an hour (50 minutes of work + 10 minutes of breaks).

Why does this work?
	•	It’s less intimidating. Knowing you only have to focus for 10 minutes makes starting way easier.
	•	You look forward to both work and breaks. The constant switch keeps things fresh and stops procrastination from taking over.
	•	It builds momentum. Once you get into the flow, you might even find yourself skipping the breaks and diving into more work.

The “(10+2)x5” method is perfect for overcoming that initial hurdle of just getting started. Plus, it’s adaptable: if you’re feeling ambitious, you can stack multiple cycles or extend your focus times.

1i4905h,https://i.redd.it/q2536b8qlrde1.jpeg,Is Morning the Best Time to Take Modafinil?,"**Is Morning the Best Time to Take Modafinil?**

Modafinil, a prescription medication often used to treat narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder, has gained popularity as a cognitive enhancer. Many people use it off-label to improve focus, increase productivity, and enhance cognitive function. As with any medication, timing can significantly impact its efficacy and side effects. This raises the question: is morning the best time to take Modafinil?

One of the primary reasons morning is considered the ideal time to take Modafinil is its pharmacokinetics. Modafinil is designed to promote wakefulness and alertness, which is particularly beneficial during daytime hours when productivity is typically at its peak. Taken in the morning, the effects of Modafinil align with the natural circadian rhythms of the body, which are geared towards alertness and activity during daylight hours.

When Modafinil is taken in the morning, users often experience heightened concentration, improved mood, and increased energy levels throughout the day. This timing allows individuals to maximize their productivity, whether at work or during academic pursuits. Many users report that taking Modafinil in the morning helps them tackle complex tasks with greater efficiency and clarity, making it a favored choice for those who need to perform at their best during the day.

Moreover, taking Modafinil in the morning can help mitigate potential sleep disturbances. Since the medication has a half-life of about 12 to 15 hours, taking it later in the day may lead to insomnia or difficulty falling asleep at night. By consuming Modafinil in the morning, users can enjoy its stimulating effects without the risk of experiencing restlessness or sleep problems later on.

However, individual responses to Modafinil can vary significantly. Some users may find that taking the medication in the early afternoon yields better results for their specific needs, particularly if they have night shifts or require alertness later in the day. It’s essential to consider personal schedules and how Modafinil interacts with one’s unique physiology. Experimenting with timing, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, can help users find their optimal window for taking the medication.

Another factor to consider is the potential for side effects. Common side effects of Modafinil include headaches, nausea, and anxiety. Taking the medication in the morning may help users manage these side effects better, as they can engage in activities that distract them from discomfort throughout the day. Conversely, taking Modafinil in the evening may lead to heightened anxiety during nighttime hours when one is typically winding down.

Additionally, users should be aware of their caffeine intake. Many people consume coffee or energy drinks in the morning, and combining these with Modafinil can amplify the stimulant effects. It’s crucial to monitor caffeine consumption to avoid potential jitters or increased heart rate, which can occur when multiple stimulants are used together.

In conclusion, while morning is generally considered the best time to take Modafinil due to its alignment with natural body rhythms and its ability to enhance daytime productivity, individual experiences may vary. Factors such as personal schedules, potential side effects, and caffeine consumption should all be taken into account. Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential to tailor the timing of Modafinil intake to individual needs, ensuring optimal benefits while minimizing adverse effects. Ultimately, finding the right time to take Modafinil can lead to improved cognitive performance and a more productive day.",1,1737211509.0,modafinilworldwide,0,1.0,False
1i48zxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/clancypasta/comments/1i48zxb/runner_of_the_lost_library/,Runner of The Lost Library,"Thump.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t for anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for convenience, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was looking for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the collection.”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have quite the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“I mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”


It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can taste you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was forward - but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and still he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.


Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

The air between its pages cushioned the closing of the tattered 70’s mechanical manual as Peter’s fingers gripped them together. Another book, another miss. The soft noise echoed ever so softly across the library, rippling between the cheap pressboard shelving clad with black powder coated steel.

From the entrance, a bespectacled lady with her frizzy, greying hair tied up into a lazy bob glared over at him. He was a regular here, though he’d never particularly cared to introduce himself. Besides, he wasn’t really there for the books.

With a sly grin he slid the book back onto the shelf. One more shelf checked, he’d come back for another one next time. She might’ve thought it suspicious that he’d never checked anything out or sat down to read, but her suspicions were none of his concern. He’d scoured just about every shelf in the place, spending just about every day there of late, to the point that it was beginning to grow tiresome. Perhaps it was time to move on to somewhere else after all.

Across polished concrete floors his sneakers squeaked as he turned on his heels to head towards the exit, walking into the earthy notes of espresso that seeped into the air from the little café by the entrance. As with any coffee shop, would-be authors toiled away on their sticker-laden laptops working on something likely few people would truly care about while others supped their lattes while reading a book they’d just pulled off the shelves. Outside the windows, people passed by busily, cars a mere blur while time slowed to a crawl in this warehouse for the mind. As he pushed open the doors back to the outside world, his senses swole to everything around him - the smell of car exhaust and the sewers below, the murmured chatter from the people in the streets, the warmth of the sun peeking between the highrises buffeting his exposed skin, the crunching of car tyres on the asphalt and their droning engines. This was his home, and he was just as small a part of it as anyone else here, but Peter saw the world a little differently than other people.

He enjoyed parkour, going around marinas and parks and treating the urban environment like his own personal playground. A parked car could be an invitation to verticality, or a shop’s protruding sign could work as a swing or help to pull him up. Vaulting over benches and walls with fluid precision, he revelled in the satisfying rhythm of movement. The sound of his weathered converse hitting the pavement was almost musical, as he transitioned seamlessly from a climb-up to a swift wall run, scaling the side of a brick fountain to perch momentarily on its edge. He also enjoyed urban exploring, seeking out forgotten rooftops and hidden alleyways where the city revealed its quieter, secretive side. Rooftops, however, were his favourite, granting him a bird's-eye view of the sprawling city below as people darted to and fro. The roads and streets were like the circulatory system to a living, thriving thing; a perspective entirely lost on those beneath him. There, surrounded by antennas and weathered chimneys, he would pause to breathe in the cool air and watch the skyline glow under the setting sun. Each new spot he uncovered felt like a secret gift, a blend of adventure and serenity that only he seemed to know existed.

Lately though, his obsession in libraries was due to an interest that had blossomed seemingly out of nowhere - he enjoyed collecting bugs that died between the pages of old books. There was something fascinating about them, something that he couldn’t help but think about late into the night. He had a whole process of preserving them, a meticulous routine honed through months of practice and patience. Each specimen was handled with the utmost care. He went to libraries and second hand bookshops, and could spend hours and hours flipping through the pages of old volumes, hoping to find them.

Back in his workspace—a tidy room filled with shelves of labelled jars and shadow boxes—he prepared them for preservation. He would delicately pose the insects on a foam board, holding them in place to be mounted in glass frames, securing them with tiny adhesive pads or pins so that they seemed to float in place. Each frame was a work of art, showcasing the insects' vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and minute details, from the iridescent sheen of a beetle's shell to the delicate veins of a moth's wings. He labelled every piece with its scientific name and location of discovery, his neatest handwriting a testament to his dedication. The finished frames lined the walls of his small apartment, though he’d never actually shown anyone all of his hard work. It wasn’t *for* anyone else though, this was his interest, his obsession, it was entirely for him.

He’d been doing it for long enough now that he’d started to run into the issue of sourcing his materials - his local library was beginning to run out of the types of books he’d expect to find something in. There wasn’t much point in going through newer tomes, though the odd insect might find its way through the manufacturing process, squeezed and desiccated between the pages of some self congratulatory autobiography or pseudoscientific self help book, no - he needed something older, something that had been read and put down with a small life snuffed out accidentally or otherwise. The vintage ones were especially outstanding, sending him on a contemplative journey into how the insect came to be there, the journey its life and its death had taken it on before he had the chance to catalogue and admire it.

He didn’t much like the idea of being the only person in a musty old vintage bookshop however, being scrutinised as he hurriedly flipped through every page and felt for the slightest bump between the sheets of paper to detect his quarry, staring at him as though he was about to commit a crime - no. They wouldn’t understand.

There was, however, a place on his way home he liked to frequent. The coffee there wasn’t as processed as the junk at the library, and they seemed to care about how they produced it. It wasn’t there for *convenience*, it was a place of its own among the artificial lights, advertisements, the concrete buildings, and the detached conduct of everyday life. Better yet, they had a collection of old books. More for decoration than anything, but Peter always scanned his way through them nonetheless.

Inside the dingey rectangular room filled with tattered leather-seated booths and scratched tables, their ebony lacquer cracking away, Peter took a lungful of the air in a whooshing nasal breath. It was earthy, peppery, with a faint musk - one of those places with its own signature smell he wouldn’t find anywhere else.

At the bar, a tattooed man in a shirt and vest gave him a nod with a half smile. His hair cascaded to one side, with the other shaved short. Orange spacers blew out the size of his ears, and he had a twisted leather bracelet on one wrist. Vance. While he hadn’t cared about the people at the library, he at least had to speak to Vance to order a coffee. They’d gotten to know each other over the past few months at a distance, merely in passing, but he’d been good enough to supply Peter a few new books in that time - one of them even had a small cricket inside.

“Usual?” Vance grunted.

“Usual.” Peter replied.

With a nod, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a round ivory-coloured cup, spinning around and fiddling with the espresso machine in the back.

“There’s a few new books in the back booth, since that seems to be your sort of thing.” He tapped out the grounds from the previous coffee. “Go on, I’ll bring it over.”

Peter passed a few empty booths, and one with an elderly man sat inside who lazily turned and granted a half smile as he walked past. It wasn’t the busiest spot, but it was unusually quiet. He pulled the messy stack of books from the shelves above each seat and carefully placed them on the seat in front of him, stacking them in neat piles on the left of the table.

With a squeak and a creak of the leather beneath him, he set to work. He began by reading the names on the spines, discarding a few into a separate pile that he’d already been through. Vance was right though, most of these were new.

One by one he started opening them. He’d grown accustomed to the feeling of various grains of paper from different times in history, the musty scents kept between the pages telling him their own tale of the book’s past. To his surprise it didn’t take him long to actually find something - this time a cockroach. It was an adolescent, likely scooped between the pages in fear as somebody ushered it inside before closing the cover with haste. He stared at the faded spatter around it, the way it’s legs were snapped backwards, and carefully took out a small pouch from the inside of his jacket. With an empty plastic bag on the table and tweezers in his hand, he started about his business.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” came a voice from his right. It was rich and deep, reverberating around his throat before it emerged. There was a thick accent to it, but the sudden nature of his call caused Peter to drop his tweezers.

It was a black man with weathered skin, covered in deep wrinkles like canyons across his face. Thick lips wound into a smile - he wasn’t sure it if was friendly or predatory - and yellowed teeth peeked out from beneath. Across his face was a large set of sunglasses, completely opaque, and patches of grey beard hair that he’d missed when shaving. Atop his likely bald head sat a brown-grey pinstripe fedora that matched his suit, while wispy tufts of curly grey hair poked from beneath it. Clutched in one hand was a wooden stick, thin, lightweight, but gnarled and twisted. It looked like it had been carved from driftwood of some kind, but had been carved with unique designs that Peter didn’t recognise from anywhere.

He didn’t quite know how to answer the question. How did he know he was *looking* for something? How would it come across if what he was looking for was a squashed bug? Words simply sprung forth from him in his panic, as though pulled out from the man themselves.

“I ah - no? Not quite?” He looked down to the cockroach. “Maybe?”

Looking back up to the mystery man, collecting composure now laced with mild annoyance he continued.

“I don’t know…” He shook his head automatically. “Sorry, but who are you?”

The man laughed to himself with deep, rumbling sputters. “I am sorry - I do not mean to intrude.” He reached inside the suit. When his thick fingers retreated they held delicately a crisp white card that he handed over to Peter.

“My name is Mende.” He slid the card across the table with two fingers. “I like books. In fact, I have quite the *collection.*”

“But aren’t you… y’know, blind?” Peter gestured with his fingers up and down before realising the man couldn’t even see him motioning.

He laughed again. “I was not always. But you are familiar to me. Your voice, the way you walk.” He grinned deeper than before. “The library.”

Peter’s face furrowed. He leaned to one side to throw a questioning glance to Vance, hoping his coffee would be ready and he could get rid of this stranger, but Vance was nowhere to be found.

“I used to enjoy reading, I have *quite* the collection. Come and visit, you might find what you’re looking for there.”

“You think I’m just going to show up at some-” Peter began, but the man cut him off with a tap of his cane against the table.

“*I* mean you no harm.” he emphasised. “I am just a like-minded individual. One of a kind.” He grinned again and gripped his fingers into a claw against the top of his cane. “I hope I’ll see you soon.”



It took Peter a few days to work up the courage to actually show up, checking the card each night he’d stuffed underneath his laptop and wondering what could possibly go wrong. He’d even looked up the address online, checking pictures of the neighbourhood. It was a two story home from the late 1800s made of brick and wood, with a towered room and tall chimney. Given its age, it didn’t look too run down but could use a lick of paint and new curtains to replace the yellowed lace that hung behind the glass.

He stood at the iron gate looking down at the card and back up the gravel pavement to the house, finally slipping it back inside his pocket and gripping the cold metal. With a shriek the rusty entrance swung open and he made sure to close it back behind him.

Gravel crunched underfoot as he made his way towards the man’s home. For a moment he paused to reconsider, but nevertheless found himself knocking at the door. From within the sound of footsteps approached followed by a clicking and rattling as Mende unlocked the door.

“Welcome. Come in, and don’t worry about the shoes.” He smiled. With a click the door closed behind him.

The house was fairly clean. A rotary phone sat atop a small table in the hallway, and a small cabinet hugged the wall along to the kitchen. Peter could see in the living room a deep green sofa with lace covers thrown across the armrests, while an old radio chanted out in French. It wasn’t badly decorated, all things considered, but the walls seemed a little bereft of decoration. It wouldn’t benefit him anyway.

Mende carefully shuffled to a white door built into the panelling beneath the stairs, turning a brass key he’d left in there. It swung outwards, and he motioned towards it with a smile.

“It’s all down there. You’ll find a little something to tickle any fancy. I am just glad to find somebody who is able to enjoy it now that I cannot.”

Peter was still a little hesitant. Mende still hadn’t turned the light on, likely through habit, but the switch sat outside near the door’s frame.

“Go on ahead, I will be right with you. I find it rude to not offer refreshments to a guest in my home.”

“Ah, I’m alright?” Peter said; he didn’t entirely trust the man, but didn’t want to come off rude at the same time.

“I insist.” He smiled, walking back towards the kitchen.

With his host now gone, Peter flipped the lightswitch to reveal a dusty wooden staircase leading down into the brick cellar. Gripping the dusty wooden handrail, he finally made his slow descent, step by step.

Steadily, the basement came into view. A lone halogen bulb cast a hard light across pile after pile of books, shelves laden with tomes, and a single desk at the far end. All was coated with a sandy covering of dust and the carapaces of starved spiders clung to thick cobwebs that ran along the room like a fibrous tissue connecting everything together. Square shadows loomed against the brick like the city’s oppressive buildings in the evening’s sky, and Peter wondered just how long this place had gone untouched.

The basement was a large rectangle with the roof held up by metal poles - it was an austere place, unbefitting the aged manuscripts housed within. At first he wasn’t sure where to start, but made his way to the very back of the room to the mahogany desk. Of all the books there in the basement, there was one sitting atop it. It was unlike anything he’d seen. Unable to take his eyes off it, he wheeled back the chair and sat down before lifting it up carefully. It seemed to be intact, but the writing on the spine was weathered beyond recognition.

He flicked it open to the first page and instantly knew this wasn’t like anything else he’d seen. Against his fingertips the sensation was smooth, almost slippery, and the writing within wasn’t typed or printed, it was handwritten upon sheets of vellum. Through the inky yellowed light he squinted and peered to read it, but the script appeared to be somewhere between Sanskrit and Tagalog with swirling letters and double-crossed markings, angled dots and small markings above or below some letters. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before.

“So, do you like my collection?” came a voice from behind him. He knew immediately it wasn’t Mende. The voice had a croaking growl to it, almost a guttural clicking from within. It wasn’t discernibly male or female, but it was enough to make his heart jump out of his throat as he spun the chair around, holding onto the table with one hand.

Looking up he bore witness to a tall figure, but his eyes couldn’t adjust against the harsh light from above. All he saw was a hooded shape, lithe, gangly, their outline softened by the halogen’s glow. A cold hand reached out to his shoulder. Paralyzed by fear he sunk deeper into his seat, unable to look away and yet unable to focus through the darkness as the figure leaned in closer.

“I know what you’re looking for.” The hand clasped and squeezed against his shoulder, almost in urgency. “What I’m looking for” they hissed to themselves a breathy laugh “are eyes.”

Their other hand reached up. Peter saw long, menacing talons reach up to the figure’s hood. They removed it and took a step to the side. It was enough for the light to scoop around them slightly, illuminating part of their face. They didn’t have skin - rather, chitin. A solid plate of charcoal-black armour with thick hairs protruding from it. The sockets for its eyes, all five of them, were concave; pushed in or missing entirely, leaving a hollow hole. His mind scanned quickly for what kind of creature this… thing might be related to, but its layout was unfamiliar to him. How such a thing existed was secondary to his survival, in this moment escape was the only thing on his mind.

“I need eyes to read my books. You… you seek books without even reading them.” The hand reached up to his face, scooping their fingers around his cheek. They felt hard, but not as cold as he had assumed they might. His eyes widened and stared violently down at the wrist he could see, formulating a plan for his escape.

“I pity you.” They stood upright before he had a chance to try to grab them and toss them aside. “So much knowledge, and you ignore it. But don’t think me unfair, no.” They hissed. “I’ll give you a chance.” Reaching into their cloak they pulled out a brass hourglass, daintily clutching it from the top.

“If you manage to leave my library before I catch you, you’re free to go. If not, your eyes will be mine. And don’t even bother trying to hide - I can hear you, I can smell you…” They leaned in again, the mandibles that hung from their face quivering and clacking. “I can *taste* you in the air.”

Peter’s heart was already beating a mile a minute. The stairs were right there - he didn’t even need the advantage, but the fear alone already had him sweating.

The creature before him removed their cloak, draping him in darkness. For a moment there was nothing but the clacking and ticking of their sounds from the other side, but then they tossed it aside. The light was suddenly blinding but as he squinted through it he saw the far wall with the stairs receding away from him, the walls stretching, and the floor pulling back as the ceiling lifted higher and higher, the light drawing further away but still shining with a voraciousness like the summer’s sun.

“What the fuck?!” He exclaimed to himself. His attention returned to the creature before him in all his horrifying glory. They lowered themselves down onto three pairs of legs that ended in claws for gripping and climbing, shaking a fattened thorax behind them. Spiked hairs protruded from each leg and their head shook from side to side. He could tell from the way it was built that it would be fast. The legs were long, they could cover a lot of ground with each stride, and their slender nature belied the muscle that sat within.

“When I hear the last grain of sand fall, the hunt is on.” The creature’s claws gripped the timer from the bottom, ready to begin. With a dramatic raise and slam back down, it began.

Peter pushed himself off the table, using the wheels of the chair to get a rolling start as he started running. Quickly, his eyes darted across the scene in front of him. Towering bookshelves as far as he could see, huge dune-like piles of books littered the floor, and shelves still growing from seemingly nowhere before collapsing into a pile with the rest. The sound of fluttering pages and collapsing shelves surrounded him, drowning out his panicked breaths.

A more open path appeared to the left between a number of bookcases with leather-bound tomes, old, gnarled, rising out of the ground as he passed them. He’d have to stay as straight as possible to cut off as much distance as he could, but he already knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Already, a shelf stood in his way with a path to its right but it blocked his view of what lay ahead. Holding a hand out to swing around it, he sprinted past and hooked himself around before running forward, taking care not to slip on one of the many books already scattered about the floor.

He ran beyond shelf after shelf, the colours of the spines a mere blur, books clattering to the ground behind him. A slender, tall shelf was already toppling over before him, leaning over to the side as piles of paper cascaded through the air. Quickly, he calculated the time it would take to hit the wall and pushed himself faster, narrowly missing it as it smashed into other units, throwing more to the concrete floor. Before him now lay a small open area filled with a mountain of books beyond which he could see more shelving rising far up into the roof and bursting open, throwing down a waterfall of literature.

“Fuck!” He huffed, leaping and throwing himself at the mound. Scrambling, he pulled and kicked his way against shifting volumes, barely moving. His scrabbling and scrambling were getting him nowhere as the ground moved from beneath him with each action. Pulling himself closer, lowering his centre of gravity, he made himself more deliberate - smartly taking his time instead, pushing down against the mass of hardbacks as he made his ascent. Steadily, far too slowly given the creature’s imminent advance, he made his way to the apex. For just a moment he looked on for some semblance of a path but everything was twisting and changing too fast. By the time he made it anywhere, it would have already changed and warped into something entirely different. The best way, he reasoned, was up.

Below him, another shelf was rising up from beneath the mound of books. Quickly, he sprung forward and landed on his heels to ride down across the surface of the hill before leaning himself forward to make a calculated leap forward, grasping onto the top of the shelf and scrambling up.

His fears rose at the sound of creaking and felt the metal beneath him begin to buckle. It began to topple forwards and if he didn’t act fast he would crash down three stories onto the concrete below. He waited for a second, scanning his surroundings as quickly as he could and lept at the best moment to grab onto another tall shelf in front of him. That one too began to topple, but he was nowhere near the top. In his panic he froze up as the books slid from the wooden shelves, clinging as best he could to the metal.

Abruptly he was thrown against it, iron bashing against his cheek but he still held on. It was at an angle, propped up against another bracket. The angle was steep, but Peter still tried to climb it. Up he went, hopping with one foot against the side and the other jumping across the wooden slats. He hopped down to a rack lower down, then to another, darting along a wide shelf before reaching ground level again. Not where he wanted to be, but he’d have to work his way back up to a safe height.

A shelf fell directly in his path not so far away from him. Another came, and another, each one closer than the last. He looked up and saw one about to hit him - with the combined weight of the books and the shelving, he’d be done for in one strike. He didn’t have time to stop, but instead leapt forward, diving and rolling across a few scattered books. A few toppled down across his back but he pressed on, grasping the ledge of the unit before him and swinging through above the books it once held.

Suddenly there came a call, a bellowing, echoed screech across the hall. It was coming.

Panicking, panting, he looked again for the exit. All he had been focused on was *forward* \- but how far? He wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it, but now that he had no sight of it in this labyrinth of paper he grew fearful.

He scrambled up a diagonally collapsed shelf, running up and leaping across the tops of others, jumping between them. He couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t, it was simply a distraction from his escape. Another shelf lay perched precariously between two others at an angle, its innards strewn across the floor save for a few tomes caught in its wiry limbs. With a heavy jump, he pushed against the top of the tall bookshelf he was on ready to swing from it onto the next step but it moved back from under his feet. Suddenly he found himself in freefall, collapsing forwards through the air. With a thump he landed on a pile of paperbacks, rolling out of it to dissipate the energy from the fall but it wasn’t enough. Winded, he scrambled to his feet and wheezed for a second to catch his breath. He was sore, his muscles burned, and even his lungs felt as though they were on fire. Battered and bruised, he knew he couldn’t stop. He had to press on.

Slowly at first his feet began to move again, then faster, faster. Tall bookcases still rose and collapsed before him and he took care to weave in and out of them, keeping one eye out above for dangers.

Another rack was falling in his path, but he found himself unable to outrun the long unit this time. It was as long as a warehouse shelving unit, packed with heavy hardbacks, tilting towards him.

“Oh, fuck!” He exclaimed, bracing himself as he screeched to a halt. Peering through his raised arms, he tucked himself into a squat and shuffled to the side to calculate what was coming. Buffeted by book after book, some hitting him square in the head, the racks came clattering down around him. He’d been lucky enough to be sitting right between its shelves and spared no time clambering his way out and running along the cleared path atop it.

At its terminus however was another long unit, almost perpendicular with the freshly fallen one that seemed like a wall before him. Behind it, between gaps in the novels he could see other ledges falling and collapsing beyond. Still running as fast as his weary body would allow he planned his route. He leapt from the long shelf atop one that was still rising to his left, hopping across platform to platform as he approached the wall of manuscripts, jumping headfirst through a gap, somersaulting into the unknown beyond. He landed on another hill of books, sliding down, this time with nowhere to jump to. Peter’s legs gave way, crumpling beneath him as he fell to his back and slid down. He moaned out in pain, agony, exhaustion, wanting this whole experience to be over, but was stirred into action by the sound of that shrieking approaching closer, shelving units being tossed aside and books being ploughed out the way. Gasping now he pushed on, hobbling and staggering forward as he tried to find that familiar rhythm, trying to match his feet to the rapid beating of his heart.

Making his way around another winding path, he found it was blocked and had to climb up shelf after shelf, all the while the creature gaining on him. He feared the worst, but finally reached the top and followed the path before him back down. Suddenly a heavy metal yawn called out as a colossal tidal wave of tomes collapsed to one side and a metal frame came tumbling down. This time, it crashed directly through the concrete revealing another level to this maze beneath it. It spanned on into an inky darkness below, the concrete clattering and echoing against the floor in that shadow amongst the flopping of books as they joined it.

A path remained to the side but he had no time, no choice but to hurdle forwards, jumping with all his might towards the hole, grasping onto the bent metal frame and cutting open one of his hands on the jagged metal.

Screams burst from between his breaths as he pulled himself upwards, forwards, climbing, crawling onwards bit by bit with agonising movements towards the end of the bent metal frame that spanned across to the other side with nothing but a horrible death below. A hissing scream bellowed across the cavern, echoing in the labyrinth below as the creature reached the wall but Peter refused to look back. It was a distraction, a second he didn’t have to spare. At last he could see the stairs, those dusty old steps that lead up against the brick. Hope had never looked so mundane.

Still, the brackets and mantels rose and fell around him, still came the deafening rustle and thud of falling books, and *still* he pressed on. Around, above, and finally approaching a path clear save for a spread of scattered books. From behind he could hear frantic, frenzied steps approaching with full haste, the clicking and clattering of the creature’s mandibles instilling him with fear. Kicking a few of the scattered books as he stumbled and staggered towards the stairs at full speed, unblinking, unflinching, his arms flailing wildly as his body began to give way, his foot finally made contact with the thin wooden step but a claw wildly grasped at his jacket - he pulled against it with everything he had left but it was too strong after his ordeal, instead moving his arms back to slip out of it. Still, the creature screeched and screamed and still he dared not look back, rushing his way to the top of the stairs and slamming the door behind him. Blood trickled down the white-painted panelling and he slumped to the ground, collapsing in sheer exhaustion.



*Bvvvvvvvvvvzzzt*.

The electronic buzzing of his apartment’s doorbell called out from the hallway. With a wheeze, Peter pushed himself out of bed, rubbing a bandaged hand against his throbbing head.

He tossed aside the sheets and leaned forward, using his body’s weight to rise to his feet, sliding on a pair of backless slippers. Groaning, he pulled on a blood-speckled grey tanktop and made his way past the kitchen to his door to peer through the murky peephole. There was nobody there, but at the bottom of the fisheye scene beyond was the top of a box. Curious, he slid open the chain and turned the lock, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his good hand.

Left, right, he peered into the liminal hallway to see who might’ve been there. He didn’t even know what time it was, but sure enough they’d delivered a small cardboard box without any kind of marking. Grabbing it with one hand, he brought it back over to the kitchen and lazily pulled open a drawer to grab a knife.

Carefully, he slit open the brown tape that sealed it. It had a musty kind of smell and was slightly gritty to the touch, but he was too curious to stop. It felt almost familiar.

In the dim coolness of his apartment he peered within to find bugs, exotic insects of all kinds. All flat, dry, preserved. On top was a note.

1i48xzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1i48xzt/nespresso_vs_lormy_story/,Nespresso vs L’Or-my story,"I have a Vertuo Plus, and honestly, I loved everything about it except for the cost of the pods. I got around that by using those foil covers to reuse the pods with my own coffee (almost always espresso blends). This adds a bit of an extra step that almost cancels out the convenience of just popping a pod into the machine and pressing the button. It did tend to stop working on occasion-usually tied to the reused pods-the bar coding getting worn and not triggering a cycle. 
Over the holidays, the spring and cup mechanism broke-not sure how, but it snapped, and I had to send it in for repairs. 
I figured I’d take that opportunity to check out the L’Or machine-which I’ve enjoyed on trips to Europe, and the cost/availability of the pods was better. I ordered one on December 2nd, and figured I’d get that before I got my Nespresso back and I could decide which I liked better. 

Well, Nespresso turned around my repair at lightning speed, and I got the machine back in barely over a week. This is including the time it took for me to receive the box to send it back in. L’Or, on the other hand, did not ship my machine for over a month. Their repeated response was that they had been overwhelmed during their Black Friday sale. A quick Google revealed that this had happened in prior years also.

I finally got the machine, and now I have the two machines in my kitchen. Lol. I am trying to decide which one to keep, and which one to sell. 

The Nespresso makes great espresso-the refilling I do provides flexibility (if I want a coffee sized espresso-I fill a coffee sized pod with espresso), but also takes longer than simply plopping a pod in. 

The L’Or pods are available online and in my grocery store at a much lower price-Peets makes delicious espresso pods, so I don’t have to rely on ordering from L’Or, But it is only two sizes- coffee and espresso. While there are three size selections for each size pod, the larger size setting you select, the weaker the coffee/espresso. A large brew of coffee to me tastes very watered down. This is not quite as bad with the espresso, but still noticeable.
Also, the same shipping issue arose when I ordered a shipment of pods from L’Or, and after three weeks, part of my order has still not shipped. This appears to be an issue with this company.

The L’Or machine feels a little cheap compared to the Nespresso machine. 

So I am in a battle between convenience, functionality, cost, and customer service. 

Who has two cents to add??

1i48vq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1i48vq9/casual_grandparents/,Casual Grandparents ,"Im just going to say it: grandparents today are not like the grandparents we had. I don't know what happened to these people, but it seems to be a common trend among families we know. Friends and acquaintances all share similar stories, grandparents who are rarely around and make everything about themselves.

I grew up with fond memories of my grandparents (born in 20s and 30s). They were a constant, loving presence in my life, a real cornerstone of my childhood. But my kids? They barely even recognize their grandparents. And honestly, we’re not alone in this experience.

The rare times they do decide to show up, it’s an exercise in frustration. They disregard every rule or “code of conduct” they used to preach to us. They come empty-handed, bring their own coffee, spend most of the visit glued to their phones, and can’t be bothered to interact with the kids, let alone play with them. And the hypocrisy is staggering—they act like the exact stereotypes they used to rail against, like the “lazy” or “selfish” people they warned us not to be.

What’s worse, they have zero tolerance for normal kid behavior. If a tantrum happens, they lace in this mysticism like, “Oh, babies cry,” or, “You never did that,” completely dismissing the reality of parenting and how kids work. If the kids don’t immediately warm up to them, give hugs, or act perfectly, they take offense, storm off, or sulk like children themselves. Every visit becomes about their egos, not about building a bond with their grandchildren.

It’s hard not to feel a sense of cognitive dissonance. My wife and I grew up with loving, present grandparents who helped shape some of the best memories of our childhood. Naturally, we’ve expected that grandparents play a similar role in their grandchildren’s lives. It’s not just disappointing, it feels like an existential issue, as if something vital is missing.Knowing they’ll never come around and become the grandparents we had just infuriates me. My kids will never have that special bond, and those moments that could define their childhood will never happen. It’s such a small window of a few short years, and once it’s gone, it’s gone forever. To make matters worse, the fact that they show up sporadically and randomly just causes confusion and further damage. It makes us hope they’ll “man up” and actually engage with their grandkids, but every time, they prove us wrong.

We’ve accepted that this is futile. What we had as children belongs to a foregone era. The best we can hope for is to one day be the grandparents we had.

I’m such a sweet tooth and everyday crave a sweet treat with my daily coffee. I make these cookies as my weekly prep ☺️

I’ve started out using the link in the comments but after many trials, this is what the base looks like for me :

Macros: 35kcal 0.9p 0.4f 7.3c 

Super simple to make:
1) preheat oven to 180celcius
2) Mash bananas 
3) Add the rest ( i use grape molasses which could be replaced by maple syrup or any pther sweetener) 

It’s so much fun to play around with toppings, since the base is really low in calories you have a lot of room for creativity! 

Here are some inspo: 

Raspberry - pistachio 🍓
Raspberry - white chocolate 🤍
Walnut - Dark Chocolate 🍫 
Blueberry - Coconut 🥥 ( i add blueberries in the mix and roll them around in coconut flakes, this is a great one for volume eaters!) 
Raisins - Peanuts 🥜 
Dried cranberries 
Dates
Goji berries mixed with nuts or dark chocolate works great! 

Today i did it like thumb cookies and added sugar free jam on top 🍓

Depending on the toppings 1 cookies comes to a total of between 40-70cals, but always super delicious 😋

The theory is to allow the puck to swell before applying full pressure, so it behaves uniformly as the shot is pulled. I always wondered how much difference this makes, since I thought the thick puck screen with the Flair 58 might prevent the puck from expanding.

However, I recently found evidence that the puck *is* able to expand. I was testing flat 9 bar profiles for someone here, and I ground too fine. Going to 9 bar immediately didn't let any coffee through for at least 20-30 seconds. Releasing the pressure for a few seconds, however, immediately allowed me to ramp back up to 9 bar and pull a shot (albeit with a flow rate of only 0.5-1 g/s). I don't think this would have been possible if the puck hadn't expanded. I'm assuming that the expansion reduced the puck density enough to allow water to flow.

TLDR - blooming profiles are possible on the Flair 58 with the thick puck screen, and dropping the pressure for a while might allow you to rescue a choked shot",2,1737210874.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

backstory: my wife and I are big time coffee lovers - especially cappuccinos. She never let me get an espresso machine because of counterspace and surprised me with a La Pavoni over the holidays. It looked beautiful but leaked out of every hole. lol. reading more, I am just not handy enough or patient enough to learn on it. So after a few days of attempting to repair (a brand new machine) I agreed with the store to return it.

Anyway, while she's partially in the mood, I want to proceed with getting a machine but I'm very overwhelmed - even after watching countless hours and readying 100s of posts.

I am not opposed to spending $2-3,000 - but if I do, I want it to be 100% end game. and since I am new, I really don't know if I like light or dark roast, I don't know if i'll like messing with profiling or I'll just want the process to be fast and just enjoy the coffee. So I am thinking I should just start with something more manual that I can re-sell later??

It led me to the Flair 58, MHW-3Bomber Sonic S7, and Espresso Forge. I picked these because of the 58mm portafilter - so I can accumulate baskets / tampers etc. I am thinking of pairing this with a Morning Dream Steamer. This setup is going to run me \~$1,100 or so. stay pat with this for a year or so and see how it goes / what my desires are.

I also am eyeing the Odyssey Argos - but they are saying \~3-6 months for shipping. \~$1,100 also. so I could buy this and just something used to get by a few months.

otherwise a jump right into an ECM machine \~$3,500. I'm sure I'd be beyond happy - but like I said don't wanna wind up with something where I would have preferred another machine..

I love spending time with her, but lately, I've noticed some tension between us. I've always enjoyed cooking and have often cooked for her. Recently, she started cooking more, which is great, but she gets defensive when I offer suggestions. I'm trying to be supportive, but she sees it as criticism.

For example, the other day I pointed out something that could have led to food poisoning, and we ended up having a big fight. It feels like she doesn't value my input, even when it comes to safety.

But it's not just about the cooking. I often feel like she doesn't care about me or my feelings. This morning, I waited to have breakfast with her, hoping we could connect. I asked if she wanted to watch a show together, but she responded in a really degrading way, saying, ""There's something wrong with your mind, we have watched that."" It hurt because she could have said something different, and she often chooses words that make me feel bad.

I waited for her to ask if I wanted breakfast, but she just made toast for herself. So, I started making my own breakfast. Then, as I was almost finished, she asked if I needed help. I told her I thought she already ate since she had toast, and she said it was because of low blood sugar. I offered to share, but she didn't respond. Then she made coffee only for herself, without asking if I wanna have too. When I finally asked if she wanted to share my meal, she simply said, ""I don't want it.""

I told her I don't like how she's behaving. It feels like she expects me to share without valuing me or even asking if I want anything. I really want to connect with my sister and have a good relationship with her, but I'm not sure how to navigate this and improve our communication.

I was extremely depressed initially but I've seen some improvement since changing my antidepressant medication. I thought that my lack of feeling and emotion was due to the depression but I'd say I'm still struggling with my ability to feel a connection to anything I do. I've been purposely pushing myself to try expand my emotional range but nothing seems to work as it used to. The only TV I can focus on is comedy and I barely find my favourite comedians funny anymore, I'm lucky to laugh once or twice during a set. I can't get aroused when I watch pornography. I don't get no sense of achievement from playing Elden Ring and Dark Souls, I don't even get frustrated when I'm stuck on a boss. I also have ADHD, I used to feel perfect on 50mg of lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse/Vyvanse). Since coming out of hospital I've gone up to the maximum dose of 70mg and I still can't really feel the medication, I can drink 5 coffees on top and not feel stimulated. I've even tried getting drunk, I get no buzz even after 8 cans of strong beer. All I do everyday is lie in bed listening to documentaries on YouTube for background noise, I have no interest in doing anything else.

I wasn’t always this lonely. There was a time when my phone would buzz constantly, plans were made, laughs were shared, and life felt like an endless road of possibilities. But now, at 25, I sit alone in a tiny apartment, surrounded by silence so loud it feels suffocating.

It all started a few years ago when I moved to this city for my first real job. I thought this was my chance to start over—to build a life I could be proud of. I left behind my small-town friends, my family, and the comfort of familiarity, convincing myself that I was doing the right thing.

The first few months were exciting. I explored the city, worked late nights chasing deadlines, and told myself the loneliness was temporary. ""You’ll make friends soon,"" I whispered to my reflection. But weeks turned into months, and soon, the only voice I heard regularly was the automated one on my work emails.

I tried. I really did. I joined a book club, smiled at strangers in coffee shops, and forced myself to attend office get-togethers even when anxiety screamed for me to stay home. But somehow, I always felt like I was on the outside looking in—like everyone already had their people, and there was no room for someone like me.

Then last month, something happened that shattered me. My birthday came and went without a single call. Not from the friends I thought I’d always have, not from colleagues who’d laughed at my jokes, not even from distant relatives who usually remembered because of Facebook reminders. I sat on the couch that night with a store-bought cupcake and a single candle, trying not to cry. But the tears came anyway.

The worst part? I couldn’t even blame anyone. Life gets busy, people move on, and maybe I didn’t try hard enough. Maybe I wasn’t interesting enough, funny enough, or worth remembering.

The next morning, I called my mom. I told her I was fine, that work was great, and I had so many exciting plans lined up. She didn’t question it, and I was grateful. I didn’t want her to worry. But deep down, I wished someone would ask, “Are you really okay?” I wished someone would see through my mask and just sit with me in the silence.

It’s strange, isn’t it? We’re more connected than ever, but I feel like I’m drifting further away from everyone. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe I’m hoping someone out there will read it and understand. Maybe someone else feels like this too, and we can remind each other that we’re not alone.

I’m not looking for pity or advice. I just needed to share this, to let it out. And if you’ve made it this far, thank you. Truly. Sometimes, knowing someone is listening—even for a moment—is enough to keep going.",2,1737209558.0,lonely,2,1.0,False
