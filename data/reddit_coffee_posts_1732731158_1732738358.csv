I have a **Delonghi Primadonna Soul** and it's been having issues of late.  I ONLY use beans for my coffee, but the coffee maker has a hopper where you can put in ground coffee.  I never use this hopper, but it's there anyway.

The issue I'm having is that the coffee beans being ground seem to be backfilling into the ground coffee hopper with very fine ground coffee.  I only noticed this when the coffee maker began to stop working.  I vacuumed out hte hopper and it was all working again, but it seems I need to do this once every couple of weeks.

Now I am using a new bean mix and I'm wondering if I need to set the grinding process to something else .... I'm just not sure what.  When I look at the grounds in the tray, they seem to be the right consistency,  But should I make hte grounds even more coarse?  Or should I switch to a completely different set of beans?  Are there just some beans that are not suited to automatic coffee machines?",1,1732737795.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

","I wish I never had friends ever in my life. because then I could at least delude myself into thinking I'll ever enjoy life without a social circle



I was starting to do really well, too. I went to the movies alone, I made myself meals. Now I'm in a big city. So I go on walks alone, I get coffee alone, I study alone, I go to museums alone. I haven't gotten over my fear of going to pubs alone, but I'm an 18 year old girl so that's probably for the best.



I was starting to get mad. like really fucking angry when people would complain about being alone. because I had it all figured out. if you want to be fulfilled you just have to learn how to enjoy doing things alone. that's been my motto, I have it all figured out. I can be fulfilled if I just tell myself that I'm enjoying doing things alone. all these fucking idiots just haven't figured out the secret. why are they complaining? it's right there



but god, it's all so much funner when you have people to do it with. my flatmates are all doing a friendsgiving, and it was light streaming out the door when they left to go meet up with the other people. light and happiness and love and they were all talking to each other



I last had a friendgroup for 3 days in 8th grade. is that relevant? I wish it never happened. for years afterwards I would tell myself I wanted to go back. recently I stopped thinking about it



but friendsgiving. what a stupid thing to fixate on. the truth is I'll never get to have it. I go to the movies and I eat my meals and I go on walks and I'll tell myself that you just have to enjoy doing things alone. and if you can't you have to force yourself to enjoy it. over and over and over again I'm lying to myself. and I was starting to believe it, starting to believe in the delusion, but it's all collapsed right in front of me. just forcing myself to go alone over and over and over again. but there's no use. there's no fulfillment if you have to go alone. never have I ever been fulfilled

Unveiling the Coffee-Boosting Weight Loss Supplement,"Can a simple coffee additive truly revolutionize your weight loss journey? Explore Java Burn's claims, ingredients, potential benefits, and scientific backing to decide if it's the right fit for you.

[Weight Management ](https://preview.redd.it/9i8uvhoni73e1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60aa16bc912a5f4391de2f8f5ee52b93483ebe1)

# Introduction

The pursuit of a healthier lifestyle often leads us down a path paved with enticing supplements. One such offering making waves in the weight loss arena is Java Burn. This coffee additive promises to supercharge your morning cup by boosting metabolism, enhancing energy levels, and ultimately aiding in weight management. But before you dive headfirst into the world of Java Burn, a deeper exploration is essential. Does this coffee companion truly live up to its claims? ¬†

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a dietary supplement marketed as a natural and convenient way to support weight loss. Packaged in single-serve pouches, it's designed to be mixed seamlessly into your daily coffee. The creators claim it works synergistically with coffee to unlock a range of benefits, including: ¬†

* **Increased Metabolism:** Java Burn supposedly revs up your metabolic rate, prompting your body to burn more calories at rest and while exercising. ¬†
* **Appetite Suppression:** By curbing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, Java Burn aims to help you consume fewer calories throughout the day. ¬†
* **Enhanced Energy Levels:** Feeling sluggish? Java Burn promises to combat fatigue and elevate energy levels, keeping you active and motivated. ¬†
* **Improved Focus and Cognition:** Sharpen your mental edge with Java Burn, which claims to support sharper focus and cognitive function. ¬†
* **Overall Detoxification:** Some sources suggest Java Burn aids in eliminating toxins from the body, contributing to a more cleansed and revitalized system. ¬†

# Ingredients Breakdown: Unveiling Java Burn's Powerhouse

So, what fuels these purported benefits? While the exact ingredient list isn't readily available on the official website, some sources suggest Java Burn may contain a blend of the following:

* **Green Tea Extract:** A well-known thermogenic ingredient, green tea extract boasts properties that might enhance metabolic rate and fat burning. ¬†
* **Chromium:** This essential mineral plays a vital role in insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation, which can indirectly influence weight management. ¬†
* **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid supports the transportation of fatty acids into cells, potentially promoting their utilization for energy production.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Rich in chlorogenic acid, green coffee bean extract might aid in blood sugar control and provide a slight energy boost. ¬†
* **Vitamin Complex:** A blend of vitamins could be present to ensure optimal nutrient intake and support overall wellbeing during weight loss. ¬†

# Scientific Scrutiny: Does Java Burn Hold Water?

While the individual ingredients hold promise, the crucial question remains: is there robust scientific evidence to support Java Burn's claims as a whole? Here's a closer look:

* **Limited Clinical Studies:** Currently, there are no published clinical trials specifically investigating Java Burn's effectiveness. Independent research is needed to verify its claims.
* **Individual Ingredient Backing:** Some individual ingredients in Java Burn, like green tea extract and chromium, have research suggesting their potential role in weight management. However, the specific formulation and dosages used in Java Burn may not be the same as those studied. ¬†
* **Synergistic Effects:** The creators emphasize how Java Burn works synergistically with coffee. While coffee itself poses some potential weight control benefits, further investigation is needed to determine if this interaction significantly elevates Java Burn's effectiveness. ¬†

# Safety Considerations: Potential Side Effects of Java Burn

Since the full ingredient list isn't readily available, it's difficult to provide a definitive assessment of potential side effects. However, some general considerations include:

* **Individual Allergies:** It's important to be aware of any allergies you may have to common ingredients like green tea extract or chromium.
* **Drug Interactions:** If taking any medications, consult your doctor before introducing Java Burn. Some ingredients may interact with medications.
* **Quality Control:** Limited information about manufacturing practices raises concerns about potential quality control issues.

# Unveiling the Cost: How Much Does Java Burn Set You Back?

Java Burn is primarily available through their official website. Currently, pricing structures may vary, but it typically falls within the range of:

* **Single Pouch:** Prices may start around $20-$30 per single pouch.
* **Multi-Month Packs:** Purchasing multiple pouches at once can offer a slight discount.

# Who Should Consider Java Burn?

Java Burn might appeal to individuals seeking a convenient and natural supplement to support:

* **Weight Loss:** If you're looking for an extra boost alongside diet and exercise, Java Burn could potentially offer some benefit as part of a holistic weight management plan.
* **Increased Energy Levels:** Feeling drained? The potential energy-enhancing properties of Java Burn might be a consideration.

# The Java Burn Experience: Real-World Insights

While scientific studies are the gold standard, real-world experiences can offer valuable insights. Many users have shared their experiences with Java Burn online, with varying results. Some report positive outcomes like increased energy levels, improved focus, and weight loss. However, others have noted minimal effects or even adverse reactions.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. **Is Java Burn Safe?** While generally considered safe for most people, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications. ¬†
2. **How Long Does It Take to See Results with Java Burn?** Individual results may vary. Some users report noticing changes within a few weeks, while others may take longer. Patience and consistency are key. ¬†
3. **Can Java Burn Help with Specific Weight Loss Goals?** Java Burn is not a magic pill. It can be a helpful tool when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. For targeted weight loss, consider consulting with a registered dietitian or fitness professional.
4. **Is Java Burn Suitable for Vegetarians and Vegans?** While some ingredients in Java Burn are plant-based, it's crucial to check the specific product label for any potential animal-derived components.
5. **Can I Use Java Burn with Other Supplements?** Before combining Java Burn with other supplements, consult with a healthcare professional to avoid potential interactions or overconsumption of certain nutrients.

# Conclusion

Java Burn presents an intriguing proposition for those seeking natural support for weight loss and energy levels. While its individual ingredients hold promise, the lack of comprehensive clinical studies leaves room for further exploration. As with any supplement, it's crucial to approach Java Burn with realistic expectations and to prioritize a balanced lifestyle. If you're considering incorporating Java Burn into your routine, consult with a healthcare professional to determine if it's right for you.

**Remember:** While supplements can be a helpful tool, they are not a substitute for a healthy diet and regular exercise. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or supplement regimen. ¬†",1,1732737677.0,heathieryoudaily,0,1.0,False

FYI: sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my first language. 

So by the time the story happened me (19) and let‚Äôs call her Flower (25) got hired to travel overseas to work in a really cool company, since we were going to live together I send her a text (the company provided us the telephone numbers since we were going to be stuck in planes for 36 hours) and I wanted to meet the person I was going to be stuck in a plane with for more than a day. So from here weird stuff begins so get ready for this roller coaster. All context is needed to get to the point don‚Äôt worry. 

So we agreed on meeting in a coffee shop, the weird part she was there with her parents, and all the time her parents were answering questions for her to the point that I made a joke like I would love to know about you from you haha. But after the most awkward 30 minutes I went home with a really weird feeling of it. 

So after that we meetup at the airport to travel to the other side of the world and 36 hours of planes, stops and security. All those 36 hours this woman kept me awake and when we landed I was so sleep deprived that I was sleeping all the way to the apartments. The apartments where in a frat house which was cool the big issues started here this lady had no knowledge of English (needed for work and living in this country) and since was a new country she decided that her name ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù was going to be ‚ÄúRose‚Äù because it‚Äôs a flower (like wtf) 

I didn‚Äôt wanted her as a friend but a lot happened and she needed a disciplinary call because she didn‚Äôt when to work the 8 hours needed and she worked in a kindergarten and took babies of 1 year OUT OF THE KINDER WITHOUT PERMISION so they asked me to be a translator since apparently she couldn‚Äôt understand. Here is when she mention her fianc√©e ( 1 month after arrival at this new country) and me and the sponsor where completely baffled by it. She mention that this man (59) was going to marry her and that she didn‚Äôt had to go to work, no time after she got fired.

Her answer was making a weird FAKE sue to the company including my name for mistreatment, when the HR called me I had no clue of it and her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù was the layer that I forge my signature. After that her photo and her fianc√©e where in the door of my house with dangerous don‚Äôt let them in note in them.

Almost a year later I had forgotten about this woman buuuuuut she sent me an invite for her birthday, which some friends of the frat wanted to go and convince me to go with them.

In this party was her fianc√©e which was MEGA OLD and when to sleep at 8 leaving her and 10 people downstairs in his mother‚Äôs house. I was really uncomfortable since my boyfriend at that time was from Irak and the mother of this guy was attacking him and at some point tried to grab him to search he didn‚Äôt had a bomb or that he wasn‚Äôt dangerous. When we wanted to leave she stood on the door and didn‚Äôt let us out screaming that I was going to die. I forcefully move her and we left BUT our friends stayed.

At 5 am I got a call from one of the friends that stayed in the party asking me to pick him up from the police station and to prepare tea since he was ready to spill it. I picked him up and the first thing he mentioned was that ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù got punched several times by her fianc√©e. I gasped bc the story was worst than what I knew since the mother of this man yelled at Flower to pick up the mess of the party now and when she didn‚Äôt she yelled for her son (flower‚Äôs fiancee) to put her on her place and that she was rude to her (mother of Flower‚Äôs fianc√©e) 

When I knew this I send her a text saying like hey we are not friends but that situation is bad like here we have rooms if you need them and basic human care to be honest‚Ä¶ 
She mentioned that he ask forgiveness and that also sent her roses like her ‚Äúname‚Äù yeah sureeeeee 

So I sent her mom a text to try to take her out of there bc if police in this country gets involved is bc neighbors called bc she was yelling to be helped and for him to stop, and this was not the first time this happened 

The mom of Flower never answered but she sent me a whatsapp and I quote the following: 
‚ÄúYou are an asshole by inventing that he punches me, he only kicks me and slaps me, you want to ruin my marriage but it won‚Äôt work, you jealous bitch, your boyfriend will kill you‚Äù 

So I stopped being sorry for her, after years of this more than 5 she is married to the guy and cross with one of my friends where she commented that I was an asshole by trying to ruing her marriage, her future and her visa (the marriage I guess) ",1,1732737595.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,0.67,False

From the moment he wakes up till he goes to work which is between 8-10hrs before then he sits at his computer and plays video games and also does school. He is a bartender at a high end restaurant currently getting his bachelors. I know he is busy sometimes with school but come ON. He‚Äôs been in school for almost 10yrs and hasn‚Äôt gotten shit done. 


I do ALL of the housework by myself. I take care of the kids all by myself. He does not help me AT ALL. He doesn‚Äôt lift a finger. I serve him food throughout the day. Make him his coffee. Occasionally check on him asks if he needs anything. I don‚Äôt ask him for help because if I do he has a meltdown. I‚Äôm not getting enough sleep because im so busy handling housework after the kids go to sleep.


 He complains im not nice to him or do anything for him when that‚Äôs obviously a lie. I don‚Äôt have sex with him often because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable at all. He makes me feel sick to my stomach. I‚Äôve grown a lot of hatred and resentment towards him because of his lack of help. He even has the audacity to tell me I shouldn‚Äôt be stressed out and I have no reason to be‚Ä¶. LOL. I make sure his work clothes are clean and ironed everyday. When he‚Äôs off of work he sits in his office and does not come out unless it‚Äôs to smoke weed or take a piss.


 I feel like I‚Äôm living a nightmare. He‚Äôs currently trying to quit smoking so I am trying to leave him alone as I know it‚Äôs hard to quit. But FUCKING COME ON! Even after the kids go to sleep he‚Äôs playing more video games till 3am. I put the kids to sleep by myself. I cook 99% of the meals. He doesn‚Äôt give me money and nor do I ask for it because I know there are more important things to pay for.  I feel like I‚Äôd rather be dead some days than deal with this anymore. Please help me.

So by the time the story happened me (19) and let‚Äôs call her Flower (25) got hired to travel overseas to work in a really cool company, since we were going to live together I send her a text (the company provided us the telephone numbers since we were going to be stuck in planes for 36 hours) and I wanted to meet the person I was going to be stuck in a plane with for more than a day. So from here weird stuff begins so get ready for this roller coaster. All context is needed to get to the point don‚Äôt worry. 

So we agreed on meeting in a coffee shop, the weird part she was there with her parents, and all the time her parents were answering questions for her to the point that I made a joke like I would love to know about you from you haha. But after the most awkward 30 minutes I went home with a really weird feeling of it. 

So after that we meetup at the airport to travel to the other side of the world and 36 hours of planes, stops and security. All those 36 hours this woman kept me awake and when we landed I was so sleep deprived that I was sleeping all the way to the apartments. The apartments where in a frat house which was cool the big issues started here this lady had no knowledge of English (needed for work and living in this country) and since was a new country she decided that her name ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù was going to be ‚ÄúRose‚Äù because it‚Äôs a flower (like wtf) 

I didn‚Äôt wanted her as a friend but a lot happened and she needed a disciplinary call because she didn‚Äôt when to work the 8 hours needed and she worked in a kindergarten and took babies of 1 year OUT OF THE KINDER WITHOUT PERMISION so they asked me to be a translator since apparently she couldn‚Äôt understand. Here is when she mention her fianc√©e ( 1 month after arrival at this new country) and me and the sponsor where completely baffled by it. She mention that this man (59) was going to marry her and that she didn‚Äôt had to go to work, no time after she got fired.

Her answer was making a weird FAKE sue to the company including my name for mistreatment, when the HR called me I had no clue of it and her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù was the layer that I forge my signature. After that her photo and her fianc√©e where in the door of my house with dangerous don‚Äôt let them in note in them.

Almost a year later I had forgotten about this woman buuuuuut she sent me an invite for her birthday, which some friends of the frat wanted to go and convince me to go with them.

In this party was her fianc√©e which was MEGA OLD and when to sleep at 8 leaving her and 10 people downstairs in his mother‚Äôs house. I was really uncomfortable since my boyfriend at that time was from Irak and the mother of this guy was attacking him and at some point tried to grab him to search he didn‚Äôt had a bomb or that he wasn‚Äôt dangerous. When we wanted to leave she stood on the door and didn‚Äôt let us out screaming that I was going to die. I forcefully move her and we left BUT our friends stayed.

At 5 am I got a call from one of the friends that stayed in the party asking me to pick him up from the police station and to prepare tea since he was ready to spill it. I picked him up and the first thing he mentioned was that ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù got punched several times by her fianc√©e. I gasped bc the story was worst than what I knew since the mother of this man yelled at Flower to pick up the mess of the party now and when she didn‚Äôt she yelled for her son (flower‚Äôs fiancee) to put her on her place and that she was rude to her (mother of Flower‚Äôs fianc√©e) 

When I knew this I send her a text saying like hey we are not friends but that situation is bad like here we have rooms if you need them and basic human care to be honest‚Ä¶ 
She mentioned that he ask forgiveness and that also sent her roses like her ‚Äúname‚Äù yeah sureeeeee 

So I sent her mom a text to try to take her out of there bc if police in this country gets involved is bc neighbors called bc she was yelling to be helped and for him to stop, and this was not the first time this happened 

The mom of Flower never answered but she sent me a whatsapp and I quote the following: 
‚ÄúYou are an asshole by inventing that he punches me, he only kicks me and slaps me, you want to ruin my marriage but it won‚Äôt work, you jealous bitch, your boyfriend will kill you‚Äù 

So I stopped being sorry for her, after years of this more than 5 she is married to the guy and cross with one of my friends where she commented that I was an asshole by trying to ruing her marriage, her future and her visa (the marriage I guess) ",2,1732737323.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1h1dadu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1h1dadu/two_questions_about_thanksgiving_details_stock/,Two Questions About Thanksgiving Details -- Stock Filtering & Butter Temp,"These are two mostly unrelated questions, though both about stuff I'm doing on Thanksgiving.

1. I've got some chicken stock for a soup.  It's not so gelatinous it's going to solidify in the fridge.  Indeed, it's been in the fridge for a day and still liquid.  But it's a bit cloudy.  My question is, can I use a coffee filter to remove some of the debris and clarify the stock a bit?  Having passed it through some cheesecloth that made little difference, I figure perhaps a finer filter might do the trick.

2. I've spatchcocked & seasoned my turkey but I'd like to rub butter on -- well pretty much everything, all the skin on the top of the bird.  But it seems I can't find a good temp for the compound butter!  It's either rock hard or so soft at room temperature it's in danger of melting in my hands!  Is there a temp I should shoot for there?  I have a decent thermometer, I can temp it as it comes up out of the fridge.",1,1732737302.0,AskCulinary,0,1.0,False

1h1d969,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidalideations/comments/1h1d969/daydreaming_turned_night_dreaming_about_suicide/,Daydreaming turned night dreaming about suicide.,"I have been so alone for my whole life. It's like I'm cursed or something. I try so hard to be a good person. I don't lie(for the most part) cheat, steal. I live by the golden rule. TREAT OTHERS HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED. 

I have a very traumatic past, this is just a very small portion, for context. Beginning at 8 months old when my mother was shot in the head with a 4.10 sawed-off shotgun while holding me on the couch. 

My father was held responsible, but released when I was 2 and I went ""home"" from foster care. 

At 4 my dad died. 

I remember that day so vivid November 25th,1992, looking around that hospital room, my Gramma, my aunt, my uncle, my step mom, the chairs lined the room with one door at the end. 

I remember the doctor coming in, saying it was too late. I remember the sound of the screams and the sorrow that filled that room. I was scared, I turned to my Gramma (who was my safe space up until then, thru molestation and physical child abuse). She was silently crying (one of 3 times I saw her drop an actual tear my whole life) 

I tried to squeeze in-between and up on her lap cuz the noise was vibrating through my little body, and my heart was pounding into my throat and ears, I understood what dead meant. 

She pushed me away. I stood there in that room all by myself and have been by myself ever since. 

People don't call me, stop by to say hey or grab a coffee. Instead I give them my last $20, and I make sure they are not hungry. 

People don't treat me the way they treat others.
No one calls to check on me.

If I see someone with a post asking for help I'm immediately reaching out to offer any kind of support. Weather that's cash apping you $10 for a coffee so u can get away for a minute or just listening to you rant. The posts I make don't get any comments from friends or family, but those same friends and family do things like this for literally everyone else. 

It's like I'm just here. Just wasting time, space and oxygen. Literally the only time I can get my husband to take me grocery shopping once a month is if I do ""whatever"" he needs in bed. And that almost always hurts me. Not to mention that then I have to RUSH the whole time I'm grocery shopping and end up forgetting something every time. 

I started daydreaming of killing myself years and years ago. I had kids and told myself when they are grown I could end my pain. Counting down the years to sweet relief. 

Now instead of just thoughts.... I actually picture myself swinging from a rope (not my preferred method) in my back yard. Or in the shower or from my closet or in the middle of the woods somewhere. 

Several weeks ago I started dreaming at night about it. (Using my preferred method). 

It's a lot. 
I am tired. 
I am so tired. ",1,1732737213.0,Suicidalideations,0,0.99,False

1h1d8cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1h1d8cb/a_recipe_for_hatred/,A Recipe for Hatred,"Challinor Close is not a place many people visit. A dead end, lost amongst a tangle of narrow roads in the high hills beside the river, it is easily overlooked and leads nowhere. Those hills, and the gardens of the few houses perched on them, are all lush with verdant overgrowth. It is as though the soil is particularly fertile here, and the residents of those turn-of-the-century homes of brick and pine can never quite keep up with the hungry demands of nature.  
I first chanced upon the area as a teenager, obsessed with rollerblading. My quest for speed took me up to the ends of the highest roads, where I could race down the steep and twisting footpaths like a red-haired streak of lightning. And I still remember first discovering the house at the end of the Close, its bounds marked by crumbling red-brick walls, draped with moss which wept dark liquid onto the road. Beyond the walls and gigantic trees, I glimpsed a spire, and the dome of a huge conservatory, the bronze arc of its struts dull with a creeping patina of green, its glass fusted with mildew.  
A house like that holds a sort of otherworldly enchantment, as though it is slightly out of time with the rest of the world. And that first time I peered at it, I felt¬†*observed*. But I was a very sensible, practical child; and in those days my only real concern with the the house at the end of Challinor Close was that it meant I had reached the apex of my skating route.  
It‚Äôs strange, remembering that girl, so naturally bold and unafraid. So free. The thought of her barrelling down that steep maze of roads with only reflexes, wits and kneepads to protect her still makes my throat tighten.  
Because my fearlessness was finally rewarded with what my parents had always feared the most ‚Äì as I emerged from the shadow of one street and tore across an intersection, a car hit me.  
I have no memory of the accident at all, just what I was told. My recollections of the first weeks in hospital are hazy, just warped time and a constant boil of distant pain, its flame turned low by all the drugs. After they had pinned and wired my bones back together, I spent a long time on the ward, staring mindlessly at the television above my bed ‚Äì numbed as much by day-time soaps as by the endless pills.  
When I was finally allowed to go home, I barely recognised myself. My trendy skater-girl clothes hung loose from my pallid, skinny bones, and the hair I‚Äôd always kept so proudly spiked short had grown down to my collar in a lacklustre flop.  
My parents encouraged me to put my blades back on, offered radical haircuts and new clothes, even though Mum and I had once clashed daily about my stylistic choices. They both did everything they could to help me reclaim the vibrant identity I‚Äôd once so eagerly worn, but I couldn‚Äôt. That fearless, free girl was gone; replaced by someone drained of her colour and her confidence. This new creature was smaller, weaker, and terribly afraid of the dangers of the world she had to learn to navigate. And she was even more afraid of the power of the strong, careless people who lived in it.

¬†  
Although my parents and teachers continued to encourage me back into sports and physical activities, the lingering pain of my injuries, and the listless cobwebs left by the grey hospital limbo held me back. I wallowed, and I fretted. I played up the aches in my recently knitted bones, and I worried at my scars with my nails, inflaming them until the pain was fiery and real.  
I felt like everything had fallen to pieces, and that it was all my own doing. In my head I‚Äôd deserved this somehow, I had taken a wrong turn and ruined any chance I had of a normal life. And it didn‚Äôt help that everyone around me couldn‚Äôt see that it was my fault, that they were so kind and sympathetic. I was a story to them. And there is no more tragic story than the one about the popular, athletic girl who is involved in a dreadful accident and can never swing a softball bat again, at least not without her wrists clicking audibly and painfully. And I saw their eyes, averted but still so proud of their own pity and kindness, when it became obvious that I couldn‚Äôt run to first base without stumbling as my bad leg gave out under me.  
If I said I hated the physical therapy, I‚Äôd be lying. When that vital part of me had died in the accident, had emptied that wellspring of passion and ambition, it took with it my ability to feel reckless, powerful emotions like anger and hate. So I tolerated the endless hours of physio that felt like the punishment I deserved, but I couldn‚Äôt even use that pain for good. I had no feelings to use; I just put in the effort that was required of me.  
My father, who had doted on his sporty little girl, coped even less well than I did, probably because he still had feelings. Within two years, the stress of it all, the stress that was¬†*me*, had fractured my parents‚Äô marriage beyond repair. Dad moved out of our house at the bottom of the hills and into an apartment in the city with his new girlfriend.  
On my sixteenth birthday, my mother said she had a surprise for me. She drove us through the warren of streets and past the scene of my accident. She didn‚Äôt stop there, but carried on up through the hills, all the way up to the end of Challinor Close. I had no idea how to feel when she parked on the familiar, lichen-blotched road in front of the last house with its vigilant spire and red brick walls.  
The tall wooden gate was unlatched. A short brick tunnel led us into a veritable explosion of plant life, that much greener passage redolent with sharp, earthy scents. A bronze-bound door sat at the end of the wild walkway, sporting a massive brass knocker shaped like an unopened pinecone.  
My mother knocked three times, then waited. I stood by her, feeling even smaller than usual, still not knowing why we were here and what it had to do with my birthday. When the door eventually swung open, it revealed a small foyer filled with coats, boots, umbrellas and potted plants. Amongst the clutter stood a tall, silver-haired woman with eyes the colour of cinnamon.  
‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she bid us, those eyes capturing mine even as I tried to look away. Her voice was resonant, almost as deep as a man‚Äôs, but pleasant and warm in my ears.  
Through the foyer, we entered a kitchen-come-solar, crammed to the roof with more planters and pots, each container spilling fronds and flowers, choked with an array of exotic flora.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve just finished preparing it,‚Äù she told my mother, as she moved about the claustrophobic kitchen, the space heavy with the scent of herbs and bright with hung copper implements. Her deft hands poured the contents of a pan into a steaming kettle, then decanted the liquid from the kettle into a pretty china cup, which the woman pressed into my grasp.  
‚ÄúDrink,‚Äù she instructed, the smoky timbre of her voice and the spark of her touch firing strange and unnameable feelings in the pit of my stomach.  
My mother nodded to me, and I raised the cup to my lips. I smelled spices from places so distant they had yet to be catalogued by modern botanists.  
It was sweet and thick on my tongue, the potion the woman gave to me. It spread through me like an alien emotion, filling my belly with tingling heat and my head with a sense of unnatural euphoria.  
‚ÄúHappy birthday,‚Äù my mother said, her voice edged with a strange melancholy.

¬†  
The power of my mysterious birthday gift became apparent all too quickly.  
The most livid, lumpy scars smoothed and faded almost overnight. My constant aches eased away, and the weakness that plagued my left side was all but gone, replaced with new muscle tone and increased vigour. My mother‚Äôs smile returned, and blossomed more frequently each day as my ‚Äòmiraculous‚Äô recovery continued apace. Soon, even the drudgery of all those physio appointments was behind me for good.  
But although the components of the potion fed to me by the cinnamon-eyed woman worked their magic on my body, nothing was enough to heal the wounds in my psyche. I returned to the field and was soon hitting home-runs again, but there was no passion or pride in my physical prowess, no¬†*soul*. My limbs might be strong and hale, but inside my head I was the same terrified mess as before ‚Äì worse, even more guilty, since I suspected that the potion had cost my mother dearly.  
When school came to an end, I came out to my parents. There seemed no point in denying that I was attracted to girls; it had been pretty obvious since the day I first hacked off all my hair and started obsessing over the Indigo Girls. My mother was resigned and careful, and even managed to be polite enough to my first girlfriend. I never really found out what my father thought of it all. He didn‚Äôt say much when I phoned him specially to tell him, then all contact with him stopped abruptly. Mum couldn‚Äôt meet my eyes when she reluctantly revealed he had moved out of town without telling me, and the half-hearted attempts I made to track him down were met with little success. I wasn‚Äôt even hurt; in truth, he hadn‚Äôt been part of my life for a long time, content as he was with¬†*his*¬†new life. I knew that the old me would have been angry at him, would even have¬†*hated*¬†him for abandoning me for his twenty-something floozy, but the person I had become felt nothing but a vague and lingering sadness.  
My first attempt at a relationship died after six months, my looks and sporting achievements not nearly enough to fill the obvious personality void. I bounced from girlfriend to girlfriend, always trying to bend myself into the shape desired by my partners. But instead, I simply became even more flat. I became a doormat ‚Äì and the purpose of a doormat is to be stomped on.

¬†  
Nel wasn‚Äôt your typical dyke, even though she rolled in some pretty butch circles. Yes, she owned a motorbike ‚Äì but that‚Äôs about as far as the stereotypes extended. People often assumed we were sisters, being a little¬†*too*¬†similar in size and build. But where I was docile and compliant, she was loud, controlling, and often obnoxious.  
I wanted to have feelings so badly that I still thought I loved her.  
Almost all of the conventional literature on abusers centres around men as the perpetrators, and I think that‚Äôs how Nel got away with so much of what she did ‚Äì and another reason why I went along with it. It wasn‚Äôt happening because it couldn‚Äôt be. I handwaved the isolation away, telling myself that it didn‚Äôt matter if she hated me having female friends, because I was a hermit and a homebody anyway. The insults and the persistent overtures for sex even when it was the last thing I felt like were forgivable, understandable ‚Äì she‚Äôd had a hard life; she was a broken person too, just in a different way.  
The first trip to the emergency room was written off as an accident even though my story was not particularly convincing, but after two more visits in as many months, one of the doctors began asking subtle questions about how healthy my relationship was.  
But I couldn‚Äôt see it. I still couldn‚Äôt bring myself to believe that I was one of¬†*those*¬†women.  
Nel cheated on me, twice. At least, twice that I found out about. Forgiving her was easy; there was no anger in me, and it made things so much more comfortable to just forget it and move on. While I couldn‚Äôt pretend it hadn‚Äôt happened, I could pretend, and even believe, that it didn‚Äôt really¬†*matter*. After all, Nel had come back to¬†*me*, rather than running off with those other women. And she‚Äôd probably only done it because there was so much I couldn‚Äôt be for her.  
My delusional naivety was inevitably rewarded in the end. Nel did leave me for one of those women, but not before she beat six shades of shit out of me just for the hell of it. And because she knew I‚Äôd never report her, and that I would eventually forgive her, just as I had done every other time.  
The ward hadn‚Äôt changed all that much since my long stay as a teenager. At least there was a better selection of TV shows this time around, to fill up the empty days around awkward visits from my mother and vicious 3am phonecalls from Nel.  
After listening to a particularly barbed string of drunken profanity on my answerphone, I finally changed my number.

¬†  
Mum asked why I didn‚Äôt seem to hate Nel. The few friends I‚Äôd recently reunited with were likewise baffled by the equanimity I displayed over the whole situation. Surely there was a spark of anger somewhere inside me, a tiny glowing ember that could be fanned into some good old-fashioned rage?  
I really tried. I dug around inside me, wrist-deep in the grey dirt of myself. I sought out therapist after therapist. I forced myself to remember every shitty thing that Nel had ever done to me ‚Äì replaying details that should have seared my cheeks scarlet with shame, or inflamed my mind white-hot with incandescent rage.  
Nothing real emerged.  
But I did remember the last time I felt a spark, the last time I could recall feeling anything true at all.  
Challinor Close was a more strenuous walk than I remembered. By the time I reached the curved brick boundary that surrounded the house, my legs were trembling, and my vision swam with little black fireflies. The gate opened before I could touch it, and the sure, strong hands of the cinnamon-eyed potion-maker caught me as I stumbled on wet moss. She guided me inside the cluttered house, and plied me with sweet, cool drinks until the shaking stopped.  
‚ÄúI need a potion from you,‚Äù I managed, my voice small in my ears, swallowed by the foliage in her kitchen. I had no idea how this all worked. She didn‚Äôt seem surprised, and her gaze was warm and bright as burnished copper.  
‚ÄúAnd what kind of potion would you like?‚Äù she burred, ‚ÄúA salve to mend your broken heart? Or perhaps an elixir to make another fall in love with you?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, not a love potion,‚Äù I answered, licking my lips, sticky with wild honey and sweet with the dust of old spices.  
‚ÄúThen what do you wish for?‚Äù  
It came in a flash of inspiration, one of those lightning moments of perfect clarity that only strike after extreme stress. Desperation pushes you to the edge, where you can think of unthinkable things.  
‚ÄúI want a¬†*hate*¬†potion.""

She led me through a vaulted hallway, all aglow with polished wood and old-fashioned lamps of curling iron and warped amber glass. The long corridor ran the full length of the house, ending in a back door, through which we emerged into the sweltering, womblike heat of the glass-domed hothouse. Sweat sprang forth on my upper lip immediately; the air felt syrupy and viscous, so humid that for a moment I felt like I was drowning. As the panic subsided, I took stock of my surroundings and forced myself to breathe normally again. The mad tropical garden was a maelstrom of scents and colours, even the light strangely tinted by the weathered curve of glass above us. Great, fleshy fronds of acid yellow grabbed and hooked at my clothes as I brushed past one plant, and sticky pollen dusted my sleeves, smelling of coconut and burning plastic. Huge orange flowerheads drooped from prehistoric jungle vines, and rubbery roots tangled my feet. Wafts of crushed apple and grass met my nostrils as I stumbled through, my shoes bursting tiny protruding nodules full of pungent moisture.  
The alien scents blended themselves into one great heady roil of musty, potent¬†*otherness*. I shied back from a giant pitcher plant, elaborate as a living pipe-organ, as it snapped shut its pink-veined trapdoor near my fingers.  
‚ÄúI want you to walk through the garden,‚Äù the woman told me, her voice oddly distorted, blanketed by the hot, heavy air, ‚Äúand pick those things which remind you of the one you wish to hate. Pick a piece of each, then return to me in the kitchen.‚Äù  
She handed me a woven basket, then left me to tend some other part of her strange domain. I walked listlessly through the dappled, giddy paths of the hothouse, my head hazy from the powerful smells surrounding me.  
I managed to do what she asked despite my malaise, finding it easier as I went deeper into the arboreal maze; here bloomed a black, greasy flower shaped like a dagger, which reminded me of Nel‚Äôs crudely-inked tattoos. I pulled at the stem, and it came away from the black-leafed plant with a soft¬†*pop*¬†and a waft of sickly rotten sweetness.  
It was soon joined by an angry crimson seedpod with wicked mohawk spines, a broad, scaly leaf colonised with tumours the same muddy blue as her eyes, and a woody thorn as long as my index finger, which leaked sour milky fluid from the tip. All of them made me think of Nel in some way, but they didn‚Äôt seem quite¬†*enough*.  
This part of the hothouse was dark and close, massive umbrellas of leaves blotting out much of the light. The air was even more moist here, and everything oozed and dripped - my shirt clung to me, sodden transparent with sweat, and my hair hung in damp ringlets.  
Everything was oversized. What looked very like a corpse flower bloomed to my left, the powerful carrion stench making me gag. Fat flies hovered, swarming around the lolling tongues of its petals. More huge plants loomed ahead in the murky green twilight, and the hairs on my arms and neck started to rise as I recognised the shapes of countless maws gaping wide in the gloom.  
Venus fly traps.  
But these were not the coin-sized mouths striped with jolly watermelon colours I recalled from my childhood. These were massive and angry, each hinged plate the size of a grown man. The spiky green ‚Äòteeth‚Äô were anything but cute and cartoon-comical; they were terrifying, and¬†*sharp*. All were open bar one, and each fringe of glossy green swords was drawn and ready, eager to impale anyone stupid enough to touch those soft, sweet-smelling tongues.  
But oh, how they reminded me of Nel. They were the perfect symbol; I‚Äôd fallen into her abusive trap and couldn‚Äôt get free, even though she was devouring me alive. Without further thought, I grabbed one of those vicious teeth with both hands, and snapped it off, yanking it clear of the closing jaws with a frenzied heave. My ingredients complete, I fled down the foetid, slippery paths and back to the blissful cool of the house. My hands dribbled a trail of bright blood all the way down the wooden floor of the hallway.

¬†  
I dozed on a pillow-drowned couch, exhausted from my ordeal, as the woman brewed my potion. In my limbo of half-dreams, I dimly registered the lilt of her rich contralto humming unfamiliar tunes as she worked, and chanting in a language that sounded faintly Germanic. It might have been hours or days before she roused me gently with a mug of steaming water that smelled of lemon and bergamot. As I cradled it, soothing my wounded palms with its welcome warmth, she placed a fluted glass vial on the plant-cluttered coffee table.  
‚ÄúIt is done.‚Äù She considered the faceted vessel for a moment, then regarded me just as carefully, as if I were more fragile and rare than the delicate container for her peculiar craft.  
‚ÄúThis is the first hate potion I have brewed, and I confess I don‚Äôt truly know how powerful it will be. My advice is to take a small sip first. If the effect is not strong enough, only then should you drink more.‚Äù  
I took the vial in my hands and inspected the potion. I realised I‚Äôd expected it to be black or red ‚Äì colours I naturally associated with hate ‚Äì but instead it was a cosmic whirl of dark blues and azures, shot through with green flecks.  
‚ÄúHow much do I owe you?‚Äù  
She shook her head,  
‚ÄúThere is no payment unless you are satisfied with the results. If the potion is what you desired, then we will discuss the fee.‚Äù  
I left her house with magic in my hands, and the searing heat of her kiss on each of my cheeks. My ears burned just as hot, inflamed by the memory of all the complicated teenage feelings I‚Äôd forgotten I had for this tall and mysterious older woman, all those years ago.  
The walk was easier downhill, although I suspected the potion maker‚Äôs refreshments also had something to do with that. My flat was a twenty minute bus ride away, and as I waited at the stop near my mother‚Äôs old house, I could only think of the fluted vial, now wrapped snugly in a scarf in my backpack. I knew that her potions worked. I knew that her curious talent was real; after all, I had been completely healed of the injuries from the accident.  
On the bus, I listened to heavy, angry music, turning it up until my headphones distorted and my ears hurt. I suppose I was hoping to spark some natural rage of my own, so that I wouldn‚Äôt need the potion. But it was the same as always, there was no anger to muster; all I could give myself was a headache.  
It was dusk when I pushed through the front door of my nearly-empty flat. Nel had taken most of our things while I was in hospital, so my furniture currently consisted of two beanbags, a folding camping table and chair, and a set of ugly drawers I‚Äôd bought from the second-hand shop down the road. The contrast with the beautiful, cluttered house of the potion maker made me feel like I was in a bad dream.  
I took two painkillers with a glass of water for my head, then I unstoppered the potion vial and took a tentative sip.  
It tasted like Nel.

¬†  
To say my sleep was troubled would be a gross understatement. I kicked and twisted in my sleeping bag, my restless bones finding no comfort from the thin foam yoga mat beneath me. When morning dawned cruel and clear, I was hollow-eyed and dangerously irritable, my skull still littered with the detritus of fragmented nightmares.  
When I slipped on the bathroom floor getting out of the shower, I swore. Nel had even taken the bath mat, and all I had was an ancient towel I used for the pool. Hot, poisonous thistles filled my head as the curse left my lips. And then a wave of excitement hit me like a fist.  
*This was anger!*  
As I brushed my teeth, I coddled the feeling. I let my mind roam over all the injustices visited on me by my ex-lover. I poured the thick, stinking syrup of them all into a single vessel, and stewed it until I felt the scalding rage sear my synapses. The euphoria in its wake was like a blast of steam.  
With a wordless keening of furious and beautiful hatred, I bunched my fist around my toothbrush and punched the mirror as hard as I could.  
The glass flexed, but did not break. Screaming again, I balled both fists into knots, and battered and hammered at my reflection until my knuckles wept red and shards of glass filled the sink.  
My laughter was giddy and delirious, a sound like nothing I‚Äôd heard from my own lips ever before. I spun like a child in the small bathroom, barely noticing the splinters embedding themselves in my feet.  
The potion had worked. It had really¬†*worked*. All my unexplored emotions could be free now. I would experience good, clean, healthy¬†*hatred*, and nobody like Nel would ever be able to control me again.  
And there were so many things I suddenly needed to say to her. And even more things I needed to do. Like get back all the fucking furniture the bitch had taken from me.

¬†  
I felt her shock when she opened the door of her newest lair to see me there, looking her dead in the eyes.  
‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù she snarled, already swinging the door closed.  
It bounced off my boot, planted firmly in the way. I smashed my shoulder into the flimsy wood, and it slammed back on its hinges, nearly knocking Nel off her feet. Her expression all startled goldfish, she couldn‚Äôt do anything but gape and stare as I shoved past her and into the place, already looking for the things she‚Äôd taken from me.  
‚ÄúYou need to get out,‚Äù she managed, but she sounded uncertain, not yet able to comprehend what was going on.  
‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I told her, fresh rage rising like bile in my throat as I looked at her pinched, hateful face, ‚Äúand listen. You have things of mine and I‚Äôm taking them back.‚Äù  
She started to speak, but I cut her off, vicious and clean as a razor,  
‚ÄúI said,¬†*Shut. The fuck. Up.*¬†Here‚Äôs a list,‚Äù I shoved a sheet of paper into her chest, ‚Äúof all the stuff I want taken back to my flat. If it‚Äôs not there by Friday, I‚Äôm going to take you to court, and you‚Äôll¬†*pay*¬†for¬†*new*¬†furniture.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this!‚Äù she spat, red-faced and already crumpling the list.  
‚ÄúOh, yes I fucking¬†*can*, you stupid slag,‚Äù the words were coming easier now, tripping off my tongue like profane poetry, ‚Äúand there isn‚Äôt one damn thing you can do about it.‚Äù  
I could see it all ticking over behind her eyes. Part of her was reeling in shock at her doormat growing a spine, but another, shrewder part of her nasty little mind had unsheathed its well-honed tools and was looking for a way to turn this to her advantage.  
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she began, eyes darting over the leather couch and glass cabinets, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry I did what I did, but‚Ä¶ but I did it for you. Clearly it‚Äôs helped you. I mean, look at you,‚Äù she choked out an unconvincing laugh, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all brimstone and pep, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre a whole different person.‚Äù  
Her fingers brushed my sleeve and she smiled. She probably intended it to be coy, but all I saw was a hyena,  
‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, it‚Äôs kinda hot.‚Äù  
Maybe I‚Äôd been planning on it all along. I‚Äôm still not certain, but I didn‚Äôt wear my Doc Martens much, they gave me blisters. My foot connected with her pubic bone before I knew what I was doing. As she collapsed sideways onto my couch, winded and clutching herself, I walked past her and to the door.  
‚ÄúFriday,‚Äù I reminded her, the steel in my voice scaring me slightly.  
I didn‚Äôt stop shaking for the next fifteen minutes. But God, I felt wonderfully, deliriously¬†*alive*.  
I hadn‚Äôt felt this real since before the accident.

¬†  
I awoke on Friday morning to sirens and shouting. I‚Äôd borrowed a camp bed from mum‚Äôs place and rolled out of it awkwardly, yanking the curtains open.  
On the sparse patch of grass in front of my flat, Nel had piled up every single thing I had demanded ‚Äì and then set them all on fire. It was such a perfectly¬†*Nel*¬†thing to do that I applauded grimly, standing barefoot on the smouldering lawn in my sunflower-print t-shirt and silk boxers. The blaze was quickly doused, but what the flames hadn‚Äôt ruined, the water finished off. A policewoman in an orange vest took my statement as her partner roped off the sodden, blackened wreckage, and I took great delight informing them that my evil ex had done this deliberately.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù the policewoman told me, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll sort this out.‚Äù  
She put away her little notebook and tucked her pen into the pocket of her vest,  
‚ÄúHave you got someone to help you clean up this mess?‚Äù  
I shook my head,  
‚ÄúNo, but never mind. I can deal with it.‚Äù  
The resounding, consuming hatred from the day before had subsided, only its echo remaining. I felt hollow, thin. The potion stood on the breakfast bar, pretty in the morning sun, and the stopper came out all too easily. As the taste of Nel slipped down my throat, I was drowned by an instant wave of nauseatingly pure¬†*hate*¬†for her, which resolved into a ball of acid that filled my gut to bursting.  
Getting the burned furniture onto the trailer was easy, with all that potent rage firing my muscles. Breaking into Nel‚Äôs place proved a little harder; she‚Äôd fixed the door, and it took me five good tries to kick it in.  
Once I was inside, it was easy again. I trundled barrow after barrow of the black detritus into her lounge, making sure I left filthy, sooty trails all through the house.  
My final act of petty, hateful revenge was saved for the bedroom. I squatted over her unmade bed and emptied my bladder, wiping myself with her pillowcase.  
‚ÄúYou might have been doing this longer than me,‚Äù I whispered to myself, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve got nearly a whole bottle of pure hatred to use up on you still.‚Äù

¬†  
The sound of the brick shattering the glass pane in my front door was sudden and huge. My heart leaped in my chest, watching Nel‚Äôs arm intrude through the hole she‚Äôd made, her hand feeling around blind for the new lock to let herself in.  
She was furious. She was beyond furious. She‚Äôd always been the proud owner of powerful resting bitchface, even completely relaxed she was intimidating enough. But seeing her truly angry enough to kill, my stomach flipped with queasy fear. I scrambled sideways out of the beanbag and stumbled toward the kitchen.  
‚ÄúWho the¬†*FUCK*¬†do you think you are?‚Äù she screamed, punctuating every word with staccato, stabbing gestures, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where you found the fucking balls to do it, but by the time I‚Äôm done with you, you‚Äôll never be able to take a piss again.‚Äù  
The was a knife in the kitchen drawer, but Nel would know that. She‚Äôd always been able to read me like a book; she‚Äôd see me going for it and stop me before I could get to it. I dredged deep for the rage and hate that had filled me earlier, but there was only the shallowest pool inside me now; barely enough to wet my toes.  
On the breakfast bar, so close, was the bottle, still mostly full. Flecks of green winked under the fluorescent kitchen lights, deep as the shadows of an ancient forest.  
‚ÄúFeel like a drink?‚Äù I asked Nel as she stalked toward me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs good stuff. Put hairs on your chest.‚Äù  
Thrown off balance by my tone, she paused for just a moment, quizzical, as I grabbed the vial and thumbed out the stopper.  
In that pregnant pause, I drank it all down, heedless of the consequences.  
I remember Nel‚Äôs face, twisted with fury, coming toward me. And then the flames claimed me.  
No longer orange-red, nor even white-hot, this blaze was impossible ‚Äì a luminous blue that incinerated all reason, a nova of the purest hatred, igniting nuclear fire in the core of my being.

¬†  
Reality flickered through the fire, sporadic images. Nel crying out in pain. Blood slicking my hands. Flashes of streets, crumbling brick. Alien yet familiar smells, and the gentle, moist caress of fleshy flora against my burning limbs. Then the angry, hungry mouths of the enormous Venus traps gaped before me. Their fringed jowls quivered and rippled as I forced Nel‚Äôs head in amongst the soft sensor filaments, fine as cat whiskers.  
They closed more slowly than I thought they would, but not slowly enough for her to escape, not in her state. The glossy green daggers slid slickly through her hands and calves, and the red flesh of those pillowy mouths moulded around her, already weeping something both corrosive and sweet.  
The cinnamon-eyed woman found me asleep in her solar, curled up amongst all the cushions, bathed in blood and ichor. She did not scold me, nor did she kick me out of her home. Instead, she made me a pot of sweet tea, which instantly eased the towering hate-hangover that still pounded in my head.  
‚ÄúIt worked,‚Äù I said, knowing she would know I meant the potion.  
‚ÄúYes. And thank you for your payment,‚Äù she replied, her eyes soft as brown sugar, her cheeks dimpled as fruit, ‚Äúmy Venus child is ever so grateful.‚Äù  
My stomach churned tea. The events of the previous night flashed through my skull, the horrific and impossible thing that I had done.  
‚ÄúShush now,‚Äù she said, placing a warm finger on my lips, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs done is done ‚Äì and if anyone deserved such a fate, it was she.‚Äù Her touch banished my terror and guilt like a salve on a burn. I hadn‚Äôt realised how empty I felt until she continued, ‚ÄúNow, if you‚Äôre up to it, I thought we might get a little brunch.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

The potion is easy enough to make, and I have rows of pretty glass bottles on the shelf.  
Nel is still here, pressed between the corrosive folds of the plant‚Äôs fleshy maw. Her skin is slowly sloughing off, and her nutrients are mostly supped away, but she‚Äôs still very much alive. It seems it is hideously painful, to be awake and aware as such a plant consumes you. But as I sip my potion and listen to her whimpers, I bask reverently in the sound, and in the hatred that suffuses me. The waves of pleasure it gives me are nearly orgasmic, and I feel so real. So full.  
My new mistress tells me that there is another potion that we can brew, this one all for Nel. It will slow the process, prolonging her life nearly indefinitely. Even as her bones dissolve, she will know exactly what‚Äôs happening to her.  
I wonder if it will taste like me?

1h1d7rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenMarriage/comments/1h1d7rc/not_sure_if_this_is_worth_it_anymore/,Not sure if this is worth it anymore.,"Background. M55. I work out regularly. Average appearance, a little extra pounds but these have been coming off ‚Äì building up muscle (dropped from 255 to 220 and went from a size 44 waist to a 36 waist). I dress well (Usually business casual as I work in a white collar gig. Nice dress shoes, three button shirt with kaki‚Äôs). Have my own place as well as a place to hang out or otherwise entertain if there was something going on. In an open marriage as the wife cannot have sex due to medical reasons which I am not getting into.

Over the last few years since opening, meeting people that I actually want to meet and get to know have become few and far between. The women I do meet, I flat out don‚Äôt want a damned thing to do with them.

Case 1. I‚Äôm out running errands and stuck in a line at Lowes of all places. I see a person that I am interested in at least talking to. I‚Äôm looking for wedding rings and anything that should tell me to back off before I even say hello. I comment ‚ÄòHi. Nice day isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô Just something to see if there is even ANY interest. If nothing else, kill a minute or two while waiting in line.

It almost ALWAYS goes without fail. The woman looks at me dead in the eye and walks away without saying a word, or I get the resting bitch face like I had pee‚Äôed on her car or something. It was the resting bitch face this time (with a sneer! for the extra points). I shrug and walk off to the register and check out. Not a big deal but WTF? Who would even WANT to put up with that?

Case 2. I manage to meet a woman, talk to her for a few minutes while out and she doesn‚Äôt seem like there are issues. So we‚Äôre texting and I as always say ‚ÄòHey do you want to chat for a few minutes over coffee, or a quick lunch?‚Äô

I got the MOST grief for that question. ¬†‚ÄòI don‚Äôt do coffee dates.‚Äô ¬†And I got read the riot act about that how she was better for than that. And I am sitting there wondering ‚Ä¶ HUH? I could have said my reasons for a coffee date. It‚Äôs not that I am unsure of the woman, it‚Äôs the fact I wasn‚Äôt sure I even wanted to a relationship with this person, and I wanted to see if there was anything to pursue. The only thing I could respond with was ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs no. OK!‚Äù then blocked the number.

This crap is crazy. Is it just me or is this just not worth it? I find myself thinking ‚Äì see a band with friends. Go play guitar with friends and have a drunken jam session. Go work on my old truck that I am trying to restore. Work on the side hustle. Hit the gym more. Hang out with the wife (I may not get laid but hey... its better than wasting time and money).

1h1d65i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1h1d65i/insomnia_but_incredibly_tired/,Insomnia but incredibly tired,"Hello fellow quitters!

I am at a little over 5 weeks (I believe, I don't even know anymore) and I am still suffering from insomnia.
It has gotten a little better but I still wake up around 3AM every night and can't go back to sleep. I get around 5 hours of sleep on a good day.

When I'm off in the afternoon, I fall asleep on the couch because I just can't fight it anymore, but I try to not sleep longer than 1 hour. And this doesn't happen every day, but max. twice a week.

Here is what I do/don't do:
- I take non-chemical sleeping aids and melatonin spray every night
- I drink 3 liters of water every day (always have)
- I only drink 1 cup of coffee early in the morning. No tea or soda  during the day
- I work out 3-4 times a week
- I go for a walk on most days
- I eat my fruits and veggies
- I tried a vitamin C and amino acids cure, didn't help
- I take magnesium daily


How can I get over this sucky feeling? I feel so tired all the time that I'm slowly slipping into a blues and I really don't want that.
I asked my GP about it 3 weeks ago and she said ""well, all you can do is fight through it"".
 
But when does it get better? I'm walking on my gums here and feel like breaking down any day (not smoking related, but health-wise). Still doing great quitting, pheeewwww!

FYI: sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my first language. 

So by the time the story happened me (19) and let‚Äôs call her Flower (25) got hired to travel overseas to work in a really cool company, since we were going to live together I send her a text (the company provided us the telephone numbers since we were going to be stuck in planes for 36 hours) and I wanted to meet the person I was going to be stuck in a plane with for more than a day. So from here weird stuff begins so get ready for this roller coaster. All context is needed to get to the point don‚Äôt worry. 

So we agreed on meeting in a coffee shop, the weird part she was there with her parents, and all the time her parents were answering questions for her to the point that I made a joke like I would love to know about you from you haha. But after the most awkward 30 minutes I went home with a really weird feeling of it. 

So after that we meetup at the airport to travel to the other side of the world and 36 hours of planes, stops and security. All those 36 hours this woman kept me awake and when we landed I was so sleep deprived that I was sleeping all the way to the apartments. The apartments where in a frat house which was cool the big issues started here this lady had no knowledge of English (needed for work and living in this country) and since was a new country she decided that her name ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù was going to be ‚ÄúRose‚Äù because it‚Äôs a flower (like wtf) 

I didn‚Äôt wanted her as a friend but a lot happened and she needed a disciplinary call because she didn‚Äôt when to work the 8 hours needed and she worked in a kindergarten and took babies of 1 year OUT OF THE KINDER WITHOUT PERMISION so they asked me to be a translator since apparently she couldn‚Äôt understand. Here is when she mention her fianc√©e ( 1 month after arrival at this new country) and me and the sponsor where completely baffled by it. She mention that this man (59) was going to marry her and that she didn‚Äôt had to go to work, no time after she got fired.

Her answer was making a weird FAKE sue to the company including my name for mistreatment, when the HR called me I had no clue of it and her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù was the layer that I forge my signature. After that her photo and her fianc√©e where in the door of my house with dangerous don‚Äôt let them in note in them.

Almost a year later I had forgotten about this woman buuuuuut she sent me an invite for her birthday, which some friends of the frat wanted to go and convince me to go with them.

In this party was her fianc√©e which was MEGA OLD and when to sleep at 8 leaving her and 10 people downstairs in his mother‚Äôs house. I was really uncomfortable since my boyfriend at that time was from Irak and the mother of this guy was attacking him and at some point tried to grab him to search he didn‚Äôt had a bomb or that he wasn‚Äôt dangerous. When we wanted to leave she stood on the door and didn‚Äôt let us out screaming that I was going to die. I forcefully move her and we left BUT our friends stayed.

At 5 am I got a call from one of the friends that stayed in the party asking me to pick him up from the police station and to prepare tea since he was ready to spill it. I picked him up and the first thing he mentioned was that ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù got punched several times by her fianc√©e. I gasped bc the story was worst than what I knew since the mother of this man yelled at Flower to pick up the mess of the party now and when she didn‚Äôt she yelled for her son (flower‚Äôs fiancee) to put her on her place and that she was rude to her (mother of Flower‚Äôs fianc√©e) 

When I knew this I send her a text saying like hey we are not friends but that situation is bad like here we have rooms if you need them and basic human care to be honest‚Ä¶ 
She mentioned that he ask forgiveness and that also sent her roses like her ‚Äúname‚Äù yeah sureeeeee 

So I sent her mom a text to try to take her out of there bc if police in this country gets involved is bc neighbors called bc she was yelling to be helped and for him to stop, and this was not the first time this happened 

The mom of Flower never answered but she sent me a whatsapp and I quote the following: 
‚ÄúYou are an asshole by inventing that he punches me, he only kicks me and slaps me, you want to ruin my marriage but it won‚Äôt work, you jealous bitch, your boyfriend will kill you‚Äù 

So I stopped being sorry for her, after years of this more than 5 she is married to the guy and cross with one of my friends where she commented that I was an asshole by trying to ruing her marriage, her future and her visa (the marriage I guess) ",6,1732736976.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I was hoping for some input regarding a family friendly espresso machine around $300 to pair with my Breville Smart Pro Grinder. 

Since many people of varying espresso tastes will be using this machine, milk frothing quality is important as well as ease of use (sadly no Gaggia Classic due to having to time or weigh shots). I personally would also like high quality plain espresso out of this machine too. 

  
Right now I've got the list down to the [Breville Bambino](https://www.breville.com/en-us/product/bes450) (non-plus) ($300) and the [Delonghi Dedica Maestro Plus](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/dedica-maestro-plus-espresso-machine-with-automatic-steam-wand/p/EC950M) ($330). 

To my inexperienced eye, the Maestro Plus looks like it's more comparable to the Bambino Plus than the Bambino, making the Maestro Plus a fantastic deal. I am wary of purchasing something that is so new though, with the Bambino having possibly many more years of build refinement going into it than the Maestro Plus. 

I have seen that the 51mm portafilters of the Delonghi Dedicas require a little corser of a grind than 54mm portatilers like Breville do. Since I have my own grinder, does this matter? Tom's Coffee Corner seemed to prefer the taste of plain espresso and the milk quality of the Maestro over the Bambino Plus once the Maestro was given slightly corser grinds.

So, let‚Äôs get into it. This apartment has plain white walls and natural wooden floors. To make it very warm yet looking quite chic, let‚Äôs get a special something like a large canvas wall art. A piece with tones on a more neutral note in a vibrant key, like a minimalist painting, something like this image from ihomeart.com. It will harmonize with the clean design and look best in the room. It‚Äôs unnecessary to overdo it. One large piece of artwork on a small modern sofa or over a dining table will suffice. Furniture should be as small as possible, but all of the essentials should be included. I am talking about a loveseat to save space on the floor. Softness may be introduced with either a round coffee table or a wooden glass top. Caring for living elements is easier than caring for artefacts, thus, introducing one or two plants, such as a fiddle leaf fig. There are many ways to choose functional but beautiful light: a popular brass lampshade will help. Some of the other beautiful concepts that need to be incorporated include using area rugs to demarcate the zones. Storage is the key to every studio out there. For space-saving, choose pieces with multiple uses, such as an ottoman with storage inside or a bed with incorporated drawers.¬†

- Never been a Lisa fan and this was another thing that kinda highlighted why I disliked her. She always makes everything about herself, and while I do feel bad for the way the show exploited her trauma, she fails to take any responsibility for anything she says or does and just blames Top Model for everything. If you hated being on Cycle 5, then why did you come back for all stars? She said she was touring/making music at this time so I don‚Äôt think she was needing money from Top Model at the time
- I love Sarah (C9) both on the show and now.

She just seems like a sweet, want to grab a coffee with type of girl and I like that she‚Äôs just like a typical, non-celebrity type of person.

He ended up giving me the bird without charge when I met up with him, and he couldn't get her out of the cage saying she'd attack him any time he tried, so there I was driving down the highway with a full-size poor condition bird cage and a goffins who was very plucked and... only had one eye.  

I got her to the vet right away, and she was very slightly elevated for abv.  She was already being isolated from my own flock, and I was trying to give her meds daily.  We made the decision to try celebrex. which is twice a day, and it just wasn't something I was able to do while also caring for my own two.  I couldn't find anyone to help, and my mom offered to take her in to get her through the meds.   I was really nervous, she'd bitten me twice, hard (but had after that, realized I was pretty fun to be around, and would take treats, come out of her cage and hang out close to me, dancing and chattering - never a cuddly bird but she'll lean in for head scratches).   

But, here's the thing, my mom, always an animal lover, but starting this journey cold, started making her fresh chop, and since she was struggling a bit with the meds, figured out a green bean trick that got all the meds eaten twice a day.  She's retired and while she's active she's around a lot, and Winnie is in her living room with an open cage from morning to night.   

The first pic is her hanging out with me at my office, the second, is how she was looking right before I took her up to my mom, and the last pic is a fluffy belly.  I'm really blown away by how well she's done bonding with her.   She is, I don't think jealous, but definitely wishes Winnie would approach her more, and I just try to keep reassuring her that the fact that she's constantly dancing, calling for my mom whenever she's in another room, exploring, and for a 12-year old girl, regrowing feathers is a bigger sign of happiness than anything else.  

Anyway, this girl clearly had a rough life before now, her missing eye is kind of not a great sign (old injury though and healed, and she gets by well).  if any of you 'too peeps have any other words of encouragement, let me know and I'll share with her, but mostly, I wanted to share my good feels for someone who will never be on reddit.    Love this girl and so happy to see her thriving when I couldn't give her what she needed.

Takeaways



‚Ä¢	AI services have different forms and names, like chatbot, AI assistant, intelligent assistant, voice assistant, IVA, etc.

‚Ä¢	It has been discussed in many areas: tourism, e-commerce, chat, offline service(caf√©), ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢	Various influential factors towards consumer attitudes, purchases, CBRs, ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢	One article mentioned uncanny valley, which sounds interesting. Are AI going to be more human-like, then just like a human, or beyond?

‚Ä¢	Still a new area, do not have much literature (these are almost everything, excluded those studies unrelated to AI service), and most articles published in 2024. A lot of articles in CS area and some are just prospects, why these things were accepted by journals???? Another thing is, many teams are designing new systems/ models for AI service bots, which are fun but also not included in here.

Cheng, Y., & Jiang, H. (2022). Customer‚Äìbrand relationship in the era of artificial intelligence: understanding the role of chatbot marketing efforts. Journal of Product & Brand Management, 31(2), 252-264.

Analyzed chatbot marketing efforts (CMEs), whose variables are interaction, information, accessibility, entertainment and customization. Results showed that CMEs have significant direct effects on the quality of communication with chatbot agents and indirectly affect customer‚Äìbrand relationships (CBR) and customer response. CBR mediates the association between communication quality and customer response.

Studied robot barista, refers to comparing the coffee shops with human or robot (one arm model, not humanoid). Brand experience affects brand satisfaction, consumers have different brand experience perceptions and satisfaction levels when they are served by different types of baristas, which include human baristas and robot baristas, in a coffee shop. Brand satisfaction had a positive influence on brand attitude, brand attachment, and brand loyalty. The moderating role of type of employee was found.



Bergner, A. S., Hildebrand, C., & H√§ubl, G. (2023). Machine talk: How verbal embodiment in conversational AI shapes consumer‚Äìbrand relationships. Journal of Consumer Research, 50(4), 742-764.

Mentioned a theory called social process of human dialogue. Results showed that dialogue properties enhance the perceived humanness of the interface, which in turn promotes more intimate consumer‚Äìbrand relationships and more favorable behavioral brand outcomes (greater recommendation acceptance, willingness to pay a price premium, brand advocacy, and brand loyalty). Moreover, we show that these effects are reduced in contexts requiring less mutual understanding between the consumer and the brand.



Yu, S. Y. (2021). Research on user experience and brand attitudes of chatbots. International Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 15(8), 698-704.

Users who have high trust in using chatbots can easily enhance brand acceptance and easily accept brand messages, extend the trust of chatbots to trust in the brand, and develop a positive attitude towards the brand.



Yang, C., & Hu, J. (2022). When do consumers prefer AI-enabled customer service? The interaction effect of brand personality and service provision type on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Journal of Brand Management, 29(2), 167-189.

	Tested brand personality (sincere vs. competence) and customer service provision type (human-staffed vs. AI-enabled) on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Consumers prefer AI-enabled customer service when the brand personality is competence and human-staffed service when the brand personality is sincerity. These preferences lead to more positive brand attitudes and higher purchase intentions. Perceived brand authenticity mediates the above relationships. Consumer involvement has a moderating effect, brand personality-service provision alignment‚Äôs positive effects emerge for high-involvement consumers but not for low-involvement consumers.

	Tested brand image (cool vs non-cool). The results indicated that the adoption of AI by cool brands can foster the right feeling and enhance consumers‚Äô positive brand attitudes. Employing human staff did not lead to improved brand attitudes toward non-cool brands. Service failure moderated the matching effect between service agents and cool brand images on brand attitude. The matching effect was observed under successful service conditions, but it disappeared when service failure occurred.



Zhang, Y., & Wang, S. (2023). The influence of anthropomorphic appearance of artificial intelligence products on consumer behavior and brand evaluation under different product types. Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 74, 103432.

	This study considered the anthropomorph level of AI and product types. Research design is (anthropomorphic design: anthropomorphic vs. non-anthropomorphic) √ó 2 (product type: hedonic vs. utilitarian). The findings revealed that for hedonic AI products, anthropomorphic appearance improves consumers' purchase intention and brand evaluation through perceived entertainment, and intelligence level significantly moderates the mediating effect of perceived entertainment; while for practical AI products, anthropomorphic appearance improves consumers' purchase intention and brand evaluation through perceived usefulness, and intelligence level does not significantly moderate the mediating effect of perceived usefulness. There is no significant moderating effect of intelligence level on perceived usefulness.

	This article studied Microsoft Xiaobing, an AI chatbot launched in China. I remember many trendy social media posts complaining about its sexual discriminatory statements in conversations. The team fixed it soon, but I believe the humanistic aspect of the chatbot needs more attention. Results shows that regarding the IQ and EQ of AI chatbots, the multi-dimensional social support model helps explain consumers' interactant satisfaction with communication, which facilitates affective attachment and purchase intention. Suggesting that chatbots should emphasize emotional and esteem social support more than informational support.



Youn, S., & Jin, S. V. (2021). In AI we trust?‚Äù The effects of parasocial interaction and technopian versus luddite ideological views on chatbot-based customer relationship management in the emerging ‚Äúfeeling economy. Computers in Human Behavior, 119, 106721.

Mentioned customer relationship management (CRM). Theory bases are personality theory and parasocial interaction, which are valuable references for me. Results: Chatbots can form virtual assistantship versus virtual friendship with customers. Chatbots can represent a brand in customer relationship management (CRM). Brand personality perception and parasocial interaction (PSI) affect CRM. Virtual friend chatbots induce stronger PSI than virtual assistant chatbots. Technopians and luddites respond differently to AI-manifested brand personality.

	It‚Äôs a 2 (locus of agency: high vs. low) by 2 (brand image-voice congruity: congruent vs. incongruent). Used ANOVA to analyze, and results revealed that human-centric (vs. machine-centric) agency led to higher perceived control. The interaction effect was significant, indicating the importance of congruency between brand image and VAs' voices. SEM results confirmed that perceived control predicted brand loyalty fully mediated by flow experience and consumer happiness.

	A research in the tourism area. This article mentioned that some consumers rejection of the use of AI devices because of their needs for social contact (Gursoy et al. 2019). Findings suggest that tourists‚Äô acceptance of the use of AI devices in both service contexts is influenced by social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance and effort expectancy, and emotions toward the artificially intelligent devices. Findings further suggest that social influence is a stronger determinant in hospitality services compared to airline services. Tourists have higher performance expectancy from AI devices used to provide airline services compared to hospitality services. Tourists‚Äô willingness to accept the use of AI devices for delivering hospitality services is lower than airline services.



Xia, Z., & Shannon, R. (2024). CONCEPTUALIZING AI-CHATBOT APPLICATION AS AN E-SERVICE AGENT TO DEVELOP A CUSTOMER-BRAND RELATIONSHIP. Operational Research in Engineering Sciences: Theory and Applications, 7(1).

	Using the A-B-C model(cognitive (thinking), affective (feeling), and behavioral (doing) components) examines various external factors namely interaction, perceived enjoyment, customization, and problem-solving capabilities have positive and significant relationship with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude and customer brand relationship. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use also have significant relationship with attitude and customer brand relationship. The study also identifies the affective component of attitude as a key predictor of customer-brand relationship outcomes.



Balakrishnan, J., & Dwivedi, Y. K. (2024). Conversational commerce: entering the next stage of AI-powered digital assistants. Annals of Operations Research, 333(2), 653-687.

This one mentioned perceived animacy, which I think is important. Human when strongly attached to a tool, they personify at least to an abstract level. However, they may not wholly perceive it as a living thing but animate it to that level. Psychology research state this phenomenon as perceived animacy (Shultz & McCarthy, 2014). Animacy can be defined as believing objects as living beings that can interact and move on with their own rules. Also mentioned uncanny valley theory and try to explain the consumers‚Äô preference of anthropomorphic level of AI. Theory: Technology Acceptance Model (perceive ease of use, perceived usefulness). Tested Perceived anthropomorphism, Perceived intelligence, Perceived animacy. Finding shows that perceived anthropomorphism plays the most significant role in building a positive attitude and purchase intention through digital assistants.



Prentice, C., Loureiro, S. M. C., & Guerreiro, J. (2023). Engaging with intelligent voice assistants for wellbeing and brand attachment. Journal of Brand Management, 30(5), 449-460.

	Mentioned self-determination and motivation of expectancy, I also believe they are vital. Results show that the consumer‚Äôs need for autonomy, sense of competence, and relatedness are significantly related to IVA engagement. Consumer wellbeing also had a significant mediation effect on the relationship between engagement and brand attachment.

	 In tourism area. Tested the effects of informal language (vs. formal language) and invitational rhetoric (present vs. absent).  Found that chatbots using informal language or invitational rhetoric increase one's brand attitude via social presence. Brand familiarity only moderated the findings when the chatbot used invitational rhetoric: participants who were familiar with the brand experienced more social presence when the chatbot messages contained invitational rhetoric. Perceived humanness of chatbots can be increased by adopting a communication style consisting of informal language and invitational rhetoric.

I have never had a good relationship with food, thanks to my mom and internalized anorexia. Before pandemic, my body was healthy, i was active and i was thin. I was never skinny cause i have a sweet tooth (or insuline resistance..?) But during pandemic and thinking everything has stopped i just ate and ate. I gained like 60lbs/ roughly 30kgs. Then it never stopped i kept gaining. Only time i lost weight was when i walked 20k steps a day and ate a sandwich, protein bar, coffee in a day. And when i stopped those steps and started eating i gained weight so easy. I think a part of me knows only way i can lose wieght is due to starvation, therefore i either starve or binge. It is just so exhausting. Diets are never sustainable and i dont have the money for therapy. I am so sick of this, i just want to cry cause it is so hard to look at something you dont like everyday.

I'm also not done with my psychiatric assessments (there are still some suspicions that need to be addressed), so I wanted to wait and see everything and then decide if I'll try meds. basic info: I'm 21 AFAB, but identify as nonbinary.

how do I manage my adhd without medication, while being genuinely burnt out? I have tried maintaining routine, but I get bored and tired of it after three days max. I can barely force myself to go to bed at 2am because I always want to do more, but I also have to wake up early every day. I have no energy to do my university coursework and I spend most of my time doomscrolling because my brain is so tired from constantly thinking. I try to regulate my sudden bursts of motivation with coffee, so that I'm motivated more often, but I don't really like coffee and after a while it makes me anxious and has an opposite effect. I also can't really do to do lists or any kind of organization techniques because everything bores me after a while. 

I managed to survive until now, but barely. however, the burnout is growing stronger and I'm losing more energy day by day, and my symptoms for everything are getting worse (I'm also under assessment for autism, and there's also perhaps an underlying personality disorder). the main issue I would like to tackle is my sleep schedule and controlling the maladaptive daydreaming and my hyperactive mind (especially at night).

Another loop, another series of experienced events. By now, Will had stopped paying attention to anything going on. Everything was so familiar that it had become background music.

His first instinct was to rush to the parking lot mirror pole, when he suddenly remembered‚ÄîAlex had only agreed to lend him the thief class for one loop. The same could be said for Jace.

*It‚Äôs better this way*, Will reluctantly told himself. He needed more experience before attempting the wolf challenge again. With luck, maybe the boss would grant them a reward that would prove useful.

‚ÄúA reminder to all students,‚Äù the announcement echoed through the halls as Will made his way to the bathroom. ‚ÄúWe remind you to take care of your physical and mental health. There is no shame in seeking help. The school counselor‚Äôs door is open at all times.‚Äù

Hearing it felt particularly awkward given that he carried a version of Daniel in his pocket. If the former rogue had been true to his word, there wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything stopping them from defeating the final elite on the second floor.

‚ÄúBro!‚Äù Alex appeared a step away, just as Will acquired his class. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd it go?‚Äù

Anyone‚Äôs immediate reaction would have been to jump away or attack the goofball. Logically, it was impossible for him to have arrived there. The door was closed and Will was fairly certain that there hadn‚Äôt been anyone in the bathroom when he had arrived.

‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù he gave a vague reply. ‚ÄúI might need to borrow your class again at some point.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery sus, bro.‚Äù Alex shook his head. ‚ÄúYou tried the wolf challenge, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

There was no point in denying it. For all Will knew, his friend might have been there sneaking in the school while he leveled up. In theory, lacking a class prevented it, but as Danny had said, permanent skills provided a constant bonus, and Alex had been stuck in eternity for a very long time.

‚ÄúWhat wave did you reach?‚Äù Alex took out a muffin and bit off half of it, along with the paper.

‚ÄúEight.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor real?‚Äù The goofball almost choked. ‚ÄúLit! I ran off at five.‚Äù

For a single class thief that was rather impressive. It also put things into perspective.

‚ÄúHow many copies did you use?‚Äù

‚ÄúBro,‚Äù Alex laughed. ‚ÄúNot enough. Those great wolves are vicious.‚Äù

Funny. From Will‚Äôs perspective, they were the lesser obstacle.

‚ÄúOnce we pass the tutorial, we must get the band to try again. For real!‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù That was the last thing Will wanted. ‚ÄúHelen might not be up to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs already got her class, bro.‚Äù Alex grinned. ‚ÄúI helped.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you did.‚Äù Taking one last glance at the bathroom mirror, Will left the room.

Alex didn‚Äôt follow him, but by the time Will got into the classroom, he found him already there. The chemical smell seemed a lot more bearable this time, possibly because all the windows were already open.

Helen was at her usual desk, reading an actual paper book. It wasn‚Äôt the first time she had been seen to do so, though more often than not, she‚Äôd be holding a school textbook or nothing at all.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Will tossed his backpack on Daniel‚Äôs desk and went up to Helen.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she replied without looking up.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù he asked, looking closely at the book cover. ‚ÄúSapphire Diode?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a combination he expected.

‚ÄúScience fiction short stories.‚Äù The girl put the book away without further explanation. ‚ÄúJace told me about the crafter skill,‚Äù she looked at him. ‚ÄúDid you try it out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Will nodded. There were several more things he wished to share, but he felt that it wasn‚Äôt the time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strong.‚Äù

The door opened and closed as Jace entered the room, almost as if he had heard them talking about him.

‚ÄúHey, Stoner,‚Äù he immediately said. ‚ÄúDid you try it out?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were just talking about that.‚Äù Will took a step away from Helen‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs useful with other classes. Also, it combines weapons.‚Äù

‚ÄúCombines in what way?‚Äù

‚ÄúI used the chain and my dagger to make a chain blade.‚Äù

‚ÄúLit,‚Äù Alex managed to say, impressed by the combination of words alone.

‚ÄúBut I needed the knight‚Äôs skills to use it. You won‚Äôt be able to fight on your own.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, what else is new?‚Äù Jace went up to him. ‚ÄúSo do we continue?‚Äù he asked, then looked at Helen.

Will did the same. Only Alex remained by the window, as if looking outside.

‚ÄúDo we need to finish the tutorial?‚Äù Helen asked. ‚ÄúThings are fine now. Boring, but fine. The further we go, the more dangerous it becomes. I‚Äî‚Äù she abruptly stopped. ‚ÄúDanny pushed the limit every day until he didn‚Äôt. The same might happen to us.‚Äù

Behind his back, Will clenched his fists.

‚ÄúIt might be worse if we don‚Äôt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt know. You said there were five names on the leaderboard. That means there are five groups in the tutorial. If what Danny said about the classes is true, there‚Äôs one group that hasn‚Äôt started. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt want to end up being last on the list.‚Äù

No one said it openly, but they all knew what he was implying. Usually, it was the last of the list to be cut.

‚ÄúAlright, we continue then,‚Äù the girl said.

‚ÄúThis time we go in force. We get as many mirrors as we can.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll get any shit I can use to upgrade stuff,‚Äù Jace added.

Will nodded.

‚ÄúAlso, we level up according to a plan.‚Äù

The discussion came to an end as other classmates started arriving. Helen was joined by her clique; the jocks went back to making stupid jokes at Will‚Äôs expense. Jace joined in, of course, but he was playing along. There even was a fake fight, which Will used to increase his loop length. When the teacher arrived, shortly later, the boredom of school began.

On the surface, everything continued the same as always. Will, along with the other looped, played their parts in an eternity they were familiar with. And still, all of them, without exception, were thinking of things to come. There was a good chance that this might be the loop to end the tutorial. A certain amount of excitement and anxiety came with that. Would the final boss turn out to be as strong as the hidden one they‚Äôd faced? What would the rewards be? And, most important of all, what would happen afterwards?

There was a good chance that the end of the tutorial could remove whatever protection the group had, putting them at the archer‚Äôs mercy. On the other hand, that hadn‚Äôt stopped him before. The person did whatever he wished, whether there were restrictions or not.

After class, a car came up to pick Helen home. The three boys were left to their own devices. It was agreed that they get as many materials as they could, and also level up in the process. Since he knew the area, Alex hung out with Jace, helping him to level up as much as possible before the school run. Will did the same, using the partial reward he‚Äôd gotten from the wolf challenge.

Going to several of the locations on his fragment map, Will managed to kill enough wolves to reach level five.



**PARALYSIS RESISTANCE**

**Diminish the effects of poisons on you.**



**BACKSTAB**

**Perform a weak but unexpected attack with a sharp weapon.**



**ROGUE‚ÄôS SENSE**

**Spot hidden traps and mechanisms.**



The latest set of skills stared at him from the mirror‚Äôs surface. Waiting patiently for the wolf corpses to fade out of existence, Will tapped the mirror again to claim his wolf pack reward. Sadly, all he received was a one-hour loop extension.

Unlike the last loop, the random skills were pretty bad this time. None of them were permanent, and they all had to do with increased weight and inventory capacity. Hopefully, once the tutorial was over he could take advantage by challenging all the elites the group had faced and obtaining some loot drops.

Just as Will was about to leave the basement he had snuck into, two red messages appeared on the mirror.¬†¬†



**CLASS DUPLICATION!**



**Only one rogue can be present.**

**Freezing eternity.**



‚ÄúYo.‚Äù Danny‚Äôs reflection appeared in the mirror.

Instantly, Will reached into his pocket to check his fragment. It was there in perfect condition. Hastily, the boy went through all the sections. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any changes, and yet the former rogue had managed to make an appearance unchallenged.

‚ÄúChill. I haven‚Äôt run off,‚Äù he said, amused by Will‚Äôs concern. ‚ÄúJust wanted to have a chat before you deal with the boss.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt challenge you,‚Äù Will uttered.

‚ÄúChallenge is your way to call me. I‚Äôve got other means to call you.‚Äù

This wasn‚Äôt something that had been mentioned before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to end the tutorial, right?‚Äù Danny pressed on.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the plan.‚Äù Will tried to appear calm.

‚ÄúOkay. After you kill the boss, I want you to press the fragment against him. Doesn‚Äôt have to be anywhere specific. Just do it before Helen fades him away.‚Äù

Several red flags popped up in Will‚Äôs mind.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you, five?‚Äù Danny smirked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking you. That should be enough.‚Äù

That was the problem with their agreement. In theory, Will was free to refuse, but there was no telling what damage his former classmate would do if that were the case. It was already illustrated that he could appear in mirrors at will. Quite possibly, he had other tricks up his sleeve.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be easy,‚Äù Will said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll be facing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll handle it. You‚Äôre a rogue, after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I get any help? Some assistance or info or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll lend a hand. Provided there‚Äôs an intact mirror anywhere there. You‚Äôll have to snatch the weapons before anyone sees them, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôll do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, we have a deal. Remember. You must do it before Helen gets the loot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do what I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and make sure Alex doesn‚Äôt see you.‚Äù

This was unexpected. The goofball had the tendency of being overly nosy, but why would Danny be so concerned?

‚ÄúDid something happen between you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him. And neither should you. Consider this a freebie.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery funny. How about you give me some actual‚Äî‚Äù

As Will blinked, he found that he was talking to himself. Danny‚Äôs reflection was gone, as were the red messages. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the entire time freeze, one might consider this whole thing a trick of the mind.

Will looked at the mirror fragment. He had the option of challenging Danny to continue the conversation. Would that be of any benefit? Most likely not. A task had been given, and it was up to him to see it through or not at all.

‚ÄúBastard,‚Äù Will whispered, then left the basement.

With a while left till the meeting time, he wandered aimlessly within his allocated eternity zone. According to the map in his fragment, the area was simultaneously larger and smaller than one would expect. A lot more was encompassed than the school itself, yet the moment one ventured to explore any part of the area further, he found himself on the verge of leaving it. Often the invisible barrier would go through entire buildings, splitting them in different sections. As tempting as it was to take a single step beyond to see what would happen, Will decided not to. If all went as planned, the area might be gone by the end of the loop. If not, eternity would provide instructions on what to do.

The phone in Will‚Äôs pocket vibrated. He‚Äôd received a text of a moose head and a coffee cup followed by the question, ‚Äúwant anything?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt difficult to tell who had sent it. Jace and Helen quickly replied with a firm no. After some consideration, Will sent a moose head in response. The way things were going, he wasn‚Äôt going to say no to some chocolate mousse.

That was the problem with their agreement. In theory, Will was free to refuse, but there was no telling what damage his former classmate would do if that were the case. It was already illustrated that he could appear in mirrors at will. Quite possibly, he had other tricks up his sleeve.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be easy,‚Äù Will said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll be facing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll handle it. You‚Äôre a rogue, after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I get any help? Some assistance or info or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll lend a hand. Provided there‚Äôs an intact mirror anywhere there. You‚Äôll have to snatch the weapons before anyone sees them, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôll do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, we have a deal. Remember. You must do it before Helen gets the loot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do what I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and make sure Alex doesn‚Äôt see you.‚Äù

This was unexpected. The goofball had the tendency of being overly nosy, but why would Danny be so concerned?

‚ÄúDid something happen between you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him. And neither should you. Consider this a freebie.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery funny. How about you give me some actual‚Äî‚Äù

As Will blinked, he found that he was talking to himself. Danny‚Äôs reflection was gone, as were the red messages. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the entire time freeze, one might consider this whole thing a trick of the mind.

Will looked at the mirror fragment. He had the option of challenging Danny to continue the conversation. Would that be of any benefit? Most likely not. A task had been given, and it was up to him to see it through or not at all.

‚ÄúBastard,‚Äù Will whispered, then left the basement.

With a while left till the meeting time, he wandered aimlessly within his allocated eternity zone. According to the map in his fragment, the area was simultaneously larger and smaller than one would expect. A lot more was encompassed than the school itself, yet the moment one ventured to explore any part of the area further, he found himself on the verge of leaving it. Often the invisible barrier would go through entire buildings, splitting them in different sections. As tempting as it was to take a single step beyond to see what would happen, Will decided not to. If all went as planned, the area might be gone by the end of the loop. If not, eternity would provide instructions on what to do.

The phone in Will‚Äôs pocket vibrated. He‚Äôd received a text of a moose head and a coffee cup followed by the question, ‚Äúwant anything?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt difficult to tell who had sent it. Jace and Helen quickly replied with a firm no. After some consideration, Will sent a moose head in response. The way things were going, he wasn‚Äôt going to say no to some chocolate mousse.

1h1cofd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1h1cofd/gifts_for_teachers_lunch_aides_bus_drivers/,"gifts for teachers, lunch aides & bus drivers","Hi all, I need suggestions on what to give my kids' teachers, lunch aides and their school bus driver. My kids are 7 & 11, if that matters. 

Last year, I gave my kids' teachers monogrammed land's end tote bags with a box inside containing silk pillow cases, weighted eye mask and pillow mist + a gift card. I know it was a hit because 2 teachers called me to thank me and maybe 3 more said they loved it when I saw them months later. This year, my kids have teachers that were also their teacher last year and despite knowing that personally, I cant have enough tote bags, I want to give them something else with a personal touch. 

This is also the first year that my kids are raving about the kindest lunch aide, they dont know her name, they just call her Ms. M. I also have no idea what to give Ms. M and 3 more lunch aides (who my kids dont know by name so personalized gifts are a no go). I am already planning a gift card but I want to give something more thoughtful aswell. 

Lastly, Last year we gave the school bus driver an insulated coffee tumbler, winter beanie and rechargable hand warmer..... I cannot think of anything to give him this year. ",3,1732735758.0,Gifts,4,1.0,False

1h1cn2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentalHygiene/comments/1h1cn2t/im_at_a_loss_at_this_point_on_what_to_do_about/,I'm at a loss at this point on what to do about oral problems,"I spend about 10 minutes brushing my teeth‚Äî2 minutes brushing my teeth and 8 minutes brushing my tongue. I start at the back of my tongue and brush forward. I do this for about 10 seconds at a time before using a scraper, but it doesn‚Äôt help. My tongue remains discolored, and after about 15 minutes, I do a smell test. It has a very sour odor‚Äînot like manure, just very sour.

I also floss and brush my teeth, but my mouth still tastes horrible after every morning routine. Using mouthwash doesn‚Äôt work, and chewing gum doesn‚Äôt help either. I‚Äôve tried brushing my tongue with tongue gel‚Äîno improvement. I‚Äôve even brushed my tongue using mouthwash, but it‚Äôs always the same sour smell.

I‚Äôm very self-conscious about this and usually maintain a distance of 1‚Äì2 feet when talking to people. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a fungal issue or something else. My tongue is almost always stained, regardless of how much I scrape or brush. It usually has a white coating or sometimes a brown color. I do drink coffee, but I‚Äôve started drinking water right after my coffee, and it hasn‚Äôt made any difference.

Another problem is that a very thick substance develops on the roof of my mouth and tongue after I brush my tongue and rinse. It coats my entire mouth, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is causing the halitosis. I‚Äôve tried researching it, and some people say it‚Äôs caused by a chemical in toothpaste. I‚Äôve even bought toothpaste without that chemical, but it didn‚Äôt help.

This has been persisting for over a decade. And I've been told by a lot of people I smell horrible.",1,1732735664.0,DentalHygiene,0,1.0,False

1h1clva,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1h1clva/the_cemetery/,The Cemetery ,"The dead walled off from the living. A complex of stone and wood composed by anarchic hands. Within these walls, the music from the outer world dissipates into hallowed silence, broken only by small chatter of tourist groups, the craning of necks to look up at statues, the fluttering of Argentinian pigeon wings, more skilled air surfers compared to their Brazilian counterparts. They scavenge, but there‚Äôs nothing in the cemetery except shade, so they rest on angel wings and meditate. The buzz from the radiating sun sucks moisture from the ground like a cosmic vacuum.

A spectacle of a cemetary housing men and women that were spectacles in their own lives. Nobel laureates, presidents, generals, personalities, and now anonymous nobility forgotten by their own lineage.

Evita rests in an unremarkable black tomb. Fresh and dry flowers decorate the protective fence separating her exhausted body from the grubby hands of the obscene living. Evita‚Äôs life was adorned by grandiosity, supreme heights, dubbed the spiritual leader of a nation. Her death was an odyssey into Hades.

She was taken from her resting place by Aramburu during the military coup against Peron. Driven around in a truck for three days to avoid suspicion. During that time she haunted a soldier. He killed his wife, thinking it was Evita‚Äôs ghost.

Whispers of her body‚Äôs violation is a myth in Argentina. She was transported to Italy with the help of the Vatican. Then brought to Spain, then Argentina. Rumours of wax copies swirled. She lost a finger, her nose was crushed. She was buried beside her husband. Eventually taken by her family and brought into her current tomb. 14 years of posthumous movement, experiencing more than many do in their lifetimes.

A woman who inspired plays of passion and ecstasy in life was cast into darkness in death. These plays surround the whole continent, its expanses and oceanic jungles and labyrinth cities are only good for life in explosions, as it was meant to be.

I hid with the pigeons, masking my head with shade. I read the names with my broken spanish accent. I cupped my eyes looking into the mausoleums in varying degrees of maintenance. The family of a chemist keeps his clean as his old lab. The sleek brown casket dressed in an Argentinian flag. His portrait and a menorah sit on opposite sides of a shelf. In the middle is a cross with a wounded Christ.

An anonymous family sits forgotten in another. Their name is scratched out, their caskets and ashes flung about the small room as if a secret tornado singled it out. A cross lays fallen with a broken right arm. Dust and rubble piling and piling. Excavators of the future will scan this place with robotic eyes. The family will be found and studied and displayed, stripped of their souls, or in their anger haunt the world.

Cherubs, Christ in every mode of action, stained glass Madonna‚Äôs, angels, goddesses atop domes, obelisks, blind Justice, warriors and generals are the main population in the cemetery. They tell stories too. I see them weeping, triumphant, stoic, or wrapped in embraces. A weeping angel crystallizes a moment of transcendent mourning. Descending from its perch in heaven, it froze itself in a moment of loss.

Angels, like the gods of antiquity, select favourites. They watch, smile, and intervene. I know this because it‚Äôs happened to me in moments of exasperated loss, fury, or serenity. My angel has taken form of my mother‚Äôs smile or my brother‚Äôs consoling hand on my back. Once, when Natasha and I walked through the jungle and angel came in the form of a mud-caked dog, leading us through the snaking paths of roots and rock to an isolated waterfall where we were given yet another moment to smile with our mouths and hearts. I can see the sun‚Äôs rays breaking through the foliage now, lighting spider webs in impossible places.

At another tomb, two warriors wielding swords guard a door. On a slab of white marble above it reads a message, or a warning:  
  
*""If you are not accustomed to looking at the sun of Liberty head-on,*  
*If for you dictatorship means nothing more than a lack of democracy,*  
*If for you the dignity of institutions is an insignificant matter,*  
*If the weight of the memory of so many Argentines who fought and sacrificed to bring us a worthy homeland does not trouble you,*  
*If you fear the risks of Liberty,*

*If you find security in the obedience imposed by despots,*  
*If you prefer that politics be founded on the quarrels of the past and not on the truths that prepare the future,*

*If you think that the example of OSSORIO ARANA has been in vain and is incapable of awakening dormant consciences,*

*Do not stand before the tomb of this soldier!*

Liberty! The message of liberty stamps the whole new world from Nunavut to the southern tip of Patagonia. Liberty, a thing known, never grasped and always fought for. How many men and women have been sacrificed at the altar of liberty in the Americas?

This soldier ran into some field, a liberator fighting other liberators. His bayonet engaged flesh, his final scream rang out in an echo, his final breath a whisper caught in the wind.

Liberty is beyond language, beyond life itself. It‚Äôs promised in abundance in every form of the afterlife. Liberty is the promise of peace, but acquiring it comes through horrendous violence. Sometimes violence is even mistaken for it.

There‚Äôs a lost interview of a grizzly paramilitary officer in the Yugoslav war. He‚Äôs talking to an American journalist, telling him Americans have a mistaken notion of freedom. The soldier says he‚Äôs allowed to kill, maim, torture, rape, and pillage with impunity. This was true freedom. That man is either in an unmarked grave or enjoying coffee and baklava peacefully now. Is he freer now than he was when he said that? Is he haunted by his barbarity or is he nostalgic for it?

The Argentine soldier speaks of obedience, institutions, democracy, despotism, the past, the future. Lofty words said by the living. Words that shapeshift with zeitgeists. I can‚Äôt tell you if they‚Äôre true.

I can tell you what is true. That soldier had a homeland and now he has a resting place in it. I can tell you time is the ultimate vandal. In the cemetery, broken columns try to hold up a sky. Forgotten tombs crumble, whittled away by time‚Äôs anxious fingers and dependable tools. Once glowing copper turns green, its colour leaking and staining the fields of white marble. Time never sits still even in death, it bleeds one realm into another. The cemetery was built to commemorate the dead. To set their memory into stone. But the stone bleeds into pebbles, then dust, then it‚Äôs whisked away to the same place all these souls have gone to.

I can tell you what is true. The radiating heat and innumerable alleyways create a play between light and dark. Shadows of crosses tattoo the white marble. Shadows more permanent than the bodies, the stone, the slow chew of time. The only thing that gives my bare head a respite from the sun.",1,1732735581.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Hespera‚Äôs expression was a grim one as she spoke.

‚ÄûShe‚Äôs calling to us again‚Ä¶""

She met her sister‚Äôs gaze, their expressions just as grim as hers. Silence filled their home. Only a light snoring could be heard from another room.

‚ÄûShe is‚Ä¶""

Sabah replied. The cup of coffee in her hand was uncharacteristically dark, devoid of the cream she usually liked to add.

‚ÄûAnd she‚Äôs been for a while‚Ä¶""

Meridian added, her characteristically cocky smile completely absent from her face. Hespera sighed.

‚ÄûWe can‚Äôt ignore it any longer‚Ä¶Even if we want to‚Ä¶Not listening to what she has to say won‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶Whatever it is this time‚Ä¶""

Sabah nodded, yet Meridian just stared off into space. Her eyes were usually the brightest of the three of them and not only due to her domain being the closest to Sol. Today however, her eyes seemed unsettlingly dull.

‚ÄûLast time she called us‚Ä¶Sol‚Ä¶He-‚Äû

Sabah placed her hand on her sisters shoulder, quickly pulling her into a hug.

‚ÄûShhh‚Ä¶It‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶It‚Äôs all gonna be alright‚Ä¶""

Meridian hugged her back. Hespera let out another sigh, looking at her older sisters with sad eyes.

‚ÄûYou can stay here Mer, Sabah and I can handle it this time‚Ä¶Besides, we need someone to keep watch‚Ä¶Now more than ever‚Ä¶""

Meridian just solely nodded into Sabah‚Äôs shoulder‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

Some time later, Sabah and hespera were walking towards a back fence gate, behind which lied an ancient grave yard. No one was buried here, they had made sure of that. All the graves were empty‚Ä¶Exept for one.

The gate opened on its own, allowing them entry. They continued walking, making their way towards the center of the graveyard.

Soon they reached their goal, a large mausoleum build from black stone and decorated with all kinds of golden symbols and murals, yet at the center of it all was the image of the sun, mounted above the mausoleum‚Äôs decorated door.

Despite the late hour, the building was illuminated by the light of the sun, emanating from nowhere in particular.

Just a few meters away from the structure, Sabah and Hespera split up, with Sabah continuing to walk towards the mausoleum, while Hespera hid behind a nearby tree.

Suddenly, there was a blinding flash of golden light, yet Sabah seemed completely unfazed. When the light dimmed down, someone stood between Sabah and the mausoleum.

It was a tall and muscular man wearing a toga. His eyes were shining like the sun in the sky, his his hair was like strands of gold and from the back of his back a pair of burning golden wings emerged.

‚ÄûGreetings, Helion.‚Äú

Sabah spoke, completely unimpressed by the appearance of the angel standing in front of her.

‚ÄûI have come to discuss a matter concerning the new born star.‚Äú

‚ÄûHave you finally found the wannabe usurper?‚Äú

‚ÄûWalk with me.‚Äú

Sabah didn‚Äôt even give the angel a chance to reply and started walking. Helion let out an annoyed grunt, as he followed her.

A few seconds later, Hespera stepped out from behind the tree and walked up to the mausoleum‚Äôs entrance. She took a deep breath, opened the door‚Ä¶And stepped inside.",1,1732735521.0,InstaWizards,0,1.0,False

Hello, I‚Äôm a 25 year old programmer from Turkey. I‚Äôm interested in photography, cooking, baking, gaming, astronomy and basketball. I‚Äôm also a huge nerd who loves learning about random stuff. 

I‚Äôm also an introvert, and a bit socially awkward. I usually spend my free time at home, but I also love travelling and spending my time in cafes, parks and by the sea. I‚Äôm a sucker for any place that has a great view, I love looking outside while sipping a coffee or eating some delicious food. 

I have a big imagination and love talking about the weirdest hypotheticals. My sense of humour is pretty dry and a bit on the darker side, a product of having studied in the UK I suppose. I don‚Äôt laugh very often, but when I do sometimes I‚Äôll have trouble breathing. 

I‚Äôm looking to meet someone that I can hopefully fall in love with. I want to meet in real life as well, so it‚Äôs a big plus if you‚Äôre somewhat close to me. 

So let‚Äôs get to know each other. Let‚Äôs talk about our lives, our hobbies, our dreams, and everything in between. If you can‚Äôt think of a good message, which believe me I understand, tell me what you would do in a zombie apocalypse. Hope to hear from you. ",1,1732735245.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

My wife recently started a new job. I've been asking her if she would like to have lunch w/ me and she says ""Yes"" every time. I give her some dates/times, but they usually never work so she tells me that she'll let me know what dates/times work best for her. However, nothing ever happens between ""US"". Then one day, she tells me that she is having lunch with her sister. Then another day, a colleague. I'm pissed now. All of this completely blindsides me because I'm thinking, I've been trying to set something up w/ you since you started working. So I completely blow up at her. She apologizes and tries to setup a lunch w/ me but I refuse since it's reactionary. I just let her know that she can do it when she's ready. I explain to her my frustrations w/ this and tell her that I'm hurt on a more deeper level because it's clear that something happened between us where I'm now just the after thought, the consideration. She tells me I'm not, and that she loves me and that she would never do that. However, actions speak louder than words here and I just don't see how she can apologize yet also claim she would never do that? Still, no offer for a lunch date other than the pity one I turned down. After all of this, this week, she tells me that she's having a ""coffee break"" with her sister and tries to avoid using the word ""lunch"". I push on this and tell her that's it's okay for her to have lunch with people and she doesn't have to avoid telling me. But I do ask again why she hasn't setup a lunch with me? She doesn't answer and instead says, she's not having ""lunch"" with her sister, it's a ""coffee"". I've already said my peace. What I'm unhappy about is that, if she had only put in the same amount of interest and work in setting up a lunch date w/ me like she did with other people, I'd be happy. Considering the series of events, I'm pretty confident that if she repeatedly sets up lunch dates with people other than me, her SO, something is wrong and I don't know what is since she's not being forthcoming. Generally though, I understand the choices she's made, and those choices aren't me so I'll have to live with that. I'm not going to bring this up to her again as it really did get us nowhere since she denies everything, but continues doing the exact thing I talked to her about. It also seems spiteful now. So, how do I get over this feeling (maybe not even a feeling anymore, but a reality in some scenarios) of not being a priority for my SO? I know I can't always be her priority, but it does suck to know that something you bring up directly can still end up nowhere.",1,1732735174.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

1h1cfpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timberborn/comments/1h1cfpt/suggestion_the_logical_logistics_update/,suggestion: the logical logistics update.,"so I think logistics needs some love. Hauling everything by hand being the only way to move resources seems a little strange to me. So I have some suggestions for several more ""high tech"" ways to move beavers and resources around. I am gonna leave out specifics for numbers, resources costs, and faction locking because I am bad at balancing that kind of stuff lol. I'll also try to list ideas in ascending tech level. (I am also going to be pulling from other suggestions I've seen)

**Upgraded/Advanced Hauling Post:** a low tech direct upgrade to the existing hauling post, haulers working in this building get a wheeled cart of some sort (like a wagon or dolly) allowing them to carry more items. 

- optional mechanics: add paved paths. advanced haulers move slower on standard paths but faster on paved paths. 

**Pipes:** while we can make pipes with the new 3d water physics, I still think dedicated pipes would be useful. primarily so we can move the ""non-water"" liquids around (anything that's stored in a tank). dedicated pipes would also allow liquid resources to be pumped into/out of buildings that create or use them like how power works currently. so you could have water and maple syrup pumped into a biofuel refinery, then pump biofuel out of the refinery and into tanks placed around the map. for balance sake dedicated pipes would require pumps at some interval to work at all. yea, it doesn't make sense to pump water downhill but balance. requiring pumps even for downhill sections would mean aqueducts, canals and etc. would still be the primary way to move water around the map. with pipes reserved for other fluids and specific uses cases for water.  

- pipes come in 3 sizes, small, medium, and large. obviously larger pipes have a higher throughput. this could be reduced to 2 sizes for simplicity sake. pipes can't mix fluids, aside from good and bad water. different sized pipes should connect so you can have a large central ""main line"" branching off into smaller ""feed lines.""  

- pumps: uses power to move liquids through pipes. on flat ground a pipe network needs a pump every X pipe sections, uphill every 2X, and down hill every 1/2X. (thoes are examples and have had minimal thought put into balance.) yes, it doesn't make sense to pump water down hill but see above.  

- valves: pipe sections that can close or open connections between networks. 

- intakes/outputs: pipe sections that can pump water (good and bad) into/out of pipe networks. intakes require power and double as a pump. Outputs have sluice gate like automation. manual intakes (requires a worker) and ""dumb"" outputs with no automation could also be added as cheaper or faction locked options.

- sprinkler: built on top of a pipe and irrigates an area based on pipe size.

- buildings that use or produce a liquid and tanks can be connected to a pipe network and have liquid ingredients pumped in and liquid products pumped out. adjacent buildings share pipe network connections (like power). pipes/pumps connected to buildings need a ""filter"" option to make sure the correct liquids are removed.

- homes that are connected to a water pipe give beavers a bouns to happiness (indoor plumbing) and refill thier thirst bar overnight. it would be fun if you could pump coffee into homes as well.

**Elevators:** this has been suggested a lot, and I am shamelessly stealing it. a paternoster, an elevator with 2 shafts the cabs loop through, has been suggested because it fits the games aesthetic and I agree. moving beavers vertically is a pain in the ass and takes up so much room in the current version of the game.  

- elevators require power. they are made from 2 pieces shafts and doors. all pieces are 1x3x1, doors allow beavers to get on/off the elevator, shafts just continue the elevator and dont allow access. doors require at least one shaft piece above and below it to be a valid elevator. ie. the shaft has to continue at least one block higher and lower than the desired floor so the cab can loop. power can be input from any connected piece.

- optional freight elevator with a larger foot print and higher power consumption, but has a more ""through put."" could be a nice Ironteeth only upgrade.

**Trains/Cable Cars:** this has also been suggested a lot and I think it's something we desperately need. a way to move resources and beavers long distances quickly would be very useful. cable cars fit the games aesthetic better, but I think the branching lines train tracks offer might be more useful. there is probably room for both but for simplicity I am just going to stick to cable cars. 

- stations allow access to the cable car line. for balance there should probably be dedicated freight and passenger stations/lines

- lines require support posts at some interval 

- passenger lines can have more than 2 stations and cant cross districts. freight lines can only have 2 stations but can cross districts.

- freight stations have a UI similar to district crossings to control what's sent or received.

**Tunnler's Yard:** a new building that allows you to dig tunnels and underground caverns. it seems silly to me that the only way to build underground is to dig a trench, build a platform, and then refill the hole. a mid/late game way to dig out room underground would be cool and allow for some neat builds like underground revivors, pipe/power networks, and storage complexes. I am thinking an entierly underground industrial district run by bots with the surface dedicated to farming and green space run by biological beavers.

- tunnels are built with overhang/platform like pieces that stack. (stacking 2 2x1 tunnel sections creates a 1 wide, 2 deep, 2 tall hole). the ""foundation"" of the tunnel sections would block building and be in the same place as thier overhang/platform counterparts.

- tunnel sections can't be demolished like normal buildings. they must be ""deconstructed"" by a worker from the tunnlers yard. deconstructing the section requires dirt to fill the hole in.     

- explosives should be consumed when building a tunnel section.  

- optional mechanic: place a layer of ""bedrock"" at the bottom of the map that can only be removed if you have a tunnler's yard. under this layer of bed rock is just more room to build under ground. there could also be natural caves, underground water sources, more mine shafts, etc.

- this could also be a function of a standard builder with tunnel sections unlocked with science like normal for simplicity's sake.",7,1732735155.0,Timberborn,2,1.0,False

He said he couldn't do the weekend without specifying any reason and said we should meet during the week. He said he'd be happy to see me even if it's for a little bit so I could only meet him in one of the gaps between a morning lecture and a late afternoon seminar, which he was fine with. He suggested we do a coffee date again and then go to the retail because he wanted to buy a hat. When the date came and we met he went completely off that plan and just wanted to wonder around the retail shops ""just cause"" which goes completely against the initial idea for the coffee date. Mind you, i was at university, my bag was full and heavy and i had just come out of a rough lecture so i wasn't as energised as I have been previous dates. I just wanted to sit down, get a coffee, like we agreed. And i told him just that. He said okay we will and then proceeded to walk around the shops care free. We were there for like an hour and at a certain point my body was just killing me and I needed to sit down. So i told him again that i wanted to sit down and we finally went to a coffee shop. Before going there however he wanted to go to some other shop so i had to say, again, that my bag is pretty heavy and i can't stand walking around anymore. Finally we go get the coffee and we sit at one of the tables. I try to make some kind of conversation, like how is your week, how is work going, whats new that sorta thing. His only responses included ""its fine"", ""im fine"", ""nothing new"". So any type of conversation that I tried to make was a complete fail. We ended up people watching and other than argue if the guy at the queue has milk in their drink or not, there were only crickets at the table. He tried to make some jokes but they weren't funny to me. So finally i say, lets go, we go to another shop, he gets his stuff and i said i needed to get back to the university because i needed to go back for a seminar. Right before we parted tho I felt like I had to tell him that I don't see a relationship possibility for us and that we'd be better off as friends. He only said okay, turned back and without another word or look just went off. (I haven't geard from him since)I kinda felt bad that i had to end it but I didn't feel like he wouldn't love me in the way I needed to be loved and I couldn't imagine anything happening between us. The date had little to do with how i felt about him. ",1,1732734896.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm recently back from a wonderful 21-night October trip to Japan, as a solo, female, elder-millennial, Canadian traveller. This was a trip I had been waiting years to take, as I was days away from a late-March 2020 trip, but we all know what happened there.   
  
I know there are often questions on these forms about accommodations, so I thought I would share my thoughts across my visits to Osaka, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Hakone and Tokyo.  
  
*Background:*  
My three priorities were location, air-conditioning and private bathrooms.   
  
I stayed in a mix of places at a low, but not bare-bones budget. I originally aimed to keep my average cost-per-night at $100 CAD, but I was able to find a little extra travel income, so I ever-so-slightly increased my spend and ended up averaging around **$115/night**, or **Y12,700/night**. I really appreciated that Japan charged per person, and overall found the value of my money went much further than what I could get for the same price in Western Europe, or even locally.   
  
I booked my hotels online, in advance, using Google Hotels as my primary search tool. I made my first reservations almost immediately after I booked my flights, six months out, but made sure they were all refundable until a date close to my actual stay. I kept an eye on prices, and ended up switching or rebooking most of my original stays around the four-month mark, due to lower rates at the same hotel, or I found a more appealing place, at a price I was happy with.   
  
After the four-month mark, prices did start to climb again, and I wasn‚Äôt able to find any better raters after that point, even continuing to check right up to the cancellation dates, incase of any last minute deals. I‚Äôm not a big breakfast gal, so unless otherwise noted, it was not a part of my experience.   
  
*Hotels*:   
**Sotetsu Fresa Inn Yodoyabashi, Osaka**   
$72/Night x 4 Nights   
I loved this hotel, and it provided the best value per dollar of the trip. It opened in 2023, and it still had that fresh/new feeling. I checked-in via a kiosk, which was handy. The lobby held comfy white waffle-knit PJs and a robust selection of toiletries. The room was small, but super clean and well laid out, so I didn‚Äôt feel claustrophobic. My view looked out to the main road and the river beyond it.   
  
My favourite part about the hotel was the direct elevator¬† access to the metro station. Even though the location was in a quieter, business district, it was easy and quick to pop down to Dotonbouri, Shinsekai, and up to Umeda. And getting to USJ, Nara and Kobe was no trouble at all.   
  
**APA Hotel Hiroshima Ekimae Ohashi, Hiroshima**  
$60/Night x 2 Nights   
I didn‚Äôt love the fact that I was staying in an APA hotel, but the price and location couldn‚Äôt be beat. I did the mental gymnastics of saying $120 really isn‚Äôt going to have any impact on the owner‚Äôs bottom line. The location was solid, less than 10-minutes on foot from the train station, and walkable into the main city area, and there was a Lawson directly connected to the hotel.   
  
It was large, so reception was bustling for afternoon check-in, but it moved pretty efficiently. Even though my room had the same sq. footage as the Sotetsu, the layout made it seem much smaller, and the bedside plug-in options were limited. It was also an older hotel, and the room also felt a bit dated, so I was glad I was only there for two nights.   
  
The public bath was a nice experience. I went four times, and I had the place to myself each time, probably because from what I could tell, most of the guests of the APA were male. PIECE HOSTEL   
  
**Piece Hostel SANJO, Kyoto**  
$115/Night x 5 Nights   
After originally booking a private room in the WeBase hostel, I came across the Piece Hostel Sanjo. While it was double the price, I realized I was going to be there for a longer stay, and likely have more down time, so I wanted a place with nice common areas.   
  
I had a private, en-suite room. No frills, and quite small, but the bed was large and there was lots of space under the bed for storage. The hostel itself is split into two buildings, across the street from each other. One has a large communal kitchen, which was squeaky clean and had everything you could need, including a grind your own beans, pour over coffee station.   
  
The main building had a downstairs bar and lounge, but I would head up to their rooftop space. In the evenings they had a bar setup, but you could also just bring your own food and drinks.   
  
I found the location to be wonderful, halfway between two metro lines, I was able to get to most places easily, including Uji and Arishiyama. And there was lots of great shopping, bars and restaurants in the area. This hostel also does luggage forwarding, which came in handy.   
  
**Hakone Yutowa, Hakone**  
$210/Night, Breakfast Included x 2 Nights¬†  
This hotel is located a short, flat walk from Gora Station. I found the location to be very convenient, especially as I wanted to avoid any mountain bus-related motion sickness. I took the Tozan trains up from Odwara station to the hotel, arriving around 2:30pm. The next day, I was on the first cable car up to Owakudani and with the exception of the pirate ships, had few crowds and no lines to MotoHakone, there, or back. On the morning I checked out, I stored my bags at the hotel and walked to the Open Air Museum, before making the trek to Tokyo.   
  
The hotel itself wasn‚Äôt fancy, but felt warm and cozy. It felt more family-oriented than romantic, and there was at least one tour group there. They were from France and were a hoot. My room was quite large, with two double beds and a tatami floor. The hotel had a public onsen, with two hot spring tubs and a sauna, and it also had two private onsen rooms. The private onsens were not reservable, so you had to have a bit of luck, but I was able to use them 4 times during my stay. The only downside to both the public and private onsens was that they were a bit basic and had no view. Milk, infused water, and popsicles were complimentary.   
  
The hotel had great public areas, including a lounge with a lovely reading nook. Complimentary afternoon tea, and evening dessert/happy hours were provided daily. And there was a nice outdoor area with a footbath and firepits.¬†

Breakfast was buffet-style with lots of options. As I find with any buffet, the food is never quite as hot as I wanted it to be, the tempura a bit limp etc, but overall solid. Dinner wasn‚Äôt included in my package, but I did pay the extra $75 the first night for dinner, which included a self-serve buffet, featuring a wide-selection of options, unlimited drinks and alcohol, and a choice of main course which was cooked on a hot pot lit over a small fire. The second night, I didn‚Äôt feel like spending that kind of money again, so I walked 10-minutes down the thankfully flat road to a well-stocked Lawsons, and had my $10 Konbini dinner out by the fire pit.¬†

**Premier Cabin Hotel Shinjuku**, **Tokyo**   
$96/night x 3 Nights   
This was a perfectly adequate hotel. Nothing bad to say, but no raves either. The room was your classic small, business hotel style. Not as outdated and cramped as the APA, but not as comfortable as the Sotetsu either. I did appreciate that my floor had an ice machine, and I used their laundry machines.  
  
I primarily booked this hotel for the location, which I found to be great. It was right in the heart of Kabuchiko, and I passed by both the 3D Cat, and the Godzilla on my way from Shinjuku station, making easy guide posts. I had zero issues feeling unsafe as a solo female in the area, even though I had been warned against the location. It felt safer than my own town after a night out. One tout tried to start up a conversation, but I simply ignored him and kept walking and it was a non-issue.   
  
Note\* I switched hotels midway through my Tokyo trip, and it was absolutely the right move for me. I paid to have my luggage shipped same-day. I dropped it off when I checked out, and when I checked into my new hotel, it was in the lobby waiting for me, so no lost time.  
  
**Dormy Inn Premium Ginza, Tokyo**  
$150/night x 4 Nights   
Loved this hotel! Similar to the Sotetsu, it was brand new. My room was quiet spacious, and I liked that it had a sliding door between the bathroom and sink area, and the main bed and living area. There was a little pudding in the fridge which I thought was a nice touch. The hallways played relaxing spa style music, there was a small rooftop space (no view though), complimentary non-alcoholic drinks were available in the dining area after 3pm, and they offered complimentary late-night noodles. I went for ramen the first night, but the quality wasn‚Äôt worth the extra calories.  
  
The public bath in the basement was lovely! My favourite of the trip. It felt like a really nice spa, thanks to the calming music, a waterfall over stones view and the ‚Äúcold pillow‚Äù. I went each morning and evening.   
  
Location wise, it was easy access to a metro, but I don‚Äôt think I would stay in Ginza again. It made sense for my itinerary, which included Teamlabs Planets, DisneySea, Asakusa, Skytree and shopping, but it was a bit soulless and bland in the evenings. If I were to opt to stay on the east side of Tokyo again, I‚Äôd probably stay in Asakusa or Ueno.¬†  
  
**Onyado NoNo Yodoyabashi, Osaka**  
$145/night x 1 Night   
Finishing up almost exactly where I started, the Onyado was literally two blocks over from the Sotetsu. I had heard that this was the highest-end line from Dormy Inn, and after staying at the Premium hotel in Ginza, I think my expectations were just a bit too high. My room was around the same size, and I like the tatami floor, but overall I preferred the Ginza Premium in terms of vibes and decor.   
  
Similar to the Premium, this hotel offered late night noodles and had a public bath, this one was on the top floor. While I preferred the spa-like vibes of the Ginza bath more, I did really enjoy the two pot baths that were in the open air section, which provided a welcome breeze.  
  
I opted for breakfast here on my last morning before heading to the airport. Lot of Japanese-style options, including fresh raw tuna and ikura to make your own rice bowls. I‚Äôm just not a big enough breakfast eater to justify the price, but if you like a hearty breakfast, than I‚Äôd 100% say it‚Äôs worth it.¬†

Happy to answer any questions I may not have covered!¬†

When my flight lands I'm picking up my part-time nesting partner at the ferry so we can spend the weekend at my place. He's never been to a ramen restaurant before so we are going to eat our way through the city and take ridiculously long showers together. I can feel my heart rate lowering just thinking about it.   

Made plans with another partner to have an early morning coffee before work one morning because that's how we squeeze little moments of connection in between dates. He requested to schedule a more structured catch-up as well, and specifically asked if I had the space and spoons to talk about his decision to end another connection this week. The part that gave me the warm fuzzies is how careful and intentional he's being because I was a sounding board about that connection when we were platonic, and we've talked about how boundaries and support may need to shift now that he's touching my butt.

Another is coming over for a quickie after work on Wednesday and I am going to climb that man like an orchard ladder.

I live on the Big Island and buy from local coffee plantations, with occasional purchases of Kona coffee from Costco (usually the Kuai brand in the blue bag).

However, Kona coffee has a very distinct taste profile, and I've struggled finding a good technique for extracting the flavor without it being overly bitter. I have a V60 and use the James Hoffman technique, which is very similar to the one from a Japanese youtuber that standardized it for competition.

I find that this isn't producing the best cup of coffee, so I've tried playing with the grind size and bloom times, but I can't get it consistent. I just purchased a Fellow Aiden to get it more consistent and automate my morning coffee, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had success with Kona coffee varietals in particular.

I usually go with a lite or medium roast on the beans.",1,1732734709.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I mostly don't let it get under my skin or I'd be upset every day. Today however, I saw a particularly egregious example. It was on the opposite side of the road so I couldn't say anything about it. 

The lady was sitting in her car waiting and was too lazy to pull through the bike lane into the parking lane so she was partially in two parallel parking spots and completely blocking the bike lane. The only reason I could think of is that if she had pulled all the way into one of the parking spots, it would have required her to shift into reverse at some point--either to back into the rear spot or back out of the front spot. Apparently, that's too much hassle. 

It can't be an issue of taking too long since she was just hanging out waiting for her passenger to get coffee and had plenty of time to position herself in one of the parking spots and clear the bike lane. Just remember, as a cyclist your life is not worth the inconvenience of shifting into and out of reverse. It's all good though because her park anywhere lights were on. End rant.

It recently came back and now I have trouble even saying my own name to people üò≠ the thought of somebody asking me what my name is makes me FREEZE. Like fully freeze up and I look so so silly. This has stopped me from calling the doctors, ordering coffee, even pronouncing or reading things infronf of people who I don‚Äôt know. I know anxiety definitely plays a role in this and growing up I had extremely bad social anxiety. Throughout this year I have lost a lot of weight, like a lot. I‚Äôve never been big I‚Äôve always been quite small but I had a reasonable sized tummy to me, had decent sized breasts and a decently sized bum. Now all of that is gone. I barely have any breasts, absolutely no bum and my stomach is as thin as could be. I‚Äôve tried my best to gain weight back and to be fair I do eat a lot of junk. Living out of home also plays a big role in this as now I‚Äôve sorta gotta fend for myself. I‚Äôll only eat 1 small thing a day and my appetite completely goes away. I hate it so much because I used to enjoy food a lot but now even thinking about it makes me feel weird. I have a problem with not eating infronf of people who I don‚Äôt know, I feel like throughout highschool and my relationships with people I was completely fine with this and didn‚Äôt care. Now, there‚Äôs no way I can eat in-front of somebody I don‚Äôt know or have just met like a date. I feel as if the person is watching / judging me eat and it just feels off to be the only one eating infront of people sometimes. Can anybody offer me some advice?

Why did Christopher Tolkien omit the small details about Idril‚Äôs actions during the fall of Gondolin in the published Silmarillion?

In the Book of Lost Tales she arrays herself and Earendil in chainmail at the onset of the attack. 

She fights ‚Äúlike a tigress‚Äù against Maeglin when he takes her and Earendil captive. 

She insists on waiting for Tuor with minimal guards while sending Earendil to safety through the Secret Way with the bulk of her guards. 

And then she goes about the city rescuing elves and smiting bands of orcs with her small band ‚Äúand could not be dissuaded from bearing a sword‚Äù. 

In the Silmarillion I believe she is just rescued from Maeglin by Tuor and they then flee down the Secret Way. It‚Äôs not an egregious omission but it is curious. Including it wouldn‚Äôt contradict anything else in the published Silmarillion and would just add to her characterization. ",13,1732733936.0,tolkienfans,10,0.88,False

The next day after the tour, Clark was ready to start working. Katy had printed and gave him his key card at the end of the previous day. The guard scanned the card and let him park inside the wall. It was six in the evening, the lot was empty except for a handful of cars.¬†*I wonder which one is uncle‚Äôs, could he still be here this late?*¬†Clark wondered. Katy was gone for the day, so he used his card to enter the facility. The smell of spoiled chicken still hung in the air, maybe that was something he could fix today. In the main facility room, he and Nancy shared a computer, used to clock in and out. He could even surf the web on his breaks! Nothing wrong with watching some shows while on a meal break. He had his own facility cart where he could carry all the tools needed. Mop, sponges, rags‚Ä¶ you name it, Clark had it. He put on his headphones and began to work. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until a few hours into the shift. A man came out of one of the red sealed doors and made his way down the hall that Clark was mopping. He was an old Japanese man with a small mustache, bald head, shrewd eyes, and large glasses. The man was wearing a white doctor‚Äôs gown and sleek black shoes that creaked along the hallway. Clark took his headphones off and greeted the man.¬†

‚ÄúEvening doctor, name‚Äôs Clark. I‚Äôm the new janitor around here.‚Äù

¬†The man eyed Clark up and down for a few seconds, seemingly in judgment.¬†

‚ÄúAh yes, nephew of Mr. Rogers. The last janitor we had left poorly‚Ä¶ I hope you will not do the same‚Äù said the man.¬†

Without introducing his own name, the doctor walked away. But not before Clark got a glance at his name tag.¬†

*Doctor Wu, huh? I think he‚Äôs a friend of my uncles‚Ä¶ seems like a piece of work*¬†thought Clark. The rest of the shift was spent cleaning desks and bathrooms. He made sure to make the place spotless and empty all trash cans. But the spoiled smell was still in the air. Guess that would have to be a problem for another day.¬†

Second week on the job, Clark got his first paycheck. It was huge! At least triple the size of his average check from the school. The money pleased him, he used the cash to buy a new set of headphones. The pay was great, but the environment‚Ä¶ not so. Something was just‚Ä¶ weird about SynMed. All the other workers were quiet and kept to themselves, besides the occasional chat with Nancy and Katy of course. He hadn‚Äôt even seen his uncle yet, he hoped to run into him sometime soon. The rooms that Clark wasn‚Äôt allowed in had started to pique his interests as well. Maybe it‚Äôs just all the cameras, but he could never shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He never noticed anything that might suggest so, but the hairs on the back of his neck would stand up and he would get chills. A seemingly instinctive response to an unwanted pair of eyes. Not to mention he still couldn‚Äôt get rid of the foul odor in the air. People acted like he was crazy for smelling anything. They must be ‚Äòblind‚Äô to the smell or something.

*Maybe an animal died in the vents or something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just check it out later.*¬†Whatever other doubts might cloud Clark‚Äôs mind, he would simply shake them away and keep working. After all, fifty dollars an hour is not something to worry about at all.¬†

After clocking in, Clark struck up a conversation with Katy.¬†

‚ÄúHey Katy, so I‚Äôve been meaning to ask. What is the process exactly for giving someone a replacement body part? I can see that you have purple access, so you must know a lot about this company.‚Äù

Katy seemed pleased that he asked, she grabbed her coffee and gestured to the couches in the waiting room.

¬†‚ÄúSo Clarky, let me tell you a basic representation of our process here at SynMed. A customer comes to us asking for a replacement mold. The term ‚Äòbody-part‚Äô can be a little gross, so we call individual organs or limbs ‚Äòmolds‚Äô. Now, I then schedule a meeting for them with my husband, Wu‚Ä¶‚Äù

*What? Katy is married to Dr. Wu? I had no idea‚Ä¶*¬†Clark thought.¬†

Katy continued,¬†

‚ÄúAfter Wu‚Äôs evaluation, we¬† take a minimum of two weeks to prepare the mold for the person. To do that we draw some blood, then go through a process of mixing it with the mold. I don‚Äôt know how it all works, too much science for me. Ask my husband if you see him, have you met him yet?‚Äù

Clark answered,¬†

‚ÄúOnce in passing, he seemed busy and we didn‚Äôt get to chat. I haven‚Äôt even seen my uncle yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt too surprising. Mr. Roberts rarely comes into work. Keep an eye out for a red, sports-y car with yellow lines. I‚Äôm sure you know all about those cars and stuff but I don‚Äôt know all the different types.‚Äù

*Man is Katy a talker‚Ä¶*¬†thought Clark. Katy continued, again,¬†

‚ÄúYou know Wu and your uncle were friends in college, that's how they met and started this business. Also, there is no better way to learn something than to experience it. Tell you what Clarky, I have a new customer who scheduled a meeting with my husband today. His name is John Elton, a war veteran who needs an arm. I will have you sit in with Dr. Wu and follow up on Elton‚Äôs process, m‚Äôkay?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, that sounds great! Thanks for the chat Katy, I‚Äôve been clocked in for the past half hour I should probably start working no-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh but wait I haven‚Äôt even told you the story of how they met! You see, both your uncle and Wu are big fans of tennis and‚Ä¶‚Äù

An hour later, Clark hadn‚Äôt started working yet when John Elton walked in the building. He was an old, fat man. Bald headed with a long white beard. He was holding a wooden cane that thunked hard against the wooden entryway floor. And just like Katy stated, his right arm was missing.¬†

‚ÄúHey, John Elton? I‚Äôm Clark, nice to meet you‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, hello young‚Äôun, are you this Wu fellow?‚Äù

Katy walked up to the man,¬†

‚ÄúNo, that would be my husband. I‚Äôm Katy, we spoke earlier on the phone. Wu will be with you shortly, and Clark here is new so he is going to sit through your meeting if you don‚Äôt mind‚Äù she said.¬†

‚ÄúOh, sure I don‚Äôt mind at all. Mind if I take a seat while we wait?‚Äù asked John.¬†

Clark made small talk with John for a few minutes while they waited. Wu then walked into the room.

‚ÄúJohn Elton, come with me for your meeting. Clark, why are you not working?‚Äù

¬†*What a ray of sunshine*¬†thought Clark before replying.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna sit in on this meeting, I wanna learn more about the company and well, Katy thought it would be good for me to sit in today.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh alright then, just make sure you‚Äôre clocked out. Your uncle will not pay you for dilly-dallying‚Äù said Wu.¬†

Clark and John then followed Wu down the hall. The examination room had a red code door, Clark noticed Wu pull out a purple pass and gestured for them to walk inside. The room looked like your average doctor‚Äôs examination room, just even more soulless. Everything was just white and bright. White tile floor, white examination bed, bright white lamp‚Ä¶ the room had all the personality of a slice of¬† bread. Wu told Clark to stand in the corner and listen while John sat on the bed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, does anyone else smell rotten meat? I think someone might have left their lunch in here or somethin‚Äô...‚Äù pronounced John.¬†

Clark was about to remark in agreement, but Wu started talking before he could say anything.¬†

‚ÄúJohn Elton, you are seventy-eight years old and live at 104 Aviva lane. You lost your right arm forty years ago while on duty. You now live with your wife, Ophelia, whom you have been married to for fifty-three years. Is all this information about you correct?‚Äù

John seemed to have dosed off‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù exclaimed Wu. Clark was taken back by his aggressiveness.¬†

‚ÄúOh, uh sorry. It‚Äôs just late is all. Yes, that information is correct, sorry doctor‚Äù answered John. Wu rubbed his sweaty bald head and handed John some papers to sign. While John read it over, Wu explained the process.¬†

‚ÄúOur work here is relatively straightforward, all you are required to do is give some blood and pay. It all starts with your arm. I have many arm molds in the building. I will then use the blood you give to slowly adjust the arm to fit your person. I cannot graft the mold immediately, your body would reject it upon sensing that it is not your own. The rejection of a mold is something to avoid at all cost, the side effects are incredibly painful and irregular. This process will take a minimum of two weeks to finish. When it is done, you come back and we graft the mold onto you. Think of the mold as a blank canvas. As the artist, I must perfect it before giving the work to your person. Do you have any questions?‚Äù

Wu had a very straightforward way of speaking. Each sentence felt like a bullet point, like a computer spitting facts as opposed to a person talking. ‚ÄúOh, uh how do you grow these limbs?‚Äù asked John.¬†

‚ÄúOur process is irrelevant information to you. Now let's finish these procedures and send you on your way‚Äù answered Wu.¬†

Clark left the room while Wu drew John‚Äôs blood and ran other tests. All this information, molds, grafting‚Ä¶ it was a lot to think about. Clark too wondered just how exactly SynMed grows these ‚Äòmolds‚Äô.

After the procedures, Wu escorted John and Clark back to reception. John took a seat while Katy processed the payment. Clark was close enough to hear Wu whisper into Katy‚Äôs ear,¬†

‚ÄúMake sure John Elton brings a family member to speak on his behalf next time. I will no longer tolerate this buffoon on his own.‚Äù

Clark couldn‚Äôt understand how Katy could give Wu such a loving look before continuing the payment process. After the day was done, Clark only got more curious about SynMed‚Äôs process.

**Chapter 4: Clark**

There was a red sports car with yellow stripes parked in the lot at work today. His uncle must be at the facility! It would be nice to see him. Clark walked into the building and asked Katy if his uncle was here and if he could finally talk to him.¬†

‚ÄúOh, your uncle is in a meeting with Wu, apparently a customer had their mold reject them and now they‚Äôre doing paperwork or something on it. Sorry about that, Clarky.‚Äù

He responded, ‚Äúit seems like uncle is avoiding me almost, but I understand how busy this line of work must be‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Clark did have the feeling that his uncle was staying away from him. He was never close with him. As smooth as Tom is with people, he doesn‚Äôt like them all that much.¬†

Clark noticed that Katy was looking uncomfortable with that last remark, so he quickly changed the topic.¬†

‚ÄúSay, Wu was telling John Elton about this rejection process, what exactly is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh trust me Clarky you don‚Äôt want to know. Especially before lunch time‚Äù.

Their conversation awkwardly ended there and Clark went to work.

Cleaning helps keep the mind busy, but it can be tiring. A delivery guy showed up with a bunch of anesthetics, Clark directed him towards Wu‚Äôs office and then went on lunch. He was resting in the break room, he got a full thirty minutes for lunch and didn‚Äôt know how to spend the time. The thought hit him to check out that website that Nancy had told him about. He opened his phone and searched for a Ethical Genetics website. Sure enough it was the top search, it seems it was created by some activist group.

¬†*This must be similar to PETA or something lame like that*¬†he thought. But when the page was opened he was greeted by a disturbing image. The quality was not the best, but Clark could basically make out what it was. It was a human torso, white as snow, covered in arms. The head was deformed and shrunken into the chest, it seemed to have its eyes precisely sliced out. There were probably twenty arms growing out of this thing's body, all pure white, and oddly enough all right arms. It was suspended in air by a few hooks and had all sorts of tubes with various liquids pouring in and out of the thing. The image‚Äôs splash text read,

¬†**‚ÄúTHIS IS WHAT SYNMED‚ÄôS ‚ÄòMOLDS‚Äô ARE‚Äù.**

The image was revolting to say the least, and any little bit of hunger felt on the lunch break was lost.¬†*Surely this can‚Äôt be how stuff is grown here, right? This has to be one of those groups that makes fake information and stuff to make people upset*¬†thought Clark. As disturbing as the image was, Clark continued to read the website. According to this Ethical Genetics group, SynMed uses human bodies as the base for the molds and injects a type of formula that causes the growth of whatever body part is needed. He read about the start of the company back in ‚Äò13, how Wu was the mastermind and uncle Tom was the charismatic businessman. There was a whole section on this ‚Äòrejection process‚Äô from witnesses, and he was about to start reading when the door to the break room quickly swung open.¬†

‚ÄúClark! Just what do you think you‚Äôre doing in here?‚Äù said a smooth voice with a southern accent.¬†

Clark could recognise that voice anywhere, even after all these years.¬†

‚ÄúUncle Tom? Oh I was just-‚Äù

‚ÄúJust what, huh? Looking at our critic‚Äôs website on our wifi? You gotta be kidding me!‚Äù

Uncle Tom was furious, and Clark forgot that Nancy told him to be sure to turn wifi off when he searched for the website.¬†

‚ÄúOh, I uh, I‚Äôm sorry Unc- I mean, Mr. Roberts. I was just told to give this website a visit and I thought that-‚Äù

‚ÄúWho told you to visit?‚Äù Tom asked, while pulling up a chair to sit next to Clark. His voice was calm now, uncle had a way of doing that. His manner could switch from furious to calm in seconds. Clark sat there for a minute, debating if he should rat out Nancy.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay Clark, I‚Äôm not mad. Just a little frustrated given the details of this situation, you know?‚Äù Tom gave Clark a reassuring pat on the back.

‚ÄúJust tell me if it was someone here who told you, and all is forgiven, okay champ?‚Äù

Clark had to decide between keeping his co-workers secret or upsetting a family member. Heck not just a family member, his boss. The choice was obvious.¬†

‚ÄúIt was Nancy‚Äù replied Clark.

‚ÄúGood, that‚Äôs all I needed to know‚Äù Tom rose from his seat and Clark stood also.

¬†‚ÄúChristmas break is almost upon us now, and we will be closed from the twenty-fourth until the first of the new year. You will be sure to get a good holiday bonus for being such a good worker, okay champ? Just don't get too curious is all I‚Äôm asking‚Äù said Tom.¬†

‚ÄúAll right Uncle, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù

‚ÄúHey no need to apologize for being curious, I‚Äôm just upset I had to see you for the first time here in a situation like this. Tell you what, let‚Äôs go grab a beer after work today, what do you say?‚Äù¬†

What he saw on the website truly disturbed him. He wants to keep his uncle happy, but is what's happening here even ethical? Was that thing he saw¬†*alive*? Those would be questions answered another day. The smell of the facility seemed to get stronger when Tom showed up, but Clark tried his best to ignore it and walked out of the room with his uncle.

The decision that Clark made was not just witnessed by himself and Thomas, but by another. The crawler in vents was upset at the young man‚Äôs decision. It‚Äôs three eyes narrowed in judgment. But all would be well, the matter would be settled come Christmas break.¬†

It was now the following day. Clark never got that beer with his uncle. Tom canceled at the last minute, citing ‚Äòan emergency work situation‚Äô. This upset him, the day was not off to a great start.¬†

*Just think, this is the last day of work before christmas break. A whole week off! I can do whatever I want until the facility opens again on the first!*¬†Clark thought. As he was walking towards the door he heard a commotion inside. Sounded like someone was yelling. Not wanting to disturb, he waited outside the building where he could partially hear what was going on. It was Katy‚Äôs voice all right, and she was furious. Clark had never seen Katy mad, he didn‚Äôt even know there was a mean bone in her body. She was yelling at Nancy, who he couldn‚Äôt hear making any form of protest.¬†*Oh man, she must be getting chewed out because I told on her‚Ä¶*

This made Clark upset, but he thought,¬†*hey, better her than me. I wasn‚Äôt the one who did anything wrong*.

He could tell now that Katy lies, she puts on a kind welcoming face for reception. But she must be a shrill, mean-spirited person on the inside. No wonder she got married to Wu.¬†

After a minute or two the yelling stopped, and Nancy left the building. It would seem she had packed all of her stuff. She turned around and saw that Clark was listening. However, there wasn‚Äôt any anger in her eyes, only tears.¬†

‚ÄúIt was a mistake ever working here. SynMen provided me with these beautiful blue eyes‚Ä¶ I thought that if I could just work here I could help others in need, but then I found out what actually happens here and‚Ä¶‚Äù

She was struggling to not break down, so she turned away to her car. Clark called out to her,¬†

‚ÄúHey Nancy, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for ratting you out. I just didn‚Äôt want to upset my uncle and I thought that‚Ä¶‚Äù

he trailed off as she turned back around.¬†

‚ÄúWalk away from this place while you still can Clark. The help we give here‚Ä¶ is not worth the suffering of the ones less fortunate‚Ä¶‚Äù

Clark watched as the only truly welcoming face at SynMed left. The thought crossed his mind to leave with her, but it was only for a moment. He was working with¬†*family,*¬†not to mention making a pretty penny doing it. Clark‚Äôs mind processed what she was saying.

*She must be talking about the molds, but I mean look at all the good this company is doing! Surely SynMed isn‚Äôt in the wrong.*

*Right?*

As explained above, I am in the process of buying a 2 bed flat in zone 2 west London. It is not a new build, the building has about 25 years and is a share of a freehold.

Me and my partner just had a baby and are just wondering if there is a better use of the ¬£284k deposit, which is part of our inheritance money.

We are both foreigners working under visas, there might be some limits to what we can do in terms of buy to let property and all. we‚Äôre also first time buyers.

The flat is nice and spacious and built to a very nice standard, but wonder if we could instead buy two cheaper properties and rent one of the two instead? I‚Äôm just unsure what to do.

If we went for it, we‚Äôd be left with somewhat of a tight budget, but could make it work if we adjust some of our habits (like buying coffees out or eating out regularly or less holidays).

Would appreciate any recommendations/advice.

I recently had the chance to try out the Sonos Arc soundbar in my home theater setup, and I'm impressed with its performance. This sleek black soundbar packs a punch when it comes to audio quality.

The Arc delivers rich, room-filling sound that brings movies and TV shows to life. I noticed a big upgrade from my TV's built-in speakers. The Dolby Atmos support creates an immersive 3D audio experience that made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action.

https://preview.redd.it/9fxqvv9sqh3e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c57b75eceda5f901b0ed85e2b732eb3d5d37bd7

Setting up the Arc was a breeze. I simply plugged it in, connected it to my Wi-Fi, and linked it to my TV with the included HDMI cable. The Sonos app made it easy to fine-tune the sound to my liking.

I found the voice control features handy for adjusting volume or switching inputs without reaching for a remote. The Arc also works well for music playback, filling my living room with clear, balanced audio.

# Bottom Line

The Sonos Arc is a top-notch soundbar that delivers excellent audio for movies, TV, and music. Its easy setup and smart features make it a great choice for upgrading your home entertainment system.



# Overview of the Sonos Arc Soundbar

I've been testing out the Arc, and I'm impressed with its performance. This sleek soundbar packs a punch with Dolby Atmos support, creating an immersive 3D sound experience for movies and TV shows. The Arc connects easily to my TV via HDMI and integrates well with my smart home setup. I can control it using voice commands, the Sonos app, or my TV remote.

Sound quality is top-notch, with clear dialogue and rich bass even without a separate subwoofer. The Arc's 11 drivers fill my living room nicely. I appreciate the simple setup process and how it works seamlessly with other Sonos speakers for multi-room audio.

While it's on the pricier side, the Arc delivers premium sound and smart features that enhance my home entertainment. It's a solid choice for those wanting high-quality audio without a complex surround sound system.

# Immersive 3D Sound with Dolby Atmos

I was blown away by the Arc's 3D sound. Dolby Atmos makes movies and shows come alive. I felt like I was right in the middle of the action. The upward-firing speakers create a dome of sound that fills the room. Explosions rumble overhead, and raindrops seem to fall all around you.

The Arc does a great job with music too. Instruments and vocals are clear and detailed. Bass is punchy but not overwhelming. I loved how it made my favorite songs sound fresh and exciting.

While the Arc sounds amazing on its own, it really shines when paired with rear speakers for true surround sound. The price is high, but the audio quality matches premium home theater systems. For most people, this soundbar will be all they need for an immersive audio setup.

# Seamless Connectivity

I was impressed by how easy it was to set up the Arc. With built-in Wi-Fi, I just plugged it in and the Sonos app guided me through the process. Connecting to my TV via HDMI made things simple. The Arc works great with Alexa, letting me control it by voice. I can stream music from my phone or computer without issues. One small gripe is that it only has one HDMI port, so I had to use up my TV's eARC port. But for most setups, this won't be a problem. Overall, getting the Arc connected and working smoothly was a breeze.

# Ease of Use and Control

Setting up the Arc was a breeze. I plugged it in, connected it to my TV with HDMI, and the Sonos app guided me through the rest. The app is user-friendly and lets me fine-tune the sound easily. I can adjust bass, treble, and other settings with a few taps. Voice control with Alexa or Google Assistant works well too. The touch controls on top of the soundbar are simple and responsive. I like that I can quickly mute the mic or adjust volume without reaching for my phone. The Arc integrates smoothly with my TV remote, so I don't need extra remotes cluttering my coffee table.

# Design and Build Quality

The Arc's sleek design caught my eye right away. Its curved shape and matte black finish look elegant in my living room. I was impressed by how solid and well-made it feels - no cheap plastic here. At 45 inches wide, it's a good size for my 55-inch TV without overwhelming the space.

The metal grille wraps seamlessly around the front and top. There are touch controls on top, but I mostly use the app. I like that it can be wall-mounted or sit on my TV stand. The only downside is its 13.78 pound weight made setup a bit tricky by myself.

Overall, the Arc has a premium look and feel that matches its high-end sound quality. It's clearly built to last.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Sonos soundbar for a while now, and it's transformed my TV viewing experience. Let's break down what I like and don't like about it.

# Pros

* Amazing sound quality
* Easy setup process
* Sleek, modern design
* Dolby Atmos support
* User-friendly app for adjustments

The Arc delivers rich, room-filling audio that's a huge step up from my TV's built-in speakers. I was impressed by how quick and simple it was to set up. The black finish looks great with my TV, and it doesn't take up much space.

Dolby Atmos really shines with this soundbar. I can hear sounds coming from all around me, even from above. The app is a nice touch - I can fine-tune the audio settings without any hassle.

# Cons

* High price point
* Limited connectivity options
* May not fit all TV setups

The Arc isn't cheap, and that might put some people off. I had to think hard before spending this much on a soundbar.

It only has one HDMI port, which might be an issue if you have multiple devices to connect. Also, its size might not work well with all TV setups - it's quite long and could look odd with smaller screens.

While the sound is great, it's not a full home theater system. If you want the deepest bass or true surround sound, you might need to buy extra speakers.

# What Customers Are Saying

I've noticed that many Arc users are thrilled with their purchase. The sound quality gets a lot of praise, with folks calling it ""incredible"" and ""excellent."" People seem to love how easy it is to set up and use. The Sonos app gets good marks for letting users tweak the sound to their liking. Some buyers were hesitant about the price but felt it was worth it after trying the Arc. A few mentioned it works great in rooms with high ceilings. Not everyone thinks it's perfect though. Some say it's not quite as good as a full home theater system. But for most users, the Arc seems to hit the sweet spot of great sound without too many extra speakers cluttering up the room.

# Conclusion

After spending time with the Arc, I'm impressed. This soundbar delivers rich, room-filling audio that truly enhances movies and TV. The Dolby Atmos support adds depth, though it works best in rooms with the right layout. Setup was a breeze, and the app makes adjustments simple. While pricey, the Arc's sound quality and ease of use justify the cost for many. It's not a full home theater replacement, but for most people, it's more than enough. The sleek design looks great too. If you want to upgrade your TV audio without a complex speaker system, the Arc is a solid choice. Just measure your space first to make sure it fits.",1,1732733669.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

The prompt:

Can you please help me write an EPIC letter of complaint. I would like you to direct this letter to \[STARBUCKS\] and specifically complain about \[THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU ORDER A SIMPLE COFFEE, YOU NOW HAVE TO HEAD OVER TO THE BARISTA SECTION AND WAIT BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO ORDERED MORE COMPLICATED DRINKS. IT USED TO BE THAT THE CASHIER WOULD IMMEDIATELY POUR YOUR COFFEE WHILE TAKING YOUR PAYMENT, SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT, BUT THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE\]. In writing the letter, please assume that you are Schopenhauer, and employ his style, exaggerated for effect. This means inserting more than the appropriate amount of vitriol, but also adding a philosophical depth that will cause myself and the recipient of letter to see this letter not as a mere complaint, but a vector for understanding critical truths about the nature of the human condition\]



Output:

**To Whom It May Concern,**  
Starbucks Corporation

It is with a blend of bemusement and dismay that I find myself compelled to address this missive to your venerable institution‚Äîa corporation whose very name conjures the aroma of roasted beans and the hum of human conviviality. But alas, as so often transpires in this wretched world, what was once a modest convenience has descended into an abyss of inefficiency and indignity, revealing the inexorable truth that human ingenuity often labors to exacerbate its own torment.

Permit me to illuminate the matter at hand: the simple act of procuring a humble cup of coffee, a ritual so elemental as to border on the sacrosanct, has, in your establishments, been reduced to a Kafkaesque ordeal. In times past‚Äîoh, golden era!‚Äîone could approach the cashier, offer payment, and receive one's coffee in a seamless exchange, a small but vital balm against the ceaseless friction of existence. Now, however, this elegant choreography has been upended. One is obliged to join the barista queue, a throng teeming with the discordant desires of the latte-swilling masses, to wait interminably for a simple black coffee‚Äîa beverage as unpretentious as it is pure.

What malevolent spirit whispered into the ears of your strategists to devise such a system? Was it envy of the straightforward? A yearning to homogenize all orders into one chaotic stew of needless complexity? Or is this, perhaps, yet another manifestation of the perverse will-to-live, that insidious force which drives humanity to complicate even its simplest pleasures, burdening the soul under the guise of progress?

This new order of operations, I contend, is not merely inconvenient‚Äîit is emblematic of a deeper malaise afflicting our age. In subordinating the immediate needs of the coffee purist to the intricate demands of the frappuccino aficionado, you enact a parable of modern existence itself: the triumph of the ostentatious over the essential, of the complicated over the clear. The cashier, who once poured coffee with the swiftness of one acknowledging the brevity of life, now stands idle while a customer's payment is processed, sending us on to wait behind elaborate concoctions that stand as monuments to mankind‚Äôs grotesque excess.

And what, I ask you, is the metaphysical significance of this indignity? It reveals that the human condition is one of perpetual frustration, that the very institutions erected to ease our burdens become instruments of our torment. The coffee queue, once a beacon of simplicity, now mirrors the world itself: teeming with noise, cluttered with unnecessary diversions, a grim microcosm of life‚Äôs relentless absurdity.

Starbucks, you were meant to be an oasis in the desert of existence‚Äîa place where one could briefly elude the relentless grind of modernity. Instead, you have become a mirror to it, a dark reflection of the bureaucracy and entropy that plague our lives.

I implore you, in whatever vestiges of wisdom remain in your corporate soul, to restore the practice of immediate coffee service. Let not the coffee purist be forced to linger behind the artifice of caramel drizzle and whipped cream. Bring back the era when a simple coffee could be obtained without this parade of inefficiency, and in so doing, restore to your patrons a measure of existential relief.

Yours in exasperated sincerity,  
\[Your Name\]

I recently had the chance to try out the Sonos Arc soundbar in my home theater setup, and I'm impressed with its performance. This sleek black soundbar packs a punch when it comes to audio quality.

The Arc delivers rich, room-filling sound that brings movies and TV shows to life. I noticed a big upgrade from my TV's built-in speakers. The Dolby Atmos support creates an immersive 3D audio experience that made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action.

Setting up the Arc was a breeze. I simply plugged it in, connected it to my Wi-Fi, and linked it to my TV with the included HDMI cable. The Sonos app made it easy to fine-tune the sound to my liking.

I found the voice control features handy for adjusting volume or switching inputs without reaching for a remote. The Arc also works well for music playback, filling my living room with clear, balanced audio.

# Bottom Line

The Sonos Arc is a top-notch soundbar that delivers excellent audio for movies, TV, and music. Its easy setup and smart features make it a great choice for upgrading your home entertainment system.



# Overview of the Sonos Arc Soundbar

I've been testing out the Arc, and I'm impressed with its performance. This sleek soundbar packs a punch with Dolby Atmos support, creating an immersive 3D sound experience for movies and TV shows. The Arc connects easily to my TV via HDMI and integrates well with my smart home setup. I can control it using voice commands, the Sonos app, or my TV remote.

Sound quality is top-notch, with clear dialogue and rich bass even without a separate subwoofer. The Arc's 11 drivers fill my living room nicely. I appreciate the simple setup process and how it works seamlessly with other Sonos speakers for multi-room audio.

While it's on the pricier side, the Arc delivers premium sound and smart features that enhance my home entertainment. It's a solid choice for those wanting high-quality audio without a complex surround sound system.

# Immersive 3D Sound with Dolby Atmos

I was blown away by the Arc's 3D sound. Dolby Atmos makes movies and shows come alive. I felt like I was right in the middle of the action. The upward-firing speakers create a dome of sound that fills the room. Explosions rumble overhead, and raindrops seem to fall all around you.

The Arc does a great job with music too. Instruments and vocals are clear and detailed. Bass is punchy but not overwhelming. I loved how it made my favorite songs sound fresh and exciting.

While the Arc sounds amazing on its own, it really shines when paired with rear speakers for true surround sound. The price is high, but the audio quality matches premium home theater systems. For most people, this soundbar will be all they need for an immersive audio setup.

# Seamless Connectivity

I was impressed by how easy it was to set up the Arc. With built-in Wi-Fi, I just plugged it in and the Sonos app guided me through the process. Connecting to my TV via HDMI made things simple. The Arc works great with Alexa, letting me control it by voice. I can stream music from my phone or computer without issues. One small gripe is that it only has one HDMI port, so I had to use up my TV's eARC port. But for most setups, this won't be a problem. Overall, getting the Arc connected and working smoothly was a breeze.

# Ease of Use and Control

Setting up the Arc was a breeze. I plugged it in, connected it to my TV with HDMI, and the Sonos app guided me through the rest. The app is user-friendly and lets me fine-tune the sound easily. I can adjust bass, treble, and other settings with a few taps. Voice control with Alexa or Google Assistant works well too. The touch controls on top of the soundbar are simple and responsive. I like that I can quickly mute the mic or adjust volume without reaching for my phone. The Arc integrates smoothly with my TV remote, so I don't need extra remotes cluttering my coffee table.

# Design and Build Quality

The Arc's sleek design caught my eye right away. Its curved shape and matte black finish look elegant in my living room. I was impressed by how solid and well-made it feels - no cheap plastic here. At 45 inches wide, it's a good size for my 55-inch TV without overwhelming the space.

The metal grille wraps seamlessly around the front and top. There are touch controls on top, but I mostly use the app. I like that it can be wall-mounted or sit on my TV stand. The only downside is its 13.78 pound weight made setup a bit tricky by myself.

Overall, the Arc has a premium look and feel that matches its high-end sound quality. It's clearly built to last.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Sonos soundbar for a while now, and it's transformed my TV viewing experience. Let's break down what I like and don't like about it.

# Pros

* Amazing sound quality
* Easy setup process
* Sleek, modern design
* Dolby Atmos support
* User-friendly app for adjustments

The Arc delivers rich, room-filling audio that's a huge step up from my TV's built-in speakers. I was impressed by how quick and simple it was to set up. The black finish looks great with my TV, and it doesn't take up much space.

Dolby Atmos really shines with this soundbar. I can hear sounds coming from all around me, even from above. The app is a nice touch - I can fine-tune the audio settings without any hassle.

# Cons

* High price point
* Limited connectivity options
* May not fit all TV setups

The Arc isn't cheap, and that might put some people off. I had to think hard before spending this much on a soundbar.

It only has one HDMI port, which might be an issue if you have multiple devices to connect. Also, its size might not work well with all TV setups - it's quite long and could look odd with smaller screens.

While the sound is great, it's not a full home theater system. If you want the deepest bass or true surround sound, you might need to buy extra speakers.

# What Customers Are Saying

I've noticed that many Arc users are thrilled with their purchase. The sound quality gets a lot of praise, with folks calling it ""incredible"" and ""excellent."" People seem to love how easy it is to set up and use. The Sonos app gets good marks for letting users tweak the sound to their liking. Some buyers were hesitant about the price but felt it was worth it after trying the Arc. A few mentioned it works great in rooms with high ceilings. Not everyone thinks it's perfect though. Some say it's not quite as good as a full home theater system. But for most users, the Arc seems to hit the sweet spot of great sound without too many extra speakers cluttering up the room.

# Conclusion

After spending time with the Arc, I'm impressed. This soundbar delivers rich, room-filling audio that truly enhances movies and TV. The Dolby Atmos support adds depth, though it works best in rooms with the right layout. Setup was a breeze, and the app makes adjustments simple. While pricey, the Arc's sound quality and ease of use justify the cost for many. It's not a full home theater replacement, but for most people, it's more than enough. The sleek design looks great too. If you want to upgrade your TV audio without a complex speaker system, the Arc is a solid choice. Just measure your space first to make sure it fits.",1,1732733608.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I work as an a barista and something happened during my shift recently. I've been thinking a lot about it lately. 

The other day, a blind customer came my job and was getting around by herself. I welcomed her as she headed to¬†the counter and said, ""would you like any assistance to the counter?"" since the coffee shop where I work is tiny and hard to get around due to the amount of customers and several chairs in the way.

""No, I'm good, thanks ,"" she responded, in a tone that hinted irritation. After successfully placing her coffee order, it came time to pay. I waited patiently while she inserted her card into the reader. After her first comment, I retreated from trying to assist her. She was clearly having trouble, so I asked if she could help entering her card. To which she said, ""Are you ableist?!?!"" ""Oh no ma'am, I just want to help you!"" was my response to her.

I have previously assisted numerous blind clients who asked for¬†help. removing the straw wrappers at times bringing their drinks to their seats, and even helping them in locating the restroom. She went on to say, ""I'm a dancer and I do ballet,"" along with a few other unrelated things that I am unable to recall, but I didn't want to cause her any stress. 

""I will be right back, I'm going to the restroom,"" she said after she completed her payment, and I replied, ""Okay ma'am,"" as she stood right in front of the counter (the drink¬†pickup was down the bar). While heading to the restroom (which can be found in the far right corner), she slammed into a wall. 

After becoming frustrated, she flung her cane on the floor and started yelling, ""IS NO ONE GOING TO HELP ME?"" As I said earlier, I am the kind of person¬†that would love helping anyone in need. lately though, I've been worried that by asking, I might have come across as judging or as believing they couldn't handle it on their own.

Some of you may start to wonder if you are an extremist. Some of you may wonder if edging and watching porn sometimes is ok.

Is it ok to punch your wife in the face sometimes? Is it ok to cheat on your wife or be the one someone else‚Äôs wife cheats with sometimes? There are certain principles that must be adhered to absolutely. This is not extreme. This is logical, just, and good.

Do not allow them to lower our vibration. When you understand the path you‚Äôre on, do not allow anyone to make you stray.

In this modern world there are many people who have lost the understanding of principle. It is not extreme to follow principles absolutely as long as they are sound.

May all of you develop stronger judgment as this journey is not for the weak. There will be envious souls trying to bring you down to their vibration. That is when you vibrate even higher so you can be protected.

Bend to other social norms that don‚Äôt matter because being rigid isn‚Äôt good. If the world says wearing hats inside is rude but it‚Äôs part of your style then bend the rules. If the world says men must drink black coffee hot but you enjoy a cold frappuccino then bend the rules. These are rules that don‚Äôt matter.

### Key Features of Manual Recliner Loveseats

Understanding the key features of manual recliner loveseats is essential for making an informed decision. Here are the main elements to keep in mind:

- **Reclining Mechanism:** Most manual recliners feature a lever or a pull handle that allows you to lean back and find your ideal position. Make sure the mechanism is easy to use and fits your specific needs.

I wanted to find a place where I could ask for a piece of advice regarding long-distance relationships. It's probably going to be a very popular type of question üòÖ  
Me and my girlfriend live 120 km from each other, so I visit here once in a week or two. I'm a university student, she is a high-schooler preparing for her final exams. Both of us are adults.

The problem is, she often points me out as the one who doesn't really plan or organise anything for us, doesn't really put much effort into the relationship. She is right. I don't know why, but I just struggle to come up with any activities we can do. I'm a very chill person. I love to spend time at home, read a book, play a game, study, dive into my passions for a while. I'm a bit reluctant to doing new and spontanious things. She is the opposite ‚Äî she loves to do something fresh, try new things, go out, have some fun. I always try to find a place, an event, but usually we end up finding something and doing it all over again now be it going to a cinema, grabbing a coffe at a local caffe or organising a little picknick in the park. She says we either don't do anything or just go to the same places, which gets boring quickly.  
I also and especially struggle with activities when we're separated. Like, what can you actually do being 120 km from each other??? Play a game? Watch a movie together again? I also tried ordering her a meal or a coffee to be delivered to her house and it was a brilliant idea, she was so delighted and I was so happy with it, but it's also very pricy to me as a student for the long run ü•≤ I don't know why it's so hard, but I'd really love to do something special for her, especially that she's always stresses from the enormous amount of studying she has to fill her days with and ends up exhausted and barely able to call me for a couple of minutes, before she has to go to sleep before it's too late to wake up well-rested before the next day of school.

So, the simple question is: **what activities do you guys do?** And most importantly: **how do you find the ideas?** I mainly struggle with coming up with things, so I'll be especially glad to ""learn how to fish, not ""get the fish themselves"". To say a little bit about us: we both love literature and poetry and I think it's fair to mention we both share an interest to fantasy novels. We are both also tied to music and performing it ‚Äî I play the guitar, she used to sing in a choir.",1,1732732230.0,LongDistance,0,0.99,False

+essential perfumes, bois: he didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He just grabbed the paper and held it under his nose and inhaled. ‚ÄûCan you glue the paper under my nose?‚Äú i didn‚Äôt, but sprayed a bit on one arm ;)

+essential perfumes, divine Vanille: ‚Äûsmells like wood. Can you spray it on my other arm?‚Äú

-zoologist chipmunk: ‚Äûurgh. Smells like rotten eggs‚Äú

Then I'm straight all I have to do is wait for the previously mentioned white car in the drive thru line to pull forward bc they are too far to the right for me (or even a small car) to squeeze thru them and Parked car *sighs* np I'll wait till the inch forward then I'm good to go and can leave... but this white car is driven by an idiot üôÑ she had the nerve to roll down her window and yell at me while I'm still stopped just waiting for the line to move so I can pass the white car  and leave, and yells out ""wtf r u doing????!!!!!""

I have already post here before with the same words almost that are said‚Ä¶but now I feel that I am ready. I will be 39 years old in December and I want to give myself the best of the gift. I don‚Äôt drink coffee, but I drink one or two Yerba mate or Guayusa energy drinks by day. Sometimes I skip one day or two, but always relapse.i find that these drinks don‚Äôt give myself anxiety like coffee does, but I lack of energy and it gives depression when it crash. Also, I like to produce music and find that these drinks make myself creative, and that is the number one of my intention to keep the creativity, and I am a little afraid that I won‚Äôt be as creative without them. But it is false because I lose energy fast when I drink them and finally do nothing. So I want tomorrow the first day without energy drinks‚Ä¶but I will continue to drink tea. I have bought smoothie mixer and now makes fruit and vegetables smoothie, I find that it gives little energy, so it help me. I want to change energy drinks toward smoothie all the time, so it will be an healthy alternative. When I stop drinking energy drinks, the next day or two are hard and that is always because of that that I relapse. I have another little question‚Ä¶what do you think of Nootropics Depot, if you have heard of them? I‚Äôm not sure if I want only smoothie for my days, or some nootropic on N.D, stimulant or to relax, because I don‚Äôt know if it is the right choice. Because when I have ordered N.D in the past, these things gave me intense nightmares or dreams and now I only want healthy lifestyle, so vegetables smoothie don‚Äôt give me symptoms like that. Thank you very much! Have a great day.",1,1732731598.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

We both started from 0 connections wanting to break into the financial industry. Neither family relatives or friends that we both have are in that sphere so we started from 0. 

Both of us started networking efforts at the beginning of this year : cold outreach, coffee chats, etc.

I‚Äôve had a few coffee chats but none of them really stocked and as much as I tried to nurture the connection it just didn‚Äôt work on the other side. 


My friend however was able to have a mentor that keeps up with her and he‚Äôs a managing director at bulge bracket bank, and they‚Äôve had multiple exchanges / phone calls and he gave her much perspective and praise.

We lived on the east coast , and she emailed someone not even out Alma mater , and he took 45 min to talk to her and told her to keep him updated by this certain date. I understand alumni would be more inclined to respond, but she‚Äôs gotten responses from people with no connection. 


I‚Äôm trying not to be jealous but I‚Äôve probably reached out to hundreds and had many calls and my email template is pretty much the same as hers.. 

The most senior professionals manage to make time for her and she‚Äôs even secured an interview by cold outreach.

Not everyone in the witch community can agree on this but we can definitely all agree that this is kind of a hot button topic.

Anyways before i left for work i heard people talking about this in a podcast i was listening to and i couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it all day.

ü§°‚ÄúThe only thing that you need for spells is intention‚Äù

     I can have every intention of getting a paycheck, but if i dont get out of bed, get my uniform on, have my coffee, go to work, and do my job‚Ä¶ then i wont get shit. 

     That isnt to say that intention isnt NECESSARY either. Intention IS super important but i sort of feel like some people get confused and think its some sort of crazy godlike superpower that they have where they dont even need to put in the spellwork, they can just make things happen with their minds. Again though, intention is important but people get confused.

Let me put it like this:

     Would you want to eat at a restaurant where the chef making you food had no intention of making something that tasted good? 
      Would you feel confident in getting on a plane that an engineer designed with no intention of making something that could fly?

What about this next one:

ü§°‚ÄúYou dont need tools to do spells, you can just use your energy.‚Äù

you can try to make a cake without any tools, but now what? Are you going to get the ingredients together and just, 
will them into a cake, with your mind? 
Yeah okay buddy. Well you Have fun with that, i‚Äôll be over here with my bowls, and my spoons and my oven making a damn cake.

    Again though, just to play devils advocate, being able to do spells using your energy is also really important. Obviously you dont always carry your wand and cauldron and shit around with you everywhere so lets put it like this:

     If i asked you to split a carrot in half do you NEED a knife to do it?
Obviously not, anyone can break a carrot by hand. A knife would make it EASIER, but its not necessary for something small like this. 
   Now what if i asked you to peel a carrot and dice it? Could you do that by hand? 
Potentially yes, you could probably find some creative ways lol, but if i knew there was a knife available i would go and get that first. ",18,1732731274.0,witchcraft,18,0.92,False

","I‚Äôm in an argument with someone saying that it‚Äôs not doctrine or policy to abstain from coffee and tea or pay a full tithe to be able to get a temple recommend. I just need to try. I said see how that works with the law of chastity. 
But does anyone know where I can find something that says it is policy that they pay a full size and abstain from coffee and tea completely? 
Edit: I know they are temple recommend questions. This argument is about do u have to pay a FULL tithe with no wiggle room. And abstain from coffee and tea 100%. She says she doesn‚Äôt pay a full tithe and still drinks tea and coffee. It‚Äôs all about if u try or not. So I want something (if it‚Äôs out there) that says it‚Äôs more black and white.
