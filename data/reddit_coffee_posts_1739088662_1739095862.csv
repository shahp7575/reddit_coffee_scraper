So starting off this series with one of the most recommended beginner coffee here: **Hunkal heights Aranya gold/Tiger reserve**

This coffee is likely going to be the gateway to better brews for many newcomers to the sub, and probably the one most of you have tried or will try. While not exactly specialty coffee, it's still one of the best entry level coffee beans in the country and a must try if you're starting your coffee journey.

Some information about this coffee according to the manufacturer:

* Blend Composition - Aranya gold (100% arabica), Tiger Reserve (80% Arabica 20% Robusta)
* Roast Level - Medium for both

So, grab your notebooks and start jotting down those coffee notes!

***Rules:***

* Share how the coffee tastes to you.
* Mention the brewer and brewing method you used (and feel free to drop your recipe if you can).
* (Optional) If you’ve tried other coffees that taste similar, share your suggestions!

Last week, I met a woman on social media. We talked for a few minutes online, but I had the confidence to go all in and ask for a spontaneous date that same night—and it worked. We went to a café, and it was very enjoyable.

Yesterday, we had a second date. We went for a sunny walk, ate together, then I invited her to my place for coffee and conversation. I had no interest in having sex yet because I prefer to develop a strong sense of complicity with her first. Bref, the date was great, and I believe we are a perfect match for each other. I really love the fact that I’ve gained a level of confidence I never had before.

One last thing I’m proud of is that after yesterday’s date, I obviously had blue balls, and it was hurting. I knew that one way to release the tension was to fap, but I just acknowledged it and didn’t even have the urge to do it, even though it was painful. I let it heal overnight, the tension released itself naturally, and I’m all good this morning—still on this successful NoFap streak.

I’m very proud that I don’t have any urges anymore and that I’m seeing positive effects in my life.",2,1739095279.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False

1ilbioy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1ilbioy/when_they_come_with_a_spare_wheel/,When they come with a spare wheel,"So there I am, casually scrolling through TikTok, lost in the endless loop of people dancing, lip-syncing, and sharing questionable life advice, when I stumble upon her. Now, I’m not saying she had the kind of energy that could stop traffic, but let's just say, if I were driving, my car would've crashed into a tree the moment she smiled. This chick had it all—the vibe, the smile, the look that could cause a guy to accidentally send a heart emoji to his mom. Naturally, I hit that friend request button like a guy who had just discovered a new planet.

A few minutes later—ding! The notification pops up: She accepted. I swear, I almost dropped my phone. It was like getting handed a golden ticket to get a greasy bag of chips ya mwitu—except instead of chips ya mwitu, I got a direct line to someone who could probably bench press my self-esteem.

We start chatting, and let me tell you, it’s like we’ve been friends for years. Smooth, natural. The kind of conversation where you’re sending messages and waiting for the next one like it's the best Netflix series you’ve ever watched. Then, just like that, we agree to meet at Java Junction. Nothing fancy, just coffee. I’m thinking, Alright, this is gonna be chill.

Cut to the big day. I walk into Java Junction, feeling the nervous excitement you get on your first date, trying to look like I’m not sweating through my shirt. And there she is—Brenda. She enters the café like she’s the sun and the rest of us are just planets orbiting around her. Her smile? Magnetic. Warm, confident, a little dangerous. She has that kind of beauty that makes you stop in your tracks. If there were a soundtrack to this moment, it would be some dramatic orchestral piece—strings and horns and all.

But wait—there’s a plot twist. Brenda’s not alone. Oh no. Her friend is with her, and she’s like—a vision. This woman is so stunning, I almost drop my coffee just looking at her. She’s got that rich, luminous ebony skin, glowing like she’s been kissed by the stars. And her body? Holy curves. It’s like someone carefully designed her from top to bottom, each contour more captivating than the last. Her full lips, high cheekbones, eyes that shine with mystery? Forget it. I was in trouble.

We grab our coffees and start chatting, but I quickly realize—I’m not just on a casual date. No, no. Every sentence I say feels like I’m trying out for the lead role in a rom-com. I’m half-waiting for a soundtrack to start playing and someone to yell “Cut!” because I’m definitely overdoing it, but at this point, I’m too invested to stop.

Then Ivy (aka the Self-Appointed Secret Service of the night) leans in and drops this bomb: “I’m her security. I have to do the vetting.”

I choke on my coffee. Wait, what? Is this a date or an interrogation? I’m half expecting her to pull out a lie detector test and start asking if I’m secretly a spy or just here to steal Brenda’s mutura. But instead, I go sausage pasua mode like, “Yeah, sure. Totally fine with the intense background check.”

Fast forward to the end of this caffeine-fueled interrogation—sorry, meeting—and Brenda says she’ll walk me to my car parked on level 1. I’m thinking, Alright, here we go—moment of truth. We walk to the car, and suddenly... she does something that flips the whole script.

Instead of a casual goodnight, I enter the backseat with her in tow. Casually. Like she’s stepping onto a movie set, all smooth and effortless. I’m sitting there, like, Wait, hold up—what just happened? My brain is processing the what and the why at the speed of dial-up internet.

But then, like a scene from a rom-com that’s both terrifying and exhilarating, she sits on my lap. Full-on. Staring me in the eye. I think, Is this a dream? Is someone about to jump out and tell me I’ve been punked? But nope, this is very real. And before I can even gather my thoughts, she leans in and plants a kiss on me. Right on the lips.

I’m frozen. What? Is this actually happening? I’m looking around like I might be in a parallel universe where everything is cooler, smoother, and more dramatic. At this time Mandela is straining to be released from prison.

We break the kiss, both of us a little breathless, and she smirks like she’s the mastermind behind this whole operation. “I’ll text you. Round two coming soon, I see Mandela is excited to meet me.” And just like that, she slides out of the car.

As she walks away, I sit there, stunned, replaying every second of what just happened. Did I just get kissed on a first date after being vetted by her friend? I don’t know, but if this is what the vetting process looks like, I’m 100% in for round two—just as long as Ivy doesn’t show up with a clipboard for a follow-up interview.

What happens next? Stay tuned…

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (East Midlands in England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

My interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to): playing sports (badminton, squash, table tennis etc); fitness/gym; watching movies 
(my favourite film genre is horror movies); reading; socialising; going out for coffees; going out for dinner; going to pubs and clubs; learning about new languages and cultures; cooking; playing pool, and bowling; travelling and sightseeing; gaming etc. 

If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same thing, or feels they may share some of the same interests or values as me, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and chat and connect.

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Hi everyone,

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also.

1ilbcqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW/comments/1ilbcqg/is_she_shy_or_shes_just_oblivious/,Is she shy or she's just oblivious?,"I (f. 31), have a crush on my coworker (f. 25). She came to my workplace around half of a year ago. We instantly clicked, after barely two weeks she told me that she loves spending time with me and I quickly started developing feelings for her. She's certified yapper towards everyone, but mostly towards me and our coworkers tease us about it, calling us twins (because we have the same name). I came out to her quite early (I just casually said that me and my ex girlfriend had a dog because I've always been out and proud), and not long after she told me that she's catholic... It scared me off a bit, but in time I realised that she's also a feminist and she's very open-minded.

I'm not flirting openly with her, but I know that my stupid face shows off everything that I'm feeling. We always look into each other's eyes when we talk, we smile all the time to each other. We're helping each other with tasks at work (also I can show off my strength because she's always asking me to change container in water dispenser xD). I asked her out on a ""date"" (I didn't call it exactly that, but I'll quote our conversation) and her reaction was priceless:

Me: Would you like to go out with me to hot chocolate?
Her: Wait, what? (She looked confused, but happy) Could you repeat? 
Me: Do you want to go to hot chocolate with me?
Her: Where? 
Me: To [place name] in old town. 
Her: Ooh! I wanted to check it out! My friend went there with her boyfriend on a date.
Me: So is that a ""yes""? 
Her: Sure! 

So we went on this date and it wasn't all romantic, but I was happy anyway. One day she told me, that she was never in a relationship, so I'm guessing that she's a virgin. Bit later she asked me about my novel that I wrote, but stopped working on it. She studied editing, so she wanted to help me out, but I was bit scared, since my book is erotic. But boy, I was so wrong... She read it, she loved it and she... scolded the shit out of me, because she said that it has enormous potential but it doesn't have structure and there's not enough spicy scenes xD. So SHE asked ME out for dinner and coffee to talk about my novel and since then we're working on it together. When we went on this ""date"" it was more romantic, because we sat in front of each other when we had dinner and I really felt the romantic atmosphere... 

Few days later I couldn't hold back any longer and asked her why she was never in a relationship. Her reply was like: ""Oh, I never fell in love and I suspect that when it will happen it will be like a lightning bolt. I didn't have many male friends when I was younger. And I'm straight... Probably."" The last part broke me, because I became even more confused. What the hell even ""probably"" mean!? 

One day at work I told her very dry joke, she was embarrassed by it (but in a playful way) and I told her, that I have a sense of humour of a teenage boy. She said that everyone has humor like that, but they don't show it, so I replied that I'm holding back when it comes to her (because I LOVE flirty and sexual jokes and she's aware of it since she heard my conversations with other coworkers). She looked me straight in the eye and said: ""So don't hold back"". But it's hard for me, because I don't want to scare her off, especially since it would be straight up flirting. 

Anyway. To the most important part. 

We're going on a concert to a different country in one month. Quite far away. Just the two of us. Whole weekend, one hotel room with ""separate"" beds (because on some pictures of hotel the beds were joined anyway). And I don't know what to expect. 

Okay, so since y'all have a background – do you think that since she was never in a relationship she doesn't understand the meaning of my behaviour? Or she's just shy? She often blushes when she talks to me, she's the one who comes to my desk to yapp. And I'm so confused...

The laptop was on when it happened, and it kept running for a while after the spill.

I reacted quickly and rotated the laptop to prevent more liquid from getting inside, but I didn’t turn it off. After a few minutes, I tried wiping the keyboard, and while doing so, I accidentally pressed a few buttons. That’s when I heard some noise, and the laptop powered off by itself.

I tried turning it back on, but it won’t power up now.

The next morning, I took it to a service center covered by the store’s warranty (though I didn’t mention the coffee spill, as I knew they wouldn’t take it if I did).

What do you think?
Should I still have hope for a repair?
Do you think my laptop should have had spill resistance or some protection against this kind of issue?

I also realized now that I have a stick blender that I can easily make the viral dalgona coffee from 2020. 

Now I don't really want to have 2 separate drinks, the shake and the coffee, but I want to somehow combine them. The obvious thing to do would be to just have the coffee cream on top of the shake, but I want to ask for a good order of operations if I don't care about looks and want to maximize efficiency in having less dishes to wash. AKA making the whole thing in just the blender cup and only using 1 blender attachment. Here's the order I was thinking of:

1. Make the coffee cream first in the cup, but use sugar-free syrup instead of sugar

2. Add the oatmeal shake ingredients right in on top of the cream and just blend it up.

The concerns I have are whether the cream will form if I use the blender attachment instead of the whisk attachment and also if I substitute sugar-free syrup for sugar. The reason for the sub is the shake is the only reason I bought the syrup in the first place and don't have any other use for the still half-bottle left. 

Also by just dumping everything together is there any point in making the cream in the first place or will it be the same as just adding a bit of concentrated coffee into my regular shake?",1,1739094238.0,Cooking,1,1.0,False

We are  
Members   
Of the same secret society   
We are like Stonemasons   
The Bilderbergians   
Illuminati 

Except we do not   
Cannot   
Control the levers of power   
Because we can barely   
Hold together our own lives 

There are no secret handshakes   
Because often we mistake a   
Fist bump   
For a cheek kiss  

We do not form clubs   
Where virgins are sacrificed   
Upon an altar to Moloch   
Because we thrive alone   
And it is we   
Who lost our virginity   
Late 

We are the anxious   
We are the shy   
We are the socially awkward   
And   
We are often,   
The depressed 

Some of us have learned   
To hide it   
We have jobs  
And  
As we speak to an auditorium   
There is a background drone   
Of dread   
As if some microphone   
Attached to a deep space probe   
Has picked up the sound   
Of an eater of worlds   
Cthulhu   
Devouring a distant galaxy 

I watch very closely   
For these people   
In the wild   
(And to them   
The world is the wild)

I watch how they   
Sit in coffee shops   
How they point their   
Crossed feet at the   
Exit   
And cover the dimple below   
Their exposed throats   
As a regrettable date   
Discourses on Bitcoin 

I see them in bars   
Drinking alcohol   
Like Medicine   
I see them working in   
Those same bars   
Saying, ‘I’ll collect glasses’   
So they don’t have to stare down   
The barrel of the cruel, unfeeling masses 

Often, I see them   
Stopping in the street to   
Stroke cats because   
Cats don’t judge   
Well, not much 

I see you on warm days   
Sitting in puffer coats   
Like caterpillars   
Who never are quite able to   
Emerge from their cocoons 

And I see the way  
You bite your cuticles   
Chew your hair   
Tap yourself on the forehead gently   
When the bastard–   
That voice in your head–  
With you   
Your whole life   
Launches a particularly   
Savage attack 

I feel your despair   
Your inability to live in the moment   
The sense you were born into  
Cosmic randomness   
Not even a God could comprehend 

And I feel your rage   
Because you are forced to   
Inhabit a world with those   
Who claim to have all the answers   
Those who make black-and-white statements   
About spirituality, politics, economics   
Pineapples on pizza 

We live in a world designed by the confident   
The extroverted   
The gung ho   
The foolish   
And we dance to their drumbeat  

When we are young, we go   
To their awful nightclubs   
And even when we are old   
We are pushed in our wheelchairs   
Into their retirement home circles   
Still forced to socialise   
No rest until   
Death 

No we will never form   
Our own club   
We will never effect   
The price of the dollar   
We will never instigate war   
(Because we are at war   
With ourselves) 

But just know   
I see you   
And I do not stare   
And I do not judge   
And it is against my nature   
And probably yours   
To impose  

And that is our blessing   
And that is our curse

Very small amounts worked the best after having a 3 week tolerance break. I'm also on atomoxetine and I drink small amounts of coffee. Experience with Vyvanse: 2 years+

Before my break I was taking 30mg to 55mg (15mg+15mg to 20mg+20mg+dex). After the break I first managed to get full efficacy just from 10mg (5mg+5mg) of Vyvanse. The need slowly goes up to about 30mg (10mg+10mg+10mg). After a few months on 30mg I know it's time to take a longer break again, instead of updosing, because the efficacy fades and certain side effects appear.

The takeaway for me was that a 10mg-30mg dosage range can give me full efficacy with minimal side effects, whereas a 30mg-55mg range gives full efficacy but more problems and more money spent.",3,1739093526.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Hey Empowish community! 🌟

Ever felt that initial excitement when you decide to start a new habit – only to find it slowly fading away after a few days? You're not alone. Transforming dreams into goals and then into reality means making habits that stick, and I'm here to help you crack the code! Understanding the science behind habit formation can supercharge your personal growth journey.

Let's dive into some action-packed strategies that will help you make your habits stick like glue. Ready for transformation even when the initial motivation dips? Let's do this! 🚀

1. **Start Small 🎯**

The key to success is to start so small that you can’t say no. This concept is rooted in the psychology of tiny habits. For instance, if you want to build a reading habit, begin with just five pages a day. 🕮 Sounds easy, right? That's the point! This technique minimizes resistance and makes it more likely that you'll start the habit regularly, hence setting you up for success.

👉 Tip: Celebrate small victories regularly! Every little step adds up and deserves a small celebration. Got through your five pages? High five! 🙌

2. **Pair the New Habit with an Established One 🔗**

Behavioral science suggests that linking a new habit to an existing one can strengthen the new behavior. It's called ""habit stacking."" If you habitually drink coffee every morning, pair it with a short meditation or affirmations session. ☕

👉 Try this: ""After I brush my teeth, I will do 10 minutes of journaling."" 📝 By anchoring it to a well-established routine, you’re more likely to remember and perform the new habit.

3. **Make It Fun! 🎉**

Incorporating elements of enjoyment into your habits spurs stickiness. Our brains release dopamine when we experience enjoyment, which reinforces the behavior. Whether it's working out with a friend, dancing while cleaning, or listening to your favorite podcast while jogging, make it as enjoyable as possible. 🕺

👉 Here's an idea: Create a happy playlist for chores or workouts. Linking your habit to something you love transforms it from a chore to a treat. 🎶

4. **Visualize Success and Obstacles ⚖️**

Visualization is a powerful tool. Not only should you see yourself successfully achieving your habit, but also visualize potential obstacles and how you'll overcome them. This dual visualization prepares your mind for challenges and boosts resilience. 🏞️

👉 Exercise: Imagine completing a month of your new habit. Now think of what might hinder it and visualize how you'll tackle those hurdles with grace. 🚧

5. **Track Progress and Fine-tune ⚙️**

When you keep track of your habits, you provide accountability to yourself and celebrate progress. Use a habit tracker app or a simple bullet journal to visually mark each day you complete your habit. 📆

👉 Pro Tip: Analyze weekly what's working and what isn't. Is there a pattern during which your new habit falls off? Adjust your approach to precisely meet those challenges and enhance sustainable development.

So, Empowish champs, what's the habit you're excited to build into your life? Share your experiences, ideas, and even struggles in the comments below!

I am currently having my thesis right now and nasa data gathering na ako and I am done with my defense, it went well naman and I don't see any problems on it.

I was disowned by my stepmother and my Dad passed away na din last 2022 pa. I am struggling financially since may bago na kinasakama yung stepmother ko and hindi naman niya ako kargo dahil hindi daw kami magkadugo (binenta na niya lahat ng ari-arian) namin nalulungkot ako at hindi ko na alam gagawin ko.

At next stop, wala na akong gana tapusin pa tong degree na to pasuko na ako dahil sa mga iniisip ko pero pangarap ng Dad ko na makapagtapos ako. I don't now what to do right now. I tried to inquire and apply sa online sites, coffee shops nearby me, and other restaurants pero hindi sila nagreresponse.  Imagine pano ako mabubuhay sa 300 pesos by this week. Dagdag pa yung mga need bayaran sa dorm.

My step mom cutted off my allowance na rin. Hirap na hirap ako sa buhay, Lord. S-word na minsan ang naiisip ko which is super alarming dahil di na rin ako nakakabili ng gamot ko. Pagod na ako.

I bought a gaggia classic with a 9 bar mod already. Moved from a cheaper De Longhi machine and love it.

My issue is I had to remove the solenoid valve 3 times already to clean in, in a year. Which is very frustrating. Now, I learned my lesson and descale the machine more often, make sure to clean it well etc.

My issue is I live in a European city with hard water. Now my machine is again, blocked. I can steam but I can't put anything through the group head. This is the first time that NOTHING comes out. Only after making like 3-4 shots after last taking apart the valve to clean it.

What am I doing wrong? Is there a way to get a valve that's more tolerant of clogging? I just want to make myself a coffee in the morning, not play technician every week.",1,1739093412.0,gaggiaclassic,4,1.0,False

I know there is no one there, but it gives me tremendous anxiety and anguish every time it happens. Also, I know it may sound strange, but every time I try to sleep and I hear some noise or see something move, sometimes I shake and maybe cry just because I feel like it's there watching me.

I recently got into making my own nutmilk because I want to use less store-bought Oatly Barista. I use a regular espresso maker for the stove and like to use much milk to mellow out the bitterness and acidity from the espresso. 

I did everything that was recommended to avoid it curdling from the acidity of my coffee (heating up the milk and also using sodium bicarbonate to make the coffee less acidic) and it technically worked well. 

So far, I tried pure cashew milk with sunflower oil, cashew milk with coconut cream, and almond milk with just a little bit of coconut cream for the taste. 

I used soy lecithin to emulsify the fat content (sunflower oil, fat from coconut cream). 

But unfortunately, I didn’t like the taste at all. I usually only drink Oatly Barista since it’s creamy and doesn’t leave a weird aftertaste like the majority of the brands I’ve tried over the years. I like how Oatly somehow completes the flavour of my coffee in a way that no other plant milk has done so far - it doesn’t overpower the coffee taste, but rather mellows out the bitterness and acidity without taking too much of the aroma away. 

But my nutmilk… I don’t know. I like the taste of it on its own; if I drink it pure or eat cereal with it it’s delicious. But the almond milk got somehow really gross when I heated it up, it had like a slimy texture and it split (even though I added soy lecithin) and my coffee tasted watery and bitter at the same time with all the recipes I've tried. 

I missed the creaminess and richness even though my nutmilk contained fat, and so I am wondering what exactly in plant milk does that for coffee? Do I need a kind of protein content? Do I have to add something else? I'd really like to try hazelnut milk next. 

Btw, I also tried Guar Gum once as a stabiliser, but I didn’t like the consistency at all, it tasted more slimy than creamy. If you have ever tried the Coconut Barista Milk from Alpro, you might know what I mean - the taste is great, but the consistency feels off, like it was artificially stabilised (though they used Gellan, not Guar Gum). 

Somebody told me soy lecithin may prevent the milk from foaming, but tbh, that’s not so important to me. The taste and consistency is what matters - I want my latte to taste great, not look great. ;)

I already made a post in the vegan subreddit and there are a lot of nutmilk specialists there, but I didn’t get the info I need - they seem content with their coffee, but I am picky and want it to taste right to me. The coffee subreddit didn’t allow my post since it wasn’t deemed substantial. 

I know this is a very particular question, but I am deep in the nutmilk rabbit hole now and I want to crack the code of creamy plant-based milk that works with coffee and that I can make at home.

I will find a job, eventually. Hopefully.

Main trigger is stress, lack of exercise (also too much exercise), lack of sleep. Other triggers are coffee, chocolate, citrus, vyvanse (had to stop my adhd meds), and cannabis. Main symptom is urethral/vaginal burning and lower bloating. I get urgency and cloudy urine during flares. Main lifestyle habits to help are pelvic floor and hip stretches, internal pelvic wand, leg resistance training (if I don’t take time to stretch before and after I flare, but I have weakened muscles that contribute to pt dysfunction so it also helps), diaphragmatic breathing, meditation, sipping water instead of chugging, magnesium flake or epsom salt baths 2-3x/week. Supplements: d mannose for uti prevention, high epa omega, saffron (for stress), magnesium bisglycinate, oregano oil (during flares), women’s probiotic, and PEA. I tried quercetin but didn’t work so probably not histamine related. There is some good research showing effectiveness of PEA for IC patients so thought I’d try. I take 400mg capsules by preferred nutrition, 3 capsules daily (I take 2 in the morning and 1 at night). I’ve been taking the PEA for roughly 3-4 months. I found a bit of relief after 2-3 weeks, and now I only get symptoms if I’ve had a very stressful day or fall off my routine for a week (sometimes forget when things are going well). I might try reducing my dose a little since I’ve been on a high dose for a while, but I haven’t had a major flare since the 2-3 week mark of starting it. If I feel like a flare might happen, I take 2 capsules of oregano oil, a long session of pelvic stretches, meditate, and take a magnesium flake bath. It subsides within 1-2 hours and the burning is pretty minimal overall. I do still have constant lower bloating and if my bladder gets too full then it’s hard to get a proper stream with urination (this only happens in the morning if I drank too much before bed). And the urgency and cloudy urine is a sign a flare is about to happen. But the main difference is the severity of pain, frequency of flares, and if I feel like a flare is coming it subsides very quickly. Before taking PEA it was hard to control a flare and they happened more often. I even recently had 1 week of having red wine every other night and I felt fine :) PEA’s action is anti-inflammatory. Also if I don’t eat regularly then that is a trigger (adds stress on the body too). ",1,1739092306.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False
1ilauvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ilauvc/what_if_i_build_my_own_tool_i_will_not_promote/,« What if I build my own tool… ?» - ( I will not promote ),"A few months ago, I had a brilliant idea.

“What if I built a tool that actually solved my content chaos instead of adding to it?”

Simple, right? Yeah, I thought so too.

See, I manage content across multiple sites, and every so-called “AI-powered content tool” I tried was either a glorified Google scraper in disguise or a productivity black hole that required more babysitting than an actual intern. I didn’t want an AI that thinks for me—I wanted something that would let me be the damn boss of my own content.

So I did the rational thing: I spiraled into an existential crisis, ignored all logic, and built my own.

Phase 1: The “This Will Be Easy” Delusion

I thought, “I’ll just use RSS feeds, throw in some AI magic, and boom—problem solved!”

Yeah, no. That’s how I ended up with a bloated mess of irrelevant headlines and AI-generated summaries that made my soul physically ache. Turns out, if you let AI research for you with zero oversight, you get the journalistic equivalent of a wet paper towel.

At this point, any sane person would have cut their losses. Instead, I doubled down.

Phase 2: Full-Blown Startup Chaos

You ever spend too much time on something and reach a point where quitting would hurt more than finishing? That’s where I landed.

I scrapped everything, rebuilt the logic, and said, “Fine, if no tool can do exactly what I need, I’ll Frankenstein one together myself.”

Suddenly, I was knee-deep in API hell, UX dilemmas, and wondering why everything in tech is unnecessarily complicated. No dev team, no funding, no sanity—just me, a ton of coffee, and the burning desire to make something that didn’t suck.

I learned some harsh truths along the way:
	•	“Less is more” is a lie when you’re a control freak. Every feature I added felt like “the one thing that will make it perfect.” Spoiler: It wasn’t.
	•	No one tells you how lonely solo development is. No co-founders to validate your ideas, no team to complain to, just you and the growing sense that you might be losing it.
	•	The best version of your product will always exist in your head, not in production. My UI is functional, my pricing page is wrong, and half my buttons don’t even work. But hey, it does what I needed it to do.

Phase 3: The “Wait, This Might Actually Be Something” Moment

Somewhere in the middle of this self-inflicted chaos, I realized something.

I wasn’t just building a better content tool—I was accidentally building something bigger. Something that could actually help other people stuck in the same content hell I was in. And yet, I kept thinking…

“What the hell am I supposed to do now?”

Should I try to scale it? Should I find a co-founder who gets the vision? Should I look for investors who won’t make me want to jump out a window? Or do I just keep hacking away at it in the dark, pretending this isn’t turning into a real company?

I trusted someone who seemed perfect in my eyes. I know perfection is subjective, but he ticked all my boxes. He was handsome, funny, kind, gentle, and so calm. The kind of soul I had been craving to meet. He listened without judgment, made me feel safe, and was someone I could truly be myself around.

We talked for months, shared so much, and I let my guard down, thinking I had finally found someone who cared just as much as I did. I felt a deep attachment to him in December. I was genuinely happy to see his name on my phone—whether it was a text, a photo, or just a message. It was the highlight of my day.

But now? I haven’t heard from him in over a month. He’s ignoring me, hasn’t opened my messages, hasn’t reached out at all. Yet, I see he’s online, talking to other people. It feels like I don’t even exist anymore, and I can’t stop wondering why. Was I not enough? Did I do something wrong? I feel so stupid for giving so much of myself to someone who didn’t care enough to explain.

I keep replaying everything in my head, trying to figure out what went wrong. I’m left in silence, i tried reaching out 3 times the first week and got not answer. I stopped trying.

I thought about him this morning, again. Guess who saw my morning coffee post? Him. And it hurts more than I can say. I still don’t know what I did wrong, and I may never know.

But of course, the day had other plans.

It started with barely any sleep. My wife was tossing and turning all night, uncomfortable and restless, which meant I was up too. Morning came too fast, and everything was already going wrong. No milk for coffee. No clean dishes. My phone was blowing up with reminders of assignments due. I was drowning, and it wasn’t even 8 AM yet.

I needed to get out of the house, too many distractions, too much stress. I packed my laptop, hard drive, and notes into my backpack, kissed my wife goodbye, and headed to the coffee shop. Just a few hours of quiet work, that’s all I needed.

At first, everything was going fine. I got my usual spot in the corner, ordered the cheapest coffee I could, and finally started making progress. It actually felt like I was catching up.

Then I made one mistake. I left my bag at the table to use the bathroom. I wasn’t gone long. But when I came back, my bag, my entire bag, was gone.

Laptop. Hard drive. Notes. Everything.

I felt my stomach drop. I looked under the table, behind my chair, like maybe I had somehow misplaced a whole backpack. But no. It was stolen. Someone had walked in, grabbed it, and disappeared.

I ran to the counter, asking the baristas if they had seen anything, if they had cameras. Nothing. A guy in the corner thought he saw someone take a bag but assumed it was theirs.

Panic set in. I had deadlines coming up. That laptop had everything for school. My hard drive had backups, but that was stolen too. I tried using my phone to at least email my professors, but writing a whole research paper on a phone? Impossible.

I rushed home, hoping I could figure something out. Maybe I could use the smart TV. It had a browser, right? It would be slow, but I was desperate.
It was a disaster. The TV lagged, the keyboard was horrible to type on, and I could barely navigate my school’s website. I was wasting time, and the frustration was making everything worse.
My wife saw me struggling and asked what was wrong. When I told her, she just stared at me, her face pale.“We can’t fricken get a new one.”I knew that. Of course, I knew that. But hearing her say it out loud made it hit even harder. ni sat there, staring at the frozen webpage on the TV, completely stuck. No laptop. No backups. No way to get my work done. No money to replace what was stolen.

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just the stuff of science fiction. It's quite literally in the classroom, helping students ace those pesky exams. What's going on, you ask? Well, let's dive into the world of Mercyhurst University, where students are getting cozy with AI, courtesy of one innovative department chair, Christopher Mansour.

Dr. Mansour has rolled out an AI ""study buddy""—and no, it doesn’t bring you coffee, but it does offer the next best thing: instant access to course-related questions and practice tests. This virtual companion is designed to be the Yoda to your Luke Skywalker, minus the cryptic speech. It creates an interactive learning environment, allowing students not just to memorize but to truly understand their materials.

Why does this matter? For one, it highlights the growing intersection between technology and education, proving that Siri and Alexa aren’t the only AI around with all the answers. Additionally, it's a glimpse into the future where personalized education—tailored to learning speeds and styles—could become the norm.

Mercyhurst University is paving the way, showing how AI can be a powerful tool for academic support. With these advancements, education might soon be like having a 24/7 personal tutor (who doesn't get cranky if contacted at 3 AM before finals). 

So, what's next for AI in education? Could it eventually replace traditional teaching methods, or will it enhance the teaching experience by giving students more control over their learning paths?

I suggested we meet on a different after this weekend or next weekend and he seemed to be understanding and said yeah we can do that. 

He shared his number and suggested that we text. I sent him a text message thinking that we’d be able to talk more throughout the day compared to the app (I don’t keep my hinge notifications on as it can be distracting at work). 

Since we’ve exchanged numbers, he only sends one text a day. I’m not expecting him to text me every minutes but a little bit more than one would be nice. I asked him what kind are some of his hobbies and I have to wait 24 hours to hear the answer. That’s kind of ridiculous. I don’t always answer my messages right away but if I’m interested in someone I don’t wait 24 hours to reply back. Usually when I look at my phone or something I’ll reply back. I hate playing those texting and mind games. 

I was thinking he could be busy, but if he was able to make plans for this weekend then he’s not that busy. Since Wednesday it’s only been one text a day. 

Why is he only sending one text a day? Is this a red flag? What could be his intentions? Am I missing reading a sign or something? Am I just overthinking? ",2,1739090992.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1ilak1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/smosh/comments/1ilak1b/i_met_courtney_a_few_days_ago_at_work/,I met Courtney a few days ago at work!,"I should preface this by saying I've been a casual fan of Smosh for the past year, usually watching a few of their videos each month. I was initially hesitant to share this story because the interaction was quite cringeworthy for me, but I decided to share it anyway.

I work at a small coffee shop near Hollywood. A few days ago, a girl came in – super chill, hoodie pulled up, sunglasses indoors – the typical LA vibe. She placed her order with another coworker, and I was tasked with making her latte. While preparing her drink, something about her looked incredibly familiar. Then it hit me: it was Courtney from Smosh!

My hands started shaking, and I accidentally spilled some of her order LOL. After composing myself, I called out her order number, and she approached the counter. As she collected her coffee, I blurted out, 'I'm a huge fan of you and Shayne!'

She gave me a confused look and replied, 'Umm, who's Shayne?'

I thought she might be joking, but the silence that followed was deafening. I replied, 'Your husband?'

Courtney just laughed and walked away. A wave of embarrassment washed over me. To be honest, I felt disrespected. I wasn't being rude, and I also felt she was being dismissive of Shayne, which I found disrespectful to him as well.

Later that night, as I was trying to fall asleep in bed, the truth dawned on me: the woman wasn't Courtney at all. It was Tate McRae.

In hindsight, it's clear they're not even remotely similar, but my mind played a serious trick on me. I apologize if this story isn't very interesting.

1ilajgu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilajgu,Small Review of my First Batch,"To Preface: I had seriously been looking for budget friendly versions of some higher end scents. It seemed like all roads pointed towards Montagne so I went for it! Pulled the trigger on Fig Tree (not pictured) and Eau Matcha. I placed my first order around Christmas but when it came in I was so blown away by how quality they smelled and how accurate Eau Matcha was to the Original. Wound up Trading off Fig Tree for Eau Vanille as it was just a bit too green for me. I suppose I’m not as crazy about philosykos as some other Diptyques anyway but man, super seamless trade, fell in Love with Eau Vanille and placed a couple more orders. I’ve got Eau Gaiac and Eau Noir on the way but as of now, here’s what I’ve got!

Torino 21: Honestly, I just couldn’t find an alternative or clone for ‘You or Stronger Like You’ by Etat Libre D’orange so I literally bought this based off of the comparisons they get. That said, it’s scratching that minty green fresh itch that I had for YOSLY. Thoroughly impressed + the lemon adds another nice facet to the DNA that I’m diggin. 👌🏼 8/10 

Eau Vanille: Probably my most unique Vanilla. It has this oddly medicinal dry vanilla accord and it’s almost even a little… baby powderish? Yet not particularly powdery? To my nose it’s drying down down just the slightest bit like MB Club Black with the incense but really I’m kinda enjoying it the way I enjoy Eau Duelle. Clean Dry Vanilla, a little paperish, just a ˡⁱᵗᵗˡᵉ sweet and incensy. 8.2/10

Eau Matcha: I mean it smells like Matcha 26 🍵🤷‍♂️ I honestly like this one more than Le Labo’s because while I do enjoy the original, I think this is actually smoother and not as strong. 10/10 for quality but 7/10 overall because It’s not quite my favorite.

Meteorite: Citrusy Spicy Soap! I just kinda wanted to see how similar it REALLY was and it’s freakin’ spot on lol idk that I can really recommend anyone get the OG with this stuff around, maybe just a tad less spicy than Meteore. Luxurious Clean Soap. (Kinda nostalgic too? it’s a soapy smell that’s familiar but not all that common for modern day.) 8.2

Another 14: Alright, for what it’s worth, this stuff is a very solid take on another 13 and it’s pretty much hitting all the spots that I enjoy about the original, especially on drydown. Maceration has definitely smoothed it out but here’s the thing; Does anyone else get some type of coffee accord in this? It’s almost not even there at times but sometimes it’s SUPER prominent to the point that I find myself trying to look up reviews for Another 13 revolving around coffee 😅 I’ve got the biggest dent in this one, and aside from the coffee thing, I don’t know that I could find another alternative to A13 as good as this. 9/10

Cacti Garden: 🍋🌱🧉!! Super Lemongrass forward! Not all that complex but it’s a good 🤷‍♂️ fresh lemony yerba mate scent. While it’s not that complicated, I could see myself effin’ up my Cacti Garden in the warmer months and I’m curious to see how this stuff macerates. 7.8/10",12,1739090882.0,MontagneParfums,1,1.0,False

I’m in my late 20s and have both a BA and an MSc. Over the past few years, I’ve struggled with significant physical and mental health challenges, which have made work difficult. I have ADHD and strongly suspect I’m autistic.

I did spend a year at HEO level, which I really enjoyed, but after returning from sick leave, I was moved back to EO with my old team disbanded and in redeployment.

Since last summer, I’ve been in redeployment, and now, due to team restructuring, I’ve been moved again. The constant changes are overwhelming, and I’m really struggling. It’s affecting my mental health to the point where I feel suicidal. I don’t want to take sick leave again, as I already had a long-term absence last year due to serious health issues.

I’ve been applying for lots of HEO and SEO roles but haven’t been getting anywhere, which has been really discouraging.

I’ve thought about taking a career break to focus on job applications and rebuild my confidence, honestly would love to work in a coffee shop or something, but I’m torn because I feel like I need to gain that confidence in a workplace setting. At the same time, I dread everything about my current role. Going into the office is unbearable, which makes me even more convinced that I might be autistic due to heavy masking. I am trying so hard.

I’ve also considered going part-time, but I’m not sure if that would actually help or just leave me stuck in the same fight-or-flight state, just with fewer hours.

I am in therapy and doing everything I can to stay well, but this role just isn’t working for me, and I have no idea how long redeployment will take.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Followed by the crossword which was fun. 

I think I can see myself as a retired older lady. I will still pamper myself and have my self care, I do not and will not be one of those older women who stop putting in effort. Tbh good for them but also I don’t do it because I *have* to, I do it because I enjoy it. Beauty maintenance and self care is a genuine hobby to me, idc what anyone says. So I don’t think I will get to the age where I become invisible and therefore stop trying, I think if anything I might just become a little bit more adventurous? Hm. But no, I will never cut my hair really short for “ease” and I will also not allow it to become stringy and straggly. I’ll get some injectables to soften any harsh lines and I will get tiny bits of filler if I need it to plump myself back up without being pillow face-y, though I think biostim boosters are better and you look infinitely more natural. I will wear perfume. I will have my hobbies and I think I could really enjoy gardening if I had ample time for it. I think it would become really addictive. I would want a couple good friends who I can spend time with and go for walks and have for dinners and al fresco summer lunches and a book group. I’ll have my dogs who I will forever baby. I’ll have my honey who I will *cherish* and never take for granted and we will do fun things together all the time without a care in the world. Little things like go for an afternoon stroll and get an ice cream or make a new dish or try a new cuisine at a restaurant or have a little house project like maybe we do up his office or something. And then bigger things like travelling to new places as and when we can, and experiences to share together like ride a camel in a desert or I really don’t want to do these but get our scuba licence or go in a hot air balloon but idk, just live life together and try new things and just *live together*. Share everything with him. Lots of little kisses and sweet notes and holding hands and he can come home when we’re 50 with some flowers and I’ll have his favourite dinner cooking and we can be 60 and set up the sofa with pillows and duvets for a proper movie night snuggled up together. I just want him as my partner in everything. My other half. My honey. 

I mowed the lawn! It looks excellent! It was so fun. I said this to dad and he said the novelty very much has not worn off for me, but I think this is the kind of chore I like. I like satisfying stuff, like cleaning windows and vacuuming and basically where you can swipe through and see the change. I definitely didn’t do it efficiently I kept leaving patches but whatever I got there in the end. So fun. I wish I had a lawn at home. I wish I could have a big huge lawn and mow it. I can’t wait til they redo the garden here and there’s more grass, all around the crab apple tree will be green grass and the way it hangs down so laden with fruit and leaves and imagine sitting under it??? Heaven. 

It’s so hot. 

I just took pups to the park earlier and we were there for lil while, about 45 mins or so. It felt like no time at all. He just came padding into my room as I started writing this to say hello and I just yoinked him up on to the bed so now he’s laying right next to me as if it’s not 27°. We did several laps around the park and just played in the grass and he had a sniff around and ate some leaves and nearly pulled my arm out of its socket. I walked around barefoot again and I just love it - walking barefoot under big trees and their dappled light in soft green grass while the sun is shining and birds and chirping and cicadas are causing a whole scene and pups is bounding around and it was just so lovely. It’s so… I don’t know. I enjoy it a lot. It brings a lot of inner peace. Towards the end I listened to some music and the first that came on shuffle was girl from the north country and idk but it just fit the vibes perfectly.

I walked into my parents room before as they were both having a lie down as it was so hot and they’d been gardening and stuff and anyway I walk in to them both having a nap and holding hands while laying on their backs on the bed and it was really sweet. I hope Andy holds my hand for afternoon naps when we’re in our 60s. 

Jesus f’ing Christ I love fruit. I just had the juiciest nectarine and I am *craving* watermelon like it’s nobody’s business. And then I think about all the fruit in the world? Apples? Pineapple? Mango? Peaches? Grapes? Kiwi? Guava? Plums? Cherries? Citrus? Pears? *Berries*? Is fruit not just evidence of how amazing earth and Mother Nature is? Do I sound like some hopped up hippy? Perhaps. I love nature. Fruiiiitttttttttt. 

Sometimes idk how I end up anywhere, but I do. Anyway I found myself looking at mid-20th century paintings and eventually came across one called Christina’s World by someone called Andrew Wyeth annnnnnnnnd I feel like it just depicted exactly how I feel. It’s incredibly famous but I’ve never seen it before, though I’m entirely unsurprised at that fact. It’s kept at MoMA so maybbbeeeee I have seen it but it just didn’t resonate then? I cannot wait to go back there some day. I think about it quite a lot.  

I’m not due for my period but I feel kind of crampy? Well I’m about a week away from being due. But I tend to have longer gaps between as opposed to shorter gaps, though since being medicated I’ve definitely noticed it becoming more somewhat regular. It still goes across the whole month but slowly moves along it, yknow? Like this was me in 2024: 

- 23 January - 27 January
- 23 February - 27 February 
- 29 March - 02 April 
- 02 May - 05 May

- 20 July - 23 July 
- 29 August - 1 September 
- 30 September - 2 October 
- 12 November - 14 November 
- 14 December - 16 December 

Anyway. 

I’m going home tomorrow. Long weekend is finito. Earrrrrrly train(s). Back to work. 

I want a white linen lil nighty, maybe with cute teeny embroidered flowers! The kind of nighty where you live in a cottage surrounded by wildflowers and have an apple pie cooling on the windowsill and a cat that sleeps on an armchair by a fireplace. But then I also want one that looks like a Victorian ghost. Maybe I get two. Or maybe I get neither. Decisions. Probs neither. Best be sensible with the $$$. 

Dinner was nice, I made a salad thing but a substantial one with roasted veggies and seeds and pomegranate and mesclun etc etc and feta crumbled on it for them but not for me. I can eat feta to be polite but I just don’t really like it much so why eat it? I guess variety for gut health but I don’t think a few meagre crumbs were going to do much. And we just sat around chatting for an hour at the table which was nice. Very reminiscent of the dinners we had growing up. I feel like my strongest memories were a big bowl of spaghetti bolognese or spag bog as dad calls it - not spag bold spag *bog*. Anyway I would set the table while dad was cooking and I’d put out the white plates they still have now and the silverware they still have now and the salt and the big massive wooden pepper grinder and then the powdered parmesan for me, the block of tasty for dad and a grater and the block of parmesan for mum because we each had our cheese preferences and then we’d all sit down and have dinner and I’d fiddle with the blinds at the window and look out of them and sneak spaghetti down to our pup at the time. I remember before that I didn’t like the tomato sauce so I would have my own bowl of plain spaghetti with salt and pepper and parmesan on it and I would get v upset if the sauce touched it… yikessss. Still, I was a kid and kids are kinda like that. At least I was never a chicken nugget child and I never caused a fuss if we were out and about or other people were over. Like when we would have fish, I would *always* have the tail - even as a teenager - because it was the smaller bit and idk I just liked it - so mum and dad always left it for me but my uncle took it one time and I remember internally thinking what do I do now?!?!?! …I was definitely raised an only child despite having a brother. But also I mean I don’t remember him at these dinners much. I do for some, because I would be sat next to him and if my elbows extended even slightly he’d elbow me right back like a big brother does and say this is my side stay out of it and so I would elbow back and… siblings. I kind of wish I was closer in age to him so that I had grown up with an actual sibling dynamic but I guess it is what it is. I think I would be less of a neurotic loner if I had grown up with another kid around. I’m *extremely* used to my own company and am never bored when alone and am most comfortable when alone. I know that’s linked to how I grew up, I mean I KNOW it is as we’ve discussed it in therapy. I never felt lonely growing up, I had a lot of friends and spent after schools and weekends with them and all that. So I didn’t grow up not being exposed to other people or anything of that nature, but I’m also just naturally a *very* introverted person. My therapist said I am more introverted than most introverts? Idk how she can tell that but she said so. I’m just incredibly content with myself, and I find it incredibly ironic given how much I wish I could escape my own mind sometimes. But that’s when I’m having a lower period and I feel like I’m teetering on the edge of doing just about anything to claw myself out of my head. Like I sit there daydreaming about a mini me inside my brain growing big talons and ripping my brain and scalp to shreds to get out into the fresh air. I don’t really know if you can understand the feeling unless you’ve felt it, but being trapped with yourself and your mind is just a different level of hell. Anyway this is rambling - dinner was nice :) 

I keep finding more books I want to read this year in my bid to diversify my consumption. Like ???? STOP LOOKING. But I cannot, so here we are. Added to my list are: 

* what I loved 
* the stoner (this was already on my list though) 
* blue light hours
* tender is the flesh 
* a big assortment of Japanese lit which I’m now realising is a theme? Like days at the morisaki bookshop, earthlings, if cats disappeared from the world, before the coffee gets cold and then some of his other books etc 

Anyway I still intend to read my beloved romantasy and romance but I just wanna get out of this rut and read the kind of stuff I used to again. 

I hope he’s sleeping well. He said he slept better yesterday so maybe my plead to the universe worked? Dear Universe, please let him keep sleeping well. He truly deserves it. Please make him happy and rested and feeling well. Thank you x

He got the parcel I think, I’m 99% sure he did but he called at 2am something and we spoke for 43 minutes and I barely remember anything? I didn’t even remember he called til this evening when I remembered the parcel and him chewing away on liquorice. Wait I remember thinking it was first shapes then grapes and him asking why I would choose rhyming words. That’s about it. I think I was definitely yanked out of deeeeeep sleep if I remember so little. Anyway he got the book, thankfully it was the right one. He didn’t seem that excited about it I don’t think, so I guess it was maybe a waste of time and effort, idk? No not a waste but idk. I just thought he’d find it cuter than he seemed to. Bad judgement on my part. Anyway he was definitely happy about the liquorice so that was good. I’m not sending or doing anything for valentines day.

I have to make up earrrrrrly tomorrow for the train :( No more puppy :(

Over the years, I became so obsessed with it that I was consuming 5 to 6 cups of espresso daily. However, due to growing concerns about GERD (gastric heartburn), I decided to cut coffee out of my life entirely. After that, I went without coffee for 7 years.

Everything was going well.

Until one day, everything changed. I had switched to tea during that time and had been frequenting a place that served excellent Oolong and Jasmine tea. But one morning at 6:30 a.m., I found out through a notice that the shop was closed for renovations and wouldn’t reopen for another 5 months. Desperate for a cup of tea, I wandered around searching for an alternative and eventually ended up at a different café. Unfortunately, this place only served a variety of coffees and no tea. With no other options, I ordered a 3/4 hot long black. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say it was an unforgettable experience. The coffee gave me complete satisfaction, it felt like running into an EX-girlfriend after 8 years. Since that day, I’ve been a regular at this coffee shop. They also happen to serve the best Mazagran in town.

-Worsening muscle twitching in my arms, fingers, torso, and neck. I've stopped painting and carrying liquids without a lid due to constant spilling

-Extreme exhaustion: No energy to do enjoyable activities, attend classes, or work for more than a few hours a day. Feel like sleeping almost all the time, nap for hours even on Adderall and a cup of coffee. 

-Worsening memory: Forgetting words, class content, tasks I just performed, grammar rules, conversations I've had recently

- Extra trouble concentrating

-Worsening sleep quality: My sleep study saw frequent arousals/parasomnia. I've also had worsening and increasingly vivid hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis

-Was hospitalized about 1 year ago with an intractable migraine. Spinal fluid was normal, brain scans were normal.

Now I'm wondering how to make things right and if I'm crazy for thinking about asking her out.

So, I've royally fucked up and need some advice. Here's what went down:

I'm in charge of setting up decorations for our college festival next week, which means I've been pulling some late nights. Yesterday, I was at college until 7 PM, working my ass off. As I was heading to the parking lot (which is creepy AF, surrounded by trees and there's even a crematorium nearby),

Out of nowhere, this shadowy figure starts approaching me fast. Now, I've got a black belt in karate and I'm learning MMA, so my fight-or-flight kicked in hard. Without thinking, I threw a defensive punch. To my horror, it wasn't some creep – it was a student in costume.

Turns out, the media team was filming some promo content for the festival and thought a spooky theme would be cool. The girl I hit (let's call her Priya) started crying, and suddenly I was surrounded by people with cameras. Fan-fucking-tastic.

Now it's Sunday, and I'm sitting in the hospital with Priya. She's got a hairline fracture in her hand from my punch. The worst part? I've had a crush on her for months, and now I've literally broken her hand. I've apologized a million times, but I still feel like the biggest asshole on campus.

Here's the twist: Priya's being incredibly cool about the whole thing. She keeps saying it was just an accident, but I can't stop feeling guilty. We've been talking for hours, and honestly? She's even cooler than I thought.

So now I'm in this weird situation. On one hand (no pun intended), I broke her fucking hand. On the other, we're vibing really well. Am I insane for thinking about asking her out? Like, ""Sorry I broke your hand, want to grab coffee?""

I know, I know, I shouldn't have assumed she was a threat. But who the fuck surprises people in a creepy parking lot at night?

What do I do? How do I make this right? And am I completely nuts for thinking this disaster could turn into something good?

P.S. I'm not great with women, so any advice on that front would be appreciated too.",28,1739089881.0,AmItheKameena,19,0.91,False

1ilab8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ilab8e/diptyques_les_essences_discovery_set_final_review/,DIptyque's Les Essences Discovery Set - Final Review,"Here were my initial impressions vs. current standings of Diptyque's Les Essences Discovery Set:

Context: I purchased this set for $200 at a diptyque botique. I used three of the five bottles and have very little of the final two bottles remaining.

Initial Sniffs: (1 = favorite. 5 = least favorite)

1. Lunamaris - Initially enthralling with a compelling urge to reapply due to its fleeting nature.
2. Rose Roche - Despite this fragrance leaning feminine, my nose initially perceived it as a masculine, refreshing scent with a notable lemon note that quickly fades, leaving a pleasant base I'm not sure how to define note wise.
3. Corail Oscuro - An intriguing blend of mineral and blood orange.
4. Bois Corse - Disliked at first for its medicinal note, though the coffee and chocolate undertones were redeeming.
5. Lilyphea - Barely perceptible. Initially disappointing.

Current Standings:

1. Lilyphea - Now favored for its clean, subtle allure. Not to say my $200 research (cost of discovery set) justifies a $330 full bottle purchase lol... but fragrance addiction is a thing and... yolo (haha).
2. Bois Corse - The medicinal note now smells like funky tree sap but grew on me similar to how the scent of oud might grow on one who is first turned off by it. It sparkles ones curiosity for sure.
3. Lunamaris - Less appealing after experiencing a similar profile in Portrait of a Woman by Frederic Malle, which offers a superior rose note that just won't escape the 'purchase this fragrance' part of my brain.
4. Rose Roche - Once novel, now perceived as somewhat two-dimensional.
5. Corail Oscuro - My interest waned after the los angeles wildfires (i was evacuated). Come Summer time, perhaps my interest can be rekindled.

Conclusion:  
Lilyphea stands out and I'd love to smell it on a woman I'm dating. And until I find one to date, I'll enjoy smelling it on my own body. My '1st date' fragrance is Orpheon. My '2nd date' fragrance is Haltane by Parfums de Marly. My '3rd date' fragrance will either be Tam Dao or Lilyphea if I purchase it.",2,1739089852.0,fragrance,0,0.75,False

I mad a little thing so you don’t have to!,"To prepare a well-organized storage system for a year’s worth of supplies in different power scenarios, efficiency is key. Below is a detailed breakdown of food, medical supplies, seeds, and other essentials, with instructions for three scenarios:
	1.	No Power
	2.	Solar Generator Setup
	3.	High-Powered Generator Setup

Each section covers food storage, medical supply storage, seed storage, preservation tools, and an efficient layout for organization.

1. Essential Storage Needs (Applicable to All Scenarios)

Storage Room Setup
	•	Location: Choose a cool, dry, and dark space (basement, underground root cellar, insulated shed, or interior pantry).
	•	Insulation: Use Mylar blankets, foam board insulation, or earth-bermed walls to regulate temperature.
	•	Shelving: Install heavy-duty metal or wooden shelves that can handle bulk storage.
	•	Humidity Control: Use silica gel packs, moisture absorbers, and dehumidifiers where needed.
	•	Rodent/Pest Control: Store all dry goods in sealed containers and use natural deterrents like peppermint oil and diatomaceous earth.

2. Food Storage for One Year (Per Person)

For a family of four, multiply amounts accordingly.

Food Type	Amount per person	Storage Method
Grains (Rice, Flour, Oats, Pasta)	400 lbs	Mylar bags + O2 absorbers
Beans & Lentils	60 lbs	Mylar bags + O2 absorbers
Canned Proteins (Tuna, Chicken, Salmon, Spam, etc.)	100 cans	Store in cool, dark place
Dehydrated & Freeze-Dried Vegetables/Fruits	60 lbs	Vacuum-sealed jars/bags
Honey & Sugar	60 lbs	Glass jars or plastic buckets
Salt & Spices	10 lbs	Airtight containers
Powdered Milk & Dairy Substitutes	20 lbs	Vacuum-sealed Mylar
Cooking Oils & Fats (Lard, Butter Powder, Olive Oil)	20 gallons	Store in dark, cool place
Nuts & Seeds	40 lbs	Vacuum-sealed, frozen if possible
Canned or Dried Soups & Stews	100 cans or pouches	Rotate every 2 years
Fermentation Supplies (Vinegar, Pickling Salt, etc.)	5 gallons	Glass jars
Canning Supplies (Jars, Lids, Rings, Wax, Citric Acid, Pectin, etc.)	Stockpile at least 500 jars + lids for a year	Organized in a sturdy storage shelf

Efficient Storage System
	•	Store grains, beans, and dry goods in 5-gallon buckets with gamma lids.
	•	Use FIFO (First-In, First-Out) rotation to prevent waste.
	•	Label expiration dates on all items.

3. Medical & First Aid Supply Storage

A medical emergency in a long-term survival situation requires proper storage, organization, and rotation.

Essential Medical Supplies

Category	Items
First Aid Basics	Bandages, gauze, medical tape, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, trauma shears
Pain Relief & Fever Management	Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin
Antibiotics	Fish Mox (Amoxicillin), Fish Flex (Cephalexin), or veterinary antibiotics (if safe and needed)
Allergy & Respiratory	Antihistamines (Benadryl), epinephrine auto-injector (if needed), saline spray
Gastrointestinal & Hydration	Anti-diarrheal (Loperamide), electrolyte packets, anti-nausea meds
Wound Care & Infection Prevention	Hydrogen peroxide, iodine, triple antibiotic ointment, silver sulfadiazine cream
Chronic Illness Medication	Store extra prescriptions if possible, insulin (refrigeration needed)
Sutures & Surgical Supplies	Sterile needles, sutures, hemostatic gauze, medical stapler
Dental Care	Temporary filling kit, dental tools, clove oil
Hygiene & Sanitation	Soap, alcohol, iodine, gloves, masks

Storage Recommendations
	•	Store medications in airtight plastic or glass containers.
	•	Keep antibiotics and pain relievers in a temperature-controlled area (ideal: 50-70°F).
	•	Organize by category in stackable bins with labels.
	•	Rotate medications annually.
	•	If freezing is needed for specific medications (insulin, some vaccines), use a dedicated 12V freezer powered by solar or a generator.

4. Seed Storage & Gardening Supplies

To ensure future crops, seeds must be properly stored.

How to Store Seeds for Longevity

Seed Type	Storage Life	Storage Method
Heirloom Vegetable Seeds	5-10 years	Mylar bags + silica gel
Grains (Wheat, Corn, Rice, Quinoa)	3-5 years	Vacuum-sealed jars
Herbs (Medicinal & Culinary)	2-3 years	Paper envelopes in sealed container
Sprouting Seeds (Alfalfa, Lentils, Broccoli)	2-5 years	Store in fridge/freezer

	•	Ideal storage temp: 32-50°F.
	•	Best practice: Keep in vacuum-sealed Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers in a cool, dark place.
	•	Keep a seed bank journal with planting times and rotation schedules.

5. Power & Refrigeration Considerations

Scenario 1: No Power (Completely Off-Grid)
	•	Cold Storage: Underground root cellar, well-insulated, stays ~55°F.
	•	Preservation: Rely on canning, fermenting, drying, and curing meats.
	•	Cooking & Heating: Use rocket stoves, solar ovens, wood-burning stoves.

Scenario 2: Solar Generator Setup
	•	Small Solar Generator (Jackery, EcoFlow, Bluetti)
	•	Runs: LED lights, small medical fridge, dehydrator, USB devices
	•	Not enough for: Full freezer, power tools
	•	Battery Bank: Use 12V deep-cycle batteries to store power.
	•	Cooking: Electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot) for energy efficiency.

Scenario 3: High-Powered Generator Setup
	•	Dual-fuel generator (Gasoline + Propane)
	•	Runs freezer, fridge, electric stove (but noisy, requires fuel storage)
	•	Backup Solar: Reduces reliance on fuel.
	•	Battery-Freezer Combo: A DC-powered freezer + lithium battery setup allows long-term frozen food storage.

6. Additional Tools & Miscellaneous Storage
	•	Hand Tools & Manual Grinders (For grain, coffee, etc.)
	•	Oil Lamps & Candles (For light in no-power scenarios)
	•	Canning & Dehydrating Equipment
	•	Rainwater Catchment & Water Purification (Berkey Filters, UV Sterilizers)
	•	Bartering Supplies (Salt, alcohol, ammo, coffee, tobacco)
	•	Hygiene Storage (Reusable cloths, soap, toothpaste, TP)
	•	Emergency Communication (Ham radio, solar-powered radio)

Final Organization Strategy
	1.	Use a spreadsheet to track expiration dates & storage locations.
	2.	Group items by function (food, medical, tools, preservation).
	3.	Have easy access to high-use items and deep storage for long-term supplies.
	4.	Regularly inspect and rotate perishable supplies.",2,1739088945.0,economicCollapse,0,1.0,False
